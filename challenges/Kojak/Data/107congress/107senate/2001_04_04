Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments on \nthe pending budget resolution.\n\n\n                      Amendments Nos. 174 and 176\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If the Senator will yield, under \nthe previous order, the Senate will now resume concurrent debate on the \nGrassley amendment No. 174 and the Johnson amendment No. 176 with the \ntime to be equally divided.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Time will be off the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is my view that a $1.6 trillion tax \ncut is an appropriate figure considering the projected surplus of $5.6 \ntrillion. But I am concerned that projections over a 10-year period are \nrisky. If there is a change of 1 percent in the inflation rate or a \nchange of 1 percent in the unemployment rate, the figures are very \ndifferent.\n\n[[Page S3362]]\n\n  I recall the projections in 1981, when we considered the Kemp-Roth \ntax bill, that surpluses were expected and deficits turned out to be \nthe fact. It is my view that there ought to be the condition that these \nsurpluses do materialize for the $1.6 trillion tax cut to take effect. \nI personally do not like the concept of a trigger, which means some \nrecall action or some responsive action. It is my view that \nconceptually the proper approach is that we are to have the tax cut if \nthe surplus holds up, and it is the event of the tax cut about which we \nare talking.\n  I have discussed the matter with the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee and with other Senators. Senator Domenici has assured \nme he is working on language that will satisfy the concerns many of us \nhave expressed. My soundings in Pennsylvania, and really around the \ncountry, are that there is enormous concern that we not add to the \nnational debt. When I have polled my constituents--repeatedly in the \ncourse of the past many years, up to a decade--I have found that more \npeople are concerned that the national debt be paid down--in fact, paid \noff--than are concerned about a tax cut.\n  But as President Bush has projected a $5.6 trillion surplus, to \nrepeat, there is adequate room for a $1.6 trillion tax cut, and there \nis adequate room to be sure that Social Security is sound, that \nMedicare is reformed, and that we are able to have the appropriations \non the domestic discretionary accounts which are appropriate for the \nimportant needs of health, education, and other discretionary domestic \nprograms, and defense as well.\n  I have also expressed my concern in conversations with the leadership \nof the Senate, and with the administration in discussions with Vice \nPresident Cheney and Secretary of the Treasury O'Neill, that at least \nas I view it, the tax cut ought to be a little more heavily weighted \nfor middle and lower income Americans.\n  I realize that in the budget resolution we are not going to delineate \nall of the parameters of these considerations. What we are looking at \ntechnically in the budget resolution is the $1.6 trillion without a \nspecification as to conditionality, without a specification as to how \nthe tax cut will be apportioned.\n  But I think it is important for Senators, such as myself, to express \nthemselves so there will be notice to those on the Finance Committee \nand the Republican leadership and the White House as to where, at \nleast, this Senator stands when the bills are presented. With the 50-50 \nSenate, it is important to be looking to take into account the \ncondition of all Senators.\n\n  It is my hope and expectation to be able to support our new \nPresident. I think he is off to an outstanding start. I had the \nopportunity to travel with him to Beaver County, PA, several weeks ago \nwhen he was talking about his tax plan. I believe we are on the right \ntrack.\n  But this is a body which is not a rubber stamp. Under the separation \nof powers--the Framers of the Constitution drafted the most impressive \ndocument in the history of the world, second to the Bible, and they \nmade the Congress article I, they made the President article II, and \nthey made the judiciary article III. If someone were to rewrite the \nConstitution, it would appear that the Supreme Court has rewritten the \nConstitution really to make the judiciary article I. But we are not \nsupposed to be a rubber stamp. But counsel and collaboration is \nappropriate. That is why I take this occasion to express my views.\n  With respect to the domestic spending, the 4-percent allocation, \ncandidly, is tight. But I expect this body to work its will on a number \nof appropriations and on a number of matters which we will offer for \namendments on education and health--and agriculture being discussed \nthis morning.\n  Last year, when the appropriations bill came to the floor for the \nsubcommittee which I chair on Labor, Health, Human Services, and \nEducation, we had established a mark of $106 billion. That was then-\nPresident Clinton's figure. After a lot of discussion with him, the \nRepublican caucus, both in the Senate and the House--the Republican \nleadership--agreed to a figure of $106 billion--somewhat reluctantly, I \nmight say. But my experience had been, in preceding years--without \ngoing into details--that if we tried to undercut the President's \nbudget, we ended up paying a lot more.\n  We then reallocated some of the priorities on the bill presented on \nthe Senate floor. Then, during the course of the amendment process, \nvery substantial funds were added to education and health care. Being a \nprincipal author of the budget presented along with my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Harkin, I defended the budget. As I said on the \nSenate floor, I cast more bad votes in 3 days voting against education \nand health care measures than I had cast in my preceding 19 years in \nthe Senate. But that was my job, to defend the budget, and I did.\n  Some 13 Republicans joined the Democrats in the add-ons, which I \nwould not be surprised takes place at least to some extent on this \nbudget resolution today. When the $106 billion budget for Labor, Health \nand Human Services, and Education was not submitted to the White House, \nbecause the Republican leadership never saw fit to do that, the figure \nthen ballooned to $114 billion. At which point, I refused to sign the \nconference report. Then the figure was ultimately lowered to $107.9 \nbillion.\n  As we consider this budget resolution, the lesson from that is, if we \ndon't adopt a realistic figure at the outset, we are going to end up \nspending more.\n  Last year when we took up the budget, there were some on the Budget \nCommittee who wanted $596 billion for discretionary accounts. Finally, \nthe figure arrived at was $600 billion. The result then was a lot of \nmirrors and smoke on deferred expenditures. The figure which was needed \nwas $616 billion. Had that figure been present, we could have gotten \nagreement in this body and in the House and then gotten the bill \nsigned. Ultimately, the figure was $640 billion. We spent at least $24 \nbillion more than we should have because of the last minute rush and \nadd-ons became the order of the day.\n  It is different this year. We have a Republican President. Last year \nwe had a President who was a Democrat. There was pressure from the \nWhite House for add-ons. This year it is my expectation that, while \nthere may be some flexibility from the White House, the pressure will \nbe reversed.\n  The President still has the veto pen. It is my hope that, as we move \nforward with the budget resolution, we will adopt realistic figures \nwith which those of us on the Appropriations Committee can live and \nstructure bills that can be enacted.\n  I compliment Senator Domenici for the extraordinary work he has done \non this budget and budgets in prior years. He has served as chairman or \nranking on the Budget Committee since 1981. It is an extraordinarily \ndifficult job. He also sits on the Appropriations Committee where he is \ncaught between a rock and a hard place as he tries to maneuver through \nthe requirements and the wishes, sometimes the demands, of the Budget \nCommittee to try to structure a bill which will pass in Appropriations. \nHe has done just an extraordinary job, as has the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, who has the unenviable job \nof trying to make ends meet with 13 subcommittees.\n  I also compliment my colleague, Senator Conrad, for the work he has \ndone, for his having come to see me on a couple of occasions to go \nthrough the budget, as he sees it, in an effort to try to find common \nground for a budget which can be approached on a bipartisan basis.\n  It is regrettable that we have not been able to work through a budget \nresolution which could be accomplished on a bipartisan basis. It is my \nthought that if we work at it harder, that is something we can still \ndo. Senator Harkin and I have had a very close relationship; he earlier \nas chairman and I as ranking on our subcommittee and I now as chairman \nand Senator Harkin as ranking. I learned a long time ago if you want to \nget something done in Washington and in this body, there has to be \nbipartisan cooperation.\n  I also compliment the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Byrd, who has performed in that capacity with great \ndistinction, as he has as President pro tempore and majority leader and \nalso, in prior years, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n\n[[Page S3363]]\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes off the \nresolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his kind words. \nI have always enjoyed working with him. He is right. I hope it is not \ntoo late to have a bipartisan approach to this budget. We are rapidly \nrunning out of time. Very soon we will be casting the final votes that \nwill set this budget in place. Nobody should doubt what that will mean \nfor the rest of this year and perhaps for the rest of the decade.\n  This morning in the Washington Post I noticed an opinion piece by \nformer Republican Senator Warren Rudman, former Democratic Senator Sam \nNunn, who are cochairmen of the Concord Coalition, and three former \nhigh officials in the Federal Government: Robert Rubin, former \nSecretary of the Treasury; Paul Volcker, former Federal Reserve \nChairman; and Pete Peterson, who was Secretary of Commerce in the Nixon \nadministration. I want to bring to the attention of the Senate this \nopinion piece because they make a great deal of sense in how they have \nalerted us.\n  They say in part in this opinion piece that ``great care must be \ntaken to ensure that any tax cut medicine treats the short-term \neconomic symptoms without adversely affecting the long-term \nprognosis.'' They go on to say:\n\n       We believe an immediate fiscal stimulus can be provided \n     independently of the proposed 10-year tax cut. Any additional \n     tax cut should be limited to account for the enormous \n     uncertainty--\n\n  Something the Senator from Pennsylvania mentioned in his remarks--\n\n     of long-term budget projections and the huge unfunded \n     obligations of Social Security and Medicare. A compromise \n     based on this framework would help ensure passage of a budget \n     resolution with substantial bipartisan support.\n\n  They are right. We could have substantial bipartisan support on a \nplan to provide immediate fiscal stimulus. I wish we would halt work on \nthe budget right now, go to work on a stimulus package right now and \npass it this week, get it into the hands of the American people as \nquickly as possible, and then go to work on a 10-year package that \nwould take account of both the uncertainty of this 10-year forecast and \nalso, as former Senators Nunn and Rudman and their group have advised, \n``the huge unfunded obligations of Social Security and Medicare.''\n  They go on:\n\n       The first part of the compromise, passing immediate tax \n     relief, already has overwhelming support.\n\n  They are right.\n\n       The second part of the compromise involves an entirely \n     separate issue--the extent to which policymakers should \n     gamble on the accuracy of 10-year projections that the \n     Congressional Budget Office itself says could be off by \n     trillions of dollars. In our view, it would be exceedingly \n     unwise to rely on these projections to lock in a series of \n     large, escalating tax cuts, particularly before addressing \n     the implications of the future financing requirements of \n     Social Security and Medicare.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time have I consumed?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 4 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If the Chair will inform me when I have consumed 8 \nminutes, I would appreciate it.\n  This chart talks about the uncertainty former Senators Nunn and \nRudman have discussed. This is from the Congressional Budget Office \nitself, the ones who did the forecast. They tell us the projection of a \n$5.6 trillion surplus has only a 10-percent chance of coming true, a \n45-percent chance there will be more money, a 45-percent chance there \nwill be less money. Of course, this forecast was made weeks ago. In the \ninterval, the economy has weakened further.\n  I will bet that the chances are we will probably have less money over \nthis 10-year period than was previously forecast. Yet we are about to \nlock in a 10-year plan that leaves little margin for error.\n  It uses all of the non-trust-fund money for the tax cut. That means \nif the forecast does not prove out, if there is less money, we will be \ninto the trust funds of Medicare and Social Security, and we will be \ninto them at a critical time--right before the baby boomers start to \nretire. And all of these surplus numbers will turn to substantial \ndeficits.\n  I hope very much that colleagues will take a look at this opinion \npiece by our very respected former colleagues, Republicans and \nDemocrats, who are saying: Enact the stimulus package now. That is \nsomething we should do and then go to work on a 10-year plan that takes \naccount not only the uncertainty of the projections but that also takes \naccount of the massive unfunded liability in Social Security and \nMedicare. That would be the responsible thing to do. That would be the \nwise thing to do. And I think we could come together on a bipartisan \nplan to do both of those things.\n  Let me conclude on the question of the uncertainty of the forecast by \nsaying this chart shows that in the year 2006 we can have anywhere from \na $50 billion deficit to more than a trillion dollar surplus, and this \nis according to the people who made the forecast. That is the \nuncertainty. It is just unwise to come out here and support a plan that \nuses all of the non-trust-fund money for a tax cut. I think it \nvirtually assures that we will be raiding the trust funds of Medicare \nand Social Security if the President's plan passes.\n  Let me say that the plan we have offered on our side as a potential \ncompromise protects the Social Security and Medicare trust funds--every \ndollar of those moneys--and then, with what is left, divides it in the \nfollowing ways: a third for a tax cut; a third for the high-priority \ndomestic needs of prescription drug benefits, money to improve \neducation, money to strengthen our national defense; and then, with the \nfinal third, we do what is proposed by our colleagues in this opinion \npiece this morning--set aside $750 billion to begin to deal with our \nlong-term liability in Social Security and Medicare. That is a \nconservative approach. To me, it is a wiser course than using all of \nthe non-trust-fund money for a tax cut--a tax cut that is predicated on \na 10-year projection that is highly uncertain.\n  There has been a lot of talk about what the differences are between \nour plan and the competing plan on the other side. The fundamental \ndifference is right here--short-term and long-term debt reduction. Our \nplan dedicates $3.65 trillion of the $5.6 trillion projected surplus \nfor short- and long-term debt reduction. President Bush's plan \ndedicates $2 trillion for that purpose.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that the plan we are offering is \nconservative; it takes account of the uncertainty of this forecast; and \nit gives us maximum paydown of both short-term and long-term debt.\n  With that, I yield the floor and look forward to our remaining 1 hour \nof debate on the amendment before us.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Georgia such time \nas he may consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment that I \nhave introduced jointly with the Senators from Iowa and New Mexico. \nThis amendment to boost agricultural spending comes at a time of great \ndistress for our American farms. It will provide our struggling farmers \nwith the assistance they so desperately need, and we believe it will \ngive Congress the ability to craft a solid farm bill as these \nnegotiations near.\n  This amendment will provide nearly $64 billion in increased \nagricultural spending over the next 11 years. More importantly, it \naddresses our current problems by providing $5 billion for fiscal year \n2001--a critical boost for later in this crop year.\n  This amendment is also fiscally responsible, accounting for only a \nsmall portion of our projected surplus; and it will not jeopardize \nsupport for other priorities that Congress identifies.\n  Crops are now going into the ground and farmers are extremely \nworried. The cost of fertilizer and fuel is expected to hit near record \namounts this summer, at the same time we watch commodity prices \ncontinue to fall.\n  While this immediate funding is critical, I say this: It may not \nprove to be\n\n[[Page S3364]]\n\nenough. We will have to watch our agricultural situation very closely \nto determine if additional funds are needed later this year. \nNevertheless, I appreciate very much the leadership and cooperation of \nmy colleagues in providing funds for this fiscal year and addressing \nthis problem directly.\n  We all understand the importance of this effort, and we will have to \nwork together to assist our producers through these difficult times. \nFarmers are pleading for our help. They are selling their crops at the \nsame level today that they or their parents did 20 years ago, while the \ncost of production continues to soar.\n  Without our help, many farms in my State and all around this country \nwill continue to go out of business. Agriculture provides one out of \nevery six jobs in my State, and it has an economic impact of over $60 \nbillion a year. Georgia farmers have a compelling need for stability. \nThe rural communities they support are under great distress as well. \nAnd those who know rural America know this type of distress extends far \nbeyond the farm. It affects the car dealership; it affects the local \nrestaurant and the downtown department store. These pieces of rural \neconomies are inextricably linked.\n  I thank the chairman, the Senator from New Mexico, and the Senator \nfrom Iowa for recognizing this shortfall in funding for agriculture and \nfor their willingness to work with me on this amendment. As I \nmentioned, this is a responsible approach, and while it may not be the \nfinal solution, I think it will go a long way and will be a good step \nforward to ensuring that the needs of America's hard-working farmers \nare met. I hope my colleagues will support this important and timely \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from New Mexico \nfor his efforts on this piece of legislation which is so important to \nour country. I also congratulate the Senator from North Dakota for his \nfine efforts in presenting the other side of the case in this matter.\n  I wish to talk about a number of issues that have been raised today. \nSpecifically, however, I want to get into the issue of spending in this \nbill and the potential for driving a large hole in the concept of \ncontrolling spending at the Federal level. The Senator from North \nDakota cited a recent op-ed piece written by the cochairmen of the \nConcord Coalition which has been a force for fiscal discipline in the \nCongress for many years. I think if the cochairmen of the Concord \nCoalition had followed the debate over the last few days, and \nspecifically the debate on the agricultural amendments, the debate on \nthe IDEA amendments, the drug proposals as a mandatory exercise, they \nwould have serious concerns and may not have written the op-ed pieces \nthey wrote. They would see that the contingency fund, or the fund for \nthe preservation of Social Security as it is defined, or the reserve \nfor Social Security as defined by the Senator from North Carolina, as \ndefined by the President in his budget, is under serious stress and \nduress because the dollars are being spent rather aggressively in this \nCongress as we add more and more mandatory programs to the agenda of \nthe Congress.\n  Mandatory programs have an insidious way of spending Federal dollars \nwithout the Congress having to be responsible in voting for those \nFederal dollars once the initial vote has occurred.\n  Regrettably, in this exercise, we are on all sorts of levels adding \nnew mandatory programs to the Federal accounts. In the end, that is \ngoing to drive up Federal spending dramatically and, as a result, put \npressure on the Social Security trust funds, put pressure on the \nability to return to taxpayers in the form of a tax cut the moneys \nwhich they rightly deserve, moneys which they are sending us which we \ndo not need to spend, and generally limit fiscal discipline. Mandatory \nprograms essentially are not subject to fiscal discipline.\n  I want to speak specifically to the mandatory programs now being \nproposed in the area of agriculture. Regrettably, over the last few \nyears, the agricultural accounts have been the least disciplined \naccounts within the Federal agenda. In fact, if we go back--and this \nchart reflects my point--if we go back over the last couple of years, \nwe see the green lines are the Federal caps. This is what we were \nsupposed to spend as a Federal Government. Beginning in 1998, we went \nway beyond those Federal caps and exploded Federal spending.\n  That explosion of Federal spending, above what we said we were going \nto do as a Congress, was driven in large part by emergency events. \nThose emergency events in large part were agricultural spending. In \nfact, agricultural spending over the last few years, as a result of \nincreases driven by the Congress, have gone from $9 billion in 1996 up \nto $38 billion in 2000.\n  The majority of this increase--which is a staggering percentage \nincrease by the way, almost a 400-percent increase--the majority of \nthis increase has been done under the guise of emergency spending.\n  Last year there was $31.5 billion in emergency spending in the \nagricultural accounts. That is why this chart has such a dramatic and \nregrettable line to it--the actual spending in relation to what we were \nsupposed to spend as a government because emergency spending in the \nagricultural accounts has been so out of control, for all intents and \npurposes.\n  This year there is a new approach. The approach is: Let's not deal \nwith these emergencies anymore; let's just make all this mandatory, and \nthen we will not have to do emergencies. We will just simply spend the \nmoney and never have to account for it under any scenario. That is not \nfiscal discipline.\n  We need to look at what is happening in the agricultural community to \nunderstand the extent of the spending, the largess that is occurring.\n  In the year 1999, the Government payments as a percentage of farm \nincome in the United States were essentially half. In other words, if \nyou take net farm income, half of the net farm income in this country \ncame from the Federal Government in tax payments raised from Americans \nand then paid out to farmers.\n  That is a staggering change because, in the year 1990, only 20 \npercent of the payments that went to farmers were Federal payments, \nFederal tax dollars going to farmers. The top 1 percent of farmers \nreceived, on average, $660,000 each from the Government. The top 10 \npercent received $308,000. The average farm income exceeds the average \nAmerican household income by $1,000.\n  These numbers are staggering. In some States, net farm income--in \nother words, what farmers make in profit, what they actually hold in \ntheir accounts to operate their day-to-day lives after their expenses--\nnet farm income was exceeded by Government payments by over 100 \npercent.\n\n  In the State of North Dakota, direct Government payments exceeded net \nfarm income by 210 percent. In the State of Indiana, direct Government \npayments exceeded net farm income by 192 percent. There are eight \nStates in this country where direct Government payments exceed net farm \nincome.\n  What does that mean? That means we pay more in tax dollars to the \nfarmers in those States than the farmers take home in pay after \nexpenses. That is an incredible figure. It essentially means that, for \nexample, in the State of Indiana, we could say to every farmer in that \nState: Stop farming, and we are going to pay you twice what you make \nnow in taxes because that is what we are doing today. Yet that is not \nenough.\n  Today we have amendments facing us which are calling for an \nincrease--an increase--over this staggering amount which we have \nalready seen in the last 5 years rise to $38 billion. This amendment is \ncalling for an increase over that number. The Johnson-Conrad amendment \nis calling for an additional $97 billion over the next 10 years. That \nis going to jump this number up radically and, over the next 10 years, \nobviously have a huge impact on the budget.\n  It is going to be a mandatory program. Once we pass it, because of \nthe machinations and procedures of this place, that is going to be the \nend of the game. It is over. A lot of times on these budget debates we \nare fighting with\n\n[[Page S3365]]\n\nrubber bullets. We shoot at each other, but it does not hurt that much. \nThese are not rubber bullets. These are real bullets. When we pass this \none, it becomes a mandatory program. When the authorization committee \nacts, which we absolutely know is going to happen because the \nauthorization committee strongly supports increasing funding, it is \nover. We will have a mandatory program on the books which is going to \ncost the American taxpayers a huge amount of money over the years. It \nmakes no sense from the standpoint that we are already paying two times \nthe cost of the net income in States such as Indiana and North Dakota.\n  It also makes no sense because the price of farm products is going \nup, as this last chart shows. We have a significant increase in farm \nprices occurring in many commodities--rice, soybeans, wheat, and corn. \nOne has to wonder, if the prices are going up--and they are projected \nby CBO to go up. For example, corn prices are projected to go up 30 \npercent over 10 years; soybeans, 43 percent; wheat, 40 percent; rice, \n40 percent--if they are going to go up, why do we have to put the \nsubsidies up?\n  I do not know. I know every time we have a farm bill, the American \ntaxpayers end up paying a huge amount of money.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is a strong supporter of this. This is \nhis amendment. For those of us in the rest of the country, we have to \nask ourselves: Why would we want to put on the books a mandatory \nprogram that is going to cost us these types of dollars? Let us at \nleast have the ability to come back every year and check this number \nand see whether we really need it.\n  Mr. President, I suspect my time is up. Therefore, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I listened to my colleague and my friend from New \nHampshire describe farm prices rising. I would love for him to go to my \nhome State and tell the farmers that farm prices are rising. They are \nnot rising. They have the lowest farm prices in real terms in 75 years. \nThat is what is happening to farm prices.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield in a moment. I would love to \nhave a dialog on this question.\n  I say to my friend from New Hampshire, I know agriculture is not a \ndominant industry in New Hampshire but it is dominant in many States in \nthe Nation. For those who represent farmers, we can report to our \ncolleague there is a desperate crisis across farm country. This is \nabout as serious a situation as I have ever seen.\n  When our colleague says farm prices are rising, he is talking about a \nprojection into the future by the Congressional Budget Office, the very \nsame people who said prices would be rising now, when prices have \nplummeted. Their record on forecasting farm prices is not very good. It \nis another indication of why there is great danger in banking on any \n10-year forecast. That is what the Senator from New Hampshire was \nshowing, a 10-year forecast for farm prices by people who in the past \nhaven't been able to forecast farm prices worth a hoot and a holler.\n  Here is what has happened. This is what has really happened from 1991 \nto now. The red line on this chart is the prices farmers receive. The \ndistribution of this line is quite clear. It is almost straight down. \nThe green line is the prices farmers pay for their input. It is going \nup, up, up. It is the relationship between the prices farmers pay and \nwhat they are paid that has created this farm crisis. It is why there \nis strong support on a bipartisan basis to respond. It is the reason so \nmuch of farm income is currently coming from the Federal Government. If \nit weren't, we would have an absolute collapse occurring in farm \ncountry.\n  My State is a wheat State. When my colleague from New Hampshire says \nfarm prices are rising--and I say I would love to have him come to my \nState and address a farm crowd and explain to them how farm prices are \nrising--this is why he wouldn't get a very good reception. This chart \nshows what has happened to farm prices ever since we passed the last \nfarm bill which was a disaster in itself. Farm prices have plummeted. \nThat is what has happened to wheat prices. Here is the cost of \nproducing. Here is what has happened to prices. The prices are far \nbelow the cost of production.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will yield soon. I want to first devastate the case the \nSenator made.\n  Mr. GREGG. You are not devastating my case. You are trying to \ndevastate CBO's case.\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, the Senator was making the case that CBO made. When \nyou say farm prices are rising, they are not. That is the simple \nreality. What you have is the lowest prices in real terms in 75 years, \nand it is a crisis all across rural America, all across agricultural \nAmerica, and every Senator who represents a farm State, farm \nconstituency, knows it.\n  Let's talk about some of the underlying reasons we have this serious \nproblem. This is what our major competitors are doing. We cannot talk \nabout agriculture in isolation. We have to talk about what is happening \nwith our major competitors. Our major competitors are the Europeans. \nThis is what the Europeans are doing to support their producers: $313 \nan acre on average. This is for the period of 1996 to 1999. This is \nwhat we are doing in the United States during the same period: $38 an \nacre. That is nearly a 10-to-1 advantage in terms of what the Europeans \nare providing their producers versus what we are providing our \nproducers. These are not Kent Conrad's numbers; these are the numbers \nfrom the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. They \nare the international scorekeepers on these questions.\n\n  It isn't just what they do for their producers directly; it is also \nwhat they are doing in terms of agricultural export support. Here is \nwhat the Europeans are doing. This chart shows which countries are \nproviding what percentage of world agricultural export subsidy, \naccording to the World Trade Organization. This is for the last full \nyear for which there are records, 1998. The blue pie on this chart is \nEurope's share of world agricultural export subsidies. It is 83.5 \npercent. The U.S. share is 2.7 percent. That is 30 to 1 as a \ndifferential. Is there any wonder our farmers are getting killed in the \ninternational marketplace? Is there any wonder our market share is \ngoing down and Europe's is going up? Is there any wonder Europe was \npoised to surpass us in world market share last year?\n  Our friends in Europe have a strategy and a plan. They are working \nit, and they are working it very effectively. They have told me \nflatout: We think we are in a trade war with you in agriculture, and we \nthink at some point there will be a cease-fire in this trade war. We \nbelieve it will be a cease-fire in place. We want to occupy the high \nground. The high ground is world market share. We are going out and \nbuying.\n  That is exactly what they are doing. They are buying world market \nshare.\n  We are faced with a circumstance in which we have a crisis in \nAmerican agriculture. It is deep. It is threatening. It is so serious \nthat if it is left unchecked, it will force thousands of farmers off \nthe land--not because of anything they have done but because of our \nfailure to respond to the European juggernaut.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire wanted to join in a colloquy, and I am \nhappy to entertain a question on his time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am not sure I have any time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The problem is we don't have any time because of the \ncircumstance that occurred this morning. That time was used up by a \ndistinguished Senator who was speaking on a subject unrelated to this. \nHe had authority to do that. He spoke for quite some time, so we ended \nup very short in time.\n  My friend got some time this morning, and I wonder if the Senator \nwould object to a request on my part that we be given an additional 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I object unless we are given an additional 15 minutes, \nand that extends the time of the vote. I don't think that is a wise \ncourse.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do they have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. They have 33 minutes.\n\n[[Page S3366]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator wants our side to finish debate in 7 \nminutes, and he has 33.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator has used his time. I didn't use his time. He \nused his time. If you add time, the only fair way to do it is for us to \nthen add time, and then we extend the time for the vote, which I don't \nthink should be done. We wouldn't accept that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 15 minutes \noff the resolution and I give 3 minutes of that to the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I wish to make a \ncouple of points in response to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  First, as to my original point--and the Senator makes this point with \nhis representations as far as the unpredictability of the pricing of \nthe commodities--I cited a pricing list put forth by CBO, and the \nSenator rejects CBO as a scorer on this event. Then we should be coming \nback to the farm issue every year. We should not be making it a \nmandatory 10-year event where the authorizing committee can essentially \ncreate a cost to the taxpayers of this country which will not be \nadjusted by the actual events that occur in the marketplace.\n\n  Second, the fundamental point I am making is that the gross increase \nin farm spending has been uncontrolled and that the amendment that is \nbeing proposed of another $100 billion of new spending on top of the \nFederal baseline is a massive hole in the Federal budget. It is going \nto a program which makes no sense any longer. In States such as North \nDakota, the American taxpayer is presently paying, in tax subsidies to \nthe average farmer in North Dakota, twice what the farmers make in \ntake-home pay. So it makes no sense. It is a program that makes no \nsense.\n  I agree with the Senator from North Dakota on that point. But I do \nnot think the way you resolve it is by putting more and more money into \nit. In fact, the last Agriculture Secretary, Secretary Glickman, said \nexactly that. He said the incentive for farms to be efficient any \nlonger has been lost. Essentially, the Government role is requiring the \nfarmer to do something in return, which has been largely eliminated by \nthe Congress. There is essentially a program that is out of control and \nit is getting more and more out of control. All we are doing is \nsuggesting we throw more and more money at it, so now we have eight \nStates where the Federal Government pays more in subsidy than the \nfarmers take home in pay. What type of program is that? It does not \nmake any sense to me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in response to my colleague from New \nHampshire, when he uses the figure of 200 percent in North Dakota, what \nhe is taking is a year in which there were two emergency packages paid \nin the same year: one for the previous year, one for the current year. \nSo it is not an accurate picture of what is occurring.\n  The Senator is right that agricultural spending has increased. It has \nincreased in response to a crisis. It has increased in response to the \nlowest farm prices, in real terms, in 75 years.\n  I put up the chart that shows what has happened to farm prices. They \nhave gone straight down since the last farm bill has passed and the \nprices that farmers pay have escalated, escalated, escalated, creating \na huge gap between the prices they pay and the prices they receive. If \nwe do not respond, we will see tens of thousands of farmers forced off \nthe land.\n  Talking about a value question, this is a value question. It has \nnothing to do with our farmers doing something wrong or being somehow \nincapable of competing. But they are up against the hard reality of \nwhat the Europeans are doing. The Europeans are outgunning us 30 to 1 \non export support for agriculture--30 to 1. On support to individual \nproducers they are outgunning us almost 10 to 1. That is the reality of \nwhat we confront here.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire can say ``tough luck, you are all down \nthe road here,'' but I do not think that is the response of the \nAmerican people. I think the American people say if this is what our \ncompetitors are doing, we ought to fight back. We ought to level the \nplaying field. We ought to give our farmers a fair, fighting chance.\n  I know there are other Senators waiting for time. How much time does \nthe Senator from Iowa need?\n  Mr. HARKIN. May I have 5 or 7 minutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Hutchinson has been waiting. Can I give him 3 \nminutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg) The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as a new member of the Agriculture \nCommittee, it will take only a moment to give my perspective as the \nSenator from Arkansas, and it is a little different perspective from \nwhat some have been speaking about on agricultural spending. Certainly \nthere are some big issues that have to be addressed on farm policy. \nThey will be addressed in the context of a new farm bill. The reality \nis farmers are hurting right now. They need a signal from this Senate \nand this Congress that we are going to address the crisis that \nagriculture is experiencing.\n  In my home State of Arkansas, 25 percent of our economy is \nagricultural related, either directly or indirectly. In east Arkansas, \nin the Delta of Arkansas, the entire economy is related to \nagriculture--the implement dealers, the seed stores, the bankers, or \nthe farmers themselves. So this is a critical issue to my State and one \nwe must address.\n  Because of low commodity prices, because of increasingly high energy \ncosts, because of high fertilizer costs, because of the investments in \nmachinery that are required, all of this compounds to create a very \nserious situation in farm communities across Arkansas.\n  What we are seeing is the death of American agriculture by attrition. \nWe may be able to point to a rising graph on spending, but we must \nacknowledge that what farmers are facing today is a grave crisis. The \nway we have handled that in recent years has only added to the \nuncertainty. This signal early in this budget debate will send the \nright kind of message to the farmers of this Nation that Congress is \nnot going to leave this issue unaddressed, and we are going to address \nit early. My farmers want predictability that they can take to the \nbank. I believe the Grassley amendment will provide the funding levels \nthat will lay the foundation for greater certainty in the future.\n  What is at stake is not just a safe, affordable and reliable food \nsupply for the American people--something we have always taken for \ngranted--it is a quality of life. What is at stake is, in fact, a value \nsystem and whether or not we believe that is worth an investment on the \npart of the Federal Government. I believe it is, and I strongly support \nthe Grassley amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I watched the occupant of the chair in his \nrecent remarks on the state of agriculture in America. He had a chart \npurportedly showing, if I remember his words correctly, that spending \nwas out of control on agriculture. Spending had gone up.\n  I want to point out that in 1999, farm payments, Government payments \nto farmers in Iowa, equaled about 130 percent of their net farm income. \nThink about that. If it were not for the Government payments, Iowa \nfarmers in the aggregate not only would have had no net farm income, \nthey would have been far into the red--negative income. Think about it: \nFederal Government payments amounted to 130 percent of Iowa's net farm \nincome.\n  The Chair, in his comments, said spending is out of control. Was the \nSenator from New Hampshire blaming the farmers for this? I surely hope \nnot because what is happening in agriculture today--high Government \nspending, yet farmers still being driven out of business--is a \nreflection of the misguided, defective farm program that we have called \nFreedom to Farm. I am proud to say I did not vote for it.\n\n[[Page S3367]]\n\n  These large Government payments in agriculture are a reflection upon \na failed agricultural policy in America. We have to get our farm policy \nback on track again. But we cannot get it back on track by just pulling \nthe rug out from underneath our family farmers and blaming them for the \nfailures of this Congress to pass a farm bill that provides for better \nincomes from the marketplace.\n  As I see the Grassley amendment, it basically takes us down the same \npathway as Freedom to Farm did. It says, don't worry; be happy; \nsometime in the future the prices are going to go up, the markets are \ngoing to be there, and everything is just going to be fine. The failure \nof Freedom to Farm was that it told farmers to plant fence row to fence \nrow for markets that did not materialize. Plant all you want. The \nconsumption will be there, the demand will be there, trade will be \nthere, and the foreign markets will be there; not to worry. Well, as we \nknow, they were not there.\n  I was in China last year. Last year China was exporting corn. We know \nwhat Brazil and Argentina are doing to compete with us in soybeans. We \nare awash in grain in the world markets right now. Yet our policy says \nkeep on producing even more. I certainly hope we are not going to \npunish U.S. farmers by saying, get out of business, and get off the \nland because we have a failed farm policy that we have passed in the \nCongress.\n  What we need to do is improve that policy. We have to write a new \nfarm bill by next year. The so-called Freedom to Farm bill expires \nthen--and we have to make some changes.\n  The amendment of my colleague from Iowa will not permit us to make \nthe kind of changes that are necessary to improve our agricultural \npolicy. For example, I believe there is almost universal support for \nadditional conservation spending and for rewarding farmers for being \ngood stewards of our soil and other natural resources.\n  With the support of both agriculture and conservation groups, as well \nas other members of Congress, I have a proposal for a conservation \nincentive program to provide farmers and ranchers the support they \ndeserve for being good stewards of their land and at the same time keep \nthem in business in agricultural production.\n  But the amendment by my colleague from Iowa, the Grassley amendment, \nprovides only $350 million a year in additional conservation funding. \nMuch more than that is needed if we are going to have a sound, viable \nfarm and conservation and conservation program.\n  The Johnson amendment, on the other hand, provides a full $1 billion \nfor added conservation spending. And it provides enough funding overall \nso that the Agriculture Committee can use its judgment to devote more \nthan that to conservation if they need to do that. And I believe we are \ngoing to need to do that.\n  The Grassley amendment fails to provide the funding to permit us to \ndo in the Agriculture Committee what I believe most of us on both sides \nof the aisle want to do; that is, to have more conservation; to reward \nfarmers for being good stewards of the soil, water and resources; to \ntell our urban cousins that they are going to get more conservation in \nreturn for farm spending--they will get cleaner water, cleaner air, \nhealthier land, and more wildlife. But farmers cannot bear the whole \nburden of being good conservationists. It takes time, it takes \nequipment, and it takes money to do that. Farmers are not making much \nif any money now. They cannot really afford more expense for \nconservation.\n  I believe it is in our national interest to shift the agricultural \nprogram to put more money into conservation. That will help farm income \nand while delivering conservation and environmental benefits for all of \nus. The Johnson amendment will allow us to do that. The Grassley \namendment will not.\n  Right now the Natural Resources Conservation Service of USDA \nestimates that at least five times as many farmers apply for funds \nunder the Environmental Quality Incentives Program than can be \napproved. Farmers want to enhance their stewardship of land and natural \nresources. We ought to be encouraging them--not turning them away.\n\n  Again, the Grassley amendment does not provide the money we need to \nstrengthen our farm programs and help our farmers be good stewards of \nland, water and natural resources.\n  The amendment doesn't even provide for the core funding that we are \ngoing to need in agriculture over the next 10 years. For 2002, the \nunderlying amendment will only provide about $7 billion against a short \nfall in farm income of some $10 billion. It provides only $5 billion \nfor 2001, which is far, far too low.\n  The Grassley amendment makes the same fatal mistake as Freedom to \nFarm. It bets on the hope of expanding markets and rising prices for \nfarm commodities.\n  Again, as we transition in agriculture, as we get off of the failed \nFreedom to Farm bill, as we move into a stronger conservation mode--\nwhich will help farmers and ranchers not just in the Midwest, but in \nthe Northeast, in the Northwest, the Southeast, and all over America--\nand meet the requirements and needs we have for environmental and \nenvironmental practices and allow farmers to stay in business. The \nGrassley amendment simply does not provide for that.\n  Lastly, let me say that especially in Iowa--I am sure it is true in \nSouth Dakota also and North Dakota--we have a very high proportion of \nelderly in our State. I believe Iowa is No. 1 in the Nation in \nproportion of people over age 85. And we rank near the highest in the \nproportion of our citizens who are over age 65. Medicare is critically \nimportant to my constituents. It is critically important. Yet the \nunderlying amendment takes money away from Medicare to help pay for \nagriculture. The last thing I want to do is to pit our elderly, who \nrely on Medicare, our rural hospitals and our rural providers that rely \non Medicare, against our farmers. But that is exactly what the Grassley \namendment does. It pits the interests of older Iowans against those of \nfarmers. That is the last thing I want to see happen.\n  The Johnson amendment is much more forthright. It says we don't need \nto give all of these tax breaks to the superrich. We will take a little \nbit out of the tax breaks that are given to the upper 1 percent in our \ncountry to help meet our needs in agriculture.\n  There are a lot of reasons to be opposed to the Grassley amendment, \nbut I submit to you that perhaps the single most important reason is \nthat we should not be taking away from Medicare to pay for agriculture \nand pit the elderly in my State against farmers. That I cannot support. \nThere is enough money if we do not give tax breaks to the wealthiest in \nour country--at least not 43 percent of the tax reductions. We can give \nthem a little bit. The Conrad amendment provides for a lot of tax \nreduction, but not the huge amount of tax breaks in this budget \nproposed by President Bush which prevent us from adequately funding \nagriculture and other priorities.\n  The Johnson amendment is one that makes sense. It will help us get \nour agricultural house in order without going after Medicare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, maybe I can review the points the Senator \nfrom Iowa is making on the amendment that we will vote on very shortly.\n  The Grassley amendment, while well intended, has a very unfortunate \nconsequence. We have gone back now and looked at the year-by-year \nnumbers in the Republican budget resolution. What we find is very \nclear. If the Grassley amendment for additional support for agriculture \npasses, he is going right into the Medicare trust fund in the years \n2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008.\n  I believe strongly that we ought to increase support for agriculture. \nWe have an amendment to do that. It is the Johnson amendment that will \nfollow the Grassley amendment. But we do not raid Medicare trust funds \nto do it. That is a profound mistake, and it is precisely what the \nGrassley amendment does.\n  If one looks at the budget we are considering this year and then the \nfollowing 10 years, if you take out the Grassley amendment that \npreviously passed for prescription drugs and the funding in each year \nfor that initiative, then you take out the Grassley agricultural \namendment and the funding it requires in each of the years, you find \nthat you are raiding the Medicare trust\n\n[[Page S3368]]\n\nfund by $15 billion in the year 2005, by $13 billion in the year 2006, \nby $10 billion in the year 2007, and by $4 billion in the year 2008. So \nthat is a total raid on the Social Security trust fund of $42 billion. \nIt is just wrong. But it is what the amendment of the Senator from Iowa \ndoes, perhaps unwittingly.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator has really encapsulated this. The Grassley \namendment, first of all, does not meet the legitimate needs of \nagriculture. It falls far short of what we need. The Johnson amendment \nmeets that need.\n  Secondly, in terms of conservation, where we want to really move \nforward, the Grassley amendment does not permit us to support the kind \nof conservation work we need. The Johnson amendment does.\n  And lastly, as the Senator pointed out, the Grassley amendment is not \ngoing to help us in agriculture, but it still raids Medicare. The \nJohnson amendment doesn't.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for pointing this out. His explanation \nreally encapsulates why the Johnson amendment is best for rural America \nand does not go after the Medicare trust fund.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It goes to the fundamental problem of the Bush budget and \nthe fundamental problem of the Republican budget which is trying to \nmatch the Bush budget. Of course, we don't even have the Bush budget \nbefore us. But with the kind of rudimentary outline he has provided us, \nit simply doesn't add up because the tax cut is so large.\n  When you try to adjust the spending provisions, as both Republicans \nand Democrats now want to do--we saw that yesterday; Republicans agreed \nthat we need twice as much money for a prescription drug benefit. Today \nwe see the Republicans agree we need substantially more for \nagriculture. Unfortunately, what they have proposed is inadequate. It \nprovides $64 billion over the 11 years. Our proposal would provide $97 \nbillion. But the biggest problem is the source of the funds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. They are--as can be clearly seen with the combined effect \nof the amendment they adopted yesterday on prescription drugs and the \namendment they seek to adopt today --raiding the Medicare trust fund in \nthe years 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008. That just can't be the way we do \nbusiness.\n  The Johnson amendment, instead, provides that we take this money \nfirst out of the surplus for the year 2001, and thereafter out of the \noversized tax cut which goes disproportionately to the wealthiest 1 \npercent.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield for a question, I didn't read \nthe Congressional Record of yesterday's debate, but I heard that the \nchairman of the Budget Committee had said that the contingency fund \nshould be reserved for Medicare. At least that is what I thought I \nheard. Yet the Grassley amendment would take money from the contingency \nfund to pay for agriculture and take it out of Medicare. Did I hear \ncorrectly that they wanted to reserve the contingency fund for \nMedicare?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is the description they gave. But the problem is, \ntheir budget doesn't work. When you break it down year by year, it \ndoesn't add up. And that is the problem they have. Maybe they were \nhoping nobody would notice or hoping nobody would bother to add it up \nand see they are raiding the trust fund. But they are. And it is \nundeniable they are raiding the trust fund in 2005, 2006, 2007, and \n2008. That is the reality.\n\n  Does the Senator from South Dakota seek time?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Yes, I do, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. If I might have just 2 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator from North Dakota, the ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee, for his leadership, and thank him and \nmy friend from Iowa, Senator Harkin, for their very able explanation of \nwhat the tradeoffs are as we engage in this budget debate.\n  There is broad-based agreement we need a significant increase in the \nlevel of funding necessary for agriculture. In fact, that agreement is \nbipartisan. Forty-four Senators have written the Budget leadership--\nincluding 19 of my Republican colleagues--asking for additional \nresources for agriculture.\n  In addition, over 20 farm and commodity organizations have been \nasking for the resources roughly equivalent to what we are doing in the \nJohnson amendment, ranging from the very conservative to liberal \norganizations in the country, from the Farm Bureau to the Farmers \nUnion, and including corn, wheat, dairy, soybean, cotton, rice, and \nsugar producers. You name it. We have across-the-board support from \nagricultural organizations.\n  I think the sense is to do this in a forthright manner rather than \nplaying games with this so-called contingency fund which, in the first \nmeasure, is largely composed of Medicare trust fund dollars and should \nnot be used for these reasons anyway and also keeping in mind the \ntremendous demands that will more than envelop the contingency fund out \nof defense, out of nonagricultural disasters, out of additional tax cut \nproposals, and out of prescription drugs.\n  The more forthright way to do this is to simply recognize that we \nought to utilize the surplus this year and downsize very marginally the \nsize of the overall tax cut over 10 years. We can do that and still \nafford a very significant tax cut.\n  This is not a question of whether or not we are going to have a tax \ncut. We will have a tax cut. It will be huge. In fact, we can do this \nand have a tax cut at least as large as what President Bush has \nproposed for middle class and working families. We could go even larger \nand do this as well.\n  So it is not a tradeoff in terms of a tax cut or no tax cut. It is a \nmatter of whether we are going to be fiscally responsible. It is a \nmatter of whether we are going to deal with the agricultural and \nconservation needs of this country and do it in a stable, consistent \nway without jeopardizing Medicare.\n  Our goal is to get away from these ad hoc multibillion-dollar \ndisaster packages which are unreliable and which no producer can take \nto his bank with the assurance it is going to happen in the next year \nand, instead, have a stable, set, and certain kind of level of funding \nfor agriculture for this coming farm bill and this year. It is our goal \nto do this and to do it in a fiscally responsible way without \njeopardizing Medicare, without setting up a fight over whether it is \ngoing to be farm relief or whether it is going to be an increase in \ndefense spending but, instead, to set this funding assigned to do it, \nutilizing some of these projected surpluses over the coming decade as \nwell as for this year.\n  This is a responsible way to do it, to have some certainty, to not \nhave financing for the agricultural sector of our economy subject to \nthe whims of the politics of any particular given year, and to not be \nutilizing what, in my view, is a largely bogus contingency fund. It \nsimply doesn't work that way.\n  Because we have bipartisan support for a significant ramping up of \nsupport for agriculture and conservation, I am hopeful that when the \ndust settles out of this debate we can have that kind of across-the-\naisle support for our efforts with this Johnson amendment.\n  This is badly needed. We are going through a time of great crisis in \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I, again, applaud Senator Conrad for his leadership in \nhelping to integrate this into a more thoughtful, balanced budget \nstrategy.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of Senator \nJohnson's amendment. This amendment includes $9 billion for emergency \nfarm assistance in Fiscal Year 2001, and $88 billion in additional \nagricultural assistance above the Congressional Budget Office baseline \nover Fiscal Years 2002 through 2011. Of this amount $58 billion is \nprovided over Fiscal Year 2003-2007, which will likely be the first \nfive years of a new Farm Bill, and also the period when the need for \nadditional assistance will be greatest. Additionally this increase \nincludes a minimum of $9.4 billion for farm conservation programs. This \nis approximately a 50 percent increase over baseline funding for \ncurrent conservation spending.\n\n[[Page S3369]]\n\n  First, this amendment includes $9 billion in emergency economic \nassistance for this crop year. This is the second year we have been \nforced to include emergency farm assistance in the budget resolution. \nThe reason is failed federal farm policy. The 1996 Freedom to Farm \nBill, which I call the Freedom to Fail Bill, promised to bring the \n``free market'' to agriculture, by reducing government assistance to \nproducers over the life of the legislation. Unfortunately that \nlegislation has failed to provide an adequate safety net during years \nof low commodity prices and weather related disasters. Over the last \nthree years Congress has spent over $25 billion in emergency payments. \nThe very largest farming operations have received a majority of these \npayments, while smaller family farms actually received less under \nFreedom to Farm. Freedom to Farm did not get the Government out of \nagriculture, but it sure has been successful in getting family farmers \nout of agriculture.\n  Unfortunately, economic forecasts for agriculture remain bleak for \nthe 2001 growing season. According to USDA, net farm income is forecast \nto decline approx 20 percent again this year, in the absence of \nadditional assistance. While commodity prices continue to be depressed, \ninput costs, most notably fuel and fertilizer, are skyrocketing. It is \nmy hope that we will not squander the opportunity this amendment \npresents, as Congress did last year, to deal with the current price \ncrisis, and write a new farm bill that works for family farmers, rural \ncommunities and the environment.\n  In order to ensure that family farmers remain a part of this \ncountry's landscape, a new farm bill must be enacted this year. We \nsimply cannot wait until re-authorization in 2002 for Congress to act. \nCongress should act now to address the impact of plummeting farm \nincomes and the ripple effect it is having throughout rural communities \nand their economic base. We must develop a farm bill which will address \nthe immediate price crisis situation, we need a bill that provides a \nreliable targeted, counter-cyclical safety net to family farmers. For \nmy part, I believe lifting the loan rate would provide relief to \nfarmers who need it and increase stability over the long term. \nAdditionally I believe we must also make a strong commitment to rural \ndevelopment initiatives this year. We must focus on ways to bring the \neconomic boom of the last decade to rural communities who have been \nleft behind. Finally a new farm bill must work for the environment. We \nmust work to include conservation incentives to reward farmers who \ncarry out conservation measures on their land.\n  This amendment is about priorities. The Senate will go on record. Do \nwe favor a large tax cut that primarily benefits the wealthiest one \npercent of taxpayers, and fails to address the key priorities of the \nnation? Or do we provide a level of funding adequate for Congress to \nwrite a new Farm Bill this year that meets the needs of farmers and \nensures the future of our rural communities. If we cherish the values \nof family farming and rural communities, we must pass the Johnson \namendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Treasury Department has provided us \nwith data showing the number of farms and small businesses, on a state-\nby-state basis, that would benefit from the President's tax relief \nplan. This data is reflected in the two charts that I have placed here \non the floor.\n  So now, let's go to our charts and examine the number of small \nbusinesses and farms operating in each of our states.\n  And let's ask ourselves whether the life's work reflected on these \ncharts deserves to be honored by relieving these people of an excessive \ntax burden.\n  We continue to hear our Democrat colleagues claim that other \nprovisions in the budget should be increased at the expense of the tax \ncut.\n  Well, let's get one thing very clear. Any reduction in the amount of \nthe tax cut means that the benefits of the tax cut proposal are \nreduced.\n  We do know what the other side of the aisle intends to take in order \nto pay for politically motivated expenditures--they intend to take away \nAmerica's tax cut! So let's take a look at what this would mean to the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  This means that for families with children, the $1,000 child care \ncredit would be reduced for each child in America. And that will occur \nfor every year of the $1,000 credit.\n  It means that for four-person families earning $45,000 a year will \nnot have their taxes cut in half, as called for in the President's \nplan.\n  It means that a four-person family earning $35,000 a year could be \nsubjected to income taxes. The President would take those families off \nthe tax rolls.\n  It means that expansion of the education savings accounts could be \nscaled back.\n  It means that the marriage penalty will continue because there won't \nbe enough funds left to fix it.\n  It means that small business owners and farmers will see an increase \nin their tax rates above the levels proposed by the President. They are \nalready paying the highest levels of tax since World War II.\n  So remember. Every time there is a politically motivated amendment to \nreduce the size of the tax cut, someone is going to pay a price for \nthat.\n  So who pays the price of this political posturing?\n  Families, small business owners and farmers, of course, because their \nwell-deserved tax relief will have to be scaled back.\n  The bipartisan amendment would add $5 billion in fiscal year 2001 and \n$58.5 billion between fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2011 to \nagriculture's mandatory commodity credit corporation price supports, \nrelated programs and conservation. Adding $63.5 billion to the existing \n$94.2 billion already assumed in the baseline would total $157 billion \nof support.\n  The amendment would stabilize net cash farm income, provide enough \nfunding to greatly strengthen a countercyclical program, provide \nadditional money for regulatory relief, enhance conservation efforts, \nand be fiscally responsible.\n  From fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2011 the Johnson/Conrad \namendment is funded out of the tax cut. Our amendment is funded out of \nthe contingency surplus. In plain language, they take $88 billion out \nof tax cuts, we don't.\n  The major criticism raised last night was that it doesn't spend \nenough money. This is seemingly always the Democratic philosophy: If a \nlittle is good, a boat load is better. Well, let me tell you, that's \nbunk.\n  The USDA's Economic Research Service has forecast that on-farm income \nwill drop $5.7 billion between 2000 and 2001. But starting in 2002, \nboth the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute widely held to \nbe the best source of non-partisan ag-economic information available, \nand the Congressional Budget Office have forecast that almost all major \ncommodities will realize improved prices. There will not be dramatic \ngrowth, but there will be improvement.\n  We have funded our proposal at $7.35 billion in fiscal years 2003, \n2004, and 2005. This far exceeds estimated shortcomings of on farm net \nincome and provides enough flexibility to help with the cost imposed by \nnew environmental regulations through EPA.\n  But if your goal is to hurt the family farmer, we should pass a boat \nload of money here today, then we can stand back and watch cash rent \nshoot through the roof. Ask any farmer who rents ground how much their \nrent has increased in the last three years. It's sure not due to \ninherent value in the land because our commodities have experienced \nrecord low prices, yet rent has increased dramatically.\n  I am not saying we shouldn't help farmers. I have been one of the \nstrongest supporters of increased agriculture spending for additional \npayments in the Senate. I have also always tried to find bipartisan \nground, and I know Senator Conrad knows this because I have often \nreached out to Senator Conrad and Senator Kerrey from Nebraska, when he \nwas in the Senate, to reach that bi-partisan position.\n  The Grassley-Miller amendment allows us to accomplish the same things \nwe have done for agriculture in the past three years, and also gives us \nthe flexibility to write an outstanding farm bill that fits the need of \nour family farmers.\n  Now I want to mention one last point. Remember the crop insurance \nlegislation that we passed last year?\n\n[[Page S3370]]\n\nTwo years ago we provided budget authority for crop insurance and the \nAgriculture Committee couldn't pass a bill out. The next year Senator \nRoberts and Senator Bob Kerrey found middle-ground and developed a \nbipartisan, broadly supported crop insurance bill. The problem was it \ndidn't fit the number that we had provided in the Budget. When the \nAgriculture Committee came back to the Budget Committee and explained \nthe dilemma, Chairman Domenici, Senator Conrad, and myself provided \nflexibility in the budget to accommodate the legislation.\n  Let me offer this thought: If the Agriculture Committee finds a \nbipartisan position that widely accepted as the right thing to do, in a \nsimilar fashion to the crop insurance legislation, we will work on \nproviding more flexibility, but for now let's start here.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I support the Grassley amendment. This \namendment will provide an additional $63.5 billion to the baseline for \nCommodity Credit Corporation mandatory payments to farmers. This will \nallow the authorizing committee to write a comprehensive farm bill that \nwill cover major commodities in addition to livestock and specialty \ncrops, rural development, trade, and conservation initiatives.\n  Conditions in agriculture are not improving. In fact, according to \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agriculture community will be \nfacing persistently low prices and depressed farm income this year, and \npossibly the next. This amendment provides an additional $5 billion in \nfiscal year 2001 for supplemental support that is needed by farmers.\n  Should farmers need additional assistance in the fall, this amendment \nalso provides for $7.35 billion in fiscal year 2002 that could be used \nfor this crop year.\n  Again, I support this amendment because it provides additional \nfunding needed by farmers this crop year. It also provides a \nsignificant level of agricultural funding in the out years to provide \neffective and predictable financial support.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \ndisappointment at the failure of Senator Johnson's amendment to H. Con. \nRes 83, the fiscal year 2002 budget resolution. On behalf of the \nfarmers in my State and throughout the country I supported this \namendment which would have provided additional economic assistance to \nproducers who continue to face depressed commodity prices and increased \nfuel and energy costs. Last year, Congress provided a total of \napproximately $30 billion in total farm spending. Nearly $11 billion of \nthe $30 billion total either carried an emergency designation or was in \naddition to the spending set forth in the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act. \nWithout these additional funds, we would have witnessed greater numbers \nof bankruptcies and foreclosures across rural America. We would have \nwitnessed greater economic tragedy in a rural economy that has already \nsuffered too much loss.\n  The Johnson amendment would have provided $9 billion this year, and \nsimilar levels of funding in future years, to continue to meet the real \nneeds of a struggling agricultural sector. Unfortunately, a slim \nmajority of the Senate rejected the amendment choosing to protect a \nmassive $1.6 trillion tax rather than provide adequate assistance for \nrural America.\n  I have heard from producers throughout Wisconsin on the difficulties \nfacing the agriculture industry, and more specifically the dairy \nindustry. In dairy, milk prices have hovered around record low levels, \nas we continue to lose our producers at an alarming rate. We also \ncontinue to see dramatic increases in imports of the milk protein \nconcentrates that displace milk produced by American farmers. Last \nyear, Congress approved $667 million in emergency, direct payments to \ndairy producers to help them remain in business. And a similar amount, \nor more, will be needed this year to counter what the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture predicts will be another year of low prices.\n  I agree with those in this body who complain that year after year of \nad hoc emergency agriculture spending is irresponsible and wasteful. I \nagree with the dairy farmers who would rather have a fair chance to \ncompete than a government handout. We need to re-write the farm bill in \na manner that provides adequate and market-oriented support to our \nfarmers and ranchers who continue to produce the safest and most \nabundant supply of food and fiber in the world. And in the context of \nthat re-write, the Agriculture Committee must enact a national dairy \nassistance program, a program that allows the competitive family farms \nof the Midwest to continue to produce and sell their quality product \nand to support their families, farms and communities with the proceeds.\n  The levels of spending for agriculture allowed in this budget, as \namended by Senator Grassley, are better than where we started: with no \nprovision for responding to the farm crisis this year. However, I am \nconcerned that even the increases now called for in the budget will not \nbe enough to meet the continuing and real needs of the farm economy. \nAnd I am equally concerned that, if the Appropriations Committee \nresponds to this shortfall with emergency spending, the White House \nwill not agree. In other words, the Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee, of which I am the ranking member, and of which my good \nfriend from Mississippi, Senator Cochran is the chairman, may not be \nable to keep the struggling agricultural sector from seeing a real cut \nin federal funds this year.\n  I hope that my concerns are misplaced. I hope commodity prices \nrebound, our farmers experience a good year, and our the Agriculture \nCommittee completes a farm bill that adequately supports rural America \nwith the limited resources provided in this budget. I look forward to \nworking toward that end, and hoping for that end, with Chairman Lugar \nand Ranking Member Harkin on the Senate Agriculture Committee and \nChairman Cochran and our other Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee \nmembers.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, as we consider the budget resolution for \nfiscal year 2002, I am offering an amendment to provide security for \nour Nation's farmers and rural communities.\n  I was disappointed earlier today when we considered the amendments on \nAgriculture spending.\n  Those of us from rural areas have always been able to put \npartisanship aside for one fundamental reason an overriding concern \nabout family farms and rural America. Yet, this institution approved an \namendment that provides less than half of the assistance that was \ndelivered to our farmers last year. Half!\n  I can't believe that my colleagues would kick the farmer when he's \ndown, but that is exactly what they have done by approving this \namendment. Crop prices are still at record lows while input costs, such \nas fertilizer and energy prices, are skyrocketing.\n  I don't understand how they can justify offering less assistance this \nyear. We have got to address the needs of our farmers today or we will \nbe importing our food from foreign countries tomorrow.\n  Twenty farm and commodity groups, as well as 32 conservation, \nreligious and environmental groups, have written to the Senate Budget \nCommittee asking for additional spending for agriculture programs. The \namount they request is the amount that I am seeking today, $9 billion \nfor emergency funds in 2001 and $12 billion per year for long term \nassistance.\n  These groups include the American Farm Bureau, the National Cotton \nCouncil, Defenders of Wildlife, The National Cattlemen's Beef \nAssociation, the National Milk Producers Federation, and the National \nFarmers Union, among many, many more.\n  This country needs a wake-up call! Americans believe that their \nbacon, lettuce and tomatoes are raised somewhere in the back of the \nlocal grocery store.\n  As the daughter of a seventh generation farm family in Helena, AR, I \nknow where our food supply is produced. It's grown in rural communities \nby families working from dawn until dusk to make ends meet.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues a letter that I received \nrecently from one of my constituents.\n  The letter reads:\n\n       My husband and I have one child. We farm 600 acres of rice \n     and soybeans. Three people, 600 acres--that should translate \n     into a very lucrative living, but it doesn't. For us, it\n\n[[Page S3371]]\n\n     translates into a financial struggle year after year. It \n     translates into a husband, the family provider, who has \n     become so frustrated and discouraged that he needs counseling \n     and medication for depression. It translates into a wife who \n     holds her breath every time the tractor breaks down for fear \n     there won't be enough money for repairs. It translates into a \n     child who is disappointed she can't participate in after-\n     school sports because extra trips to school means extra high-\n     priced gasoline for the car!\n       We, the American farm family, once felt pride in our \n     occupation. We had a sense of independence and self-\n     sufficiency. Each spring brought renewed hope for a \n     productive season and a bountiful harvest.\n       Now our hope lies with the bankers who make crop loans and \n     the government who issues supplemental income payments. And \n     there is no pride in having to ask for either one. But for \n     the sake of the families, the very foundation of the \n     agricultural industry, I ask that you give immediate, \n     deliberate attention to our crisis.\n\n  Unfortunately this letter is not unique. I have a stack of letters in \nmy office right now from hundreds of Arkansas farm families and they \nall share the same message--help us, please.\n  Unfortunately, too many in Washington continue to pay lip-service to \nour Nation's agricultural producers without actually providing them the \ntools and assistance they need to sustain their way of life.\n  Our agricultural communities are hurting. Commodity prices are at \nrecord lows, and input costs including fertilizer, energy, and fuel are \nat record highs.\n  No corporation in the world could make it today receiving the same \nprices it received during the Great Depression, yet, we are asking our \nfarmers to do just that.\n  The American farmer is the most efficient in the world. Yet they are \nforced to compete with farmers whose countries subsidize their cost of \nproduction.\n  The family I referenced earlier is not competing with their \nneighbors, or with farmers from across the river. They are competing \nwith farmers from the European Union, Japan, and Brazil, among others, \nwho annually prop their farmers up with subsidies that make the United \nState's support look like pocket change.\n  In recent years Congress has recognized that farmers are suffering \nand delivered emergency assistance to our struggling ag community.\n  Arkansas' farmers could not have survived without this help. Nearly \n40 percent of net farm income came from direct Government payments \nduring the 2000 crop year.\n  The trouble with this type of ad hoc approach is that farmers and \ncreditors across the country never really know how or when the \ngovernment is going to step in and help.\n  Many of my farmers are scared to death that the assistance they have \nreceived in the past will be absent this year because the tax cut and \nother spending programs have a higher priority.\n  This amendment will provide the security and certainty farmers need \nfor the future.\n  The Agriculture Committee needs this authority if we are going to \nadequately develop both a multi-year and multi-title farm bill.\n  Forcing Agriculture to compete with defense and other needs out of a \ncatch all ``contingency fund'' does not do our farm families justice.\n  They are the backbone of this Nation and they deserve better than \nthat.\n  What is it going to take to get America's attention on the plight of \nagriculture?\n  If we don't keep our domestic industry viable and in business, who \nwill grow our food?\n  Does this institution really want to rely on other countries for its \nfood supply? I, for one, do not.\n  What in the world would we do if we were relying on Europe for our \nbeef? Or China for our rice? How about South America for those \nvegetables in your baby's food?\n  If we can agree that domestic energy production is one key to our \neconomic independence and national security, then isn't domestic \nagricultural production at least as important?\n  This country needs to wake up and realize that we are producing the \nsafest, most affordable, and most abundant food supply in the world.\n  The question for everyone here is, are we going to do what it takes \nto keep this industry alive? I certainly hope so.\n  I encourage you to demonstrate your support for rural America by \nvoting with me to ensure that adequate funding will be available to \nwrite the next farm bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                February 21, 2001.\n     Hon. Pete Domenici,\n     Chairman, Senate Budget Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jim Nussle,\n     Chairman, House Budget Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Budget Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Spratt, Jr.,\n     Ranking Member, House Budget Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Gentlemen: Recently, you received a copy of a letter \n     we sent to the Chairmen of the Senate and House Agriculture \n     Committees requesting their help in providing significant \n     additional funding for agriculture over the next ten years. \n     Since that time, we have continued to monitor and evaluate \n     the pressing needs facing agriculture and write today to \n     share our further considerations and conclusions with you.\n       We wish to reiterate our strong belief that agriculture \n     will again need additional emergency assistance in FY2001. \n     While we seek passage of a new Farm Bill at the earliest \n     opportunity, it appears unlikely that a bill could be in \n     place in time to impact producer decision-making for the 2002 \n     crop year. If that is indeed the case, farmers and ranchers \n     will likely need emergency assistance in FY2002 as well.\n       Congress should approve $9 billion in emergency economic \n     assistance for FY2001 as soon as possible. Delaying this work \n     only harms those producers who are unable to obtain \n     production financing without at least some signal that \n     Congress will approve additional assistance.\n       In addition, we want to stress the importance of including \n     additional agricultural budget authority for each of the \n     years remaining in the Budget Resolution (FY2003-FY2011) to \n     avoid continued requests for ad hoc assistance packages.\n       We believe that Congress needs to consider at least $12 \n     billion per year in additional funding needs for each of the \n     remaining years of the Budget Resolution. Such a commitment \n     would provide the necessary funds to cover the options \n     currently being evaluated by the Senate and House Agriculture \n     Committees as essential elements of the new Farm Bill. These \n     include:\n       A fixed payment for program commodities (such as the \n     current AMTA and oilseed payments);\n       Rebalancing in the Marketing Assistance Loan program;\n       A counter-cyclical assistance program;\n       Export programs;\n       Conservation incentive programs;\n       Assistance to livestock and crop producers for compliance \n     with environmental and regulatory requirements;\n       Research; and\n       Assistance for non-program crop commodities.\n  We understand that this request entails a significant increase in \nspending on agricultural programs. However, we strongly believe that \nthis level of investment in agriculture is critical to both the short-\nterm and long-term health of American agriculture.\n           Sincerely,\n         Alabama Farmers Federation, American Farm Bureau \n           Federation, American Soybean Association, American \n           Sugar Alliance, National Association of Wheat Growers, \n           National Barley Growers Association, National \n           Cattlemen's Beef Association, National Corn Growers \n           Association, National Cotton Council, National Farmers \n           Union, National Milk Producers Federation, National \n           Pork Producers Council, National Sunflower Association, \n           National Turkey Federation, Southern Peanut Farmers \n           Federation, US Canola Association, US Rice Producers \n           Association, USA Dry Pea & Lentil Council, USA Rice \n           Federation, Wheat Export Trade Education Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              American Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 2001.\n     Hon. Blanche Lincoln,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: Thank you for offering an amendment \n     to the FY '02 Budget Resolution securing $9 billion for \n     emergency economic assistance for farmers and ranchers this \n     year, and providing for an additional $12 billion in each \n     year 2002-2011. The American Farm Bureau Federation supports \n     your proposal as a stand-alone amendment to Chairman \n     Domenici's budget resolution.\n       The current financial stress in U.S. agriculture is \n     extraordinary and conditions are not expected to appreciably \n     improve in the near future. The level of additional funding \n     provided by your amendment is the same level of additional \n     assistance the American Farm Bureau Federation Board of \n     Directors concluded would be adequate to allow the \n     Agriculture Committee to write multi-year, comprehensive farm \n     policy. Such additional\n\n[[Page S3372]]\n\n     funding is needed for future farm policy initiatives to \n     provide more certainty for farmers and ranchers rather than \n     year-by-year emergency ad hoc assistance.\n       Farmers and ranchers clearly prefer receiving their income \n     from the market. However, federal assistance will likely be \n     necessary until such time as market conditions improve.\n       Again, we appreciate your efforts, to secure additional \n     funding for agriculture.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bob Stallman,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If neither side yields time, time will be charged equally.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 27 seconds on the \namendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Five minutes. How much time do they have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 9 minutes 36 \nseconds on the amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator is going to use \nup some of his time. I would like to make a few remarks at the end.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, while we are waiting--we had a Senator \ncall and request time, so we will wait for that Senator. I hope to give \nher time. I see her entering the Chamber now.\n  Let me go back to the point I was making earlier because I think it \nis critically important for our colleagues to understand. I think \neverybody knows that this Senator is strongly supportive of additional \nresources for agriculture. We have an amendment that does that in a \nstraightforward way without taking money from trust funds, the Johnson \namendment.\n\n  The problem is the Grassley amendment we will vote on first, which \nprovides less of an increase in agriculture and does it in a way that \ninvades the trust fund of Medicare in the years 2005, 2006, 2007, and \n2008. I don't believe that is the way we want to fund additional \nresources for agriculture. That would be a serious mistake.\n  It is very clear. If one looks at the Republican budget and the \nGrassley prescription drug amendment that passed yesterday, and then \nthe Grassley agricultural amendment that is pending, and looks at the \nyear-by-year totals, one sees they are raiding and invading the \nMedicare trust fund in the year 2005 by $15 billion, they are raiding \nthe Medicare trust fund in the year 2006 by $13 billion, they are \nraiding the Medicare trust fund in the year 2007 by $10 billion, they \nare raiding the Medicare trust fund in the year 2008 by $4 billion. \nThat is a total of $42 billion taken out of the Medicare trust fund. I \ndon't think that is the way to fund agriculture or anything else. \nColleagues should be aware of what they are voting on and what the \neffect would be.\n  Mr. President, what is the time remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining is 6 minutes 57 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask the Senator from Michigan if she would like time.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time would the Senator like?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Five minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I appreciate the diligence of my \ndistinguished colleague from North Dakota and his effective advocacy \nand hard work on the budget resolution. We have people on both sides of \nthe aisle who are working hard to put together a vision and a framework \nfor the next year and beyond, up to 10 years, for our country--what are \nour values, what are our priorities.\n  Again, we have a discussion about our priorities for the country, and \nwe are focused on a very important part of our economy, an important \npart of the economy of Michigan. With my great State of Michigan, \neveryone thinks of automobiles. In fact, we have, in addition to a \nvibrant manufacturing economy, one of the strongest agricultural \neconomies in the United States and, in fact, in the world. Next to \nCalifornia, we produce more diverse crops than any other State in the \nUnion. We are very proud of that.\n  My concern is that in Michigan, as in all of our States, we are \nseeing farmers in great trouble. As I have been here only 4 years in \nthe House of Representatives on the Agriculture Committee and now in \nthe Senate on the Agriculture Committee, I hear from my family farmers, \nmy producers, about how they are working harder, they are producing \nmore, and their paycheck is less; their prices go down. Every year I \nhave been here, we have, in fact, passed an emergency supplemental to \nhelp our farmers.\n  My concern about this budget resolution is that we do not guarantee \nwe will build in the resources for the farm bill we are now working on \nin the Agriculture Committee and the needs of agriculture over the next \n10 years.\n  We have two approaches in front of us this morning. I am sure they \nare sincere approaches by colleagues. One I believe is the right \ndirection; one I believe is the wrong direction.\n\n  The right direction is the Johnson amendment that will guarantee we \nare putting aside dollars, $9 billion this year, in order to have an \nemergency response if we need it before the farm bill is in place, and \nthen $8 billion a year to guarantee we are addressing a wide variety of \nneeds, whether it is conservation, our crop insurance system, the \nspecialty crops in Michigan that are so important, that we need to \naddress in the farm bill. All the areas that need to be addressed in \nthe farm bill--rural development, research extension--are important \npriorities for the country.\n  We have a stake in making sure that agriculture is strong in our \ncountry. The only way to guarantee that is to pass the Johnson \namendment so we clearly state that agriculture is a part of the budget \nvision for the next 10 years.\n  My concern about the Grassley amendment, while I am sure it is well \nintended, is as we discussed last evening: By choosing to go again to \nthe contingency fund for any dollars being proposed, what we are doing \nis effectively raiding the Medicare trust fund. One of the priorities \nof the country, in addition to a tax cut, would be to make sure there \nis a small amount of dollars there, critical dollars, for our farmers, \nour agricultural producers, our ranchers across the country. The \nJohnson amendment will place agriculture as a priority.\n  Unfortunately, the Grassley amendment says we are going to dip into \nthe contingency fund. We heard about that yesterday, and we will hear \nabout it until this budget resolution passes. We will hear: Don't worry \nabout it; the contingency fund will take care of it. Don't worry about \nit; the contingency fund is there, rather than specifically laying out \nthe priorities of the country. When we look at what that contingency \nfund is, it is the Medicare trust fund.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Michigan has \nexpired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I urge adoption of the Johnson amendment and a ``no'' \nvote on the Grassley amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Time will be charged equally \nagainst both sides.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I apologize for the time that we didn't \nget into a quorum and were not doing any business. How much time do I \nhave remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 18 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will wrap up.\n  I thank Senator Grassley for taking the lead on this issue. Clearly, \nI thank Senator Zell Miller for being the prime cosponsor. For all \nthose in the Senate who want a practical, responsible addition to the \nfarm surplus, the farm program moneys over the next 10 years, this is \nthe right amendment.\n  Let me make sure everybody understands right off the bat there is one \nvery big distinction, and that is, once again, in order to spend more \non a program, the other side of the aisle would take it out of the $1.6 \ntrillion tax cut that is planned in this budget resolution. If we start \ndown that road for each major amendment, the way we fund it is to take \nmoney out of what the people were going to get in tax cuts, then Katie \nbar the door. Where do we end up? Enough said about that. That is a \nvery big difference. We do not take this money to pay for this program, \nthe Grassley-Miller amendment, out of the tax cuts that are going to \nthe American people.\n  Essentially this program will cost $59 billion over the decade, with \nabout $5\n\n[[Page S3373]]\n\nbillion of it going into this year and the balance going into the \nremaining 10 years. It sends the money to the function called \nagriculture, wherein it awaits a farm bill that has that much latitude \nwithout taking money from any other parts of the budget or becoming \nsubject to a point of order.\n  Is that enough? According to the experts we have who put this \ntogether, clearly if you are going to put together something practical, \npragmatic, not trying to get more than you need, not trying to push \nother things out but, rather, recognizing agriculture's appropriate \nplace among myriad very important programs, then this is a good \namendment.\n  Clearly, the $63.5 billion that is in this bill, including the first \nyear--the year we are in--you add it to the base in this budget and the \nsupports for agriculture amount to--let me repeat this number--$157 \nbillion. That is the kind of support that comes from distinguished \nSenators who know agriculture, such as Senator Grassley and Senator \nMiller.\n  You know, enough is enough. The other side would have us spend $97 \nbillion over that same period of time. I submit for all Senators to \nconsider, that is just more than enough. That is sort of asking all the \nrest of the American taxpayers and all of those expecting to get a tax \ncut--that is saying to them, all of your claims are second rate to an \nexorbitant agricultural bill. I say that because I depend upon people \nsuch as Chuck Grassley, from an agricultural State, still a farmer, who \nunderstands all of these issues intimately. He submits this measure to \nthe Senate as rational, reasonable, and enough money to be sent to the \nAgriculture Committee upon which a new agricultural bill can be drawn.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 37 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nHagel and Hutchinson be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBaucus and Senator Dayton be shown as cosponsors of the Johnson \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to enter into the Record letters \nfrom Senators requesting approximately $10 billion a year to be added \nover this 10-year period to the support for agriculture. This is a \nletter from 44 Senators, including 19 Republicans, asking for an amount \nof money--actually asking for somewhat more than is in the Johnson \namendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 30, 2001.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Domenici and Senator Conrad: We request that \n     at least $10 billion in emergency economic assistance for \n     agriculture for the 2001 crop year be included in the fiscal \n     year 2002 budget resolution. We also ask that the budget \n     resolution contain an increase in the annual baseline \n     spending for agriculture for subsequent crop years by at \n     least $12 billion over fiscal years 2002-2011.\n       Economic forecasts for agriculture remain bleak for the \n     2001 growing season and beyond due to the continuation of \n     collapsed commodity prices, while input costs--most notably \n     fuel and fertilizer--skyrocket. We believe that Congress must \n     continue to support agriculture in order to prevent massive \n     farm failures, which would cripple rural America's economy \n     and could further dampen the general economy. We cannot allow \n     this to happen, especially during this time of national \n     economic uncertainty.\n       As you know, the funds devoted to agriculture in the fiscal \n     year 1997 budget were cut substantially to help reduce our \n     nation's ballooning deficits. The farm bill enacted in 1996 \n     was therefore insufficient to fully address the last three \n     years of collapsed commodity prices and weather disasters. \n     Consequently, Congress has been forced to provide \n     approximately $25 billion in emergency aid to Agriculture \n     since 1998.\n       We believe the budget resolution must allocate a level of \n     funding adequate for Congress to write a new farm bill that \n     meets the needs of farmers and insures the future of our \n     rural communities. Producers should not be held hostage to \n     the unpredictability of politics and annual ad hoc payments.\n       Finally, we wish to go on record as supporting the position \n     already taken by our colleagues--Senators Cochran, \n     Hutchinson, Breaux, Landrieu, Bond, Sessions, Lincoln, \n     Shelby, Bunning, Helms, McConnell, Craig, Cleland, Inhofe, \n     Thurmond, Fitzgerald, Miller, Frist, Thomas, Hutchison and \n     Hagel--on this issue in their letter dated March 13, 2001.\n       We thank you for your attention to this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n         Byron Dorgan, Conrad Burns, Tom Daschle, Mike Enzi, Tom \n           Harkin, E. Ben Nelson, John Edwards, Dick Durbin, Mark \n           Dayton, Max Baucus, Jay Rockefeller IV, Tim Johnson, \n           Carl Levin, Patty Murray, Patrick Leahy, Debbie \n           Stabenow, Maria Cantwell, Ron Wyden, Herb Kohl, Jean \n           Carnahan, Evan Bayh.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I also ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed \nin the Record. It is a request to Senator Domenici from Southern \nSenators, Republicans and Democrats, for an amount of money that is \nactually in the Johnson amendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2001.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Pete: We are writing to request your assistance in \n     including appropriate language in the FY02 budget resolution \n     so that emergency economic loss assistance can be made \n     available for 2001 and 2002 or until a replacement for the \n     1996 Farm Bill can be enacted. Specifically, since conditions \n     are not appreciably improved for 2001, we support making \n     market loss assistance available so that the total amount of \n     assistance available through the 2001 Agricultural Market \n     Transition Act payment and the Market Loss Assistance \n     payments will be the same as was available for the 2000 crop. \n     We understand it is unusual to ask that funds to be made \n     available in the current fiscal year be provided in a budget \n     resolution covering the next fiscal year, but the financial \n     stress in U.S. agriculture is extraordinary.\n       According to USDA and other prominent agriculture \n     economists, the U.S. agricultural economy continues to face \n     persistent low prices and depressed farm income. According to \n     testimony presented by USDA on February 14, 2001, ``a strong \n     rebound in farm prices and income from the market place for \n     major crops appears unlikely .  .  . assuming no supplemental \n     assistance, net cash farm income in 2001 is projected to be \n     the lowest level since 1994and about $4 billion below the \n     average of the 1990's.'' The USDA statement also said .  .  . \n     ``(a) national farm financial crisis has not occurred in \n     large part due to record government payments and greater off-\n     farm income.''\n       In addition to sluggish demand and chronically low prices, \n     U.S. farmers and ranchers are experiencing rapidly increasing \n     input costs including fuel, fertilizer and interest rates. \n     According to USDA, ``increases in petroleum prices and \n     interest rates along with higher prices for other inputs, \n     including hired labor increased farmers' production expenses \n     by 4 percent of $7.6 billion in 2000, and for 2001 cash \n     production expenses are forecast to increase further. At the \n     same time, major crop prices for the 2000-01 season are \n     expected to register only modest improvement from last year's \n     15-25 year lows, reflecting another year of large global \n     production of major crops and ample stocks.''\n       During the last 3 years, Congress has provided significant \n     levels of emergency economic assistance through so-called \n     Market Loss Assistance payments and disaster assistance for \n     weather related losses. During the last three years, the \n     Commodity Credit Corporation has provided about $72 billion \n     in economic and weather related loss assistance and \n     conservation payments. The Congressional Budget Office and \n     USDA project that expenditures for 2001 will be $14-17 \n     billion without additional market or weather loss assistance. \n     With projections that farm income will not improve in the \n     near future, we believe it is vitally important to provide at \n     least as much total economic assistance for 2001 and 2002 as \n     was provided for the 2000 crop.\n       Congress has begun to evaluate replacement farm policy. In \n     order to provide effective, predictable financial support \n     which also allows farmers and ranchers to be competitive, \n     sufficient funding will be needed to allow the Agriculture \n     Committee to ultimately develop a comprehensive package \n     covering major commodities in addition to livestock and \n     specialty crops, rural development, trade, and conservation \n     initiatives. Until new legislation can be enacted, it is \n     essential that Congress provide emergency economic assistance \n     necessary to alleviate the current financial crisis.\n       We realize these recommendations add significantly to \n     projected outlays for farm programs. Our farmers and ranchers \n     clearly prefer receiving their income from the market. \n     However, while they strive to further reduce costs and expand \n     markets, federal assistance will be necessary until \n     conditions improve.\n\n[[Page S3374]]\n\n       We appreciate your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n         Thad Cochran, John Breaux, Tim Hutchinson, Mary Landrieu, \n           Kit Bond, Jeff Sessions, Blanche Lincoln, Richard \n           Shelby, Jim Bunning, Jesse Helms, Mitch McConnell, \n           Larry Craig, Max Cleland, James Inhofe, Strom Thurmond, \n           Peter Fitzgerald, Zell Miller, Bill Frist, Craig \n           Thomas, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Chuck Hagel.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a letter from Senator Crapo asking for an amount of money \nactually somewhat more than is in the Johnson amendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 28, 2001.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: I write to request your assistance in \n     including flexibility in the Fiscal Year 2002 budget \n     resolution to address the needs of America's agricultural \n     community. The budget resolution should provide for emergency \n     economic assistance for agricultural producers until the next \n     farm bill can be enacted. Additionally, adequate baseline \n     funding for agriculture needs is vital.\n       The U.S. agricultural economy continues to face persistent \n     low prices and low farm income. A rebound is unlikely in the \n     near future. In fact, U.S. net farm income is expected to \n     drop 9 percent in 2001. Recognizing the importance of a safe, \n     affordable, and abundant domestic food supply. Congress has \n     provided producers with supplemental farm assistance for the \n     last three years. This assistance has been vital to operator \n     viability. Although our farmers and ranchers would prefer to \n     receive their income from the market, they are facing \n     desperate times. While they work to reduce costs and expand \n     markets, we must do what we can to assist them. Supplemental \n     support should continue until Congress enacts a new farm bill \n     and flexibility to provide this funding should be included in \n     the budget resolution.\n       As a new farm bill is developed, it is also important that \n     we increase the baseline for agriculture related budget \n     functions. In addition to the demands of the commodity \n     programs, current funding levels do not reflect the growing \n     need for increased market access, conservation, research, and \n     rural development funding.\n       In a global economy, agricultural profitability is tied to \n     foreign markets. Trade is critical to the future of \n     agriculture. It must be free and fair, unfortunately, at this \n     time we have neither. Increases in the budget will allow for \n     additional funding for market access programs, while barriers \n     are reduced and inequities addressed.\n       America's farmers are working to meet increasing \n     environmental regulations and reach their own stewardship \n     goals. It is important that we provide them with funding to \n     meet the demand for clean air and water, wildlife habitat, \n     and open spaces. Increasing the natural resources and \n     environment baseline will provide producers the technical and \n     financial assistance necessary to allow them to succeed and \n     remain good stewards of the environment.\n       Increasing the agricultural baseline will also allow us to \n     support important research efforts. America's farmers and \n     ranchers are the most efficient in the world. Agricultural \n     research is vital to maintaining and building upon \n     efficiencies, improving profitability, protecting the \n     environment, developing new markets and uses, and \n     addressing emerging issues.\n       The rural development programs administered through the \n     U.S. Department of Agriculture are also important. Rural \n     economic development programs are increasingly valued in \n     rural America. In light of a distressed agricultural economy \n     and declining resource industries, these programs are \n     urgently needed. Additionally, infrastructure needs in rural \n     areas are high and increasing federal mandates add to these \n     costs. Rural development programs are helpful to rural \n     communities trying to comply with the disproportionate costs \n     of federal mandates.\n       Adequate steps should be taken to ensure these essential \n     programs are funded. I am confident that the budget \n     resolution can provide flexibility for emergency economic \n     assistance and increase baselines in a fiscally-responsible \n     manner. Please rest assured that I remain committed to a \n     balanced budget and will work with the Committee to \n     prioritize competing needs.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Mike Crapo,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the question of the amount of money is \nguided by what our competitors are doing. The Europeans, who are our \nmajor competitors, are outspending us by a very wide margin. The amount \nof money in the Johnson amendment is intended to approach what our \nmajor competitors are doing. It doesn't equal them, but it is to at \nleast give our farmers a fair, fighting chance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes of the remaining time \nto Senator Gramm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank Senator Domenici for yielding.\n  Let me first say to my colleagues that I have concerns with both of \nthese amendments. We should wait until the new farm bill is written \nbefore budgeting money to spend on agricultural programs over the next \n10 years.\n  Our colleague from North Dakota talks about how much the Europeans \nspend subsidizing production and exports and then holds that out as a \nstandard for something we should be doing. His argument basically is to \nimitate the worst, most inefficient farm program in the history of the \nworld--a program that would make a commissar from the old Soviet Union \nhave an uneasy stomach.\n  I am going to vote for the Grassley-Miller amendment for a very \nsimple reason; that is, it provides funds in the budget for this year \nand sets out an expectation of funding over the next ten years, while \nallowing us to write a farm bill and determine what is really needed in \norder for rural America to prosper. Of the two approaches, the \nGrassley-Miller amendment is by far the more rational option.\n  The alternative that is presented by Senators Johnson and Conrad \nwould simply create a $97 billion entitlement, put on automatic pilot, \nmassive government spending, when we haven't even written a new farm \nbill. No logic whatsoever exists to support such an amendment.\n  The only purpose of the amendment is to take $97 billion away from \nthe tax cut. So what this amendment really does is reduce the tax cut, \nwhich means either we aren't going to repeal the death tax, or we are \nnot going to repeal the marriage penalty, or we are not going to double \nthe child credit exemption, or we are not going to reduce rates. \nInstead, this amendment takes $97 billion away from the tax cut and \ncreates an entitlement before we have even written a farm bill.\n\n  So this may be disguised as an agricultural amendment, but this is \nreally an amendment to reduce the tax cut.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote for the Grassley-Miller amendment. It \nsets out funding for this year, to address real problems in \nagriculture, it provides a projected level of funding for the next 10 \nyears, and it allows us to write a new farm bill.\n  How are we going to write a rational farm bill if we have already \ncommitted to an entitlement of almost $100 billion? Does that make any \nsense whatsoever? The answer is no. The Johnson-Conrad amendment should \nbe rejected.\n  I urge my colleagues, especially those who are inclined to vote \nagainst both amendments to support the Grassley-Miller amendment--life \nis about choices, and we have a very big evil here in the Johnson-\nConrad amendment. I suggest we go with the Grassley-Miller alternative \nin order to provide funding that we know we are going to need this year \nto address current problems in agriculture--it would be better to do it \nthrough the normal process under an emergency designation, but that is \nnot the choice. Then we can write a farm bill, and, having a farm bill \nbefore us, we can make a rational decision about how much money we need \nfor the future. It may be less than $97 billion; it may be more than \n$97 billion. But the idea of committing money in the year 2001 in an \nentitlement, when we have not even written a farm bill, really insults \nour intelligence.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Grassley-Miller amendment and to \nvote against the Johnson-Conrad amendment. I think this is an important \nissue. If we adopt the Johnson-Conrad amendment, we are going to set a \nprecedent that indicates we are not necessarily interested in farm \npolicy, we are just interested in a bid to reduce the tax cut in order \nto fund a program which has yet to be devised.\n  So I want everybody to remember, if you vote for the Johnson \namendment, you are taking money out of repealing the marriage penalty, \nor doubling the dependent exemption for children, or repealing the \ndeath tax, or reducing\n\n[[Page S3375]]\n\nrates. It has to come from somewhere. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Grassley-Miller amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes \nevenly divided before vote on the Grassley amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas makes a very \ninteresting proposition. He said write a new farm bill and then decide \non the budget.\n  That has it exactly backwards. That is not how we do business. We \ndecide on a budget; then we write a farm program.\n  I also remind my colleagues that the amount of money being sought in \nthe Johnson amendment is the amount of money we have had each of the \nlast 3 years to cope with this farm crisis--the lowest prices in 75 \nyears. That is the basis of the calculation of the need.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Iowa restricts us to far less than \nwe have had each of the last 3 years to meet this farm crisis. It is \nalso true that our major competitors are outspending us 10 to 1 in \nsupport for their producers and are outspending us 30 to 1 in export \nassistance. It is no wonder our farmers do not have a level playing \nfield.\n  Finally, the Grassley amendment raids the Medicare trust fund to \nsupport the additional resources for agriculture. That is a mistake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, 1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, frankly, I do not have a lot more to \nsay. It seems as if we are adopting a policy of, if we have any time, \nwe ought to use it, so I am going to use it.\n  I remind everyone, if they want a farm bill that adds substantial \nmoney to the program over the next decade, it is my recommendation they \nvote for the first amendment, the one Senator Grassley has put together \nwith Zell Miller. If my colleagues do not, we will have no agricultural \nbill, it seems to me, looking at how things are.\n  For those who do not want to vote for the Grassley-Miller amendment \nand hold out, just remember: You may get no agricultural bill if you do \nthat. The better approach is in the Grassley amendment. I believe it is \nfair; it is reasonable; it is rational. And clearly a new farm bill \nbuilt around these numbers might, indeed, pass the Congress. If my \ncolleagues think they are going to pass one with much more than that, \nthey are just dreaming. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 176\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 2 minutes of debate prior to the vote on or in relation to \nthe Johnson amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time was consumed on the last vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Fifty minutes. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we have just passed, after a 50-minute vote, a measure \nthat raids the Medicare trust fund in the years 2005, 2006, 2007, and \n2008 to the tune of $42 billion. That is what the amendment just passed \ndoes. It raids the Medicare trust fund in each and every one of those \nyears to supply more resources to agriculture.\n  This amendment provides additional resources to agriculture, but it \ndoes it the right way. It doesn't touch any of the trust funds. It \ndoesn't touch the Social Security trust fund. It does not touch the \nMedicare trust fund. It funds the money out of the tax cut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank all Senators who supported the \nGrassley amendment.\n  Now we consider another amendment. For those who are worried about \nhow much we are going to spend on agriculture, this amendment would \nincrease the spending on agriculture to a total of $98 billion, all of \nwhich will come out of the taxes we intend to give back to the American \npeople.\n  We have done the numbers. We don't touch the Medicare trust fund. I \nwill give Senators the numbers. The total contingency fund is 845. Take \noff the Medicare trust fund, you have 453 left. Of that, the Grassley \namendment uses $59 billion. We don't touch Medicare in any year, nor do \nwe touch it over the 10 years. Actually, I believe we have done the \nright thing.\n  We ought to turn this amendment down. We have had a good vote. We \nought to leave it as a good vote and make sure that what is passed is \nwhat we do for agriculture. Mr. Grassley, who knows more than the \naverage Senator, put this together with the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia. They worked hard on it. It is a good amendment. Thanks for \nadopting it.\n  Don't undo what you did by voting for the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n176.\n  Mr. GREGG.

I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will shortly send an amendment to the \ndesk that deals with education, which I think should be the No. 1 \npriority of this Congress. Quite frankly, the President has said it \nshould be our No. 1 priority. The American people think it should be \nour No. 1 priority. Yet in the budget before the Senate, education is \nsomewhere down towards the bottom. This amendment I will shortly send \nto the desk will move it up to the top tier.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does not the Senator believe that the administration's \nforemost priority is a $1.6 billion tax cut?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will show that shortly on my charts.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will absolutely show that is their top priority.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am waiting with bated breath.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate Senator Byrd bringing that up.\n  Our country was founded on an ideal that no matter who you are or the \ncircumstances of your birth, no matter how much money your parents have \nor don't have, if you are willing to work hard, study, and get a good \neducation, you can be a success. This is the American dream.\n  Unfortunately, the dream is slipping away. It is slipping because our \nclassrooms are overcrowded, our schools are crumbling, and our students \ndon't have the educational tools from preschool to college they need to \nlearn. For years we have been nibbling around the edges for a solution; \nwe tweak a program here, tweak another program there, but we have not \nmade a real dent in education reform.\n  The fact is, now only 2 cents of every $1 is invested in education. \nThat is not enough. Ask the constituents in Montana or Iowa, in any \ntown meeting: Of every Federal dollar we spend, how much goes for \neducation? Ask your constituents. I have gotten answers from 25 cents \nto 10 cents to 12 cents to 8 cents. I have never gotten the right \nanswer, which is 2 cents. Two cents out of every Federal dollar that we \nspend goes to education. That just is not enough. It shows that \neducation is not a top priority.\n  In this new century, we need a new plan for American education, a \nbold, daring plan to demand true accountability from our schools but \nalso to provide the resources they need to meet the standards and to be \nheld accountable. It is one thing to say you will hold the schools \naccountable but then you will not give them the resources. As my \ncolleague and my chief cosponsor, Senator Wellstone, has said many \ntimes, you are setting them up for failure when you do that. If you \nwant schools to be accountable--and we all do--we have to get them the \nresources they need.\n  We need to use our budget surpluses to prepare for the future by \npaying down the debt and investing in education. That is why, along \nwith the many other Senators, I am proposing a plan to truly leave no \nchild behind. Cosponsors of this amendment are Senators Wellstone, \nKennedy, Murray, Bingaman, Clinton, Dayton, Rockefeller, Corzine, \nMikulski, Reed of Rhode Island, Reid of Nevada, Sarbanes, Kerry, \nLandrieu, and Daschle.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about the importance of education. We \nhave heard it from our President, President Bush. He said: ``My \nadministration has no greater priority than education.'' That was \nduring the swearing-in ceremony for Dr. Paige as the new Secretary of \nEducation. I was there. I heard him say that. He also said: ``It's \nimportant for us to have the national goal of every child being \neducated in the best public school system possible on the face of \nEarth.'' That was President Bush on CNN Columbus, OH, February 20.\n  The President said there is no greater priority than education. Let's \ncheck the facts and look at the President's budget priorities about \nwhich Senator Byrd just spoke. Now we see reality versus rhetoric. The \nPresident said he wants to leave no child behind; he wants education to \nbe the No. 1 priority; he wants our kids educated in the best public \nschool system possible on the face of the Earth.\n  And here is the budget. The Bush tax cut for the wealthiest 1 \npercent, over 10 years, is $697 billion. Keep in mind this is for the \nwealthiest 1 percent. Bush's education plan is $21.3 billion over 10 \nyears. What are the priorities? A tax cut for the wealthiest, $697 \nbillion; education, $21.3 billion. The President's entire budget \ndevotes $1.6 trillion of the surplus to tax cuts. Only $21.3 billion is \nfor education. The tax cut that the President is proposing is 76 times \ngreater than the investments he would provide for education. These are \nthe wrong priorities. It is time to put the priorities right.\n  Our amendment will truly leave no child behind. The education plan we \nare sending to the desk in this amendment provides $250 billion in \neducation over the next 10 years; the President's plan is $21.3 \nbillion. Our investment is 12 times that proposed by the President but \nabout one-third of what he wants to give in tax breaks to the \nwealthiest 1 percent of Americans. Let me repeat that: Our investment \nin this plan is about 12 times what the President wants to put in \neducation over the next 10 years: $250 billion in our plan, $21.3 \nbillion in the Bush plan. The $250 billion we have in our plan is still \nabout one-third as much as the President wants to give to the \nwealthiest 1 percent of Americans. So our priorities are to put the \nmoney in education and not in tax breaks for the wealthiest.\n\n  This amendment will put the resources in place so we truly can hold \nschools and teachers accountable. We meet the following five goals by \nthe end of this decade. The first goal is all children will start \nschool ready to learn. If that sounds familiar, that is because that \nwas the first goal set up by the Governors Commission which was headed \nby a Republican Governor, I might say, 11 years ago. So that ought to \nbe the first national goal in education, to have all children ready and \nable to learn.\n  We know that a child who participates in Head Start is more likely to \ngraduate from high school and less likely to end up in jail or on \nwelfare. However, less than 70 percent of children eligible for Head \nStart are receiving it. Our amendment would fully fund the Head Start \nProgram so every eligible 3- and 4-year-old child will get the services \nthey need so they can start school ready to learn.\n  No. 2, all students will be educated by a highly qualified teacher in \na classroom that is not overcrowded. Project STAR studied 7,000 \nstudents in 80 schools in Tennessee. They found students in smaller \nclasses performed better. We know that. But now we have the data to \nshow it. These students were less likely to drop out of high schools, \nmore likely to graduate in the top 25 percent of their classes. Our \namendment increases our investment in the Class Size Reduction Program \nto meet our goal of hiring 100,000 extra teachers in 2005, and to \nreduce class sizes in grades 1 through 3 to no more than 18 children.\n  Our amendment would also provide a fourfold increase in professional \ndevelopment to provide our teachers with the opportunity to acquire the \nknowledge and skills they need. We hear a lot of talk about improving \nreading skills. If you want to improve reading skills, get smaller \nclass sizes so the teachers can work with the students.\n  I yield what time he may want to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his \ncourtesy. I appreciate it.\n  The Senator from Iowa has laid out some figures. I am going to try to \ndo this a different way.\n  This is called the leave-no-child-behind amendment. I had a chance to \nvisit with some students from St. Cloud, MN. Right now there are not \nmany Senators in the Chamber, so we are just laying out the amendment. \nThere will be plenty of debate about this because there comes a point \nin time where you have to back up your words with the resources.\n\n[[Page S3377]]\n\n  I say to the Senator from Iowa, I am very proud to introduce this \namendment with him and to be a chief cosponsor of this amendment. For \nme, this is what this debate is all about. This is a values question.\n  I have said it on the floor before, and I am going to say it one more \ntime. When the Senator from Iowa talked about Head Start, making sure \nthat children are kindergarten ready, he made the point that kids who \nare kindergarten ready are less likely to be behind and less likely to \nfall behind in school and are also less likely to get in trouble.\n  I enjoy saying this. The truth is we should help these little kids--\nnot just because if we help them when they are little, they are more \nlikely to do well in school or less likely to be in trouble or more \nlikely to go on to college--we should help these little kids at the \nHead Start level because they are all under 4 feet tall and they are \nall beautiful and we should be nice to them. Nothing else needs to be \nsaid.\n  My God, what are we going to do? Are we going to put our resources \ninto Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax cuts? Paul Krugman had a piece today in \nthe New York Times where he said, actually, when you figure this out, \nover 50 percent of these tax cut benefits are going to go to the top 1 \npercent of the population.\n  Senators, do you want to vote for a tax cut heavily weighted to the \ntop 1 percent of the population or do you want to vote for this \namendment which really is about making sure we leave no child behind? \nWhat do we do? We are talking about $200 billion that goes to debt \nreduction and $250 billion that goes to education, as we look over the \nnext 10 years, which means what? It means we get to the point of fully \nfunding the IDEA program for kids with special needs.\n  At every school I visit in Minnesota, everybody I meet tells me: \nListen, if you would just provide the funding for the IDEA program, it \nwould help us out so much in our own finances.\n  I offered an amendment with Senator Harkin last year to fully fund \nthe IDEA program. We got 40 votes. Now is the time to step up to the \nplate. Make sure the kids are kindergarten ready, fully fund the Head \nStart Program--although, I say to my colleagues, really in the best of \nall worlds I would like for us to consider not just the 3- and 4-year-\nolds; I would like for us to consider the 1-year-olds and the 2-year-\nolds and the Early Head Start Program.\n  We are talking about afterschool programs. We are talking about \nteacher training. We are talking about how to recruit the best people \ninto teaching. We are talking about how to make sure higher education \nis more affordable. We are talking about dramatically expanding the \nfunding for the Pell Grant Program.\n  Senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, I think in this budget \ndebate this is going to be the litmus test vote. I said it before. I \nwill say it again on the floor. When President Bush, in his inaugural \nspeech, talked about leaving no child behind, I was moved. This is my \npassion: children, young people, education. I thought those were \nbeautiful words.\n\n  The fact is, look at these tax cuts. Let me repeat this one more \ntime. One-third of the children in America live in homes that do not \nget one penny from these tax cuts; one-half of African American \nchildren live in homes that do not get one cent from these tax cuts; \nand 57 percent of Hispanic children live in homes that will not receive \none cent from these tax cuts.\n  When are we going to make the investment in education? In children? \nWhen are we going to make sure we live up to our words?\n  I am looking at this budget in a broad outline. Next week we are \ngoing to see the specifics. When we see the specifics, let me tell you \npeople in Minnesota and people around the country are going to hold all \nof us accountable. We already know this much. We now know that there \nare going to be cuts--cuts in child care programs, the CCDBG program, \nwhen only 12 percent of low-income families, much less middle-income \nfamilies, can afford child care and get any assistance.\n  There are going to be cuts in programs for prevention of child abuse. \nThere are going to be cuts in the training for doctors in our \nchildren's hospitals where there are some of the most sick and \nvulnerable children.\n  I ask you, President of the United States of America, President Bush: \nHow do you realize the goal of leaving no child behind when you cut \nthese programs? You cannot realize the goal of leaving no child behind \non a tin-cup education budget: $23 billion versus $250 billion that \nSenator Harkin and I have brought to the floor of the Senate.\n  I want to make another point because I think this is the vote. This \nis the vote when it comes to what our priorities are. As we do the \nspeaking on the floor of the Senate, as we do the talking, there are \nentirely too many children who are not able to get the help they need \nwhen they are little and they come to kindergarten way behind.\n  There are many college students I meet in Minnesota who are \nstruggling. Many of them are at the community colleges. Many of them \nare in their forties and fifties. They have gone back to school. Many \nof them are women. They have children. They have jobs, and they are \ngoing to school.\n  Do you want to know something? We are not going to be expanding the \nPell Grant Program anywhere near enough to make sure they can get \nhigher education. That is the best bang for the buck. But instead we \nare giving tax cuts to the top 1 percent of the population.\n  As we speak on the floor of the Senate, and as we debate this \namendment, there are entirely too many teachers who are working under \nreally difficult circumstances who do not have up-to-date textbooks, do \nnot have the technology we need, are underpaid; and without the \nresources, many men and women aren't going into teaching any longer.\n  When are we going to get real?\n  I like this amendment because this leave-no-child-behind amendment \ndefines education, not K through 12, but prekindergarten all the way \nthrough age 65.\n  Right now, the report on most of the kids who are in child care is \nthat it is inadequate and too dangerous. We are talking about a real \ninvestment here.\n  We have had all of these studies, all of these books, and all of \nthese conferences about the development of the brain. When are we going \nto get serious about investing in early childhood development?\n  The taconite workers on the iron range, and a whole lot of other \npeople from farm country in Minnesota where we have a price crisis, and \nfamily farmers who don't get a decent price--many of them are being \ndriven off their farms. Many of them will have to go back to work. Many \nof them will not go back to work but are going to have to go back to \nschool. Many of them are going to go to our community colleges.\n  Where is the Pell grant assistance? Can't we expand the Pell Grant \nProgram? Can't we expand the Head Start Program? Can't we make the \ncommitment to school modernization? Can't we try to reduce class size? \nCan't we do better for teacher training?\n  Any day of the year, I say to my good friend, including the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, I want to say to people in Minnesota in any coffee \nshop anywhere, that I would far prefer to put much more money into \nchildren and education--the IDEA program, title I, the afterschool \nprogram, Head Start--than Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax cuts where everyone \nhere knows that the vast percentage of the benefits go to the very top \n1 percent, the wealthiest and highest income citizens. This is all a \nmatter of priorities and values.\n  It is time to step up to the plate, and it is time to cast a vote. \nThis amendment Senator Harkin has brought to the floor and on which \nother Senators will be speaking--and if I had to be a primary cosponsor \nof one amendment in this budget debate, this would be the amendment. \nBasically, it says it is time to get beyond symbolic politics, it is \ntime to get beyond the speeches, and if we say that we all love the \nchildren, and we are all for education, and young people are our \nfuture, then we ought to be making the investment in their skills, in \ntheir intellect, and in their health and character. That is what this \nleave-no-child-behind amendment is all about.\n  With all due respect, one more time, you cannot realize the goal of \nleaving no child behind on a tin-cup budget. Our amendment which calls \nfor an investment of $250 billion is one-third of\n\n[[Page S3378]]\n\nwhat goes in these tax cuts to the top 1 percent of the population.\n\n  Our amendment, which calls for a dramatic investment in the health, \nskills, character, and education of children--of young people, and, for \nthat matter, older people--who are going back to school, is one-third \nof the tax cuts of the Bush plan that go to the top 1 percent of the \npopulation. In the President's plan, it is $23 billion. In this plan, \nit is $250 billion.\n  I say on the floor of the Senate directly to the people of Minnesota \nthat I am up for reelection, and to me this is what the election is all \nabout. This is what the election is all about. I am for tax cuts that \nleave some standard of tax fairness. I am for making sure that working \npeople and that low- and moderate-income people get some assistance and \nbenefits. I am for making sure they get that. They will spend it, and \nit will serve as an economic stimulus. Lots of families will also \nbenefit if you make the tax cut refundable.\n  But I also believe that far more important than Robin-Hood-in-reverse \ntax cuts, with most all of them going to the top 1 percent of the \npopulation, would be to make this investment in children and make this \ninvestment in education.\n  It is a question of priorities. I come down on the side of education. \nI come down on the side of children. I come down on the side of hard-\nworking people who are going back to school and trying to rebuild their \nlives. I come down on the side of taconite workers on the iron range. I \ncome down on the side of family farmers. I come down on the side of \nordinary people. I come down on the side of people who believe that \neducation is the foundation of opportunity in America. I come down on \nthe side of this amendment. We should get 100 votes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the \namendment and on the resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has not yet been offered. On the \nresolution, there are approximately 16 hours for each side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that it \nbe charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask the Senator from Washington if she is seeking time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am. How much time may I have?\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time would the Senator like?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Between 3 and 10 minutes, whatever you can give me.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Washington. We \nwill take that off the resolution since the amendment is not yet \npending. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So we will take 10 minutes off the resolution for the \nSenator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe Harkin-Kennedy-Murray amendment which I understand will be offered \nshortly. That amendment is going to provide the kind of investment that \nwe need to make if we truly want to leave no child behind. It is a \nnoble goal, and it is one that all of us should endorse. I am glad \nPresident Bush has focused on it.\n  Unfortunately, President Bush's budget that is before us today \nsquanders this opportunity to ensure no child is left behind in favor \nof an irresponsible tax cut. Putting America's future first means \nputting our children first. But the sad truth is, this budget \nshortchanges America's students. This budget focuses on tax cuts for \nthe few, at the expense of our children's education. We cannot ask \nAmerica's students to wait in line behind a few wealthy Americans for \nthe support they need to succeed.\n  I have come to the floor to support the amendment that will be \noffered today to ensure that all students get the educational resources \nthey deserve. The Republicans are claiming that they provide a \nsignificant increase for education funding. I have to tell you, in \nlooking at this budget, I am unable to find that ``significant'' \nincrease. Instead, it is clear to me that this budget jeopardizes our \nability to maintain critical priorities like education.\n  Under this budget, the actual amount of funds available for schools, \ncolleges, and students will only increase by about $2.5 billion, which \nis 5.9 percent. That is less than half of the average yearly increase \nCongress has provided in each of the last 5 years.\n  At a time when we are--and should be--demanding more than ever from \nour schools, we must now slow down the Federal investment in our \nschools, we must not go back on our commitment to help reduce class \nsizes, we must not do away with support for emergency repairs and \nrenovations, and we must not continue to shirk our responsibility to \ndisadvantaged students and to students with disabilities.\n  Setting a high bar is important, but setting a high bar and failing \nto give kids the resources to succeed is just setting them up for \nfailure. I want to take a moment to highlight some of the ways I \nbelieve this budget fails our country.\n  Across our country, parents are asking us to reduce overcrowding in \nclassrooms. They know this is a critical step in ensuring every child \nlearns the basics in a disciplined environment. This Republican budget \nfreezes our class size progress. Teachers are asking for more help \nmastering the best ways to teach our children. They know they cannot \nrely on skills they learned 10, 20, or 30 years ago. This Republican \nbudget freezes our progress in improving teacher quality.\n  Students are asking for schools where they can feel safe and secure. \nCertainly we have an obligation to provide that. But this Republican \nbudget freezes our school safety progress.\n  Parents are asking for afterschool programs so their children won't \nget into trouble or become victims of violence after the school bell \nrings. This Republican budget freezes afterschool programs.\n  Teachers and students are asking for school buildings that are \nmodern, are up to code, and provide a safe and healthy learning \nenvironment. This Republican budget freezes our ability to help \ncommunities modernize their aging schools.\n  The American people are asking for a stronger commitment to the \nthings that make a difference in children's education, and the \nRepublicans are so busy trying to fund an irresponsible tax cut that \nthey aren't listening.\n  This budget freezes our progress. That is why we will offer this \namendment later. It will provide the resources parents, teachers, and \nstudents are asking for.\n  It will ensure more children start school ready to learn, that we \ncontinue our bipartisan initiative to improve student achievement and \nteaching by hiring 100,000 fully qualified teachers to reduce the \naverage size of classes in the early grades. It will provide critical \nassistance for emergency school repairs and renovation, and will help \nour local districts ensure there is a high quality teacher in every \nclassroom. It will meet our obligations to children with disabilities \nand disadvantaged students, and will allow communities to offer more \nafterschool programs to keep our children safe and learning. It will \nalso help more Americans afford college.\n  To justify an irresponsible tax cut, the President keeps talking \nabout an enormous surplus. But when people from my home State come to \nsee me, they ask an important question: How can there be a surplus when \nwe still haven't paid our bills on full funding for IDEA, title I, \nimpact aid, or 100,000 new teachers? I agree with them. I am glad that \nthe amendment we will offer will help to ensure that we pay those \nbills.\n  With the projected surplus, our country has the opportunity to make \nimportant choices as we begin this new century. Are we going to make \nthe investment in education that all our children deserve? Or are we \ngoing to give deep tax cuts to just a few?\n  Are we going to let our children continue to go to school in \novercrowded\n\n[[Page S3379]]\n\nclassrooms, in crumbling school buildings, with underpaid, inadequately \nprepared teachers? Or will we rise to the occasion and make the choice \nto invest in our children's future?\n  We know what the needs are out there. We know what works to help our \nchildren succeed. We just need the will of the Members of this Congress \nto stand up and put the money where their mouths are.\n  Parents, teachers, students, and community leaders are saying: Don't \njust talk about the importance of funding education. Make the tough \nchoices to show the American public that education is truly a priority \nof their elected officials.\n  That means giving our local school districts the resources they need \nto provide a first rate education to every student in this country by \nsupporting the Harkin-Kennedy-Murray amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues, when this amendment is proposed, to vote yes \nfor our children and our grandchildren and for their future.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding me time.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes off the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are in the midst of a debate on the \nbudget resolution for the year. Contained in that is a proposal for 10 \nyears because that is what the rules require of us.\n  On our side, we have tried to lay out a series of principles that \nwould form the basis of our budget proposal. Perhaps this is a useful \ntime to review those fundamental principles that we have used to form a \nbudget recommendation to our colleagues.\n  First, we have said we should protect Social Security and Medicare \ntrust funds in every year so those funds are not raided for another \npurpose.\n  Second, we have adopted the policy of paying down the maximum amount \nof the publicly held debt. The publicly held debt, as we stand here \ntoday, is $3.4 trillion. We believe $2.9 trillion of that can be paid \ndown without paying any premiums, without having any difficulty.\n  Third, we provide for an immediate fiscal stimulus of $60 billion. \nOur proposal has been: Let's put in place that fiscal stimulus now.\n  Let's not wait. Let's not delay. Let's not hold it hostage to the \nlarger 10-year budget because this would be available in fiscal year \n2001. We already have a budget for 2001. We know we have the money \navailable to provide a fiscal stimulus now. We know we have $96 billion \nof surplus outside of the trust funds available this year in the budget \nthat has already been passed to provide fiscal stimulus, to provide a \nlittle boost to this economy in the midst of the downturn we see \noccurring.\n  We think that would be a wise policy to pursue. Then we can deal with \nthe longer 10-year plan. But let's put in place right now a fiscal \nstimulus that would give lift to this economy.\n  Fourth, we provide for significant tax relief for all Americans, \nincluding rate reduction, marriage penalty relief, and estate tax \nreform.\n  We also reserve resources for the high-priority areas we have \npreviously identified: improving education, strengthening our national \ndefense, providing a meaningful prescription drug benefit, and funding \nfor agriculture because of the crisis facing our farmers.\n  Finally, we provide $750 billion to strengthen Social Security and \naddress the long-term debt problem America sees just over the horizon. \nWhen this 10-year period ends, we all know that the baby boom \ngeneration starts to retire, and then we face real financial problems. \nWe have, as I think all of us know, a circumstance in which we will \nface massive deficits as we look ahead.\n  We have tried to be mindful of the fact that all of these budgets are \nbased on a forecast, a 10-year forecast, a forecast that is highly \nuncertain. In fact, it is so uncertain that the forecasting agency \nwarned us that it is very likely to be wrong. Our friends on the other \nside are betting that this entire projection over 10 years comes true, \nall $5.6 trillion of it.\n  Let's reflect back on what the Congressional Budget Office told us. \nThey are the ones that made the forecast, and they provided us with \nthis chart, this analysis. They went back and looked over the variants \nin their previous forecasts. They said: If we apply the difference \nbetween what we projected and what actually occurred and we applied it \nto this forecast, this is what we see.\n  In the fifth year of this 10-year forecast, they are telling us there \ncould be anywhere from a $50 billion deficit to more than a $1 trillion \nsurplus. That is in the fifth year alone. They say this notion that \nthere is a $5.6 trillion pot of money at the end of 10 years has only a \n10-percent chance of coming true, a 45-percent chance there will be \nless money, and a 45-percent chance there will be more money. That \nforecast was made weeks ago.\n  Look at what has happened in the interval. The economy has continued \nto weaken. We have more announcements of job layoffs and further \nerosion in the financial markets.\n  What would a prudent person bet? Would a prudent person bet we are \ngoing to have more money or would a prudent person bet maybe we are \ngoing to have less money in that forecast, that 10-year projection?\n  A prudent person would say it is unlikely that all of this is going \nto come true and that we ought to fashion a fiscal policy that takes \naccount of that uncertainty.\n  That is precisely what a number of very distinguished Americans said \nthis morning in the Washington Post. In an article entitled ``On Taxes, \nOne Step at a Time,'' former Senator Warren Rudman, Republican Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, one of our most distinguished colleagues, former \nSenator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, again, one of our most \ndistinguished former colleagues, who are now cochairmen of the Concord \nCoalition, and three fellow officials of that organization, including \nformer Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin, former Federal Reserve \nChairman Paul Volcker, and former Secretary of Commerce in the Nixon \nadministration, Pete Peterson, said:\n\n       . . .great care must be taken to ensure that any tax cut \n     medicine treats the short-term economic symptoms without \n     adversely affecting the long-term prognosis. We believe an \n     immediate fiscal stimulus can be provided independently of \n     the proposed 10-year tax cut.\n\n  That is exactly what we have proposed on this side. Let's take \nimmediate action on fiscal stimulus and then independently address the \n10-year plan. When we address it, they advise us:\n\n       Any additional tax cuts should be limited to account for \n     the enormous uncertainty of long-term budget projections and \n     the huge unfunded obligations of Social Security and \n     Medicare.\n\n  They are exactly right. We ought to be very cautious when we talk \nabout not only the 10-year numbers but when we talk about what is going \nto happen right when we get past this 10-year period.\n  This chart shows Social Security and Medicare trust funds face cash \ndeficits as the baby boomers retire. What this shows is that we are in \nsurplus going out until the year 2016. Then Social Security and \nMedicare start running cash deficits in that year. In other words, \nthese surpluses we enjoy now are going to turn to deficits. They aren't \njust going to be piddly deficits. They are not going to be little itty-\nbitty deficits. They are going to be huge deficits. Because when the \nbaby boomers start to retire, the number of people eligible for \nMedicare and Social Security double very quickly. Then we can see what \nhappens. We see this surplus picture change dramatically. We start \nrunning massive deficits. That is why we have said on our side, having \na tax cut as large as the President proposes, that uses up all of the \nnon-trust-fund money in this period, digs the hole deeper before we \nstart filling it in.\n  I will show what I mean by that. This is our analysis of the Bush \nbudget proposal. We have the $5.6 trillion of forecasted surplus. But \n$2.6 trillion of that, according to the President's calculations, are \nSocial Security trust fund money; $500 billion is Medicare trust fund \nmoney. That leaves an available surplus of $2.5 trillion. That doesn't \ncount a third set of trust funds we have. That is another $500 billion. \nThose are the trust funds of civil service retirement, military \nretirement,\n\n[[Page S3380]]\n\nairport trust funds, highway trust fund.\n  I yield myself an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If the Chair would inform me when I have used 8 minutes, \nI would appreciate that. I appreciate the courtesy of the Presiding \nOfficer.\n  As I have indicated, if we just take out the Social Security trust \nfund and the Medicare trust fund, we are down to $2.5 trillion. That \ndoesn't count the other trust funds. That doesn't count the airport \ntrust fund, the highway trust fund, the military retirement trust fund, \nor the civil service retirement trust fund. That is another $500 \nbillion. If we counted that, we would be down $2 trillion.\n  Then let's look at the President's tax plan. He has a tax cut \nadvertised at $1.6 trillion--not billion, not million, trillion, $1.6 \ntrillion--a huge amount of money. We know from the reestimates that \nhave been done on just part of his plan that it costs more than $1.6 \ntrillion.\n  We know from the reestimates that have been done on just part of the \nplan with the House of Representatives, it is at least $1.7 trillion. \nThen, of course, you have other costs--things that will be necessary to \nfix because of the President's plan. The alternative minimum tax is \nperhaps the most significant.\n  The alternative minimum tax now affects about 2 million American \ntaxpayers. But we have been advised by the Joint Committee on Taxation \nthat if the Bush plan passes, more than 30 million taxpayers will be \ncaught up in the alternative minimum tax. That is almost one in every \nfour taxpayers in America. Boy, are they in for a big surprise. They \nthought they were getting a tax cut. Instead, they are going to find \nthey are caught up in the alternative minimum tax. That was something \ndesigned years ago to prevent wealthy people from paying no taxes. We \nare going to find a quarter of the American people caught up in it \nbecause of the changes the Bush tax cut plan makes that are going to \npush more and more Americans into the alternative minimum tax.\n  These aren't wealthy people. Some will be, but many will be middle-\nclass people. Tens of millions of people will be pushed into the \nalternative minimum tax. That was never the intention of anyone, but \nthat is what is going to happen under the Bush plan. And it costs $300 \nbillion to fix, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  So you have the Bush tax cut at $1.7 trillion. You have $300 billion \nto fix the alternative minimum tax, which is made more necessary by the \nBush plan. You have the interest costs associated with the first two of \n$500 billion. You spend money and provide tax cuts. That includes the \ninterest costs to the Federal Government because the money is not being \nused to pay down debt. So the interest cost is higher than it would be \notherwise. That is another $500 billion. Then we have the Bush spending \nproposals over the baseline that forms the foundation for this 10-year \nforecast. That is another $200 billion, for a total of $2.7 trillion.\n  Remember, if we safeguard the Social Security trust fund and the \nMedicare trust fund, we only have $2.5 trillion available. We will have \n$2.5 trillion available if we subtract out the Social Security and \nMedicare trust funds. Of course, as I indicated, if we take out the \nother trust funds of the Federal Government, that is another $500 \nbillion. So one can readily see that the cost of the Bush budget plan \nfar exceeds the available resources outside of the trust funds.\n  What does that mean? That means very simply that we are going to be \ninvading the trust funds of Medicare and Social Security under the Bush \nplan, and they won't say it, but the numbers don't lie: There is no \nother way to add this up and make it work.\n  We already see what is happening out here on the floor of the Senate \nday after day, as they present amendments to try to fix what is wrong \nin the Bush budget plan.\n  Yesterday, Senator Grassley of Iowa offered an amendment to add $150 \nbillion for prescription drugs because the President's plan is \ninsufficient. It doesn't have enough money to provide a prescription \ndrug benefit to the American people. So they offered an amendment to \nput back $150 billion. Today, Senator Grassley offered another \namendment to more fully fund agriculture, and they add back another \n$100 billion.\n  If you go out and look, year by year, at their budget and you look at \nthe results of these amendments they have passed and you look at the \nmoney that is available, what you find is, sure enough, they are \nraiding Medicare already.\n\n  In the year 2005, they are going to take $15 billion from the \nMedicare trust fund. In the year 2006, they are going to take $13 \nbillion. In the year 2007, they are going to take $10 billion. In the \nyear 2008, they are going to take $4 billion more, for a total of $42 \nbillion from the Medicare trust fund.\n  Some may be watching and wondering: well, what difference does that \nmake? The difference it makes is that it means Medicare goes broke \nfaster. That means Medicare is out of money more quickly. And already \nMedicare is the most endangered of the Federal programs. We all know \nSocial Security is in trouble. Medicare is in even more trouble. If you \nstart tapping it to fund other things, guess what. It is in trouble \neven more quickly.\n  Mr. President, those are just some of the things I think need to be \nknown before people vote on this budget. It is critically important \nthat we make wise choices, that we make choices that add up, that we \nmake choices that reflect the values of the American people. I hope \nvery much before this debate concludes that we will somehow manage to \nfind a way to change this plan so that it does add up; so that it \ndoesn't raid the trust funds; so that we can provide significant tax \nrelief to the American people but do it in the context of paying down \nthe publicly held debt as quickly as possible and also funding the \npriorities of the American people, including improving education and \nproviding a prescription drug benefit.\n  (Ms. CANTWELL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, we have a circumstance in which we fund \nthose priorities of improving education, providing a meaningful \nprescription drug benefit, strengthening our national defense, and also \nset aside some money to deal with this longer term problem.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle haven't provided a nickel \nto deal with this long-term debt crisis that is coming our way. They \nhaven't provided a dime for that purpose. We have set aside $750 \nbillion to deal with this long-term budget circumstance, this long-term \nbudget challenge of the baby boomers starting to retire and, when they \ndo, us not having sufficient resources to keep the promise that has \nbeen made.\n  Madam President, I will end on this note as I notice other colleagues \nhave arrived. The fundamental difference between the Democrat budget \nplan and the Republican budget plan can be summed up on this chart of \nshort- and long-term debt reduction. Of the projected $5.6 trillion \nthat is available if this budget forecast comes through, we reserve \n$3.65 trillion for short- and long-term debt reduction. President \nBush's plan reserves $2 trillion. So while he has a bigger tax cut--\nabout twice as big as what we propose--we have about twice as much \nmoney for short-term and long-term debt reduction. That is the \nfundamental difference between these two plans.\n  It is up to people to decide what they think is the wiser course. We \nbelieve, given the uncertainty of these financial projections, given \nthe magnitude of our current debt and the debt that is coming our way \nwhen the baby boomers start to retire, it is much wiser to put more of \nthis money aside for short- and long-term debt reduction than to put it \naside for a big tax cut.\n  Those are the differences. Our tax cut would still permit rate \nreductions. Our tax cut would permit reforming the estate tax, and \naddressing the marriage penalty, and an immediate fiscal stimulus of \n$60 billion. But beyond that, we think the money is better put to \npaying down the short-term and long-term debt.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa seeks recognition.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is Senator Harkin seeking time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I inquire; I had to leave the floor momentarily when we \nwere\n\n[[Page S3381]]\n\non the education provision. I am ready to send my amendment to the \ndesk.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Nevada wants 15 minutes off the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, in the State of Nevada we have a unique \nsituation. We have rural communities. Las Vegas, Clark County, has one \nof the most unusual situations ever to have occurred in the history of \nour country. Clark County School District must build one school each \nmonth to keep up with the growth. We hold the record. One year, we \ndedicated 18 new schools. It is a tremendous burden on the people of \nthe State of Nevada to keep up with this tremendous growth. We need \nhelp.\n  I have had lots of meetings with constituents. That is one of our \nresponsibilities. It is something I enjoy, whether it is here in \nWashington with people coming from the State or when I go home, as we \nare going to do for 2 weeks beginning next week. We will talk about \nthings they believe are important.\n  Every time someone talks to me about an issue, I think: What are we \ndoing? For example, a man by the name of Larry Carter came to visit me \none day this week. Larry Carter is a State employee. His responsibility \nis making sure that grants and other moneys that come from the Federal \nGovernment for programs dealing with children are distributed fairly.\n  In effect, he was telling me they do not need less money; they need \nmore money, and that the money we put into programs for children is \nworking. Violent crime among children, for example, has dropped the \nlast 3 years since Congress got serious about this issue and recognized \nthat violent crime among adults was going down because we had 100,000 \nnew police officers, on the streets and it has helped a great deal. \nViolent crime for juveniles was accelerating. So we decided to do \nsomething about it, and it has made a tremendous difference. These \npreventive programs are like preventive medicine: An ounce of \nprevention is worth a pound of cure. If we support juvenile justice \nprograms up front when they are the most effective, we save taxpayers' \ndollars from going to after-the-fact programs. There is some debate \nabout how much it would cost to keep a young person in a reformatory or \ninstitution, but it is about $40,000 a year. A lot of prevention \nprograms are a lot cheaper than that. We spend so much money building \njails to house youth offenders who, sadly, become adult offenders when \nthey are caught up in the cycle of violence.\n\n  The programs Larry Carter talked with me about are good programs. \nThey are not giveaways. A grant of $11,000 makes a tremendous \ndifference, according to Larry Carter, in parts of rural Nevada.\n  I am very concerned about the budget that has been put forth by the \nmajority. It is not fair. I agree with the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Conrad. He has done such a remarkably good job of \ndescribing the real problems facing this country and that the Democrats \nwant tax cuts.\n  I had the good fortune a few weeks ago to respond to President Bush's \nSaturday radio address. I said in the first sentence of my response: \nDemocrats believe in tax cuts, and we want them now.\n  Everyone within the sound of my voice should understand, we are not \nsaying there should not be tax cuts. We believe there should be tax \ncuts, but we believe there should be tax cuts that we can afford and \nthat go to the people who need them the most.\n  The one-third, one-third, one-third program we have suggested is a \ngood program. We would take the surplus and spend a third of it on tax \ncuts, a third of it reducing this huge debt we have, and a third we \nshould save for programs such as helping the people of the State of \nNevada build schools. Nothing is more important to Nevada's future and \nthe future of any State in the Union than educating our young people.\n  Around most of America, schools are overcrowded and underfunded. We \nhave some schools that do not have the same problems as Nevada. The \naverage school in America is 40 years old. These areas have crumbling \nschools. In Nevada we do not have enough schools; we need new schools.\n  Nevada has the fifth largest student/teacher ratio in the Nation. Our \nschools in Nevada are now facing nearly $300 million in deferred \nmaintenance costs. Seventy percent of the state's population live in \nLas Vegas in the Clark County School District. Another 15 percent live \nin the metropolitan Reno area. The rest of the State needs help. They \nhave no tax base. They literally are without the ability to even repair \ntheir schools. We need to help these crumbling schools in Nevada and \nother places.\n  In Nevada, we have about 450 schools. As I have indicated, in \nsouthern Nevada schools are being built at the rate of at least one new \nschool a month. The sixth largest school district in the nation is in \nClark County. In that school district, there are over 230,000 children. \nEighty-three percent of schools in Nevada report a need to upgrade or \nrepair a building to good overall condition.\n  The last year it was reported, 1999, Nevada paid over $100 million in \ninterest on school bonds, school debt. That is what this school \nconstruction legislation addresses. It will not give away money to \nschool districts. It alleviates the burden placed on the schools \nbecause of the interest costs on this debt, this bonded indebtedness \nthat school districts all over America are using to construct schools.\n  It is estimated that Nevada faces another $6 billion for school \nmodernization and construction. This is a tremendous burden. This \nincludes about $400 million for technology needs.\n  I talked about the new schools we need to build. And we do need to \nbuild new schools in Nevada. The biggest Fourth of July celebration in \nNevada is in Boulder City. They have a big parade and all kinds of \ncelebrations that go with the Fourth of July. I was asked by people at \nthe parade to visit Boulder City High School: We want to show you what \nis wrong with this school.\n  I said to myself: What is wrong with the school? When I was in high \nschool, Boulder City was one of the best schools, if not the top \nschool. They had more merit scholars and great athletic teams. It was a \nbeautiful place in southern Nevada. They had a lot of grass. We do not \nhave a lot of green things in southern Nevada.\n  I said: I will go to this school that I thought was always so nice. \nIt has not received the largess of the Clark County School District. It \nwas run down. They had no hot water in the showers for the athletes. \nParts of the track were gone. Students could not run in some of the \noutside lanes.\n  They could not put computers in that school because it was not wired. \nIt was a mess. This wonderful school that I remember was a mess.\n  Since I went there, the school district has put a little more money \nin it to modernize that school.\n  That is an example of what is happening all over America. We need new \nschools built, and we need to modernize our schools. That is what the \namendment of the Senator from Iowa is about.\n  Madam President, I have had a lot of dealings with my friend from \nIowa since I have been in Washington. He is someone for whom I have \ngreat respect. He has for many years been on the Appropriations \nCommittee. I have served with him on the Appropriations Committee. He \nand Senator Specter are the leading Democrat and Republican on the very \nimportant committee that deals with Health and Human Services and \nEducation. There is no one in the Senate who has a bigger part than the \nSenator from Iowa.\n\n  I attended a hearing yesterday dealing with Alzheimer's disease. This \nis a terrible, devastating disease. This Congress is putting huge \namounts of money into it as a result of the leadership of the Senator \nfrom Iowa and the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter.\n  Also, in addition to the work he has done in our search to find the \ncure for devastating diseases in America, he has also been a leader on \neducation. He not only fought to work on improving education for what \nsome refer to as the regular kids; he has spent months and months of \nhis legislative career dealing with disadvantaged children. I greatly \nadmire and respect him. Senator Harkin has done many things in this \nCapitol to make sure that hearing-impaired people can witness and view \nthe\n\n[[Page S3382]]\n\nproceedings in the Capitol. He has done a lot for American children, \ndisadvantaged and otherwise.\n  This amendment he will offer is in keeping with the Harkin tradition, \nputting money where it is needed. I can't say enough about my support \nof this legislation.\n  I have talked about some of the things that will be helpful to the \nState of Nevada. There is no question this will be helpful to the State \nof Nevada, but it will help everyone in America because if we help \neducate our young people, we benefit also.\n  A tax cut of the magnitude some are talking about will eliminate any \nincrease in funding for the education of our children. I am gravely \nconcerned we will not have the resources that will be needed to \nproperly fund our obligation to education and in effect give back to \nthe American family what they deserve.\n  We talk about this money, this surplus. Let's remind everyone from \nwhere it came. No one more than the Presiding Officer appreciates that \nin 1993 we had a budget deficit reduction act. On that occasion in the \nHouse, without a single Republican vote, it was passed; in the Senate, \nwithout a single Republican vote, it was passed. As a result of that \nvery dramatic vote, we stopped spending in the deficits and started \nhaving surpluses. We first cut down the deficits and then we got into a \nsurplus situation. We cut down the size of the Federal Government. We \nhad 300,000 fewer Federal employees than in the past. We had record-\nbreaking employment, with unemployment being low. Inflation was low. It \nwas remarkable what happened to the economy as a result of that vote.\n  We now have that money, that surplus. That surplus, we are told by \nthe other side, is the people's money; give it back. That is absolutely \ntrue; it is the people's money. But it is also the people's debt. We \nhave to do something about the debt. That is why when we talk about \nwhat Democrats should do, there is a third in tax cuts, a third to \ncontinue to pay down that debt, and of course, a third left over to do \nsome things in education that this amendment offered by my friend from \nIowa will do.\n  I agree with Senator Harkin; we should not leave a single child \nbehind. Part of not leaving a child behind is ensuring that our \nteachers are trained, our children have access to Head Start, and our \nchildren are in safe, well-equipped classrooms. We must invest in \nhigher education for our children through Pell grant programs, loan \nforgiveness programs for teachers, the TRIO program, and the Federal \nPerkins loan programs.\n\n  Senator Harkin's amendment invests an additional $250 billion over 10 \nyears to improve education. With that investment, we can greatly expand \nchild development programs, make Head Start available to all eligible \n3- and 4-year-olds, reduce class size to no more than 18 students, \ntriple Federal funding for school repairs and construction, fully fund \nthe Federal share of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \nand double spending for after-school programs.\n  It is not fair what has happened to school districts in Nevada and \naround the country. It is estimated that it costs an extra 40 cents for \nevery student that is disadvantaged, disabled--physically, emotionally \nhandicapped. What are we paying? Less than a dime of that. The Federal \nGovernment should pay the extra 40 cents for every student. If we did \nthat, think of the extra money it would give school districts to do \nsome of the things I have spoken of today.\n  This amendment of Senator Harkin is good for the heart; it is good \nfor the head. It is the right thing to do.\n  After-school programs, we know they work. School districts spend \nmillions of dollars to build schools. These are programs say: Why not \nuse it after school for some programs for kids who may be latch-key \nchildren who go home with no parent home. We would have programs there \nso they would do better in school and in effect keep them occupied. \nAfter-school programs are great. They work well.\n  I support a tax cut. However, we have to have a fiscally responsible \ntax cut that allows us to fund education and continue to pay down the \ndebt. I know the people of Nevada want a strong educational system. We \nshould not leave any child behind--not a child from Iowa, not a child \nfrom Nevada, or anywhere else across this Nation. We must not \nshortchange our children.\n  I urge everyone to support the Harkin amendment when it is offered. \nIt is what this country needs. It would improve everyone's life to \nbetter educate our children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 185 to Amendment No. 170\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from Nevada.\n  Having been to his State and having visited a couple of cities in \nNevada and seeing how the increase in population is there, I know \nSenator Reid understands full well the necessity to invest in \neducation. It is a terrible burden they have in the State of Nevada now \nin terms of building facilities and getting teachers in classrooms they \nneed to meet the requirements of their rapidly growing population in \nthat State.\n  I appreciate the kind remarks of Senator Reid about me, but I want to \nreturn it in kind by saying teachers and students, not just in Nevada \nbut all over the country, have no greater friend than Senator Reid. I \ndo appreciate his strong support of this amendment.\n  I also want to mention the cosponsors of this amendment: Senators \nWellstone, Kennedy, Murray, Bingaman, Clinton, Dayton, Rockefeller, \nCorzine, Mikulski, Reed of Rhode Island, Reid of Nevada, Sarbanes, \nKerry, Landrieu, Daschle, and Schumer.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of the \ngroups supporting this amendment. It is a lengthy list.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                Groups Supporting Leave No Child Behind\n\n       American Association of Community Colleges.\n       American Association of School Administrators.\n       American Association of State Colleges and Universities.\n       American Council on Education.\n       American Federation of Teachers.\n       American Library Association.\n       Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities.\n       Board of Education of the City of New York.\n       Children's Defense Fund.\n       The Children's Foundation.\n       Coalition for Higher Education Assistance Organizations.\n       Committee for Education Funding.\n       Council for Exceptional Children.\n       Council for Opportunity in Education.\n       Council of Chief State School Officers.\n       Council of the Great City Schools.\n       Fight Crime Invest in Kids.\n       Higher Education Consortium for Special Education.\n       International Reading Association.\n       National Association of Counties.\n       National Association of Independent Colleges and \n     Universities.\n       National Association of Secondary School Principals.\n       National Association of State Directors of Special \n     Education, Inc.\n       National Association for Bilingual Education.\n       National Association for the Education of Young Children.\n       National Alliance of Black School Educators.\n       National Association of Student Financial Aid \n     Administrators.\n       National Council of Jewish Women.\n       National Education Association.\n       National Education Knowledge Industry Association.\n       National Job Corps Association.\n       National PTA.\n       National School Board Association.\n       New York State Department of Education.\n       School Social Work Association of America.\n       Tulare Youth Service Bureau, Inc.\n       U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n       U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n       Urban Corps San Diego.\n       University of California.\n       Workforce Alliance.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, our amendment ``Leave No Child Behind,'' \nthe third one says that all students, including special needs students, \nwill master challenging subject matter and Federal education programs \nwill be held accountable and focus on practices proven to work. The \ntitle I program provides children who have fallen behind in reading and \nmath with the extra help they need to catch up. However, only one-third \nof the students who need this extra help are aided.\n  In addition, the Federal commitment to help educate students with \ndisabilities has lagged behind our goal to provide what we in Congress \nsaid 26 years ago, that we would endeavor to provide to the States and \nlocal communities at least 40 percent of the average per-pupil \nexpenditure to support the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n  In our amendment, we have increased investments in title I and in \nIDEA to help schools meet the tough new accountability standards. I \nmight add, it will also provide much needed relief to local property \ntaxpayers who are struggling to finance their schools.\n  This amendment we have sent to the desk will fully fund the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act to that level we stated 26 \nyears ago that we wanted to do; that is, provide at least a minimum of \n40 percent of the average per-pupil expenditures.\n  A fourth part of our amendment addresses that all students will \nattend classes in a school building that is safe, in good repair, and \nequipped with the latest technology. Fourteen million children attend \nclasses in buildings that are unsafe or inadequate.\n  Last month, the American Society of Civil Engineers issued a report \ncard on the Nation's infrastructure, on everything from roads and \nbridges to wastewater treatment, dams, everything--all of the physical \ninfrastructure of America. The one item that got the lowest grade was \nour public schools, a D-minus. It is a national disgrace that the \nnicest places our kids see are shopping malls, sports arenas, and movie \ntheaters, and the most run down places they see are the public schools. \nWhat signal are we sending to them about the value we place on their \neducation and their future?\n  This amendment triples funding for the school repair and renovation \nprogram that we began in last year's appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S3384]]\n\n  Fifth, all students will be able to attend college and get the skills \nthey need to succeed in the global economy without incurring a mountain \nof debt. Over the past two decades, the purchasing power of the Pell \ngrants has fallen by 25 percent. Loans right now are the principal \nsource of aid for colleges. In this amendment we increase the maximum \nPell grant by $600 next year. I think, again, if you talk to any of \nyour constituents, your families out there who have kids in college, \nthere is a new phenomenon happening in America. Kids are going to \ncollege. They want to have a better life. They want to succeed. They \nare piling up mountains of debt by borrowing money to go to school. \nThis is unlike anything we have ever seen in the past. This addresses \nthat by increasing that maximum Pell grant.\n  We also increase investments in the TRIO Program to make sure some of \nour most vulnerable students can succeed in college. We also expand \nloan forgiveness for teachers and increase our investment in Federal \njob training programs so every adult will have the skills necessary to \ncompete in a global economy.\n  Again, we know there are a lot of our young people who will not go to \ncollege, will not finish college. There are a lot of people in our \nworkforce today who have not gone to college. They need skills \nupgrading, job retraining, because they are shifting in their jobs. We \ncannot forget about them either. So our amendment puts the necessary \ninvestments in job training programs.\n  Last, our amendment also maintains our commitment to fiscal \ndiscipline by devoting a commensurate amount to reducing the public \ndebt.\n  Reaching all these goals will require real investments amounting to \n$250 billion over the next 10 years. But dedicating these funds is \nsimply a matter of priorities. Again I repeat, $250 billion is about \none-third as much as the tax cut that President Bush wants to give to \nthe most wealthy 1 percent of Americans.\n  I will use this chart to show the President's tax cut for the \nwealthiest 1 percent is about $697 billion. The President's education \nplan is $21.3 billion. The amendment before us provides $250 billion \nover 10 years, or slightly more than one-third--one-third of what the \nPresident wants to give in tax cuts, just to the wealthiest 1 percent \nof Americans.\n  Then, when we consider we are looking at the baby boom generation \ncoming on retirement and the problems we are going to have in Medicare, \nlooking at our economic future, the best investment we can make this \ndecade is to invest in education and make it our top priority.\n  We are not alone in this. The American people understand this full \nwell. In poll after poll after poll, the American public supports \neducation overwhelmingly. It is not even a close call. These are some \nof the recent surveys. In fact, one was done by a polling firm that \ntends to poll more for Republicans that joined with a polling firm that \ntends to poll more with Democrats. This is what they came up with.\n  The question was about promoting teaching as a career and raising \nteacher pay to keep good teachers--91 percent favored that.\n  Make college more affordable by expanding loan and grant programs and \nincreasing student aid--91 percent approve of that.\n  Reducing class sizes, using higher pay to attract good teachers, \nexpanding before- and after-school programs--87 percent approved.\n  Providing funding to repair schools in poor condition and building \nnew schools and wiring classrooms for computers--87 percent approve.\n  Providing full funding for Head Start, expanding day-care programs in \nlocal schools, providing tax credits to help families pay for \nkindergarten and preschool--85 percent approve.\n  Requiring the Federal Government to live up to its obligation of 40-\npercent funding for special education--85 percent approve.\n  The way I see it, this is not even a close call. I hate to say this \nsince we are talking about education. This ought to be a no-brainer. \nThe American people are on this side. They are telling us in clear, \nunequivocal terms: Make education your top priority. Invest in these \nprograms.\n  I have not seen the polls, but I challenge anyone to tell me that \nthey can get these kind of approval ratings for a $697 billion tax \nbreak to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. Yet that is what the \nbudget has before us. We are elected to represent the people of \nAmerica. We are all Senators. Yes, I represent Iowa, but I represent \nthe people in Minnesota and everywhere else, too. We are U.S. Senators. \nWe represent the country as a whole. What the people of America are \ntelling us is to invest in education.\n  Madam President, this amendment provides the necessary funds. So over \nthe next 10 years we can fully fund Head Start for all eligible 3 and 4 \nyear olds, double the title I funding for disadvantaged children, and \nwe can fully fund the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. We \ncan quadruple professional development, teacher training, and skills \nupgrades. We can reach our goal of hiring 100,000 extra teachers to \nreduce class sizes all over America so that no class has more than 18 \nstudents in all grades 1 through 12.\n  We can triple the funding for modernization of school repair, and we \ncan raise the maximum Pell grant by $600 next year.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Did the Senator describe the title I program? Did he \ntalk about what title I was? I know he talked about IDEA.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I talked about helping disadvantaged students with \nreading and math skills in the title I program.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Senator pointed out that right now that program is \nfunded about 30 percent. That is about it. Is that correct? He talked \nabout Head Start, but he is also talking about kids who are \neconomically disadvantaged getting that additional help for reading or \nafterschool through the title I program. We find that it is funded at \nabout a 30-percent level, but now we are going to double it with this \nproposal. Is that right?\n  Mr. HARKIN. This will get it to over 60 percent of fully funding the \ntitle I program.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. In many of our schools in the State of Minnesota--St. \nPaul, for example--where 65 percent or less of the kids in the free and \nreduced priced lunch program, do not get a cent from Title I. The state \nruns out of money.\n  Again, whether it is about poor children or kids with special needs, \nor reducing class size, this is the vote in terms of our values.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his strong support \nof education. No one works quite as hard as Senator Wellstone for kids \nin this country, and especially for disadvantaged kids. He is right. We \nhave to make sure that we invest both in title I and also in the \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act.\n  Again, on the top end of the Pell grant, this is what enables those \nwho are going to college.\n  The way I see it, this is the vote on the budget and whether or not \nwe are going to have the priority that the American people want us to \nhave or whether we are going to go down the pathway of providing almost \nunconscionable tax benefits and relief for the wealthiest 1 percent of \nAmericans.\n  Weigh it. This is the vote. We are not even talking about all of the \ntax cuts that go to wealthiest 1 percent. We are just taking about one-\nthird of the taxes the wealthiest 1 percent will fund for this \neducation program. This is the vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I was going to ask the distinguished \nranking member if he has somebody now to continue, and then we will \ncomplete it in about 15 or 20 minutes when the Senator is finished.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Massachusetts would like 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will wait for that and follow after it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We thank the chairman very much for his courtesy. I yield \nthe Senator from Massachusetts 15 minutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank Senators Harkin and Wellstone \nfor bringing forward this extremely important amendment. Over the \nperiod of\n\n[[Page S3385]]\n\nthis week we are going to cast some votes here in the U.S. Senate, but \nI doubt if there is any particular amendment that presents more clearly \nthe question of values and priorities than this amendment does. I doubt \nif there is any amendment that we will consider that is more about the \nfuture of our country and that has a greater relevance to what kind of \nsociety we will become over the period of these next several years and \ninto the future.\n  The numbers that the Senators from Iowa and Minnesota have talked \nabout are very large amounts of money. But when you look at this amount \nin the context of educational need, these figures are not out of the \nordinary. As a matter of fact, they are very modest given the number of \nchildren currently attending the nation's schools, and increases in the \nnumber of children that are going to be attending our nation's schools \nand colleges in the coming years.\n  Senators Harkin and Wellstone are posing a question of priorities. \nThat is, are we prepared to invest in the future of this country and in \nits children, through reducing the tax breaks for the wealthiest \nindividuals by a third? I commend Senators Wellstone and Harkin for \nposing that question.\n  I agree with those who say that money does not solve all of our \nnation's problems. That point will be debated here this afternoon as \nthis amendment is considered. That point is both valid and worthy of \ndebate. However, money is also a reflection of our Nation's priorities. \nThis is what the budget debate is all about. This is what our votes are \nall about.\n  The amendment brought forth by the Senator from Iowa is about placing \na priority on what the American family has said is their first priority \ninvestment in our nation's children and in our future.\n  Since fiscal year 1980, the federal share has decreased for education \nprograms. In elementary and secondary education, the investment has \ndropped from 11.9% to 8.3% in fiscal year 2000, and in higher education \nfrom 15.4% to 11%. But, the educational needs of schools and \ncommunities are rising.\n  This chart reflects the number of children who will be entering \nelementary and secondary schools in the United States of America over \nthe period of the next 90 years. The number of school-aged children \nwill increase from today's enrollments of 53 million students, up to 94 \nmillion students in 2100.\n  This amendment is really about partnership--between federal, State, \nand local communities. The federal role should lead this partnership \nthrough recognizing that the needs of our nation's schools will \ncontinue to grow as the population in our nation's schools grows. We \nmust ask ourselves: Does this budget reflect the growing need to invest \nin elementary and secondary education? Or is it business as usual--a \n5.7 percent over last year's funding level. The Harkin amendment \naccurately reflects the realities faced by our nation's schools and \nuniversities.\n  Enrollment in higher education has also significantly increased. Our \ncolleges and universities are reaching record enrollments. This year, \ncollege enrollment numbered over 15 million students, and is expected \nto rise over the next 10 years to reach 17.5 million in 2010.\n  The priority to educate all of our nation's children must begin \nthrough an investment in educating children at an early age. Various \nreports, including those produced by the Carnegie Commission, have \nshown us what a difference is made through investment at the earliest \ntime in children's lives. Early Start, which is now being funded at 4 \nor 5 percent of what it should be; the Head Start program at about 40 \npercent, or 45 percent of what it should be; child care, 17 percent in \nterms of quality education.\n  And the list goes on.\n  As I mentioned, the average annual investment in education has \ndropped over the past years. Now we are faced, in this budget, with an \nincrease of only 5.7 percent. That is an inadequate amount when talking \nabout the investment needed for the children of this country.\n  The Senator from Iowa went into considerable detail on a number of \nfeatures in this amendment, and I would also like to highlight some \nimportant points.\n  I would like to briefly mention the Pell Grant Program. We had a \nnational debate in 1960 regarding aid to education programs. At that \ntime Vice President Nixon was opposed to any aid to education, and \nPresident Kennedy supported aid to education. The President believed--\nand this country went on record during that time--that any student in \nthis country who is able to gain entrance into any college or \nuniversity on the basis of their academic ability should be able to do \nso, despite the size of their wallet or the size of their pocketbook. \nThe President believed that students should have access to a range of \ngrants, loans, and work-study programs, and also rely on their own \nindividual efforts, to make up the tuition.\n  This commitment was reflected in the creation of Pell grants. Over \nthe last 25 years, federal student need has shifted from a grant-based \nsystem to a loan-based system. In 1980, 55% of total federal aid for \nhigher education was awarded through grants, and 43% through loans. In \n1998, this ratio shifted to 58% through loans, and 40% through grants.\n  A recent study has found that the maximum award under the Pell grant \nprogram has fallen dramatically, from providing 84% of total costs at a \npublic, 4-year university in 1975-1976, to providing 39% of total costs \nin 1999-2000.\n  Any Member of this body may visit a college or university in this \ncountry and listen to young people. What are they talking about? Are \nthey talking about their books? Are they talking about their studies or \nwhat is happening in their lecture halls? No. They are talking about \ntheir loans and how they are going to repay their loans. Students are \nnot talking about whether they are able to go into public service, but \ninstead about what they are going to have to do when they get out of \nschool.\n  The Harkin amendment is a downpayment for putting this country back \non the road, and ensuring that young and talented Americans are not \nturning their backs on the possibility of higher education because do \nnot want to be in debt, nor put their families in debt. This is wrong. \nIt is clear that students cannot afford not to go to college.\n  We are all working together to ensure that every child has access to \na high quality education. But let's also invest in our nation's \nchildren. Let's invest in making sure there will be sufficient \nresources for children to benefit from elementary and secondary \neducation, and move on the furthering their education in colleges and \nuniversities.\n  We need a plan that makes increasing Head Start a priority over tax \ncuts for the wealthy.\n  We need a plan that makes full funding for IDEA a priority over tax \ncuts for the wealthy.\n  We need a plan that makes increasing Title I a program that helps \ndisadvantaged students master basic skills a priority over tax cuts for \nthe wealthy.\n  We need a plan that makes reducing class size a priority.\n  We need a plan that makes improving teacher quality a priority.\n  We need a plan that makes expanding after-school \nlearning opportunities a priority.\n\n  We need a plan that makes modernizing and rebuilding the nation's \ncrumbling and overcrowded school buildings a priority.\n  We need a plan that makes increasing the maximum level of Pell grants \na priority.\n  We need a strong investment in education that will ensure a bright \nfuture for the nation, not a tax cut that leaves the nation's children \nand students behind.\n  We know what needs to be done now in terms of education in America. \nThe real question is, Do we have the will? This particular amendment \naddresses programs that invest in children, and ensures that our future \nworkers are going to have the skills to compete in a modern economy. It \nreflects the best values of the American people and the best values of \nour party. That value is investment in children and their futures. That \nis what this amendment is about. It ought to be adopted.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield.\n\n[[Page S3386]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I have listened intently to what the Senator has said. I \nthink the Senator has clearly said that a child's ability to be \neducated should not be dependent on how much money their parents have.\n  Is that what the Senator has said?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is exactly what I have said.\n  Mr. REID. Today, this week, is when students all over America are \ngoing to get notices in the mail as to where they are going to be able \nto go to school.\n  Does the Senator agree that many students who are admitted to some \nschools are not going to be able to go there because they cannot bear \nthe burden of the cost of going to a finer school; they will have to go \nto some other school, is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could answer the Senator's question this way. 97 \npercent of students in the highest achievement and socioeconomic \nquartile go on to 4 year college. On the other hand, only 46 percent of \nchildren achieving at the same academic level, but in the lowest \nsocioeconomic quartile, go on to a 4-year college or university.\n  We, as a country and as a society, understand that education is the \ngreat equalizer. When we are faced with these facts----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). The Senator has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the Senator 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. When we are faced with these facts, we have to ask \nourselves, What should be our investment? The Harkin amendment is a \ncomprehensive amendment. It will ensure that children are well \nprepared, ready to learn, and will benefit from the changes and the \nimprovements we have made in elementary, secondary, and higher \neducation.\n  The question is, Are we going to take the one-third of the tax \nprogram and do what the Harkin-Wellstone amendment has asked, or are we \ngoing to provide additional billions of dollars to the wealthiest \nindividuals? It is a clear choice.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield for one \nother question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. There was one comment the Senator made that I think is \ncritically important. I want to make sure I understand it well and that \npeople understand it.\n  When we marked up the bill dealing with the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act in the HELP Committee, I think \nall of us went on record saying we were absolutely committed to \naccountability and holding students to really high standards. But the \nDemocrats on the committee, did we not also say that we have to make \nsure the students, the children, and the teachers of the schools have \nthe tools; in other words, that we make the investment so that they \nwill have, indeed, the same chance to achieve and do well on these \ntests? Don't the two go together?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. It will be a sham if \nwe just have the test without having the support services. We are \nworking to ensure these important services that accelerate learning and \nacademic achievement.\n  That is addressed in the Harkin amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield again?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator again for his very eloquent statement \nand his comments. Certainly, there is no one in either body on Capitol \nHill who has worked longer and harder and, I might add, more \nsuccessfully on the education of all our kids than has the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  When I was listening to the Senator speak, I was thinking about the \nprospect of kids who do not have a lot of money who want to get an \neducation, who have achieved well in school, have studied hard. They \nhave made their grades. They have made good grades. The Senator pointed \nthat out in his remarks, that they would have the same desire to go to \ncollege as anyone else.\n  Was the Senator saying that because of the financial barriers, these \nkids who are high achievers--they are bright, they have studied hard, \nthey have gotten good grades--have some shield that keeps them from \nadvancing on?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And that shield is money. There are going to be other \namendments that might focus on one thing or another.\n  My second question for the Senator: Is it his belief, from all of his \nlong experience involving education, that we have to look at the whole? \nEach one of these parts isn't a whole. It is important to increase Pell \ngrants, but that alone won't solve it. It is important to increase \ntitle I, but that alone won't solve it. It is important to increase \nfunding for individuals with disabilities, but that alone won't solve \nit. Is it the contention of the Senator that this has to be put \ntogether?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. Over the last 15 \nyears, as the Senator is well familiar, we have learned that a child's \nmind--almost from the time of birth--should have opportunities to \ndevelop. Research has shown us that we must take advantage of the new \nscience in ways that are going to enhance the academic opportunities \nfor these children.\n  The Senator's amendment focuses not only on the early learning, but \nalso on Head Start, which serves 3- and 4-year-olds.\n  The Senator is familiar with the excellent hearing that was chaired \nby Senator Jeffords, and during which we learned that 98 percent of \nyoung children are receiving important support services at a young age. \nIn Europe, for example, such services have had an important impact on a \nchild's learning ability. That is what the Senator's amendment is about \nand why it is so compelling.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Rhode Island is seeking time?\n  Mr. REED. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. REED. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island off \nthe resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Harkin \namendment.\n  Senator Harkin understands that in America education provides the \nbest opportunity for all of our citizens to achieve and that this \ncountry, at its best moments, should always be about opportunity. \nSenator Harkin seeks to ensure that every child has an opportunity. He \nhas appropriately titled this amendment ``Leave No Child Behind,'' \nbecause he believes sincerely, as do I, that we have to reach out, not \njust rhetorically but with real resources, to make sure every child can \nseize opportunity, which is what America is all about.\n  Unlike the Republican budget resolution before us, which contains \nonly a paltry increase for education--in fact, this increase is smaller \nthan the annual increases in education in the last 4 out of 5 years--\nthe Harkin Amendment provides $250 billion over 10 years for education, \na funding level that would truly leave no child behind.\n  All of our Nation's students have to be given the tools and the \nopportunity to excel and be successful, in effect, to live out the \nAmerican dream. The Harkin amendment provides these tools and the \nopportunity through high quality education that spans a lifetime--from \nearly childhood education, through elementary and secondary education, \nthrough higher education, and indeed beyond to postsecondary, lifelong \nlearning. High quality education costs real dollars. The Harkin \namendment puts those real dollars into this budget.\n  President Bush and our Republican colleagues claim that their \nproposal will leave no child behind, but simply adding accountability \nto our elementary and secondary schools without providing adequate \nresources will not do the job.\n  I have had many opportunities to talk with the Secretary of Education \nand other leaders in this administration with respect to their \neducation proposal. They talk a good game. They talk about \naccountability. They talk about standards. But then when you ask them: \nWhere are the resources? They say: Well, we really don't need \nresources.\n\n[[Page S3387]]\n\n  That is just not the case. Every American understands that education \nis worthwhile and that we must invest in education, not just with words \nbut with dollars, to make a high quality education a reality in the \nlife of every child. Indeed, today, the Federal budget only devotes \nonly 2 cents of every Federal dollar to education. We have to do more--\nnot to dispossess the States and the localities of their \nresponsibilities, but to complement and supplement what they are doing.\n  Today we live in a challenging, international economic order, and \nstudents from Massachusetts are not just competing with students from \nMississippi; they are all competing against the very best and brightest \naround the globe. That requires investment. It requires raising our \nstandards and giving every child a chance to reach those standards to \nensure that we have the best-educated workforce so we can compete in \nthis competitive global economy. That is what the Harkin amendment will \ndo.\n  Specifically, Senator Harkin would help all children start school \nready to learn by funding Head Start to make it available to all \neligible 3- and 4-year-olds and to expand learning opportunities under \nthe Early Learning Opportunities Act. Making children ready to learn \nhas been a goal of the Federal Government for more than a decade. When \nPresident Bush organized the Governor's conference, they determined \nthat their first goal was to ensure that every child should enter \nschool ready to learn. We have failed to achieve that goal. With the \nresources this amendment provides, we can strive and, I hope, attain \nthat goal.\n  We also want to ensure that every child is taught by highly qualified \nteachers in classrooms that are not overcrowded or in ill-repair. The \nHarkin amendment quadruples funding for professional development, \nincludes money for increasing our effort to reduce class sizes, and \nincreases the resources going to school repair and modernization.\n  We all understand, too, that every child, including those students \nwith disabilities, must be a part of the educational experience in a \nmeaningful way. That means fully funding the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act.\n  We also understand that we have a special obligation at the Federal \nlevel to provide the most disadvantaged American children with a real \nchance, and that is why Senator Harkin will increase title I funding \nsubstantially.\n  Then in order to complete the job, we have to ensure that all of our \nchildren with talent and ambition coming out of secondary schools have \nthe resources and the opportunity to go to college. So, Senator Harkin \nis calling for an increase in the maximum Pell grant by $600 to $4,350. \nHe is also calling for a significant increase in other need-based \nstudent aid programs, such as LEAP, TRIO, and GEAR UP.\n  All of these proposals go to the heart and soul of what we should be \nabout: giving every child the chance to learn; making them ready for \nschool; giving them good teachers and good facilities; and then giving \nthem the opportunity to go on to postsecondary education.\n  I cannot think of a more important task, one that is more central to \nthe concerns of all Americans, and one that is more fully realized than \nthis amendment proposed by Senator Harkin. I support him strongly.\n  I will be offering two amendments with respect to education. The \nfirst I will offer, with my colleagues Senators Kennedy and Bingaman, \nwould support recent initiatives sponsored by the administration and \nsupported by the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, that \ninvolves testing of our students. The President has called for the \ntesting of all students in grades 3 through 8. I understand, as so many \nof my colleagues do, that testing is an important aspect of education, \nnot the sole aspect of education, but an important aspect of education. \nBut, I have raised concerns, as have others, that these tests can \ndominate curriculum so that essentially children are narrowly being \ntaught the test. And one graver concern is that these tests, because so \nmuch rides upon them, would be dumbed down or otherwise compromised so \nthat they are not really a valid tool to assess a school's performance. \nThey simply become a routine way to secure Federal funding.\n  Nevertheless, I believe we should provide the States with the \nresources if we require them to test every child in reading and math in \ngrades 3 through 8.\n  The HELP Committee passed the BEST Act under a unanimous vote, 20-0. \nThe bill authorizes $510 million to help States meet this mandate--$400 \nmillion for the development and implementation of annual State \nassessments and $110 million for administering State assessments under \nthe National Assessments of Educational Progress. The National \nGovernors' Association, however, has expressed concern that this level \nof funding is likely not enough to cover the costs. In fact, with an \naverage testing cost of $50 per student, the real cost may be well over \n$1 billion. While the amount authorized under the BEST Act is a start, \nit is really only an initial downpayment on the true cost of \nimplementing these tests.\n  From what I am hearing from colleagues in Rhode Island, high quality \ntests are very costly, and the State will need money to implement and \nadminister these tests. It costs a great deal of money to administer \nand score the tests, to prepare schools and teachers to administer the \ntests, and to perform other tasks necessary to ensure an appropriate \ntesting regime that will adequately assess the progress of children and \nwill contribute to their education, not distract them from their \neducation.\n  In Rhode Island, it has been estimated that the cost of an annual \ntesting regime as contemplated by the BEST Act will be about $4 million \na year. That is a great deal of money in the State of Rhode Island for \neducation. That money could be used for other purposes in education. I \nbelieve if we are mandating these tests, we should at least provide for \nthese resources.\n  I know a few years ago it was quite in vogue for Republican \ncolleagues to talk about ``unfunded mandates,'' how the Federal \nGovernment was imposing these restrictions and requirements and not \ngiving the resources to do it. I can't think of a more transparent and \nobvious unfunded mandate than to require each State to test each child \nin grades 3 through 8, which is a traditional province of the States in \nterms of curriculum, and not give them the Federal resources to carry \nout that mandate.\n  So my amendment would, in fact, provide the downpayment on the costs \nof these tests. I hope it will be agreed to because, right now, this \nbudget does not put the dollars behind the rhetoric when it comes to \nState testing.\n  I will offer another amendment along with Senator Kennedy that would \nincrease our commitment to opening the doors of higher education to our \nneediest students. Senator Harkin has indicated in his amendment that \nhe understands the need to increase Pell grants and to support need-\nbased programs. My amendment also would do this. It would increase \nsignificantly those resources that are going to programs that are \ndesigned to assist talented Americans who are economically deprived. It \nwould increase the maximum Pell grant by $600 to $4,350, something \nSenator Harkin also supports. It would increase the LEAP program, a \npartnership between the Federal Government and the States to provide \nincome-based grants and aid to students going to college by $45 million \nto $100 million. It would increase the supplemental educational \nopportunity grants. It would also increase the Federal Work-Study \nProgram to provide students with more resources as they work their way \nthrough college. It would increase the TRIO program, designed to \nidentify talented young people, assist them to get into school, and \nmentor them and help them as they progress through college. It would \nalso increase the Perkins loans capital contribution to assist \nuniversities and colleges as they reach out to individual students who \nneed help. It would also help on the loan cancellation part of the \nPerkins program for reimbursement to colleges for loan forgiveness.\n\n  The amendment would also increase funding for the GEAR UP program, \nanother early intervention program. It would also address teacher \nquality and recruitment through title II of the Higher Education Act by \nproviding additional resources to help teachers better prepare \nthemselves and help communities recruit better teachers.\n  All of these programs are designed to be consistent with the theme \nthat has\n\n[[Page S3388]]\n\nbeen struck by Senator Harkin in his amendment. If we believe in \nopportunity, we really have to invest in education. When you get down \nto the practicalities of school systems in this country, the rhetoric \ndoesn't work. When you get down to the notion that they will simply \nreorganize themselves effectively and that will make up for additional \nresources, that clashes with the reality of local education.\n  What is the reality of local education? Well, the school committees \nstrive for months to come up with a budget. They go ahead and they want \nincreased professional development, and they want increased funds to \nimprove their facilities, to fix roofs. They have made political \ncompromises and struggles to get there. They are just about to announce \nit, and then they get a call--the superintendent gets a call; it is \ntheir health insurance company. They have just announced that premiums \nare going up 45 percent. So guess what happens to all that money for \nprofessional development, library books, and school construction; it is \ngone.\n  The virtue and the value that we offer is that we can provide these \nfunds and fence them off, if you will, commit them to libraries, school \nconstruction, reducing class size; and by doing that, we can make real \nprogress working with local communities.\n  The Harkin amendment is the most important amendment in this whole \nbudget because it would put us on record again as saying that we \nbelieve in education, in opportunity, and we will support it with \ndollars and not just words.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is the Senator from New York seeking time?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I am, Madam President.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would 7 minutes be all right?\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask the Senator from North Dakota, are we going to go \nback and forth on the time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. There has been no real formality here. If the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire would like time at this point----\n  Mr. GREGG. Why don't we have the Senator from New York speak, and \nthen I will seek recognition after her.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is very gracious. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator \nfrom New York, and then we will go to the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I rise in support of Senator Harkin's \neffort to make sure that we as a nation keep our word and that we do, \nindeed, make education a national priority.\n  The Senator has called for investing $250 billion in education \nprograms for our children over the next 10 years. I think that is a \nsmart investment. I think that is a sound investment. I think it is a \nprudent investment. I know that improving education has bipartisan \nsupport, as I know from my work on the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions, where I serve with the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire, where the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nreauthorization--now called the BEST Act--passed with unanimous \nbipartisan support.\n  I think we need to put the resources behind the title of that act. If \nit is to be the BEST Act, if it is, indeed, to promote education and \nprovide the kind of opportunities that our children need in the 21st \ncentury, then we have to be sure it is not an empty program.\n  Higher standards will mean absolutely nothing unless we provide our \nschools and our students--particularly in underserved urban and rural \nareas--with the resources and support necessary to meet those goals. We \nhave to ask ourselves whether this budget, absent an amendment such as \nthat of Senator Harkin's, will reflect and meet those priorities.\n  When we talk about our children's education, we know we have to start \nearly. Does this budget include funding for Head Start, Early Start, \nthe Early Learning Opportunities Act to the extent that our children \nand families need them? We don't know the details yet, but I am very \nconcerned that what we do know seems to indicate that important \nprograms such as Head Start and the Early Learning Opportunities Act \nmay well be at risk.\n  In fact, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the \nadministration's spending on education, training, employment, and \nsocial services does not actually include a real increase in spending. \nThe numbers have only been adjusted for inflation, which is important \nand necessary to do, but that means there hasn't been money added to \ncover the additional children who attend our public schools and rely on \nthese important programs. In fact, I believe it is correct to say that \nwe now have more children in school than we have ever had at any \nprevious time in our history. And in the absence of adding real \nresources, we are going to find ourselves, once we do get this budget, \nwhich I hope will be soon, having to take money away from programs such \nas Head Start in order to provide services for the elderly, or vice \nversa. Those are not the kinds of Hobson's choices, at a time of \nsurplus, we want in order to make the best investments, pay down the \ndebt, and provide affordable tax cuts that I think are available to us.\n  How do we expect children to enter school ready to learn if they \ndon't have the best of resources at home, which many of our children \ndon't have, and we don't help provide them through partnerships in our \ncommunities?\n  It is obviously clear, as Senators Harkin, Reed, and Kennedy pointed \nout earlier, the research is absolutely positive that a nurturing, \nstimulating child care environment has enormous positive impacts on our \nchildren. I would like to see us meet the goals outlined by Senator \nHarkin of providing eligible 3- and 4-year-olds the opportunity to \nparticipate in Head Start.\n  I also know that once our children get to school, if the classrooms \nare so crowded, if the teacher cannot even get to all of the children \nduring the day, then many children who come with a disadvantage are \nnever going to catch up. I believe we should continue the efforts we \nstarted of reducing class size and putting dollars into getting more \nqualified teachers into our classrooms.\n  With both Federal and State funding, for example, New York City has \nbeen able to reduce class size for approximately 90,000 students in the \nearly grades. That is nearly 30 percent of our entire K-through-3 \npopulation. We know from the research that we are getting better \nresults because of it.\n  Also, what we claim to be our priorities should be reflected in the \nschool buildings for students to see. We talk about how important \neducation is, and yet I know throughout New York and throughout \nAmerica, based on my own visits, there are children going to schools in \ndeplorable condition. We have many school buildings that are very old \nthat need to be upgraded.\n  Modernization costs are soaring. This administration's budget wipes \nout the $1.2 billion partnership with States and localities for \nemergency school renovation and repair. I do not believe this is the \ntime to be cutting funds that will help us modernize our schools, equip \nthem with the technologies that are needed--in fact, in some instances, \nmake them safe enough for the children and teachers who spend their \ndays in them.\n  It is not enough, though, just to reduce class size and have modern, \nwell-equipped schools. We also have to have teachers in those \nclassrooms. We are seeing shortages throughout America. For example, in \nBuffalo, 231 teachers retired last year, compared with an average of 92 \nin each of the preceding 8 years. Most telling, Buffalo lost 50 young \nteachers who moved on to other jobs or other school districts.\n  Buffalo happens to have the oldest school stock in America. Some of \nthe schools were beautifully built, but their walls are so thick that \nthey cannot be wired. I have seen schools where the wires for computers \ncome out the window and down to be hooked up.\n  For many teachers, these are impossible circumstances. That is why I \nintroduced the National Teacher and Principal Recruitment Act which I \nbelieve will bring up to 75,000 qualified teachers into our highest \nneeds school districts.\n  Later this week, I will offer an amendment to the budget resolution \nto reserve funds specifically for teacher recruitment. We have to \nensure that all our teachers get the professional development they \nneed.\n  My friends tell me it is just harder teaching these days. There are a \nlot of\n\n[[Page S3389]]\n\ncircumstances that make it harder, but the fact is, if we are going to \nput our money where our words are, then we need to invest in our \nteachers, in their professional development, in their recruitment, and \ntheir retention.\n  We also need to be sure the Federal Government lives up to its \nresponsibility to fully fund IDEA. Special education students should be \nprovided with the assistance they need to meet the academic standards \nthey are required to meet. I support Senator Harkin's amendment which \nwill work toward the goal of fully funding the Federal Government's \nshare of IDEA.\n\n  Finally, I do not think there is a more important obligation than to \nmake sure those doors to college are wide open to anyone who is willing \nto work and study hard. I support increasing the maximum Pell grant. I \nsupport expanding programs that will help our low-income and minority \nstudents get the assistance they need while they are still in high \nschool, and even junior high and middle school, so they are ready to go \non to college, by investing in programs such as TRIO and GEAR UP. It is \nimperative, especially in this economic time, to increase job training \nby nearly $1 billion a year. These are the investments we should be \nmaking.\n  I urge my colleagues to truly leave no child behind and vote in favor \nof Senator Harkin's amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \noff the resolution.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Harkin and Senator Wellstone has a \nnumber of facets to it. The first, of course, is it reduces the tax cut \nas proposed by the President by $450 billion over 10 years. That means \nit is taking money out of the taxpayers' pockets and putting that money \nsomewhere in the Federal bureaucracy.\n  One of the priorities that has been set out is a desire to take from \nthe taxpayers money the Federal Government does not actually need \nbecause the Federal Government is running a rather dramatic surplus, \n$5.6 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  The first priority the Senators laid out is education. The second \npriority is debt reduction. It takes $450 billion. It takes $225 \nbillion of that and applies it to what they claim to be debt reduction \nas the first element.\n  We need to understand that under the President's proposal, all the \ndebt that can be paid down is being paid down. President Clinton, \nbefore he left office, sent us a budget submission which told us how \nmuch the nonmarketable debt was, debt which could not be bought down by \nthe Federal Government over the next 10 years.\n  I have a chart that reflects that number. President Clinton said that \nnumber was $1.2 trillion. That is debt that cannot be retired over the \nnext 10 years. We are talking about public debt. President Bush has \nsuggested that the nonretireable debt is $1.15 trillion. Those two \nnumbers are important because President Bush reduces the retireable \ndebt the maximum amount it can be reduced. In other words, he reduces \nit down to the $1.158 trillion.\n  There is not any more debt that can be bought. We cannot go into the \nmarketplace and buy more debt unless we are willing to pay a very \nsignificant premium. The practical implication of the Harkin-Wellstone \namendment is that they want to pay a higher premium to buy back debt \nthan would have to be paid by the American taxpayers if it were \npurchased in the regular order of events. To accomplish the goals of \nthe Harkin-Wellstone amendment, we would have to, as a Government, take \nFederal tax dollars and say to people who own American debt: We are \ngoing to pay you a premium to buy it back; we are not going to retire \nit in the regular order of events; we are actually going to require or \nwe are going to ask you to pay it back to us, and because you do not \nhave to pay it back to us and you may not want to pay it back to us, we \nare going to give you a premium. We end up spending more money than is \nrequired to pay down that debt. That makes no sense at all.\n\n  What the President has proposed is that we pay down the maximum \namount of debt that can be paid down over this period. He has proposed \nbuying back more debt faster than at any other time in history. This is \na very significant point because there has been a lot of debate about \nthis in this body over the last few months as to how much debt can be \npaid down. The problem is there does not seem to be an agreement on \nthis point.\n  However, if we look at the numbers, we can conclude pretty clearly \nthat the President has chosen a reasonable figure. Why is that?\n  These are the types of debt, if we were to buy them down today, on \nwhich we would have to pay a premium. The first is coupon issues, and \nthat is $670 billion. The second is inflation-indexed issues, and that \nis $113 billion. The third is savings bonds, and that is $170 billion. \nThen comes State and local government series; that is $86 billion; \nbonds backing up emerging markets, the Brady bonds, $19 billion; and \nbonds issued as part of the S cleanup is $30 billion, and other bonds \nthat are nonretireable at $63 billion, adding to $15 billion. This was \nnot a number the President picked out of the air. It is tied to \nspecific obligations of the Federal Government which have been \ndetermined to not be retireable.\n\n  The practical effect is you cannot get below that number when you are \nbuying back debt. The Harkin-Wellstone amendment has proposed we go \nbelow that number; that we take the nonretireable debt number down to \nabout $900 billion. To do that will cost probably another $50 billion. \nWe will have to tax the American taxpayer more in order to raise money \nto buy back debt at a premium.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am happy to yield when I finish my statement.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. When you finish, don't yield to him. I want to be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will yield to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Let me complete this thought. It is so important I have to complete \nit.\n  The practical implication of the Harkin-Wellstone amendment is this: \nThe American taxpayers will have to be taxed further to pay down debt \nwhich isn't available to be bought back today because it is not \nretireable. So we end up, instead of saving money, costing the \ntaxpayers money by doing it this way.\n  That half of the Wellstone-Harkin amendment makes no sense on its \nface.\n  I yield to the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator for coming to the floor and \nspending so much time while I could not be here.\n  The poor American taxpayer. Every amendment from the other side wants \nto spend the surplus so they won't have it. Those on alert out here \nought to be the taxpayers. Every time we turn around, a huge amount of \nmoney that is scheduled under our President's proposal to go to the \ntaxpayers of America is taken away from them for another program, \nanother activity. Another Senator comes to the floor and talks about \nhow fixing up America will require us to do another 10 things.\n  Where do you think all those new things come from? They come right \nout of the surplus that was going to the American taxpayers.\n  On this particular one, listen up; the President's $1.6 trillion is \ndiminished, not by a little bit but by $450 billion. For those who \nexpressed a desire to have a tax cut, if you had the slightest sympathy \ntoward the President's tax cut, understand that all of these goodies \ntalked about don't come free. They come from somewhere. In this case, \nthey come from the taxpayers of the United States who were going to get \na $1.6 trillion tax cut.\n  Who knows what would be in it? Great Senators with more wisdom than I \nand more clairvoyance have told you how the tax cut will look. With \nthis surplus we are sending to the tax-writing committee, the $1.6 \ntrillion that the President is suggesting we send to the people of this \ncountry instead of spending it, we have no idea what the tax cuts will \nlook like. No idea. That money goes to a Finance Committee that is \nsplit even stephen with Democrats and Republicans. They have to get \ntogether and write a tax bill. How do we know how it will come out? It \nwill require Democrats to vote with Republicans for a tax bill. What \nwill those people vote for? When the taxpayers of America hear the \ndebate, and there is this huge song, ``don't give the rich a tax \nbreak,'' maybe they won't even give the rich a tax break. Maybe they \nwon't even give the rich a tax break. Who knows? They will be given\n\n[[Page S3390]]\n\na $1.6 trillion cut, if you adopt these budget numbers. Now they will \nbe given $450 billion less.\n\n  All the Senators who spoke of all the good things we could do, they \nare all good things, but remember, they are not free. In this instance, \nthey come out of a surplus that is $5.6 trillion. And we can't give the \ntaxpayer back $1.6 trillion? We will collect $27 trillion in all kinds \nof taxes during that period of time. Can we not give them back 6 \npercent when we have this huge surplus?\n  I heard the other day that I have been working on budgets when they \nwere mostly in deficits. I find it much easier to handle a budget that \nis in deficit than I do one that is in surplus. When we have one that \nis in surplus, everybody wants their hands on the surplus. I am here, \nmaybe the only one, saying $1.6 trillion of that should go back to the \ntaxpayer. I hope I have 51 Senators agree that is what we ought to do.\n  There are plenty of things that could be done by the tax-writing \ncommittees for the American taxpayer that would be very good. I will \ntalk about one right now because it gets a lot of attention from the \nother side. The other side of the aisle would not argue that the \nbeneficiaries of a growing, prospering American economy are the people. \nIn fact, the more growth for the longest period of time, the more poor \npeople get out of poverty, the more middle-income people climb to a \nhigher middle income because you have prosperity and growth. When you \nhave a surplus, what should you use it for so you can be sure you are \nproviding prosperity and growth, which every single American, rich or \npoor, certainly would like? Rich, poor, middle income, whoever is \nsitting around their breakfast table talking, whether they are \nfinishing up right now for April 15 with a $75,000 income or $150,000 \nincome, what do they want? They want to keep on earning money and keep \non getting more in their paycheck over the next decade.\n  How will that happen? It will happen if the American economy is \ngrowing so everyone has a real interest in growth, in the innovation \nthat has led to productivity increases--everybody, rich and poor.\n  The average household in America is going to participate in something \ncalled marginal rate reduction. Every level of taxation will get \nreduced, with the bottom level getting reduced twice as much as the top \nlevel. As a candidate for President and as President, why would one \never have dreamed up that in marginal rate cuts everybody gets a tax \nrate cut. Would he dream it up to help one group of citizens over \nanother? The very best advisers that we could put together were used, \nand we heard testimony from one in committee, Alan Greenspan.\n  What kind of use of a surplus is recommended? Pay down the debt as \nmuch as you can, they say. Then, surprise, surprise. They don't say, \nspend it, like we are. They say, if you are finished paying down the \ndebt, cut the marginal rate for Americans under the American tax \nsystem. Why do they say it? Because if you want prosperity and you want \ngrowth and most of all what you need in today's economy is investment. \nAsk anyone. Ask some of your Senators, ask their friends, perhaps \nsomebody they trust on Wall Street, ask them what is needed the most. \nThey will say investment. How do you get investment? By cutting the \nmarginal rates.\n  So everybody has a stake in it no matter what the other side chooses \nto call it. It is the very best thing we can do with the surplus.\n  Now, regarding the $1.6 trillion tax cut, since there is a continual \ncarping about who gets the breaks, the average across America is $1,400 \nin the hands of the taxpayer to use for what they would like, $1,400 on \naverage. In my State, it is $1,800 on average. I wonder what it is in \nthe State of the occupant of the chair. I would guess it is somewhere \nbetween $1,400 and $1,800 because of the level of income. But anyway, \nthat is speculative. The others I know.\n\n  In any event, the issue is are they apt to use that money right or \nare we apt to use it more right by spending it the way that is being \nproposed in this amendment?\n  I believe I do not have to answer that question. I believe the \nAmerican taxpayers will answer that question: You give us our $1,200, \n$1,400, $1,600, or whatever we get in a marginal rate cut. We will \nspend it better than the Government is going to spend it on new \nprograms or additions to programs that are already adequately funded.\n  I want to look at this one more time for anybody who has listened to \nthose on the other side of the aisle. Here are President Bush's \nnumbers. We have done it as well as we can to put it in our budget. The \nfirst number in red, $5.6 trillion, is the surplus, an incredible \nsurplus--in this Senator's opinion, a credible surplus. If we argue \nwhich is most apt to happen, I would say that is most apt to happen, \n$5.6 trillion, because there are others that might happen. It might be \n$12 trillion--that is what the economists say--or it might be $1 \ntrillion or $800 billion. But if you ask them what is it the most \nlikely to be, they say use that number.\n  We take Social Security out of it and that leaves a surplus for the \nrest of Government of $3.1 trillion. The Bush-Domenici budget said \nthere was plenty of support for it. I could name everybody else on it; \nit is just I happened to put his budget into language in a resolution.\n  So the next thing we do is take off the $1.6 trillion we want to give \nback. Write the tax bill however you want. We send an even number of \nDemocrats with an even number of Republicans to the Finance Committee \nand they will have to worry about how to spend that $1.6. So anybody \nwho thinks they have that formula, they have to wait around for a \ncouple of months and see what that next group of Senators does with the \ntax bill.\n  I repeat, the numbers are even Stephen in that committee: 11 \nDemocrats, 11 Republicans.\n  Just follow down. The rest of these are pretty obvious: Available for \nother priorities, $1.5 billion: Medicare/prescription drugs. Make sure \nyou keep the surplus in the health insurance program. And then debt \nservice, for $400 billion, and, lo and behold, there is $500 billion of \ncontingency fund left over.\n  Let me repeat. Whenever you have a surplus and whenever you plan to \ngive some of it back to the American people, rest assured, it will be a \nvery hard fiscal policy--it will be very hard to get the work done on \nthe floor because everybody wants a fistful of that surplus. Not for \nthe taxpayers; it is for other things that they are certain the \nGovernment will fix if we just have more money for the Government to \nspend.\n  I will give one other example. You might wonder, hearing the debate, \nhow much more we need. Somebody out there watching might have said it \nwould be interesting to know how much you are spending. Since we are \ntalking about what you want to spend in addition, it must be in \naddition to something. I thought we would just say what has happened to \neducation nationally and what is going to happen under President Bush, \nso everybody who has been hearing these debates about all we want to do \nfor education, remember, it all comes out of the taxpayer's hide. Here \nit is, starting in 1998, 29.9; 1999, 35; 36, 42, and then the \nPresident's request of 44.5. That is a 10.6-percent average increase. \nSo education is getting a pretty good chunk of money and the President \nhas asked for $2.5 billion more than we are spending this year.\n\n  I could get up here and list 25 new education programs and say we \nneed more. But let me see the next chart and I will be finished. \nPresident Clinton requested $34.7 for education. Congress gave him \n$35.6. In 2001, he requested $40 billion; we gave him $42 billion. In \n2002, he asked for $40.1 billion--interesting, no increase in President \nClinton's budget--we increased it from 42.1 to 44.6.\n  There was a whopping 25-percent increase. If there is anybody who \nthinks we are not helping education, from 2000 to 2002, we will have \nincreased it 25 percent. I am not standing here saying education does \nnot need more money, but I am wondering, when the Federal Government is \nputting in the largest share each year in education, largest increase \nin decades, whether or not the taxpayer ought to not be looked at to \nget the next piece of money out of that surplus, when we are already \ntaking care of education quite well.\n  So everybody ought to know when my friend Senator Wellstone gets up\n\n[[Page S3391]]\n\nand talks about all the things he would do, I say to Senator Lott, he \nhas 20, 30, 40 things the Government ought to do that he thinks would \nmake life better. Let me remind everyone, you have to get that from \nsomewhere, and there are only a couple of places to get it. One place \nto get it is to reduce what the taxpayers are going to get; just take \nit out of that pocket and decide we have something much better to do \nwith it than do the taxpayers.\n  We plan to give back to the American people over a decade--not \ntomorrow, not the next day--over 10 years, $1.6 trillion out of a \nsurplus of $5.6 trillion. This amendment, with all the things that have \nbeen spoken about that we will be able to do, takes $450 billion right \nout of the taxpayers. The taxpayers had a little pool of money they \nthought they were going to get back. It amounted to $1.6 trillion. This \nwill cut it to $1.150 trillion--just like that. If you do not think \nthis is an important amendment for the taxpayers, just think about \nthat. It is a pretty big change in what they might have been expecting, \nwhat the business community, through the lowering of marginal rates, \nmight have expected to get the American economy going permanently. That \nis going to be reduced by $450 billion.\n  Think carefully, Senators, when you vote on this. Have we increased \neducation? Absolutely. Does the President intend to increase it? \nAbsolutely. Does he intend to increase special ed? Absolutely, to the \nhighest levels, percentages in many, many years.\n  You have seen them up here. The facts are the facts. The Senator from \nNew Mexico is not saying you could not spend more on education, but I \nsuggest it is time to put the taxpayer right up there with any new \nprogram add-ons and ask: Don't they deserve to be considered up there \nwith any program? It is their money and they clearly ought to have a \nchance to spend it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment includes provisions that \nI believe, as the Ranking Member of the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pension Committee's Subcommittee on Employment, Safety, and \nTraining, are an essential part of fulfilling promises we have made to \nthe American people. As part of changes we made to the welfare laws, we \nsaid to families who were on welfare that if they went out to look for \na job, we'd make funds available for training and counseling to help \nthem reach that goal. We have said to workers who have lost their jobs \nthrough economic dislocation and down turns that we would make funds \navailable for training and counseling to help them find a new job or \nstart a new career. We have said to the young people in our communities \nthat we'll make funding available to help them reach their full \npotential and become productive members of their communities.\n  This was our promise, training, counseling, and other services to \nhelp families move out of poverty, move off of welfare and into good \npaying jobs.\n  And we funded that promise, last year in the amount of $6.1 billion.\n  Now, however, although it is somewhat difficult to tell because we \nhave not seen the President's budget, it appears that this \nAdministration wants to cut these funds by nearly $1 billion.\n  That is totally unacceptable. We need an increase in funding for \nthese important workforce training programs--not a decrease. We need to \nfully fund our promise to working families. We need to tell the working \nmen and women of this country, and the young people seeking to better \ntheir lives, that we believe in them, that we will support them.\n  That's what this amendment does. It fully funds our promise to the \nworking families of this country. In particular, it 1. restores the \nnearly $1 billion that we believe may be cut from workforce training \nprograms in this resolution and in the President's proposed budget, and \n2. adds an additional $900 million a year for ten years to fund adult, \nyouth, and dislocated worker training programs under the Workforce \nInvestment Act.\n  These Workforce Investment Act programs that we're trying to protect, \nand expand funding for, make a huge difference in people's lives. Let \nme give you just a few examples.\n  Judy Lundquist from the Minnesota Workforce Center in Grand Rapids \nshared this story with me:\n\n       For less than $1,000 we were able to train Bridget as a \n     Nursing Assistant, she had been a seasonal cabin cleaner \n     earning less than $2,000 a year, living in housing without \n     electricity or running water. Her husband had injured himself \n     while working for an employer that did not carry worker's \n     compensation and was unable to work in the logging industry \n     as he had been prior to his injury. On the day she passed her \n     Nursing Assistant Certification Test she obtained full-time \n     work. I saw her just before Christmas at Wal-Mart with a \n     shopping cart full of low cost Christmas Presents. They have \n     moved to housing that is more appropriate and actually has \n     running water. Once they moved and were able to afford a \n     telephone, Bridget's husband was also able to find \n     appropriate work.. We have more than recovered the cost of \n     her training in taxes on her earnings. We also trained \n     someone to help fill the urgent need in our community for \n     qualified Nursing Assistants.\n\n  And from Hennepin County's Training and Employment Assistance office \ncomes this account:\n\n       Timothy, a 41 year old unemployed factory worker, applied \n     for WIA services hoping to obtain any type of work quickly. \n     He had left his assembly job after ten years because he was \n     very discouraged about continuing this type of work. Timothy \n     had been unemployed for four months and was despondent about \n     his situation.\n       Through WIA counseling and assessment, it was determined \n     that Timothy had skills and aptitudes for a new career. \n     Timothy had obtained a degree in Divinity 17 years earlier, \n     but had never attained a position related to this degree. He \n     had, however, been active as a church member in many \n     service activities.\n       Timothy established a job goal of human service counselor. \n     His WIA counselor assisted him in revising his resume and \n     conducting a job search using the career resource room, job \n     opening information and internet job search engines. After \n     three months of participation in job search workshops and \n     interviewing, Timothy was hired as an admissions counselor \n     for an education institution.\n\n  And from Workforce Solutions in Ramsey County, we hear this about \nassistance to dislocated workers:\n\n       Our federal dislocated worker program is funded to serve, \n     in this current program year, 277 individuals. One of those \n     individuals, Steven E. came to us having been laid off by a \n     health care institution. He originally worked in the nursing \n     field. When he reached our counseling staff, not only was he \n     suffering from nearly 12 months of unemployment but chemical \n     dependency and the impact of a recent divorce. Our staff, \n     through intensive and support services, managed to get him \n     into chemical dependency treatment and worked to upgrade his \n     nursing certificate and licensure. He also participated in \n     grief and stress support groups to address his personal life \n     issues. Because of the WIA funding, he successfully completed \n     his nursing licensure upgrade, and the chemical dependency \n     treatment. Four months ago, he was hired by the American Red \n     Cross working for their blood collection and distribution \n     program.\n\n  And finally, from Central Minnesota Jobs and Training Service in \nMonticello, I hear this about the need for funding of youth training \nprograms:\n\n       [A] decrease in funding to the youth programs has a \n     significant effect on the number of youth that are able to be \n     served and the amount of services that are provided under the \n     WIA program. Offering long term services, meeting performance \n     standards, offering at a minimum of 12 month follow-up and \n     retention services, and incorporating all of the new WIA \n     youth elements, has increased the amount of staff time per \n     participant and has limited the number youth to be served \n     compared to past practices. All of the new initiatives are \n     necessary to meet the needs of the youth and long term \n     services is beneficial to their success. Without additional \n     funds, there will be a limited amount of new participants \n     being enrolled into the program in the coming years. The \n     funds will be used to work with youth already enrolled in the \n     program for many years and to offer comprehensive follow-up \n     and retention services.\n\n  The State of Minnesota included the need to increase funding for \nWorkforce Investment Act activities in their ``Federal Priorities for \n2001.'' These programs are vital to meeting our promises to the \nAmerican people, promises to move families out of poverty, off of \nwelfare, and into good paying jobs where they can earn a living wage. \nWe must honor those promises by supporting this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3391-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3391-S3399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I rise to express my strong support \nfor adequately funding federal education initiatives.\n  ``Education is,'' as historian Henry Steele Commager said, \n``essential to change, for education creates both new wants and the \nability to satisfy them.'' In this ever-changing world, it is vitally \nimportant that we make sound investments in education. The investments \nwe make today will count every day in our kids' lives.\n\n[[Page S3392]]\n\n  We have a real opportunity to greatly assist our schools by providing \nthem with additional resources to help them meet the challenges they \nface. In my home state of Montana, schools are faced with declining \nenrollments, teacher shortages, rising energy costs, and substantial \ninfrastructure needs. These are real needs that we as a nation can help \naddress.\n  Providing additional resources to help schools educate students with \nspecial needs, to recruit the best teachers, to repair or renovate \nbuildings, and to educate disadvantaged students will greatly help \neducators in Montana and around the country concentrate on delivering \nthe best education they can to our students.\n  Senator Harkin's ``Leave No Child Behind'' Amendment goes a long way \ntowards providing for these needs, making comprehensive investments in \neducation programs from pre-school to college.\n  This bill will help ensure that all children start school ready to \nlearn by investing additional resources in Head Start programs. In \nBillings, Montana, the Head Start facility is inadequate for the number \nof students it serves. In fact, they can only keep their doors open \nthrough April, when most Head Start programs are able to stay open \nthroughout the school year. Providing additional Head Start funding \nwill help give more kids in Billings a chance to start school ready to \nlearn.\n  This bill also provides for full funding for the Individuals with \nDisabilities Act (IDEA). Providing this additional funding, a share \nthat we have repeatedly promised to states and schools, would free up \nlocal and state education funds that are currently used to cover the \ncost of educating students with disabilities. With this additional \nfederal support, schools and districts will be able to better address \nlocal education priorities.\n  This bill also substantially increases funding for professional \ndevelopment opportunities for teachers, allowing them to enhance their \nknowledge and skills. Providing teachers with these opportunities will \nhelp teachers help be even better teachers and will let them know that \nwe care about their personal education needs.\n  Montana schools and teachers have had to do too much with too little \nfor too long. I want to make sure I am doing all I can to help Montana \nschools overcome their challenges and focus on providing the best \npossible education to our students.\n  The price may seem high. But the price we're paying by not investing \nin our education system--by not equipping our students with the skills \nthey will need to be successful--will be one we'll have to pay year \nafter year.\n  There can be no doubt that our education system plays a pivotal role \nin establishing our quality of life and the quality of life our \nchildren will enjoy.\n  John F. Kennedy once said, ``Our progress as a nation can be no \nswifter than our progress in education.'' Strengthening our education \nsystem is a responsibility all of us share--as individuals and as a \nnation. Let's call on each other to offer our resources as we build a \nbetter, stronger country through our commitment to our education \nsystem.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Specter and \nSenator Harkin in sponsoring this important amendment to provide the \nNational Institutes of Health with the resources it needs to continue \nits lifesaving mission. In a historic vote in 1997, the Senate pledged \nto double the funding of the NIH over the next five years, and Senator \nSpecter's amendment represents the fulfillment of that pledge for the \ncoming fiscal year.\n  The resources we devote to NIH are a basic investment in a healthy \nfuture for all Americans. Biomedical research supported by NIH has \ngiven us medical miracles undreamed of by previous generations. An \nirregular heartbeat once meant a lifetime of disability. This condition \ncan now be corrected with a pacemaker so small that it can be inserted \nunder local anesthetic using fiber optic technology. New drugs now \nallow many seniors to live a full and active life who once would have \nbeen disabled by the terrible pain of arthritis. Transplants save the \nlives of thousands of patients who once would have died of kidney \nfailure.\n  Even more astonishing discoveries will be developed in the years to \ncome. New insights into the genetic basis of disease will allow \ntreatments to be developed that are custom-made for an individual \npatient's genetic signature. Microscopic cameras are now being \ndeveloped that can be swallowed by patients to give doctors an accurate \nview of the patient's internal organs without the need for risky \nsurgery.\n  I'm proud that Massachusetts is leading the way to this remarkable \nfuture. Our state is home to many of the nation's leading biomedical \nresearch institutions and receives more than one out of every ten \ndollars that NIH spends on research, or over $1.5 billion last year \nalone. NIH grants support essential research all across the \nCommonwealth. In Boston, researchers supported by NIH discovered a link \nbetween the immune system and the brain that may lead to better \ntreatments for diseases like Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis. In \nWorcester, NIH funds are helping to build a new center for cancer \nresearch that will become a leading center in finding a cure for that \ndread disease.\n  Investment in research is the foundation on which the state's \nthriving biotechnology industry is built. There are more than 250 \nbiotech companies in Massachusetts that give good jobs to thousands of \nprofessionals across the state. These companies are an important \npartner in the nation's commitment to promoting the health of all our \ncitizens.\n  The future of biomedical research is bright, provided that we \ncontinue our strong national investment in discovery. Senator Specter's \namendment will give NIH the resources it needs to turn the \nbreakthroughs of today into the cures of tomorrow, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I have a unanimous consent request I would \nlike to propound to see if we get agreement. I believe Senator Domenici \nand Senator Conrad are familiar with it and are prepared to proceed on \nthis basis.\n  I believe we have all signed off on this.\n  I ask consent a vote occur in relation to the pending amendment at 3 \np.m. today, and the time between now and then be equally divided, and \nno other amendments be in order prior to the vote.\n  I further ask consent that the next four amendments in order to the \nsubstitute be the following in the following order: Specter regarding \nNIH, Landrieu regarding defense, Collins regarding health--home health, \nand Conrad or designee regarding debt reduction.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, if I could say to the leader \ntwo things. One, we have a slight problem. The fourth amendment will be \na Democratic amendment. We will let you know what it is; we have a \ncouple we are kicking around--a Democratic amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me make sure I understand what you are saying. This \nindicates Conrad or designee amendment regarding debt reduction. Are \nyou now saying it may not be about debt reduction?\n  Mr. REID. It may not be. There is a small universe. We will let you \nknow what it will be.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I can then modify my consent, that we line up the next \nthree and we confer further on what the next couple will be after that?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, again for clarification, I believe that we \nhave worked it out so we can go back to the original request identified \nas Specter on NIH, Landrieu regarding defense, Collins regarding home \nhealth, and Conrad or designee regarding debt reduction.\n  Of course, these amendments would be subject to the usual rules, and \nsecond-degree or some other agreement as to how they would finally be \ndisposed.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Senator Dorgan has been waiting here \nliterally\n\n[[Page S3393]]\n\nall afternoon. If we could give him 15 minutes, since he has been \nwaiting since 12:30 today to speak.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I am not sure exactly who we may be trying \nto accommodate. But I feel compelled to want to make some remarks out \nof leader time, if I have to. I think the best way to do it is to \nextend the time to 3:15, with the time equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, I don't mind extending and \ndividing it. I only intend to have an opportunity to speak for a \nsufficient amount of time. If that accommodates my interest, I ask my \ncolleague from North Dakota, it is fine with me. If it doesn't, I will \nobject.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think it accommodates your interest.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am asking the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me say, as I understand it, that we would then have \nless than two 2 minutes left. I ask the Senator from North Dakota how \nmuch time he would like.\n  Mr. REID. How about 3:20?\n  Mr. CONRAD. And have it equally divided.\n  Mr. LOTT. Absolutely, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I will try to set the example of not \nspeaking at great length hoping others will follow. I am hoping that \nmaybe the points I make will be sufficient without it being at great \nlength.\n  My colleagues, I haven't spoken about the budget resolution because \nwe are dealing with a lot of different issues and I have been meeting \nwith foreign dignitaries and because I have such ultimate confidence in \nthe managers of this legislation. Senator Domenici doesn't need a \nspeech from me or help from anybody. But we are here to be helpful.\n  I want to make two or three points that I am really worried about.\n  Are we fiddling around here while Rome is beginning to burn?\n  Today, and during the last couple of days, I have been talking with \npeople who are watching the stock market. Who knows what causes the \nstock market to move around? But I have also been talking to financial \nservice managers from companies that watch very carefully what is \nhappening in the country and in the economy. I have been talking to \nrepresentatives of manufacturers. They are telling me that the economy \nis perhaps in more trouble than any of us want to acknowledge.\n  I ask the question: OK, what do we do about it? Obviously, one thing \nis for the Federal Reserve System to do more. That is one of the places \nwhere I have over the years quite often agreed with Senator Dorgan in \nmy exasperation sometimes with the Federal Reserve System. I am not an \neconomist. I wouldn't presume to try to give advice to the Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve Board or any others.\n  But it looks to me as though instead of being overly focused on the \npossibility of inflation, we are entering a period of deflation--\ndeflation. We need the Fed to give us a little more of a hand while we \nbring in the cavalry with some additional help.\n  The only two things to do when you are having sluggishness in the \neconomy is change monetary policy or change fiscal policy. Give it a \nstimulus--i.e., tax relief.\n  Everybody on both sides of the aisle has been saying: yes; let's do \nmore. Let's do more now. Let's do it this year. Let's make sure it is \ngoing to have a greater impact in the next 2 or 3 years so the people \nwill have confidence, and so they can keep more of their money safe and \ninvest it, and do something about the economy.\n  We have two choices. The Federal Reserve can do something and/or we \ncan do something.\n  I think it is time that we pay a little attention to trying to find a \nway to give this tax relief, give this fiscal boost, and do it quickly.\n  That is my greatest concern and why I feel compelled, as I watch what \nis happening even today with the NASDAQ, what is happening with \nmanufacturing jobs, and what is happening with deflation beginning to \ncreep up on us, to say I think we have to do more.\n  Two other points: The pattern is clear. I have been in Congress for \n28 years--the same number of years as the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico. Only I spent a few years--16 years--on the other side of \nthe Capitol.\n  What we are going to have now is amendment after amendment after \namendment on both sides to add more spending--there is nothing new \nabout that--and in areas about which I believe very strongly. \nMississippi is a State with agriculture that is very important.\n  I have always thought of myself as a heavily laden hawk when it comes \nto defense. But I also like to think of myself as a cheap, heavily \nladen hawk.\n  We can all say we voted to spend more here or more there. That is the \npoint.\n  We are on the verge of everybody saying let's spend more. Let's have \nmore for defense, education, home health care, NIH, health care in \ngeneral, you name it. We get very comfortable when we start raising the \nlevel of spending.\n  But there is an added problem to it now. One amendment after another \nsays: Oh, and by the way, we will pay for it by taking hard-working \npeople's money away from them, bring it to Washington, and keep it here \nand decide how it is going to be spent. We are taking from millions of \nlaborers the bread that they have earned and bringing it up here.\n  What is new? We have been doing this for years. Spend more, raise \ntaxes, or in this case reduce, and pretty soon, if we passed every \namendment that has been offered to cut the tax bill, it would be a tax \nincrease.\n  What is happening? I hope we will think about that and try to stop \nit.\n  The amendment before us would reduce the tax cut by $448 billion and \nincrease spending for education, and supposedly accumulate cash. But \nthe fact is, once again, the tax relief would be reduced and more moved \ninto education.\n  I am not going to take a back seat to anybody when it comes to \neducation. I am the son of a schoolteacher. I went to public schools \nall my life. I worked for the University of Mississippi in four \ndifferent capacities before I began practicing law.\n  I believe in public education, and quality education across the \nboard; not just public education but choice. There is lots of variety \nin my area. Some of the best schools are Catholic or Episcopal schools.\n  I feel strongly about education. But the question is, How much is \nenough? How can we do it all at once with a 25-percent increase, as the \nSenator from New Mexico was just saying?\n  The President is asking for an increase. We are going to come back \nafter the Easter recess, and we are going to go to an education bill \nwhich may be the most bipartisan bill of the year and which is going to \nhave more spending in it. It is going to be thoughtful. It is going to \nhave reform, accountability, teacher training, and all the different \ncomponents. Yet here we are once again. Oh, yes, we will take out money \nfor agriculture and from the tax relief. We will take out money for \neducation.\n  My colleagues, it is the same thing we have been doing over all of \nthe years. It is time to stop it.\n  This is the worst time to be talking about cutting down or \neliminating tax relief.\n  I spoke this morning to the heads of a couple of major companies--\nJ.P. Morgan and Dean Witter. I don't know what the current names are \nbecause they are so long. We talked about what we can do. What can we \ndo? They said we support the tax relief and the sooner the better.\n  I oppose this amendment because I think if we don't do it, we will \nwind up with no tax relief at the worst possible time, and we will wind \nup spending the entire surplus. This is a balanced package. It reduces \nthe debt. It provides increases for defense, education, agriculture, \nand it provides tax relief for working Americans.\n  There is the sign of good government in this budget resolution. \nRemember this: We get all overwrought about this. This is just the \nwhistle at the beginning of the game. This allows us to go forward and \ndecide how much we are going to put in appropriations for Interior, for \nAgriculture, and also the tax relief package. This allows us to just go \nforward to give the President a chance to have his program considered.\n\n[[Page S3394]]\n\n  I express my support for this package, express my appreciation to \nSenator Domenici, and urge the defeat of this amendment and all \namendments that are going to keep trying to increase spending while \ncutting tax relief for working Americans.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I remind the majority leader that we \noffered, last week, to spend this week on a stimulus package. That is \nthe offer we made. We said: Look. We believe we ought to spend this \nweek doing a stimulus package. Don't hold it hostage to a 10-year \nbudget plan. Let's do it now. Let's provide some lift to this economy \nnow. And it was rejected on the other side.\n  Now they come on to the floor, and all of a sudden they are for \ntaking immediate action on a stimulus package. Where were they on \nFriday when we made the offer to spend this week on a stimulus package? \nThat is what we should have done. That would have been the right course \nfor the economy. That is what we proposed and they rejected.\n  Second, on the notion that this President somehow proposed a 25-\npercent increase for education, that is not so. The chart of the \nchairman of the Budget Committee shows very clearly the President \nproposed a 5-percent increase--not a 25-percent increase, a 5-percent \nincrease. Some of us do not think it is enough to deal with the \neducation challenge facing this country.\n  Third, the majority leader is using language very loosely, and that \nis a dangerous thing to do. He is suggesting that somebody out here is \ntalking about a tax increase. No one is talking about a tax increase--\nno one. What we are all talking about is significant tax reduction. We \nhave even agreed on an amount of tax reduction for this year to provide \nstimulus. But we do believe that over the 10 years in the future the \nPresident's tax cut is too big; that it threatens to put us back into \ndeficit; that it threatens to raid the trust funds of Medicare and \nSocial Security. And that is no longer just a worry; that has become a \nreality.\n  The two amendments that have been adopted out here--to increase \nspending on prescription drugs and to increase spending on \nagriculture--because of the way they were done, raid the Medicare trust \nfund in the years 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008--and it is all in their \nnumbers, and it is just as clear as it can be. They are into the trust \nfunds already, exactly what we said would happen.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the Senator from North Dakota is next, \nand he is yielded 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, would the distinguished Senator yield to \nme for 3 minutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I cannot, I say to the Senator, because we have the prior \nagreement. Senator Dorgan has been here for 2\\1/2\\ hours.\n  Mr. BYRD. But I wanted to ask the majority leader a question while he \nwas on the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, this is a very interesting debate. You \nnever know when you come to the floor of the Senate whether you are \ngoing to be informed or entertained. And sometimes it is a portion of \nboth.\n  I want to respond to a few things that my colleague from New Mexico \nsaid recently. I have great respect for him. He does quite a remarkable \njob steering the budget on that side of the aisle.\n  A couple things. One, this surplus for 10 years, if you listened to \nthe Senator from New Mexico, and did not know it, you would believe \nthat surplus was in a bank across the street. Why, that is money that \nis already here. That is locked in. We have that surplus handled.\n  The fact is, that surplus represents estimates by economists, some of \nwhom cannot remember their home address, but they know what is going to \nhappen 2, 5, 10 years from now. We know better than that.\n  My colleague mentioned Alan Greenspan. Ten months ago, Alan Greenspan \nincreased interest rates 50 basis points. Why? Because he was worried \nour economy was growing too fast. Now he is worried we might be heading \ntoward a recession. He could not see 10 months ahead. We can't see 10 \nmonths ahead. I do not know, now maybe there is a Ouija board or tarot \ncard or palm reader someone got ahold of someplace that gives them more \nconfidence than the rest of us about what is going to happen in the \nfuture.\n  I hope we have 10 years of surplus, 10 years of economic growth, but \nI sure would not bank on it. We would be smart to be reasonably \nconservative in the way we deal with these estimates.\n  But I want people to understand, when they listen to this debate, it \nis as if this surplus is in the bank, and it is not, and those who seem \nto allege it is know that it is not. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, my colleague said: We are going to collect $27 trillion in the \ncoming years; we surely can provide a reasonable tax cut out of that.\n  I do not think he meant to include $27 trillion. Madam President, $9 \ntrillion of that belongs to Social Security and Medicare. The people \nwho pay that in, pay it in to a trust fund with the expectation that \nthose who handle it will do so responsibly; that is, not spend it for \nother things but to save it in a trust fund.\n  I do not expect that the Senator, or others, intend to say that $9 \ntrillion is available to be discussed with respect to a tax cut, and \nyet they do. It is not right. They know that.\n  Then the issue of debt. I want to talk about the education issue in a \nmoment. I would like to ask my colleague from New Mexico a question. \nAnd I would ask my colleague from North Dakota a question.\n  What I show you is a description of what President Bush sent us from \nthe Office of Management and Budget. And this is the budget resolution \nwe have on the floor. On page 5, line 19, it says: Public debt. Public \ndebt grows from fiscal year 2001--that is the year we are in--$5.5 \ntrillion, to fiscal year 2011, $6.7 trillion.\n  Let me show what it looks like on a graph.\n  Now I will ask a question, if someone would come to the floor from \nthe other side so we can examine why they say you can't pay down \nadditional debt: If during the 10 or 11 years of their budget \nresolution the gross debt is increasing, and if they say it is not, go \nto page 5, line 19 of their resolution.\n  In fiscal year 2011, they say that gross public debt is going to be \n$6.7 trillion. Is gross public debt increasing or is it decreasing?\n  We know the answer to that. No one will come to the floor to talk \nabout it. I hope my colleague, Senator Conrad, will allow us some time \nwhen perhaps our colleagues are on the floor--the Senator from New \nHampshire, who spoke on this at some length earlier, or the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, who said we can discuss this.\n  There is not enough debt out there to repay? Maybe we can find some \non page 5 of your resolution. Maybe we ought to start paying a little \non that. Because your debt is increasing.\n  We will talk more about that when someone will show up to answer a \nquestion. I hope we can have a discussion about that.\n  I happen to think, when we talk about values, that one of the values \nwe ought to think important is that if during tougher times you run up \na debt, during better times you ought to try to pay it down. And debt \nis not just debt held by the public; it is all debt incurred by the \nFederal Government, all of the Federal Government's liabilities. And \nthis, on page 5 of their own resolution, describes an increase of over \n$1.2 trillion in indebtedness or liability by the Federal Government.\n  Let me turn to this amendment because we are obviously not going to \nhave a discussion about this at the moment. The question of whether \n``Leave No Child Behind'' is a bumper sticker, a political slogan, or \npublic policy, is what we will answer in this Chamber. Perhaps there \nare some who embrace all of that. There are some who certainly would \nuse it as a bumper sticker; some as a political slogan.\n  How many are there in this Chamber who will embrace ``Leave No \nChildren Behind'' as public policy? That is the question. We can all \ndescribe our experience with education. And for those\n\n[[Page S3395]]\n\nwho trash our education system--and there are many who do it all the \ntime--I ask them, how do you think the United States of America came to \nthis moment in history? How do you think we arrived at this moment? \nMight it not have been because we have a universal system of education \nin which we have a public education system that says every child in \nAmerica--no matter from where they come, no matter how fat or thin the \nwallet of their parents, no matter their circumstances in life--can be \nwhatever their God-given talent allows them to be as children of this \ngreat country? Isn't that perhaps what has given us this opportunity to \narrive at this moment in history?\n  Do we have challenges in this system of education? You bet we do. \nShould we fix them and address them? Absolutely. Can we do that just by \ntalking? No. No. It takes some money to keep good teachers. It does \ntake some money to reduce classroom sizes so kids are in a classroom of \n15 or 18 students, not 30 or 35, so they are in a school that is well \nrepaired, not in some sort of a trailer outside the school, in mobiles \nthat are ill-equipped.\n  We need to do right by our children. That is what this debate is \nabout. My colleagues have offered an amendment I intend to support. I \nam happy to support it because it moves us in the right direction. You \ncan't talk about these issues without understanding a requirement to \naddress them boldly.\n  It is interesting; all the debate on this is about spending. If you \ndon't believe that investment in our children is an investment in this \ncountry, then you don't understand anything about the management of \nmoney. There is a difference between spending and investing. When we do \nright by our kids, when we strengthen America's schools, we invest in \nthis country's future. It is just as simple as that.\n  Some say this is a tradeoff, this is an offset issue; it is between \ntax cuts and education. We will have a debate about tax cuts at some \npoint. I happen to think we should have a tax cut. My colleague just \ndescribed our offer to use this week for an immediate tax cut to \nprovide some fiscal stimulus. The other side didn't want to do that. \nNow we have heard they would like some fiscal stimulus. We offered \nthat, but they didn't want to do that.\n  We will have a tax cut. We ought to do it in a way that is fair to \nall taxpayers. We ought to do it in a manner that gives this economy a \nboost. It is not a circumstance where every single dollar is offset to \nmake a choice between a tax cut or education. There are some of us who \nbelieve that if you add the payroll taxes paid by individuals and the \nincome taxes paid by individuals and if the top 1 percent of the \nAmerican people who have done very well--and God bless them--paid 21 \npercent of that, and the majority party says, we want to give 43 \npercent of the tax cuts to them, we say: Wait a second. That is not \nsomething we ought to do. That is not a fair tax cut.\n  We are going to have that debate at some point. But we ought to be \nable to provide a tax cut and also do right by our children and \nstrengthen America's schools.\n  The Harkin amendment has $225 billion for education and also $225 \nbillion for debt reduction because he also values not only investing in \nour kids by strengthening our schools but addressing this issue as \nwell.\n  My hope, I say to my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, and \nalso the distinguished chair of the Budget Committee, is that we can \nhave a good discussion about this issue of debt, the increase in the \ngross Federal debt. I don't know that we can have it at this moment \nbecause we are headed towards a vote.\n  I would like very much to spend some time understanding how one \nrationalizes the increase in debt and the increase in liabilities in \nthe Federal budget as outlined on page 5, line 19, of the majority \nbudget--an increase of $1.2 trillion in indebtedness--how one \nrationalizes that with this notion that we have $27 trillion, according \nto them, in income.\n  We have surpluses that are almost locked in a bank, and they have the \nkey in their pocket, and they have apparently used a Ouija board to \ndiscern what is going to happen in the coming 10 years. I would like to \nunderstand the rationale of all of this. I think it is time to talk \nstraight about all of these things in terms of what we have available, \ndo it conservatively, and then make cautious judgments about what will \nstrengthen and improve this country. Yes, a tax cut will; I support \none. Yes, paying down the Federal debt will, and I support that. And \nyes, investing in America's schools will strengthen this country, and I \nbelieve we ought to do that as well.\n\n  Madam President, this will be an instructive debate, and it will be \nan opportunity, as we vote, for people to tell us, is ``Leave No Child \nBehind'' a bumper sticker or is it real public policy this Senate \nembraces.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I believe I have 5 or 6 minutes \nremaining; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We then go to a vote under the UC, as it exists.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So Senators should know that that is about the time we \nare going to vote. I want to make sure they know that because they have \nbeen waiting.\n  First of all, I think we ought to be careful about accusing the other \nside of speaking loosely. I can see about 10 examples in my mind's eye \nof saying they spoke loosely. I choose to say they spoke what they \nbelieved and we speak what we believe. I don't think it is loosely; I \nthink it is very deliberate, and it is very thoughtful on both sides.\n  I have a rough estimate, so the American people will know. We are \ngoing to spend $44 billion on education this year, the National \nGovernment. We are going to spend $500 billion over the next decade. \nThat is half a trillion dollars. So the point of it is, while some may \nnot think that is enough--and maybe I would even join in saying we \nought to do more--I think we are on a pretty good growth path for \neducation. And everybody should know that over the next decade we are a \nsmall contributor to education. That is the way it has been. We are \nbetween 6.5 and 7.5 percent of public education. So everybody will know \nthe dimension of our involvement.\n  Nonetheless, we are going to spend half a trillion dollars. It will \nbe growing substantially each year. The point I am trying to make is, \nat some point you have to raise the level of the concern for the \ntaxpayer to an equal level with those who would increase spending from \nwhat is already a very high level of spending. So the American people \nshould know we are spending a lot on education. It is going up each \nyear. I just showed how much. And it is going to continue going up. \nShould we not at some point in time bring the taxpayer into this and \nsay: OK, Mr. and Mrs. Hard Working American, would you like to get some \nof your tax dollars back or would you like for us to take every program \nthat sounds good, no matter what the level of spending nationally, and \nlet's add some more to it, and then we will consider you later on? I \ndon't think that is what the American taxpayer wants.\n\n  In fact, I think they want a fair break out of this, and a fair break \nis over the next 10 years giving them back 6.4 percent of what they pay \nin in taxes. That is what we are talking about. When we get away from \nthe big numbers and get into 6 cents out of every dollar, we are \ntalking about 6 percent, giving 6 percent of the tax taken from the \ntaxpayer back to the taxpayer over the next decade when we are running \nvery big surpluses.\n  Frankly, I will answer one further insinuation. The insinuation is \nthat the Senator from New Mexico is talking about these surpluses as if \nthey were there tomorrow. I believe they are as good estimates as we \nare ever going to get, and there is a high probability that they are \ngoing to be right. But if the estimates are not any good, then they \nought not to be any good to add spending based on them either.\n  So if you have something down here where you want to spend half that \ntax money on new programs, you ought to be thinking, maybe the tax \nsurplus is not real. We don't want you to think it is real because we \ndon't want you to use it for tax dollars, but we would like to use it \nfor something else.\n  With that, I yield back any time I might have.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is there any time remaining?\n\n[[Page S3396]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is to occur at 3:20 by previous \norder.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask that Senator Harkin be given the last 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I object. I don't know why we ought to do that. Then I \nget 2 minutes, too. You have been arguing for about an hour more than \nwe have on this amendment. I just think, being fair, we are finished. I \nyielded back my time. That is why we still have some time left. I could \nhave still been talking.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n185.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 53, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 69 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--53\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 185) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote by \nwhich the amendment was just agreed to. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion has been entered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Byrd has indicated he would like to \nhave an exchange, a colloquy. This seems a good time to do it. I might \nsay also, it would be our hope and intent now that we would go on to \nthe next amendment. Senator Specter is ready with an amendment on NIH. \nSo I hope we can--I talked to Senator Daschle about that--go ahead and \nproceed with the next amendment that was in order.\n  I would be glad to respond to a question or a comment Senator Byrd \nmight have.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader for his \nmaking possible an inquiry at this point.\n  As Senators know, I am, I think, the Senator who has had more of a \npart in writing the Budget Reform Act than any other Senator who today \nserves in the Senate. I believe, with all my heart, that the \nreconciliation instruction process was never meant to be used as a \nprocedure for cutting taxes. It has been my belief, from the beginning, \nthat the purpose of the reconciliation process is to reduce deficits. \nAnd the process has been useful in that regard over a period of several \nyears.\n  I am very concerned that the Senate is about to use the process in a \nway for which it was not intended. I think a point of order, if made, \nwould nail in the precedent that it is quite all right to use the \nreconciliation process to cut taxes. So I do not want to do that. If, \nand when, that time comes, I prefer to just vote up or down and let the \nchips fall where they may.\n  So I have a couple of questions I wish to ask of the distinguished \nmajority leader. One would be in light of the fact that we only have, I \nbelieve, about 30 hours remaining.\n  Mr. REID. That is true.\n  Mr. BYRD. And I feel sure the majority leader is concerned about this \nas much as I am because I have already heard him say some things today \nthat would lead me to believe that.\n  My question would be--and he might not want to answer it at this \npoint--but when are we going to get to the reconciliation vote on this \nconcurrent resolution on the budget? When are we going to get to it? \nWhen we reach that point, we need some time to debate it. I would like \nto speak at least 45 minutes or an hour on that subject.\n  Our time is being eaten up. I am not complaining about that except to \nsay we are not going to have enough time to debate the most important \nquestion that will come before us unless we get to that matter soon.\n  Another question which I wish to propound to the distinguished \nmajority leader, I think it is very important that the Senate have \nbefore it the President's budget before the Senate votes on final \npassage of the concurrent resolution on the budget. I think if we can \nsee what is in the President's budget, we will see that some programs, \nthat are very important to Senators on both sides of the aisle, are \nprobably going to be reduced in order to make way for the tax cut. I \nthink Senators should know these things before they vote on this \nresolution that is before the Senate.\n\n  I will not proceed further to make that case. I think it is a solid \ncase, and I think there is every reason why Senators ought to have the \nbudget at their fingertips before they cast that final vote. That has \nbeen my hope all along.\n  The President had earlier indicated, I believe, that he would submit \nhis budget to the Congress on this past Monday, and then later changed \nhis mind to say it would be sent up on the 9th, which will be next \nMonday.\n  I must say, earlier I had thought, Mr. Leader, of using some dilatory \ntactics in order to put the Senate over to Wednesday. I watched the \ndebate on the natural gas bill in 1977, at which time two Senators--Mr. \nMetzenbaum and Mr. Abourezk--kept this Senate from reaching a decision \n13 days and 1 night and still had hundreds of amendments and just as \nmany dilatory actions available as ever.\n  I know it can be done. I know how to do it. But it was decided in the \nDemocratic Caucus that we would not do that. We do, however, still need \nto see that budget. I think there is every reason the American people \nshould know what is in the President's budget before their elected \nrepresentatives in this body cast their votes in connection therewith.\n  Consequently, I ask this question: Would it be possible--this will be \na matter for both leaders, not just the majority leader, but mainly the \nmajority leader--would it be possible to put this matter over until \nnext Wednesday, which would allow Monday for the President to send his \nbudget up to the Congress and then would allow the Senate Tuesday and \nWednesday in which to amend, to debate, and to make a final decision on \nthe concurrent resolution on the budget? In the meantime a decision \ncould be made with respect to the reconciliation resolution as well. It \nmight very well be that a time agreement could be worked out, and the \nmajority leader has been interested in that. I have been interested in \nit. Mr. Gramm and Mr. Domenici have expressed some interest in it. Mr. \nNickles has expressed interest, and others.\n  I think there is every good reason why it might be wise to do that. A \nunanimous consent request hase been under consideration. The majority \nleader discussed this again with me briefly last night at the time of \nthe reception the Senate was having in honor of the spouses of the \nSenators. Would it be possible to delay final passage of the budget \nresolution until next Wednesday? I know it would inconvenience some \nSenators. But what is more important? The inconvenience to the \nSenators, or wisdom and the proper judgment when it comes to casting \nour votes for those whom we represent?\n\n[[Page S3397]]\n\n  I don't think there is a Senator here who would disagree with my \nstatement that, yes, there will be inconveniences, perhaps some trips \nwould have to be canceled, but that is all in a day's work. We get paid \nfor our work. We have a responsibility to our people. Perhaps there \nwill be no more important vote that will be cast by the Senate than the \nvote on this concurrent budget resolution and the vote with respect to \nthe reconciliation process.\n  That ends my question.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe there were actually several ideas \nor questions propounded there. I will try to respond as directly and as \nbriefly to them as I can so we can go forward with the next amendment \nthat is pending.\n  First of all, as to when to take up the issue of reconciliation and \nthe process for giving working people tax relief to be able to keep a \nlittle bit more of their money at home, I think clearly it needs to \ncome relatively shortly, I assume tomorrow, in whatever form it might \nbe so that there will be ample time to discuss it fully. I know that \nSenators on both sides of the aisle will want to be heard on that.\n  I must say that if we start down this trail of spending all the \nmoney, there won't be anything left for tax relief anyway so we won't \nneed this reconciliation process. I think clearly to have tax cut in \nreconciliation is something that we would like to have considered and \nwould be prepared to act on it. But as the Senator knows, we would be \nwilling to consider doing it another way, doing it the way it was done \neven back in the 1980s. We have offered an idea, a unanimous consent \nagreement to Senator Byrd, and I have discussed it with Senator \nDaschle. Senators on this side have looked at that. I thought perhaps \nwe could get something worked out on that, and we could get that done.\n  We would have to consult with the chairman of the Finance Committee \nand the ranking member on the Finance Committee, make sure everybody \nunderstood how that would work and make sure that it would give us some \nof the important benefits that reconciliation gives you, even though it \nwouldn't do it that way.\n\n  We will be glad to continue to work with you and with others on the \npossibility of doing it through a unanimous consent agreement. I have \ndiscussed this with Senator Domenici and with Senator Grassley. They \nare interested, willing to work on it. They just want to make sure they \nknow what is in it, and I think everybody on both sides wants to do \nthat.\n  As far as the President's budget, we have the outlines of the main \ncategories that the President is suggesting. I guess if we waited later \non, we would get line by line by line. I don't think that is what a \nbudget resolution does. A budget resolution sets the broad categories \nand then we go forward. Then in the Appropriations Committee, for \ninstance, they decide how much they are going to put in there for \nInterior or Transportation. I don't believe the President dictates \nthat. We have acted before when we didn't have the President's budget.\n  As far as the idea of postponing it, there would be two or three \nproblems with that. We had not indicated that we were thinking about \ndoing that. We would have to check on both sides with 100 Senators to \nmake sure that their schedules could be changed to that effect. I \nsuspect there would be a lot of resistance to it. We would have to \ncheck with both sides of the aisle on that. Worst of all, in my \nopinion, we need to move forward. We need to move forward with this \nbudget resolution--good, bad, ugly. We ought to move it on into \nconference and see if we can get an agreement there and then come back \nand vote on it so we can get on with the substantive business. This \njust gives us the outlines of how we can proceed and then we get into \nthe details: What we do on Medicare, what we do on defense, and what we \ndo on tax policy.\n  I think we ought to go ahead. I spoke earlier about my concern about \nthe economy and the need for us to get this process on down the road so \nthat we can be looking at taking some action on tax policy and on \nsubstantive issues, too.\n  I see Senator Domenici. As chairman of the Budget Committee, I don't \nwant to try to respond to all of this. Some of it being in his \njurisdiction, would he like to comment on this, too?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I surely don't want to use much time. You have answered \nwith the authority of the majority leader. I just wanted to say to you, \nMr. Leader, and to you, Senator Byrd, I never in my wildest dreams \nthought we would finish this budget resolution without your spending an \nhour on a subject you think is most important; namely, reconciliation. \nWe have already spent a lot of hours debating. Frankly, in my opinion, \nalthough the debates were luxurious, I think it would have served us \nwell if you would have already taken an hour and I would have taken an \nhour and Senator Conrad taken an hour and we discussed reconciliation. \nI don't intend to get finished without that hour of debate about what \nit is all about and what it means taking place. As soon as we can, I \nwould be for working it out. Our leader thinks we should work it out on \nan issue that is formulated before the Senate.\n  I do want to comment, since you have indicated two things. One, we \nshould have the President's budget first. That is OK. That is a good \nwish. I would suggest that when we had a new President named Bill \nClinton, we didn't have a budget before we approved the budget \nresolution, including the conference report on the budget resolution. \nThen we got a budget. I think there is precedent for a new President \nfor us to proceed.\n  Secondly, I think you did do more than, as much as anyone present \nhere, of course, in drafting this 25-year old Budget Impoundment Act. \nFrankly, you have one version about reconciliation that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, who has now used your product you developed with \nothers--I have used it as chairman or ranking member or member for 25 \nyears. So while you drew it, I have watched it implemented.\n  I will present to the Senate my strong conviction that there is \nnothing in this act that precludes using reconciliation for a tax \ndecrease bill. I just wanted to make sure I amplified to that extent.\n  Mr. BYRD. I don't want to take a lot of time. Let me just say this: \nWe can argue back and forth as to what has been done in the past. I \nthink we have to deal with what is in the present. We have here ``A \nBlueprint for New Beginnings.'' My problem with this is that it is kind \nof a peekaboo budget. You see just a little of the budget. But what I \nsee is disturbing. For example, with respect to the research in fossil \nfuel, that is going to be cut. That is important to the energy \nresources of this Nation, particularly at this time.\n\n  Now we have the clean coal technology program, for which the \nPresident has said he supports a $2 billion increase. That is well and \ngood. But the problem is, as I look through this peekaboo budget, I \nfind that much of the money he is going to put into clean coal \ntechnology is going to come out of fossil fuel research. That is \nimportant to coal, oil, and gas. That is just one thing of which I got \na little glimpse. I think we will find the word ``redirect'' in this \nblueprint a number of times.\n  I noted in the Washington Post of Sunday, April 1, that the Community \nPolicing Service Program, COPS, would be cut by 13 percent, from $1 \nbillion to about $850 million. I noted also in the New York Times--I \nbelieve, of yesterday--well, I don't seem to have it at my fingertips, \nbut some programs are going to be cut. I think Senators should know \nwhat programs are proposed to be cut in the President's budget before \nthey vote on final passage of this concurrent resolution on the budget \nbefore us.\n  I am going to take my seat soon, but for these reasons, which could \nbe debated at considerable length, I hope it will be possible to have \nthe President's budget before we take the final plunge on the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget. It seems to me it isn't too much \nto ask that that final action--perhaps the final 10 hours, if it could \nbe worked out that way--be put over until next Tuesday or Wednesday.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. If I have the time, yes.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator, I appreciate very much directing his \nattention to this. I think we would be better off putting this off \nuntil we got back from the break. I think we have 30 hours left. \nEverybody is trying to finish this bill by tomorrow. In the back\n\n[[Page S3398]]\n\nroom, I say to the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, we \nhave over 120 amendments just on our side. You know, unless we have \nsome time to work this out, there is going to be a big vote-athon. We \nneed to do this with wisdom and discretion and have a document before \nmaking a decision.\n  I think the Senator is right on the ball, right in the direct line in \nwhich we should be going. This is so important, I would be willing to \ncancel what I have next week in Nevada and do this. But if people are \nunwilling to do that, let's do it after we come back, set it at a \ncertain time and have a unanimous consent agreement that we can \ncomplete this thing in a matter of a day or two. People would feel \nbetter about it. We can sift through the 120 amendments and get to what \nreally needs to be done.\n  Senator Conrad has done a wonderful job of managing this bill. I \ndon't know of anybody who has ever managed a bill better than he has. \nBut with these time constraints and big things such as debt reduction, \ndefense, reconciliation, his hands are tied to manage this bill \nproperly. I certainly think the Senator from West Virginia is headed in \nthe right direction.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If the Senator will yield to me for a moment, and I \nunderstand the ranking member wants to speak. What I have here is also \na peekaboo budget, but it is not President Bush's, it is President \nClinton's. It is a peekaboo budget, borrowing your expression. It is \n``A Vision of Change for America,'' but it is not a budget.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This was sent up here on February 17, and in a \nmarvelous show of support for the new President, before any budget was \nforthcoming, a budget resolution was adopted based on this peekaboo \nbudget.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is a peekaboo budget.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It went to conference for him, and it came back as a \nconferred-upon bill. So we are kind of used to looking at what you all \ndo, and then when you are doing something really borderline \nspectacular, we say we would like to be a mimic. You did it in such a \ngreat fashion for him, we wanted to do a little bit for President Bush.\n  Mr. BYRD. I wish the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, \nhowever, had had a markup in the committee, as was the case when that \npeekaboo budget was sent up here in 1993.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator will admit, will he not, that the Budget \nCommittee did, in that instance, 1993, have a markup in the committee \nand then reported that measure out of the committee with a report? And \nI assume the minority was allowed to publish its views. Would the \nSenator respond? Was that not the case with that 1993 peekaboo budget?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Indeed, it was.\n  Mr. BYRD. In the case of that 1993 peekaboo budget, did the \ncommittee, in that instance, report out a bill? Did it mark up the \nbill?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, it did.\n  Mr. BYRD. If it did, why doesn't the Senator, who admires that role \nmodel, wish to have a markup in the committee and report out a \nconcurrent resolution on this budget?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, I tried to explain the difference. You had the \nluxury of a majority here in the Senate. In fact, you had three votes \nmore than a majority. We went in the Budget Committee not even stephen. \nEverybody already made up their minds. You had a majority of Democrats \nwilling to vote out a Presidential budget when Republicans didn't want \nit. So it is the same thing I had, except it turns out 11-11, an equal \nnumber. So there is a very big difference.\n  Mr. BYRD. There is a difference, but, with all due respect, that is \nno reason not to have a markup. Just because the people saw fit to make \nit 50/50 in this Senate, that is no reason to avoid having a markup in \ncommittee. We have a responsibility to the people who send us here to \nhave a markup in the committee.\n  The point I am trying to make is that we ought to see the President's \nbudget. It would not be asking too much of all of us, I don't think, to \nhold over until next Tuesday or Wednesday to complete action on this \nconcurrent resolution on the budget. Let us see the President's budget.\n  While I have the floor--and then I will sit down--I have the New York \nTimes of Wednesday, April 4. I will read the headline: ``Bush Budget on \nHealth Care Would Cut Aid to Uninsured.''\n  That is one example of why I think the Senate ought to have the \nPresident's budget. We don't know what is in it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Isn't it true that while President Clinton had not \nsubmitted a full budget, he had submitted sufficient detail so the cost \nof his budget proposals could be estimated by the Committee on the \nBudget, the CBO, the Joint Committee on Taxation, and so the Senate, \nacting in 1993, had all of the reestimates done that told us the cost \nof his proposal?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, absolutely.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And is it not true as well that President Bush has not \nsubmitted sufficient detail for the Congressional Budget Office or the \nJoint Committee on Taxation to do the reestimates that were done on the \nprevious President's budget, so we do not have those reestimates; isn't \nthat true?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is preeminently correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will go on, if I can, when we look at the level of \ndetail that has been provided by President Bush versus President \nClinton, there is a very stark and glaring set of differences. For \nexample, the Clinton document had tables that provided year-by-year \nbudget numbers for 68 specific proposals to reduce discretionary \nspending.\n  The tables also included the year-by-year numbers for 90 specific \nproposals to cut mandatory spending.\n  The budget also provided year-by-year detail for proposed increases \nin spending.\n  The Bush budget does not provide any year-by-year numbers for \nspecific proposed changes in discretionary spending; is that not the \ncase?\n  Mr. BYRD. Oh, absolutely; no question about it; absolutely.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So to compare 1993 to this year does not really stack up, \ndoes not hold up under much scrutiny because, as the Senator from West \nVirginia has made so clear, we had full reestimates then of the cost of \nthe President's tax-and-spending proposals, sufficient detail for the \nCongressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation to tell \nus what those costs were. We do not have it now. And we had a full \nBudget Committee markup then. We do not have any Budget Committee \nmarkup now.\n  The fact is, we do not have sufficient detail from the President to \nhave the kind of objective independent analysis done to inform the \nSenate of the cost of the President's tax-and-spending proposals.\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely. Moreover, that was a budget for 5 years. That \nwas a 5-year plan in 1993. This is a 10-year plan. Additionally, the \nresolution was used in that instance to reduce deficits, not to \nincrease them.\n  Finally, my good friend from New Mexico speaks of that 1993 budget as \na role model. Not one of the Senators on that side of the aisle voted \nfor it. Not one Republican in the House voted for it.\n  What did it do? It put the Nation on the course for reduction of the \ndeficits and for the accumulation of huge projected surpluses. Whether \nthey ever materialize or not is another question. But what are we so \nafraid of? Why is this Senate afraid to see the President's budget?\n  Mr. CONRAD. We were promised the President's budget, were we not? We \nwere promised it was going to be here on April 2 before we took up a \nbudget resolution on the floor. And presto disto, the next thing we \nknow, there is no budget until April 9 when we have completed action. \nIt is a very unusual circumstance.\n  If we are going to be fair and objective about comparing 1993 to now, \nwe will see there are very significant differences. Most significant, \nwe have had no budget markup in the committee, and there was sufficient \ndetail on what President Clinton sent us that the Congressional Budget \nOffice and the Joint Committee on Taxation were able to give us an \nobjective independent analysis of the cost of the President's spending-\nand-tax proposals which we do not have here. We do not have them.\n\n[[Page S3399]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very able majority leader for \nhis courtesy in calling attention to the inquiry I had previously \nindicated I wanted to make, and for his listening to it. I am sure he \nwill give some consideration to it. I hope he will. And I hope all \nSenators will be willing to consider the request to go over until next \nTuesday or Wednesday so that we might have the benefit of having the \ninformation that is in the President's budget.\n  I am sure it is not very far away. It is probably on the printing \npresses within three blocks of this Chamber right now. If they plan to \nhave it up here next Monday, it is available somewhere right now.\n  I thank the majority leader for entertaining my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania is going to go next. I did not want to keep burdening \nSenator Byrd with my statements. He has made his. I want to make mine.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the introduction of \nthe President's revenue proposals by the Joint Committee on Taxation, \nMarch 8, 1993.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       This pamphlet, prepared by the staff of the Joint Committee \n     on Taxation, provides a summary of the revenue provisions \n     included in the President's budget proposal, as submitted to \n     the Congress on February 17, 1993.\n       The provisions summarized in this pamphlet are those \n     revenue proposals contained in the Department of the Treasury \n     document, Summary of the Administration's Revenue Proposals, \n     February 1993 (``Treasury document''). The pamphlet also \n     summarizes three other revenue proposals included in the \n     Office of Management and Budget document, A Vision of Change \n     for America, February 17, 1993 (``OMB document''), that would \n     amend the Internal Revenue Code: taxation of social security \n     benefits; increase of inland waterways fuel excise tax; and \n     use of Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund amounts for \n     administrative expenses.\n       The pamphlet descriptions of the President's proposals are \n     taken without modification from the Treasury document and the \n     OMB document. The pamphlet summary description includes \n     present law and a reference to any recent prior Congressional \n     action on the topic and whether the proposal (or a similar \n     proposal) was included in recent budget proposals (fiscal \n     years 1990-1993). Part I of the pamphlet summarizes the \n     revenue-reduction proposals from the Treasury document; Part \n     II summarizes the revenue-raising proposals from the Treasury \n     document; and Part III summarizes three additional revenue \n     proposals from the OMB document.\n       The Treasury document's introductory statement indicates \n     that ``[t]he descriptions included in this report are not \n     intended to be final. Many of the proposals will be revised \n     in the process of finalizing the Administration's fiscal year \n     1994 Budget. The descriptions are also not intended to be \n     comprehensive. Numerous details, such as rules relating to \n     the prevention of abusive transactions and the limitation of \n     tax benefits consistent with the principles of the proposals, \n     will be provided in connection with the presentation of the \n     Budget and upon submission of legislation to implement the \n     Administration's plan.''\n       Further, the Treasury document states that ``[i]n addition \n     to the proposals summarized in this report, the \n     Administration also supports initiatives to promote sensible \n     and equitable administration of the internal revenue laws. \n     These include simplification, good governance and technical \n     correction proposals.''\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, that is the Joint Committee's \nintroduction on President Clinton's tax package that was considered, \nvoted on, passed, went to conference with the House and passed, and \nthis is all they could say about what the President submitted:\n\n       The Treasury document's introductory statement indicates \n     that ``[t]he descriptions included in this report are not \n     intended to be final. Many of the proposals will be revised \n     in the process of finalizing the Administration's fiscal year \n     1994 Budget. The descriptions are also not intended to be \n     comprehensive. Numerous details, such as . . . limitation of \n     tax benefits consistent with the principles of the proposals, \n     will be provided in--\n\n  And it goes on.\n  I want everybody to know, according to the tax Web site, no tax \nrevenue tables were available with reference to President Clinton's \nbudget until way past the time the budget resolution was considered. As \na matter of fact, the first tax tables were not made available to the \nWays and Means Committee until May 4 of 1993, the second tables on June \n17, 1993, and we had already produced the budget resolution in both \nHouses, gone to conference, and adopted it.\n  I do not care to go on forever. I believe we ought to treat President \nBush, as well as Republicans and Members of the Senate, as President \nClinton was treated when he was a so-called brand new President.\n\n  We will proceed, and I want the Record to show, and I will put the \nletter in tomorrow, that every member of the Budget Committee on the \nRepublican side asked the chairman, this chairman, not to consider \nmarkup because they said it would not yield any fruitful results. While \nthat is my decision, I want everybody to know I did not make it \nsingularly. I had a pretty good backing from Republicans who did not \nthink it would amount to anything other than long, protracted debates \nand nothing positive would be accomplished.\n  Before we proceed and I yield to my friend from Pennsylvania, I was \nasked by the majority leader to propose what I assume is a usual \nconsent request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3391-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3391-S3399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I rise to express my strong support \nfor adequately funding federal education initiatives.\n  ``Education is,'' as historian Henry Steele Commager said, \n``essential to change, for education creates both new wants and the \nability to satisfy them.'' In this ever-changing world, it is vitally \nimportant that we make sound investments in education. The investments \nwe make today will count every day in our kids' lives.\n\n[[Page S3392]]\n\n  We have a real opportunity to greatly assist our schools by providing \nthem with additional resources to help them meet the challenges they \nface. In my home state of Montana, schools are faced with declining \nenrollments, teacher shortages, rising energy costs, and substantial \ninfrastructure needs. These are real needs that we as a nation can help \naddress.\n  Providing additional resources to help schools educate students with \nspecial needs, to recruit the best teachers, to repair or renovate \nbuildings, and to educate disadvantaged students will greatly help \neducators in Montana and around the country concentrate on delivering \nthe best education they can to our students.\n  Senator Harkin's ``Leave No Child Behind'' Amendment goes a long way \ntowards providing for these needs, making comprehensive investments in \neducation programs from pre-school to college.\n  This bill will help ensure that all children start school ready to \nlearn by investing additional resources in Head Start programs. In \nBillings, Montana, the Head Start facility is inadequate for the number \nof students it serves. In fact, they can only keep their doors open \nthrough April, when most Head Start programs are able to stay open \nthroughout the school year. Providing additional Head Start funding \nwill help give more kids in Billings a chance to start school ready to \nlearn.\n  This bill also provides for full funding for the Individuals with \nDisabilities Act (IDEA). Providing this additional funding, a share \nthat we have repeatedly promised to states and schools, would free up \nlocal and state education funds that are currently used to cover the \ncost of educating students with disabilities. With this additional \nfederal support, schools and districts will be able to better address \nlocal education priorities.\n  This bill also substantially increases funding for professional \ndevelopment opportunities for teachers, allowing them to enhance their \nknowledge and skills. Providing teachers with these opportunities will \nhelp teachers help be even better teachers and will let them know that \nwe care about their personal education needs.\n  Montana schools and teachers have had to do too much with too little \nfor too long. I want to make sure I am doing all I can to help Montana \nschools overcome their challenges and focus on providing the best \npossible education to our students.\n  The price may seem high. But the price we're paying by not investing \nin our education system--by not equipping our students with the skills \nthey will need to be successful--will be one we'll have to pay year \nafter year.\n  There can be no doubt that our education system plays a pivotal role \nin establishing our quality of life and the quality of life our \nchildren will enjoy.\n  John F. Kennedy once said, ``Our progress as a nation can be no \nswifter than our progress in education.'' Strengthening our education \nsystem is a responsibility all of us share--as individuals and as a \nnation. Let's call on each other to offer our resources as we build a \nbetter, stronger country through our commitment to our education \nsystem.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Specter and \nSenator Harkin in sponsoring this important amendment to provide the \nNational Institutes of Health with the resources it needs to continue \nits lifesaving mission. In a historic vote in 1997, the Senate pledged \nto double the funding of the NIH over the next five years, and Senator \nSpecter's amendment represents the fulfillment of that pledge for the \ncoming fiscal year.\n  The resources we devote to NIH are a basic investment in a healthy \nfuture for all Americans. Biomedical research supported by NIH has \ngiven us medical miracles undreamed of by previous generations. An \nirregular heartbeat once meant a lifetime of disability. This condition \ncan now be corrected with a pacemaker so small that it can be inserted \nunder local anesthetic using fiber optic technology. New drugs now \nallow many seniors to live a full and active life who once would have \nbeen disabled by the terrible pain of arthritis. Transplants save the \nlives of thousands of patients who once would have died of kidney \nfailure.\n  Even more astonishing discoveries will be developed in the years to \ncome. New insights into the genetic basis of disease will allow \ntreatments to be developed that are custom-made for an individual \npatient's genetic signature. Microscopic cameras are now being \ndeveloped that can be swallowed by patients to give doctors an accurate \nview of the patient's internal organs without the need for risky \nsurgery.\n  I'm proud that Massachusetts is leading the way to this remarkable \nfuture. Our state is home to many of the nation's leading biomedical \nresearch institutions and receives more than one out of every ten \ndollars that NIH spends on research, or over $1.5 billion last year \nalone. NIH grants support essential research all across the \nCommonwealth. In Boston, researchers supported by NIH discovered a link \nbetween the immune system and the brain that may lead to better \ntreatments for diseases like Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis. In \nWorcester, NIH funds are helping to build a new center for cancer \nresearch that will become a leading center in finding a cure for that \ndread disease.\n  Investment in research is the foundation on which the state's \nthriving biotechnology industry is built. There are more than 250 \nbiotech companies in Massachusetts that give good jobs to thousands of \nprofessionals across the state. These companies are an important \npartner in the nation's commitment to promoting the health of all our \ncitizens.\n  The future of biomedical research is bright, provided that we \ncontinue our strong national investment in discovery. Senator Specter's \namendment will give NIH the resources it needs to turn the \nbreakthroughs of today into the cures of tomorrow, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I have a unanimous consent request I would \nlike to propound to see if we get agreement. I believe Senator Domenici \nand Senator Conrad are familiar with it and are prepared to proceed on \nthis basis.\n  I believe we have all signed off on this.\n  I ask consent a vote occur in relation to the pending amendment at 3 \np.m. today, and the time between now and then be equally divided, and \nno other amendments be in order prior to the vote.\n  I further ask consent that the next four amendments in order to the \nsubstitute be the following in the following order: Specter regarding \nNIH, Landrieu regarding defense, Collins regarding health--home health, \nand Conrad or designee regarding debt reduction.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, if I could say to the leader \ntwo things. One, we have a slight problem. The fourth amendment will be \na Democratic amendment. We will let you know what it is; we have a \ncouple we are kicking around--a Democratic amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me make sure I understand what you are saying. This \nindicates Conrad or designee amendment regarding debt reduction. Are \nyou now saying it may not be about debt reduction?\n  Mr. REID. It may not be. There is a small universe. We will let you \nknow what it will be.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I can then modify my consent, that we line up the next \nthree and we confer further on what the next couple will be after that?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, again for clarification, I believe that we \nhave worked it out so we can go back to the original request identified \nas Specter on NIH, Landrieu regarding defense, Collins regarding home \nhealth, and Conrad or designee regarding debt reduction.\n  Of course, these amendments would be subject to the usual rules, and \nsecond-degree or some other agreement as to how they would finally be \ndisposed.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Senator Dorgan has been waiting here \nliterally\n\n[[Page S3393]]\n\nall afternoon. If we could give him 15 minutes, since he has been \nwaiting since 12:30 today to speak.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I am not sure exactly who we may be trying \nto accommodate. But I feel compelled to want to make some remarks out \nof leader time, if I have to. I think the best way to do it is to \nextend the time to 3:15, with the time equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, I don't mind extending and \ndividing it. I only intend to have an opportunity to speak for a \nsufficient amount of time. If that accommodates my interest, I ask my \ncolleague from North Dakota, it is fine with me. If it doesn't, I will \nobject.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think it accommodates your interest.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am asking the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me say, as I understand it, that we would then have \nless than two 2 minutes left. I ask the Senator from North Dakota how \nmuch time he would like.\n  Mr. REID. How about 3:20?\n  Mr. CONRAD. And have it equally divided.\n  Mr. LOTT. Absolutely, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I will try to set the example of not \nspeaking at great length hoping others will follow. I am hoping that \nmaybe the points I make will be sufficient without it being at great \nlength.\n  My colleagues, I haven't spoken about the budget resolution because \nwe are dealing with a lot of different issues and I have been meeting \nwith foreign dignitaries and because I have such ultimate confidence in \nthe managers of this legislation. Senator Domenici doesn't need a \nspeech from me or help from anybody. But we are here to be helpful.\n  I want to make two or three points that I am really worried about.\n  Are we fiddling around here while Rome is beginning to burn?\n  Today, and during the last couple of days, I have been talking with \npeople who are watching the stock market. Who knows what causes the \nstock market to move around? But I have also been talking to financial \nservice managers from companies that watch very carefully what is \nhappening in the country and in the economy. I have been talking to \nrepresentatives of manufacturers. They are telling me that the economy \nis perhaps in more trouble than any of us want to acknowledge.\n  I ask the question: OK, what do we do about it? Obviously, one thing \nis for the Federal Reserve System to do more. That is one of the places \nwhere I have over the years quite often agreed with Senator Dorgan in \nmy exasperation sometimes with the Federal Reserve System. I am not an \neconomist. I wouldn't presume to try to give advice to the Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve Board or any others.\n  But it looks to me as though instead of being overly focused on the \npossibility of inflation, we are entering a period of deflation--\ndeflation. We need the Fed to give us a little more of a hand while we \nbring in the cavalry with some additional help.\n  The only two things to do when you are having sluggishness in the \neconomy is change monetary policy or change fiscal policy. Give it a \nstimulus--i.e., tax relief.\n  Everybody on both sides of the aisle has been saying: yes; let's do \nmore. Let's do more now. Let's do it this year. Let's make sure it is \ngoing to have a greater impact in the next 2 or 3 years so the people \nwill have confidence, and so they can keep more of their money safe and \ninvest it, and do something about the economy.\n  We have two choices. The Federal Reserve can do something and/or we \ncan do something.\n  I think it is time that we pay a little attention to trying to find a \nway to give this tax relief, give this fiscal boost, and do it quickly.\n  That is my greatest concern and why I feel compelled, as I watch what \nis happening even today with the NASDAQ, what is happening with \nmanufacturing jobs, and what is happening with deflation beginning to \ncreep up on us, to say I think we have to do more.\n  Two other points: The pattern is clear. I have been in Congress for \n28 years--the same number of years as the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico. Only I spent a few years--16 years--on the other side of \nthe Capitol.\n  What we are going to have now is amendment after amendment after \namendment on both sides to add more spending--there is nothing new \nabout that--and in areas about which I believe very strongly. \nMississippi is a State with agriculture that is very important.\n  I have always thought of myself as a heavily laden hawk when it comes \nto defense. But I also like to think of myself as a cheap, heavily \nladen hawk.\n  We can all say we voted to spend more here or more there. That is the \npoint.\n  We are on the verge of everybody saying let's spend more. Let's have \nmore for defense, education, home health care, NIH, health care in \ngeneral, you name it. We get very comfortable when we start raising the \nlevel of spending.\n  But there is an added problem to it now. One amendment after another \nsays: Oh, and by the way, we will pay for it by taking hard-working \npeople's money away from them, bring it to Washington, and keep it here \nand decide how it is going to be spent. We are taking from millions of \nlaborers the bread that they have earned and bringing it up here.\n  What is new? We have been doing this for years. Spend more, raise \ntaxes, or in this case reduce, and pretty soon, if we passed every \namendment that has been offered to cut the tax bill, it would be a tax \nincrease.\n  What is happening? I hope we will think about that and try to stop \nit.\n  The amendment before us would reduce the tax cut by $448 billion and \nincrease spending for education, and supposedly accumulate cash. But \nthe fact is, once again, the tax relief would be reduced and more moved \ninto education.\n  I am not going to take a back seat to anybody when it comes to \neducation. I am the son of a schoolteacher. I went to public schools \nall my life. I worked for the University of Mississippi in four \ndifferent capacities before I began practicing law.\n  I believe in public education, and quality education across the \nboard; not just public education but choice. There is lots of variety \nin my area. Some of the best schools are Catholic or Episcopal schools.\n  I feel strongly about education. But the question is, How much is \nenough? How can we do it all at once with a 25-percent increase, as the \nSenator from New Mexico was just saying?\n  The President is asking for an increase. We are going to come back \nafter the Easter recess, and we are going to go to an education bill \nwhich may be the most bipartisan bill of the year and which is going to \nhave more spending in it. It is going to be thoughtful. It is going to \nhave reform, accountability, teacher training, and all the different \ncomponents. Yet here we are once again. Oh, yes, we will take out money \nfor agriculture and from the tax relief. We will take out money for \neducation.\n  My colleagues, it is the same thing we have been doing over all of \nthe years. It is time to stop it.\n  This is the worst time to be talking about cutting down or \neliminating tax relief.\n  I spoke this morning to the heads of a couple of major companies--\nJ.P. Morgan and Dean Witter. I don't know what the current names are \nbecause they are so long. We talked about what we can do. What can we \ndo? They said we support the tax relief and the sooner the better.\n  I oppose this amendment because I think if we don't do it, we will \nwind up with no tax relief at the worst possible time, and we will wind \nup spending the entire surplus. This is a balanced package. It reduces \nthe debt. It provides increases for defense, education, agriculture, \nand it provides tax relief for working Americans.\n  There is the sign of good government in this budget resolution. \nRemember this: We get all overwrought about this. This is just the \nwhistle at the beginning of the game. This allows us to go forward and \ndecide how much we are going to put in appropriations for Interior, for \nAgriculture, and also the tax relief package. This allows us to just go \nforward to give the President a chance to have his program considered.\n\n[[Page S3394]]\n\n  I express my support for this package, express my appreciation to \nSenator Domenici, and urge the defeat of this amendment and all \namendments that are going to keep trying to increase spending while \ncutting tax relief for working Americans.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I remind the majority leader that we \noffered, last week, to spend this week on a stimulus package. That is \nthe offer we made. We said: Look. We believe we ought to spend this \nweek doing a stimulus package. Don't hold it hostage to a 10-year \nbudget plan. Let's do it now. Let's provide some lift to this economy \nnow. And it was rejected on the other side.\n  Now they come on to the floor, and all of a sudden they are for \ntaking immediate action on a stimulus package. Where were they on \nFriday when we made the offer to spend this week on a stimulus package? \nThat is what we should have done. That would have been the right course \nfor the economy. That is what we proposed and they rejected.\n  Second, on the notion that this President somehow proposed a 25-\npercent increase for education, that is not so. The chart of the \nchairman of the Budget Committee shows very clearly the President \nproposed a 5-percent increase--not a 25-percent increase, a 5-percent \nincrease. Some of us do not think it is enough to deal with the \neducation challenge facing this country.\n  Third, the majority leader is using language very loosely, and that \nis a dangerous thing to do. He is suggesting that somebody out here is \ntalking about a tax increase. No one is talking about a tax increase--\nno one. What we are all talking about is significant tax reduction. We \nhave even agreed on an amount of tax reduction for this year to provide \nstimulus. But we do believe that over the 10 years in the future the \nPresident's tax cut is too big; that it threatens to put us back into \ndeficit; that it threatens to raid the trust funds of Medicare and \nSocial Security. And that is no longer just a worry; that has become a \nreality.\n  The two amendments that have been adopted out here--to increase \nspending on prescription drugs and to increase spending on \nagriculture--because of the way they were done, raid the Medicare trust \nfund in the years 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008--and it is all in their \nnumbers, and it is just as clear as it can be. They are into the trust \nfunds already, exactly what we said would happen.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the Senator from North Dakota is next, \nand he is yielded 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, would the distinguished Senator yield to \nme for 3 minutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I cannot, I say to the Senator, because we have the prior \nagreement. Senator Dorgan has been here for 2\\1/2\\ hours.\n  Mr. BYRD. But I wanted to ask the majority leader a question while he \nwas on the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, this is a very interesting debate. You \nnever know when you come to the floor of the Senate whether you are \ngoing to be informed or entertained. And sometimes it is a portion of \nboth.\n  I want to respond to a few things that my colleague from New Mexico \nsaid recently. I have great respect for him. He does quite a remarkable \njob steering the budget on that side of the aisle.\n  A couple things. One, this surplus for 10 years, if you listened to \nthe Senator from New Mexico, and did not know it, you would believe \nthat surplus was in a bank across the street. Why, that is money that \nis already here. That is locked in. We have that surplus handled.\n  The fact is, that surplus represents estimates by economists, some of \nwhom cannot remember their home address, but they know what is going to \nhappen 2, 5, 10 years from now. We know better than that.\n  My colleague mentioned Alan Greenspan. Ten months ago, Alan Greenspan \nincreased interest rates 50 basis points. Why? Because he was worried \nour economy was growing too fast. Now he is worried we might be heading \ntoward a recession. He could not see 10 months ahead. We can't see 10 \nmonths ahead. I do not know, now maybe there is a Ouija board or tarot \ncard or palm reader someone got ahold of someplace that gives them more \nconfidence than the rest of us about what is going to happen in the \nfuture.\n  I hope we have 10 years of surplus, 10 years of economic growth, but \nI sure would not bank on it. We would be smart to be reasonably \nconservative in the way we deal with these estimates.\n  But I want people to understand, when they listen to this debate, it \nis as if this surplus is in the bank, and it is not, and those who seem \nto allege it is know that it is not. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, my colleague said: We are going to collect $27 trillion in the \ncoming years; we surely can provide a reasonable tax cut out of that.\n  I do not think he meant to include $27 trillion. Madam President, $9 \ntrillion of that belongs to Social Security and Medicare. The people \nwho pay that in, pay it in to a trust fund with the expectation that \nthose who handle it will do so responsibly; that is, not spend it for \nother things but to save it in a trust fund.\n  I do not expect that the Senator, or others, intend to say that $9 \ntrillion is available to be discussed with respect to a tax cut, and \nyet they do. It is not right. They know that.\n  Then the issue of debt. I want to talk about the education issue in a \nmoment. I would like to ask my colleague from New Mexico a question. \nAnd I would ask my colleague from North Dakota a question.\n  What I show you is a description of what President Bush sent us from \nthe Office of Management and Budget. And this is the budget resolution \nwe have on the floor. On page 5, line 19, it says: Public debt. Public \ndebt grows from fiscal year 2001--that is the year we are in--$5.5 \ntrillion, to fiscal year 2011, $6.7 trillion.\n  Let me show what it looks like on a graph.\n  Now I will ask a question, if someone would come to the floor from \nthe other side so we can examine why they say you can't pay down \nadditional debt: If during the 10 or 11 years of their budget \nresolution the gross debt is increasing, and if they say it is not, go \nto page 5, line 19 of their resolution.\n  In fiscal year 2011, they say that gross public debt is going to be \n$6.7 trillion. Is gross public debt increasing or is it decreasing?\n  We know the answer to that. No one will come to the floor to talk \nabout it. I hope my colleague, Senator Conrad, will allow us some time \nwhen perhaps our colleagues are on the floor--the Senator from New \nHampshire, who spoke on this at some length earlier, or the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, who said we can discuss this.\n  There is not enough debt out there to repay? Maybe we can find some \non page 5 of your resolution. Maybe we ought to start paying a little \non that. Because your debt is increasing.\n  We will talk more about that when someone will show up to answer a \nquestion. I hope we can have a discussion about that.\n  I happen to think, when we talk about values, that one of the values \nwe ought to think important is that if during tougher times you run up \na debt, during better times you ought to try to pay it down. And debt \nis not just debt held by the public; it is all debt incurred by the \nFederal Government, all of the Federal Government's liabilities. And \nthis, on page 5 of their own resolution, describes an increase of over \n$1.2 trillion in indebtedness or liability by the Federal Government.\n  Let me turn to this amendment because we are obviously not going to \nhave a discussion about this at the moment. The question of whether \n``Leave No Child Behind'' is a bumper sticker, a political slogan, or \npublic policy, is what we will answer in this Chamber. Perhaps there \nare some who embrace all of that. There are some who certainly would \nuse it as a bumper sticker; some as a political slogan.\n  How many are there in this Chamber who will embrace ``Leave No \nChildren Behind'' as public policy? That is the question. We can all \ndescribe our experience with education. And for those\n\n[[Page S3395]]\n\nwho trash our education system--and there are many who do it all the \ntime--I ask them, how do you think the United States of America came to \nthis moment in history? How do you think we arrived at this moment? \nMight it not have been because we have a universal system of education \nin which we have a public education system that says every child in \nAmerica--no matter from where they come, no matter how fat or thin the \nwallet of their parents, no matter their circumstances in life--can be \nwhatever their God-given talent allows them to be as children of this \ngreat country? Isn't that perhaps what has given us this opportunity to \narrive at this moment in history?\n  Do we have challenges in this system of education? You bet we do. \nShould we fix them and address them? Absolutely. Can we do that just by \ntalking? No. No. It takes some money to keep good teachers. It does \ntake some money to reduce classroom sizes so kids are in a classroom of \n15 or 18 students, not 30 or 35, so they are in a school that is well \nrepaired, not in some sort of a trailer outside the school, in mobiles \nthat are ill-equipped.\n  We need to do right by our children. That is what this debate is \nabout. My colleagues have offered an amendment I intend to support. I \nam happy to support it because it moves us in the right direction. You \ncan't talk about these issues without understanding a requirement to \naddress them boldly.\n  It is interesting; all the debate on this is about spending. If you \ndon't believe that investment in our children is an investment in this \ncountry, then you don't understand anything about the management of \nmoney. There is a difference between spending and investing. When we do \nright by our kids, when we strengthen America's schools, we invest in \nthis country's future. It is just as simple as that.\n  Some say this is a tradeoff, this is an offset issue; it is between \ntax cuts and education. We will have a debate about tax cuts at some \npoint. I happen to think we should have a tax cut. My colleague just \ndescribed our offer to use this week for an immediate tax cut to \nprovide some fiscal stimulus. The other side didn't want to do that. \nNow we have heard they would like some fiscal stimulus. We offered \nthat, but they didn't want to do that.\n  We will have a tax cut. We ought to do it in a way that is fair to \nall taxpayers. We ought to do it in a manner that gives this economy a \nboost. It is not a circumstance where every single dollar is offset to \nmake a choice between a tax cut or education. There are some of us who \nbelieve that if you add the payroll taxes paid by individuals and the \nincome taxes paid by individuals and if the top 1 percent of the \nAmerican people who have done very well--and God bless them--paid 21 \npercent of that, and the majority party says, we want to give 43 \npercent of the tax cuts to them, we say: Wait a second. That is not \nsomething we ought to do. That is not a fair tax cut.\n  We are going to have that debate at some point. But we ought to be \nable to provide a tax cut and also do right by our children and \nstrengthen America's schools.\n  The Harkin amendment has $225 billion for education and also $225 \nbillion for debt reduction because he also values not only investing in \nour kids by strengthening our schools but addressing this issue as \nwell.\n  My hope, I say to my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, and \nalso the distinguished chair of the Budget Committee, is that we can \nhave a good discussion about this issue of debt, the increase in the \ngross Federal debt. I don't know that we can have it at this moment \nbecause we are headed towards a vote.\n  I would like very much to spend some time understanding how one \nrationalizes the increase in debt and the increase in liabilities in \nthe Federal budget as outlined on page 5, line 19, of the majority \nbudget--an increase of $1.2 trillion in indebtedness--how one \nrationalizes that with this notion that we have $27 trillion, according \nto them, in income.\n  We have surpluses that are almost locked in a bank, and they have the \nkey in their pocket, and they have apparently used a Ouija board to \ndiscern what is going to happen in the coming 10 years. I would like to \nunderstand the rationale of all of this. I think it is time to talk \nstraight about all of these things in terms of what we have available, \ndo it conservatively, and then make cautious judgments about what will \nstrengthen and improve this country. Yes, a tax cut will; I support \none. Yes, paying down the Federal debt will, and I support that. And \nyes, investing in America's schools will strengthen this country, and I \nbelieve we ought to do that as well.\n\n  Madam President, this will be an instructive debate, and it will be \nan opportunity, as we vote, for people to tell us, is ``Leave No Child \nBehind'' a bumper sticker or is it real public policy this Senate \nembraces.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I believe I have 5 or 6 minutes \nremaining; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We then go to a vote under the UC, as it exists.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So Senators should know that that is about the time we \nare going to vote. I want to make sure they know that because they have \nbeen waiting.\n  First of all, I think we ought to be careful about accusing the other \nside of speaking loosely. I can see about 10 examples in my mind's eye \nof saying they spoke loosely. I choose to say they spoke what they \nbelieved and we speak what we believe. I don't think it is loosely; I \nthink it is very deliberate, and it is very thoughtful on both sides.\n  I have a rough estimate, so the American people will know. We are \ngoing to spend $44 billion on education this year, the National \nGovernment. We are going to spend $500 billion over the next decade. \nThat is half a trillion dollars. So the point of it is, while some may \nnot think that is enough--and maybe I would even join in saying we \nought to do more--I think we are on a pretty good growth path for \neducation. And everybody should know that over the next decade we are a \nsmall contributor to education. That is the way it has been. We are \nbetween 6.5 and 7.5 percent of public education. So everybody will know \nthe dimension of our involvement.\n  Nonetheless, we are going to spend half a trillion dollars. It will \nbe growing substantially each year. The point I am trying to make is, \nat some point you have to raise the level of the concern for the \ntaxpayer to an equal level with those who would increase spending from \nwhat is already a very high level of spending. So the American people \nshould know we are spending a lot on education. It is going up each \nyear. I just showed how much. And it is going to continue going up. \nShould we not at some point in time bring the taxpayer into this and \nsay: OK, Mr. and Mrs. Hard Working American, would you like to get some \nof your tax dollars back or would you like for us to take every program \nthat sounds good, no matter what the level of spending nationally, and \nlet's add some more to it, and then we will consider you later on? I \ndon't think that is what the American taxpayer wants.\n\n  In fact, I think they want a fair break out of this, and a fair break \nis over the next 10 years giving them back 6.4 percent of what they pay \nin in taxes. That is what we are talking about. When we get away from \nthe big numbers and get into 6 cents out of every dollar, we are \ntalking about 6 percent, giving 6 percent of the tax taken from the \ntaxpayer back to the taxpayer over the next decade when we are running \nvery big surpluses.\n  Frankly, I will answer one further insinuation. The insinuation is \nthat the Senator from New Mexico is talking about these surpluses as if \nthey were there tomorrow. I believe they are as good estimates as we \nare ever going to get, and there is a high probability that they are \ngoing to be right. But if the estimates are not any good, then they \nought not to be any good to add spending based on them either.\n  So if you have something down here where you want to spend half that \ntax money on new programs, you ought to be thinking, maybe the tax \nsurplus is not real. We don't want you to think it is real because we \ndon't want you to use it for tax dollars, but we would like to use it \nfor something else.\n  With that, I yield back any time I might have.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is there any time remaining?\n\n[[Page S3396]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is to occur at 3:20 by previous \norder.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask that Senator Harkin be given the last 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I object. I don't know why we ought to do that. Then I \nget 2 minutes, too. You have been arguing for about an hour more than \nwe have on this amendment. I just think, being fair, we are finished. I \nyielded back my time. That is why we still have some time left. I could \nhave still been talking.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n185.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 53, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 69 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--53\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 185) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote by \nwhich the amendment was just agreed to. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion has been entered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Byrd has indicated he would like to \nhave an exchange, a colloquy. This seems a good time to do it. I might \nsay also, it would be our hope and intent now that we would go on to \nthe next amendment. Senator Specter is ready with an amendment on NIH. \nSo I hope we can--I talked to Senator Daschle about that--go ahead and \nproceed with the next amendment that was in order.\n  I would be glad to respond to a question or a comment Senator Byrd \nmight have.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader for his \nmaking possible an inquiry at this point.\n  As Senators know, I am, I think, the Senator who has had more of a \npart in writing the Budget Reform Act than any other Senator who today \nserves in the Senate. I believe, with all my heart, that the \nreconciliation instruction process was never meant to be used as a \nprocedure for cutting taxes. It has been my belief, from the beginning, \nthat the purpose of the reconciliation process is to reduce deficits. \nAnd the process has been useful in that regard over a period of several \nyears.\n  I am very concerned that the Senate is about to use the process in a \nway for which it was not intended. I think a point of order, if made, \nwould nail in the precedent that it is quite all right to use the \nreconciliation process to cut taxes. So I do not want to do that. If, \nand when, that time comes, I prefer to just vote up or down and let the \nchips fall where they may.\n  So I have a couple of questions I wish to ask of the distinguished \nmajority leader. One would be in light of the fact that we only have, I \nbelieve, about 30 hours remaining.\n  Mr. REID. That is true.\n  Mr. BYRD. And I feel sure the majority leader is concerned about this \nas much as I am because I have already heard him say some things today \nthat would lead me to believe that.\n  My question would be--and he might not want to answer it at this \npoint--but when are we going to get to the reconciliation vote on this \nconcurrent resolution on the budget? When are we going to get to it? \nWhen we reach that point, we need some time to debate it. I would like \nto speak at least 45 minutes or an hour on that subject.\n  Our time is being eaten up. I am not complaining about that except to \nsay we are not going to have enough time to debate the most important \nquestion that will come before us unless we get to that matter soon.\n  Another question which I wish to propound to the distinguished \nmajority leader, I think it is very important that the Senate have \nbefore it the President's budget before the Senate votes on final \npassage of the concurrent resolution on the budget. I think if we can \nsee what is in the President's budget, we will see that some programs, \nthat are very important to Senators on both sides of the aisle, are \nprobably going to be reduced in order to make way for the tax cut. I \nthink Senators should know these things before they vote on this \nresolution that is before the Senate.\n\n  I will not proceed further to make that case. I think it is a solid \ncase, and I think there is every reason why Senators ought to have the \nbudget at their fingertips before they cast that final vote. That has \nbeen my hope all along.\n  The President had earlier indicated, I believe, that he would submit \nhis budget to the Congress on this past Monday, and then later changed \nhis mind to say it would be sent up on the 9th, which will be next \nMonday.\n  I must say, earlier I had thought, Mr. Leader, of using some dilatory \ntactics in order to put the Senate over to Wednesday. I watched the \ndebate on the natural gas bill in 1977, at which time two Senators--Mr. \nMetzenbaum and Mr. Abourezk--kept this Senate from reaching a decision \n13 days and 1 night and still had hundreds of amendments and just as \nmany dilatory actions available as ever.\n  I know it can be done. I know how to do it. But it was decided in the \nDemocratic Caucus that we would not do that. We do, however, still need \nto see that budget. I think there is every reason the American people \nshould know what is in the President's budget before their elected \nrepresentatives in this body cast their votes in connection therewith.\n  Consequently, I ask this question: Would it be possible--this will be \na matter for both leaders, not just the majority leader, but mainly the \nmajority leader--would it be possible to put this matter over until \nnext Wednesday, which would allow Monday for the President to send his \nbudget up to the Congress and then would allow the Senate Tuesday and \nWednesday in which to amend, to debate, and to make a final decision on \nthe concurrent resolution on the budget? In the meantime a decision \ncould be made with respect to the reconciliation resolution as well. It \nmight very well be that a time agreement could be worked out, and the \nmajority leader has been interested in that. I have been interested in \nit. Mr. Gramm and Mr. Domenici have expressed some interest in it. Mr. \nNickles has expressed interest, and others.\n  I think there is every good reason why it might be wise to do that. A \nunanimous consent request hase been under consideration. The majority \nleader discussed this again with me briefly last night at the time of \nthe reception the Senate was having in honor of the spouses of the \nSenators. Would it be possible to delay final passage of the budget \nresolution until next Wednesday? I know it would inconvenience some \nSenators. But what is more important? The inconvenience to the \nSenators, or wisdom and the proper judgment when it comes to casting \nour votes for those whom we represent?\n\n[[Page S3397]]\n\n  I don't think there is a Senator here who would disagree with my \nstatement that, yes, there will be inconveniences, perhaps some trips \nwould have to be canceled, but that is all in a day's work. We get paid \nfor our work. We have a responsibility to our people. Perhaps there \nwill be no more important vote that will be cast by the Senate than the \nvote on this concurrent budget resolution and the vote with respect to \nthe reconciliation process.\n  That ends my question.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe there were actually several ideas \nor questions propounded there. I will try to respond as directly and as \nbriefly to them as I can so we can go forward with the next amendment \nthat is pending.\n  First of all, as to when to take up the issue of reconciliation and \nthe process for giving working people tax relief to be able to keep a \nlittle bit more of their money at home, I think clearly it needs to \ncome relatively shortly, I assume tomorrow, in whatever form it might \nbe so that there will be ample time to discuss it fully. I know that \nSenators on both sides of the aisle will want to be heard on that.\n  I must say that if we start down this trail of spending all the \nmoney, there won't be anything left for tax relief anyway so we won't \nneed this reconciliation process. I think clearly to have tax cut in \nreconciliation is something that we would like to have considered and \nwould be prepared to act on it. But as the Senator knows, we would be \nwilling to consider doing it another way, doing it the way it was done \neven back in the 1980s. We have offered an idea, a unanimous consent \nagreement to Senator Byrd, and I have discussed it with Senator \nDaschle. Senators on this side have looked at that. I thought perhaps \nwe could get something worked out on that, and we could get that done.\n  We would have to consult with the chairman of the Finance Committee \nand the ranking member on the Finance Committee, make sure everybody \nunderstood how that would work and make sure that it would give us some \nof the important benefits that reconciliation gives you, even though it \nwouldn't do it that way.\n\n  We will be glad to continue to work with you and with others on the \npossibility of doing it through a unanimous consent agreement. I have \ndiscussed this with Senator Domenici and with Senator Grassley. They \nare interested, willing to work on it. They just want to make sure they \nknow what is in it, and I think everybody on both sides wants to do \nthat.\n  As far as the President's budget, we have the outlines of the main \ncategories that the President is suggesting. I guess if we waited later \non, we would get line by line by line. I don't think that is what a \nbudget resolution does. A budget resolution sets the broad categories \nand then we go forward. Then in the Appropriations Committee, for \ninstance, they decide how much they are going to put in there for \nInterior or Transportation. I don't believe the President dictates \nthat. We have acted before when we didn't have the President's budget.\n  As far as the idea of postponing it, there would be two or three \nproblems with that. We had not indicated that we were thinking about \ndoing that. We would have to check on both sides with 100 Senators to \nmake sure that their schedules could be changed to that effect. I \nsuspect there would be a lot of resistance to it. We would have to \ncheck with both sides of the aisle on that. Worst of all, in my \nopinion, we need to move forward. We need to move forward with this \nbudget resolution--good, bad, ugly. We ought to move it on into \nconference and see if we can get an agreement there and then come back \nand vote on it so we can get on with the substantive business. This \njust gives us the outlines of how we can proceed and then we get into \nthe details: What we do on Medicare, what we do on defense, and what we \ndo on tax policy.\n  I think we ought to go ahead. I spoke earlier about my concern about \nthe economy and the need for us to get this process on down the road so \nthat we can be looking at taking some action on tax policy and on \nsubstantive issues, too.\n  I see Senator Domenici. As chairman of the Budget Committee, I don't \nwant to try to respond to all of this. Some of it being in his \njurisdiction, would he like to comment on this, too?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I surely don't want to use much time. You have answered \nwith the authority of the majority leader. I just wanted to say to you, \nMr. Leader, and to you, Senator Byrd, I never in my wildest dreams \nthought we would finish this budget resolution without your spending an \nhour on a subject you think is most important; namely, reconciliation. \nWe have already spent a lot of hours debating. Frankly, in my opinion, \nalthough the debates were luxurious, I think it would have served us \nwell if you would have already taken an hour and I would have taken an \nhour and Senator Conrad taken an hour and we discussed reconciliation. \nI don't intend to get finished without that hour of debate about what \nit is all about and what it means taking place. As soon as we can, I \nwould be for working it out. Our leader thinks we should work it out on \nan issue that is formulated before the Senate.\n  I do want to comment, since you have indicated two things. One, we \nshould have the President's budget first. That is OK. That is a good \nwish. I would suggest that when we had a new President named Bill \nClinton, we didn't have a budget before we approved the budget \nresolution, including the conference report on the budget resolution. \nThen we got a budget. I think there is precedent for a new President \nfor us to proceed.\n  Secondly, I think you did do more than, as much as anyone present \nhere, of course, in drafting this 25-year old Budget Impoundment Act. \nFrankly, you have one version about reconciliation that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, who has now used your product you developed with \nothers--I have used it as chairman or ranking member or member for 25 \nyears. So while you drew it, I have watched it implemented.\n  I will present to the Senate my strong conviction that there is \nnothing in this act that precludes using reconciliation for a tax \ndecrease bill. I just wanted to make sure I amplified to that extent.\n  Mr. BYRD. I don't want to take a lot of time. Let me just say this: \nWe can argue back and forth as to what has been done in the past. I \nthink we have to deal with what is in the present. We have here ``A \nBlueprint for New Beginnings.'' My problem with this is that it is kind \nof a peekaboo budget. You see just a little of the budget. But what I \nsee is disturbing. For example, with respect to the research in fossil \nfuel, that is going to be cut. That is important to the energy \nresources of this Nation, particularly at this time.\n\n  Now we have the clean coal technology program, for which the \nPresident has said he supports a $2 billion increase. That is well and \ngood. But the problem is, as I look through this peekaboo budget, I \nfind that much of the money he is going to put into clean coal \ntechnology is going to come out of fossil fuel research. That is \nimportant to coal, oil, and gas. That is just one thing of which I got \na little glimpse. I think we will find the word ``redirect'' in this \nblueprint a number of times.\n  I noted in the Washington Post of Sunday, April 1, that the Community \nPolicing Service Program, COPS, would be cut by 13 percent, from $1 \nbillion to about $850 million. I noted also in the New York Times--I \nbelieve, of yesterday--well, I don't seem to have it at my fingertips, \nbut some programs are going to be cut. I think Senators should know \nwhat programs are proposed to be cut in the President's budget before \nthey vote on final passage of this concurrent resolution on the budget \nbefore us.\n  I am going to take my seat soon, but for these reasons, which could \nbe debated at considerable length, I hope it will be possible to have \nthe President's budget before we take the final plunge on the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget. It seems to me it isn't too much \nto ask that that final action--perhaps the final 10 hours, if it could \nbe worked out that way--be put over until next Tuesday or Wednesday.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. If I have the time, yes.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator, I appreciate very much directing his \nattention to this. I think we would be better off putting this off \nuntil we got back from the break. I think we have 30 hours left. \nEverybody is trying to finish this bill by tomorrow. In the back\n\n[[Page S3398]]\n\nroom, I say to the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, we \nhave over 120 amendments just on our side. You know, unless we have \nsome time to work this out, there is going to be a big vote-athon. We \nneed to do this with wisdom and discretion and have a document before \nmaking a decision.\n  I think the Senator is right on the ball, right in the direct line in \nwhich we should be going. This is so important, I would be willing to \ncancel what I have next week in Nevada and do this. But if people are \nunwilling to do that, let's do it after we come back, set it at a \ncertain time and have a unanimous consent agreement that we can \ncomplete this thing in a matter of a day or two. People would feel \nbetter about it. We can sift through the 120 amendments and get to what \nreally needs to be done.\n  Senator Conrad has done a wonderful job of managing this bill. I \ndon't know of anybody who has ever managed a bill better than he has. \nBut with these time constraints and big things such as debt reduction, \ndefense, reconciliation, his hands are tied to manage this bill \nproperly. I certainly think the Senator from West Virginia is headed in \nthe right direction.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If the Senator will yield to me for a moment, and I \nunderstand the ranking member wants to speak. What I have here is also \na peekaboo budget, but it is not President Bush's, it is President \nClinton's. It is a peekaboo budget, borrowing your expression. It is \n``A Vision of Change for America,'' but it is not a budget.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This was sent up here on February 17, and in a \nmarvelous show of support for the new President, before any budget was \nforthcoming, a budget resolution was adopted based on this peekaboo \nbudget.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is a peekaboo budget.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It went to conference for him, and it came back as a \nconferred-upon bill. So we are kind of used to looking at what you all \ndo, and then when you are doing something really borderline \nspectacular, we say we would like to be a mimic. You did it in such a \ngreat fashion for him, we wanted to do a little bit for President Bush.\n  Mr. BYRD. I wish the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, \nhowever, had had a markup in the committee, as was the case when that \npeekaboo budget was sent up here in 1993.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator will admit, will he not, that the Budget \nCommittee did, in that instance, 1993, have a markup in the committee \nand then reported that measure out of the committee with a report? And \nI assume the minority was allowed to publish its views. Would the \nSenator respond? Was that not the case with that 1993 peekaboo budget?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Indeed, it was.\n  Mr. BYRD. In the case of that 1993 peekaboo budget, did the \ncommittee, in that instance, report out a bill? Did it mark up the \nbill?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, it did.\n  Mr. BYRD. If it did, why doesn't the Senator, who admires that role \nmodel, wish to have a markup in the committee and report out a \nconcurrent resolution on this budget?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, I tried to explain the difference. You had the \nluxury of a majority here in the Senate. In fact, you had three votes \nmore than a majority. We went in the Budget Committee not even stephen. \nEverybody already made up their minds. You had a majority of Democrats \nwilling to vote out a Presidential budget when Republicans didn't want \nit. So it is the same thing I had, except it turns out 11-11, an equal \nnumber. So there is a very big difference.\n  Mr. BYRD. There is a difference, but, with all due respect, that is \nno reason not to have a markup. Just because the people saw fit to make \nit 50/50 in this Senate, that is no reason to avoid having a markup in \ncommittee. We have a responsibility to the people who send us here to \nhave a markup in the committee.\n  The point I am trying to make is that we ought to see the President's \nbudget. It would not be asking too much of all of us, I don't think, to \nhold over until next Tuesday or Wednesday to complete action on this \nconcurrent resolution on the budget. Let us see the President's budget.\n  While I have the floor--and then I will sit down--I have the New York \nTimes of Wednesday, April 4. I will read the headline: ``Bush Budget on \nHealth Care Would Cut Aid to Uninsured.''\n  That is one example of why I think the Senate ought to have the \nPresident's budget. We don't know what is in it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Isn't it true that while President Clinton had not \nsubmitted a full budget, he had submitted sufficient detail so the cost \nof his budget proposals could be estimated by the Committee on the \nBudget, the CBO, the Joint Committee on Taxation, and so the Senate, \nacting in 1993, had all of the reestimates done that told us the cost \nof his proposal?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, absolutely.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And is it not true as well that President Bush has not \nsubmitted sufficient detail for the Congressional Budget Office or the \nJoint Committee on Taxation to do the reestimates that were done on the \nprevious President's budget, so we do not have those reestimates; isn't \nthat true?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is preeminently correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will go on, if I can, when we look at the level of \ndetail that has been provided by President Bush versus President \nClinton, there is a very stark and glaring set of differences. For \nexample, the Clinton document had tables that provided year-by-year \nbudget numbers for 68 specific proposals to reduce discretionary \nspending.\n  The tables also included the year-by-year numbers for 90 specific \nproposals to cut mandatory spending.\n  The budget also provided year-by-year detail for proposed increases \nin spending.\n  The Bush budget does not provide any year-by-year numbers for \nspecific proposed changes in discretionary spending; is that not the \ncase?\n  Mr. BYRD. Oh, absolutely; no question about it; absolutely.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So to compare 1993 to this year does not really stack up, \ndoes not hold up under much scrutiny because, as the Senator from West \nVirginia has made so clear, we had full reestimates then of the cost of \nthe President's tax-and-spending proposals, sufficient detail for the \nCongressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation to tell \nus what those costs were. We do not have it now. And we had a full \nBudget Committee markup then. We do not have any Budget Committee \nmarkup now.\n  The fact is, we do not have sufficient detail from the President to \nhave the kind of objective independent analysis done to inform the \nSenate of the cost of the President's tax-and-spending proposals.\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely. Moreover, that was a budget for 5 years. That \nwas a 5-year plan in 1993. This is a 10-year plan. Additionally, the \nresolution was used in that instance to reduce deficits, not to \nincrease them.\n  Finally, my good friend from New Mexico speaks of that 1993 budget as \na role model. Not one of the Senators on that side of the aisle voted \nfor it. Not one Republican in the House voted for it.\n  What did it do? It put the Nation on the course for reduction of the \ndeficits and for the accumulation of huge projected surpluses. Whether \nthey ever materialize or not is another question. But what are we so \nafraid of? Why is this Senate afraid to see the President's budget?\n  Mr. CONRAD. We were promised the President's budget, were we not? We \nwere promised it was going to be here on April 2 before we took up a \nbudget resolution on the floor. And presto disto, the next thing we \nknow, there is no budget until April 9 when we have completed action. \nIt is a very unusual circumstance.\n  If we are going to be fair and objective about comparing 1993 to now, \nwe will see there are very significant differences. Most significant, \nwe have had no budget markup in the committee, and there was sufficient \ndetail on what President Clinton sent us that the Congressional Budget \nOffice and the Joint Committee on Taxation were able to give us an \nobjective independent analysis of the cost of the President's spending-\nand-tax proposals which we do not have here. We do not have them.\n\n[[Page S3399]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very able majority leader for \nhis courtesy in calling attention to the inquiry I had previously \nindicated I wanted to make, and for his listening to it. I am sure he \nwill give some consideration to it. I hope he will. And I hope all \nSenators will be willing to consider the request to go over until next \nTuesday or Wednesday so that we might have the benefit of having the \ninformation that is in the President's budget.\n  I am sure it is not very far away. It is probably on the printing \npresses within three blocks of this Chamber right now. If they plan to \nhave it up here next Monday, it is available somewhere right now.\n  I thank the majority leader for entertaining my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania is going to go next. I did not want to keep burdening \nSenator Byrd with my statements. He has made his. I want to make mine.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the introduction of \nthe President's revenue proposals by the Joint Committee on Taxation, \nMarch 8, 1993.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       This pamphlet, prepared by the staff of the Joint Committee \n     on Taxation, provides a summary of the revenue provisions \n     included in the President's budget proposal, as submitted to \n     the Congress on February 17, 1993.\n       The provisions summarized in this pamphlet are those \n     revenue proposals contained in the Department of the Treasury \n     document, Summary of the Administration's Revenue Proposals, \n     February 1993 (``Treasury document''). The pamphlet also \n     summarizes three other revenue proposals included in the \n     Office of Management and Budget document, A Vision of Change \n     for America, February 17, 1993 (``OMB document''), that would \n     amend the Internal Revenue Code: taxation of social security \n     benefits; increase of inland waterways fuel excise tax; and \n     use of Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund amounts for \n     administrative expenses.\n       The pamphlet descriptions of the President's proposals are \n     taken without modification from the Treasury document and the \n     OMB document. The pamphlet summary description includes \n     present law and a reference to any recent prior Congressional \n     action on the topic and whether the proposal (or a similar \n     proposal) was included in recent budget proposals (fiscal \n     years 1990-1993). Part I of the pamphlet summarizes the \n     revenue-reduction proposals from the Treasury document; Part \n     II summarizes the revenue-raising proposals from the Treasury \n     document; and Part III summarizes three additional revenue \n     proposals from the OMB document.\n       The Treasury document's introductory statement indicates \n     that ``[t]he descriptions included in this report are not \n     intended to be final. Many of the proposals will be revised \n     in the process of finalizing the Administration's fiscal year \n     1994 Budget. The descriptions are also not intended to be \n     comprehensive. Numerous details, such as rules relating to \n     the prevention of abusive transactions and the limitation of \n     tax benefits consistent with the principles of the proposals, \n     will be provided in connection with the presentation of the \n     Budget and upon submission of legislation to implement the \n     Administration's plan.''\n       Further, the Treasury document states that ``[i]n addition \n     to the proposals summarized in this report, the \n     Administration also supports initiatives to promote sensible \n     and equitable administration of the internal revenue laws. \n     These include simplification, good governance and technical \n     correction proposals.''\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, that is the Joint Committee's \nintroduction on President Clinton's tax package that was considered, \nvoted on, passed, went to conference with the House and passed, and \nthis is all they could say about what the President submitted:\n\n       The Treasury document's introductory statement indicates \n     that ``[t]he descriptions included in this report are not \n     intended to be final. Many of the proposals will be revised \n     in the process of finalizing the Administration's fiscal year \n     1994 Budget. The descriptions are also not intended to be \n     comprehensive. Numerous details, such as . . . limitation of \n     tax benefits consistent with the principles of the proposals, \n     will be provided in--\n\n  And it goes on.\n  I want everybody to know, according to the tax Web site, no tax \nrevenue tables were available with reference to President Clinton's \nbudget until way past the time the budget resolution was considered. As \na matter of fact, the first tax tables were not made available to the \nWays and Means Committee until May 4 of 1993, the second tables on June \n17, 1993, and we had already produced the budget resolution in both \nHouses, gone to conference, and adopted it.\n  I do not care to go on forever. I believe we ought to treat President \nBush, as well as Republicans and Members of the Senate, as President \nClinton was treated when he was a so-called brand new President.\n\n  We will proceed, and I want the Record to show, and I will put the \nletter in tomorrow, that every member of the Budget Committee on the \nRepublican side asked the chairman, this chairman, not to consider \nmarkup because they said it would not yield any fruitful results. While \nthat is my decision, I want everybody to know I did not make it \nsingularly. I had a pretty good backing from Republicans who did not \nthink it would amount to anything other than long, protracted debates \nand nothing positive would be accomplished.\n  Before we proceed and I yield to my friend from Pennsylvania, I was \nasked by the majority leader to propose what I assume is a usual \nconsent request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3399-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND A \n            CONDITIONAL RECESS OR ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, at the outset, let me say to the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, who holds an extraordinary \nrecord in this body, and asked me 45 minutes ago if I would mind \nyielding for a question, I want the Record to show that I agreed to \nyield for a question. I had no idea that the answer would be so long, \nMr. President. I thought it worthy of note.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if my dear friend will yield briefly, just \nthat I might apologize to him for the questions having gone on and on \nand the answers and the joining by other Senators, which I think added \nto the importance of the question. I think we performed a service. I \ncertainly thank the Senator most kindly.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, like the incident with the Navy plane, no\n\n[[Page S3400]]\n\napology is in order. I have worked with the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia for many years when he was the Democratic leader and then \nmajority leader, President pro tempore, and chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. I greatly admire what he has done.\n  I sat and listened to the whole proceeding, but I thought it was \nworth just a minute of the Senate's time to note I yielded for a \nquestion and 45 minutes later I got the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 186\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself, \n     Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Collins, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. DeWine, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Sarbanes, \n     and Ms. Snowe proposes an amendment numbered 186.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: Increase discretionary health funding by $700,000,000)\n\n       On page 28, line 23, increase the amount by $700,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 24, increase the amount by $700,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 15, decrease the amount by $700,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 16, decrease the amount by $700,000,000.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is an amendment which adds $700 \nmillion to increase the health function in this resolution to assure \nthat the funding for the National Institutes of Health be doubled by \nthe year 2003 as provided for in a resolution of the Senate which goes \nback to 1997, a 98-0 resolution that we double the funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health. The offset for the $700 million comes \nfrom the 920 account, I am advised, which is allowances on \nadministrative costs across the board.\n\n  The funding for the National Institutes of Health is a priority \nsecond to none. There is nothing more important than health. The \nNational Institutes of Health have made extraordinary progress in their \nefforts to combat the most serious maladies which confront Americans, \nand for that matter, people around the world. Among those diseases, \nincluding, but not necessarily limited to, are Alzheimer's disease, \nParkinson's, epilepsy, cancer of the prostate, breast cancer, cervical \ncancer, leukemia, melanoma, hearing research, heart disease, stroke, \nAIDS, and diabetes. I could go on and on and on.\n  Our effort to secure this funding has been a rather bumpy road. We \nhave managed to persevere. In 1998, Senator Harkin and I led the attack \nwith a resolution to add $1.1 billion to the health function and the \namendment was defeated 63-37. We came back the next year, having \nsustained that loss for $1 billion and doubled the request to $2 \nbillion. Again the amendment was defeated, but this time by a lesser \nvote of 57-41.\n  In those 2 years, notwithstanding the failure of our efforts to get \nan increase in the budget resolution, we took out our sharp pencils and \nas a matter of priorities allocated the extra billion in fiscal year \n1998 and the $2 billion extra in fiscal year 1999. In fiscal year 2000 \nwe, again, offered an amendment to the budget resolution, this time of \n$1.4 billion to the health function over and above the $600 million \nwhich had been provided by the Budget Committee. This time we lost \nagain by a narrowing vote of 47-52. Again, we found the extra funds as \na matter of priority by allocating funds within the overall budget for \nthe subcommittee which has jurisdiction over labor, health, human \nservices, and education.\n  In fiscal year 2001, we offered an amendment to the budget resolution \nto add $1.6 billion to the health function. This time, for the first \ntime, the budget resolution was passed 55-45. Our efforts were rewarded \nwith increases over that 4-year period of affirmative votes: 37, to 41, \nto 47, and finally to 55.\n  This year, on February 13, Senator Harkin and I had as additional \ncosponsors Senators Breaux, Cochran, Collins, DeWine, Frist, \nHutchinson, Mikulski, Murray, Santorum, Sarbanes, Schumer, and Snowe on \nS. Res. 19, the Biomedical Revitalization Resolution of 2001.\n  This year the administration has come forward with $2.750 billion, so \nit was necessary only to increase by $700 million. We could not do a \nfigure in less than $100 million amounts under the resolution rules \nwhich would enable us to come to the $3.4 billion target which is \nnecessary to keep us on the path to doubling the NIH budget within the \n5-year period as called for in the resolution from 1997 which, as I \nsay, passed 98-0.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, would the Senator from Pennsylvania yield \nfor questions on my time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his leadership \non this issue. He has brought this body a long way. We have seen it \nover a number of years by his persistence and persuasion. I publicly \nacknowledge the leadership he has provided in an area that is \ncritically important. I have seen in the lives of some of my \nconstituents how important the NIH can be and what an incredible \ncontribution it has made to improving health research and extending the \nlongevity of the lives of the American people. The Senator from \nPennsylvania can be very proud of his advocacy.\n  As I understand the Senator's amendment, it provides $700 million to \nthe National Institutes of Health in the fiscal year 2002, is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The source of funding for that would be out of the \nprojected surplus for that year?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No, as I am advised by the experts, out of the 920 \naccount which covers allowances and administrative costs.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If that is the case, I think it may well be we will \nsupport that amendment on this side. I have to check with other \ncolleagues, as I am sure the Senator is aware, in order to give that \nanswer. We are in the process of doing that. Perhaps as we go through \nthat process of checking with other Senators, we can find out what \ntheir disposition is. We may be able to either accept this amendment or \ngo to a quick vote on this amendment. We will try to get an answer \nquickly.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota for \nthose comments. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Iowa has arrived.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I seek time to speak on behalf of this amendment of my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator from Iowa will yield, I talked about the \ncosponsors of the earlier resolution we offered. Let me note that I \nhave offered this on behalf of Senators Harkin, Hutchinson, Mikulski, \nCollins, Landrieu, Kerry, Wellstone, Murray, DeWine, Snowe, and Senator \nSarbanes, as well as myself.\n  I yield to my colleague from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to stand with my colleague \nand subcommittee chairman, Senator Specter, to offer this important \namendment to the budget resolution. We stand at the cusp of a \nrevolution that I believe will result in the overthrow of disease and \ndisability in this country. At no time in our history have we been so \nclose to major advances in the fight against killer diseases. Every day \nwe read about major breakthroughs in medical research: AIDS vaccine, \ndecoding the DNA letters that make up the human genome, new therapy for \nbreast cancer, less invasive surgical techniques. This resolution is a \ndirect result of our investment in medical research.\n  Four years ago the Senate went on record 98-0 committing to double \nthe NIH budget over 5 years. We are well on our way to doing that. Over \nthe past 3 years, Senator Specter and I have made good on that pledge \nby providing the biggest increases ever for medical research. Last year \nwe were able to provide an unprecedented $2.5 billion,\n\n[[Page S3401]]\n\nor 15-percent increase, for NIH. We worked hard to make it happen, and \nI thank all of my Senate colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, \nwho worked with us on this historic accomplishment.\n\n  Unfortunately, if we pass this budget resolution as it is, we will \nfall short of the 15-percent increase needed to maintain the commitment \nthat 98 Senators made to doubling the NIH budget over 5 years. But if \nwe pass this budget resolution as it is, we will fall short of keeping \nthat commitment.\n  This budget resolution in fact shortchanges Americans' health. At the \nsame time, this budget skimps on basic investments in America's health \ncare. It also cuts taxes for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans by \nalmost $700 billion. What this budget should do is spend the additional \n$3.4 billion needed to ensure that all Americans, no matter what \nincome, can live healthy and productive lives. In this budget, that is \nonly .4 percent of a tax cut for the wealthiest; .4 percent of the tax \ncut just for the wealthiest Americans would help us fulfill our \ncommitment of doubling medical research at NIH.\n  In the next 30 years the number of Americans over age 65 will double. \nMedical research and its discoveries are essential to reduce the \nenormous economic and social toll posed by chronic diseases that impact \nour elderly, from Alzheimer's and arthritis, to cancer, Parkinson's, \nand stroke disease.\n  Let's take Alzheimer's disease. Just the other day Senator Specter \nchaired a hearing with researchers doing cutting-edge work on \nAlzheimer's, and we also had patients there, some of whom were \ndiagnosed as having Alzheimer's. One of the witnesses was John Wagenaar \nof Georgia, IA. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer's at age 60, at the \nprime of his life, working at a manufacturing plant, taking pride in \nhis children and grandchildren, looking forward to retirement. But in \nspite of this devastating diagnosis, he is a lucky man. Thanks to \nmedical research, he can now take a pill that has slowed the course of \nthe disease so now he can even continue to work and enjoy his family. \nJohn Wagenaar can hope, along with the rest of us, that a drug will \nsoon come on the market that will not just slow Alzheimer's disease but \nactually stop it.\n  Researchers have made extraordinary advances in recent years. A \ndecade ago--just 10 years ago--there were no Alzheimer's drugs on the \nmarket. Today there are four, and more are on the way. Scientists have \ndeveloped a vaccine. We saw startling pictures of this at our hearing \nyesterday. When tested on mice, it takes away, it wards off, the brain-\nclogging deposits that are associated with Alzheimer's. Plans are now \nunderway to test this vaccine in humans.\n  We are clearly on the verge of breakthroughs on Alzheimer's and in \nother areas. At no time in our history have we been so close to major \nadvances in the fight against killer diseases. Now is the time to boost \nour investment to make sure our Nation's top scientists can turn these \ndreams into reality.\n  The amendment Senator Specter has offered, which I am proud to \ncosponsor, is very simple. It ensures the budget resolution will \ninclude $3.4 billion for the National Institutes of Health for fiscal \nyear 2002. It is a commonsense amendment. It is bipartisan. It is the \nright thing to do. We have gone too far now to cut back and to slow \ndown. Millions of Americans, our families, our loved ones, our friends, \nand our neighbors all over this country are counting on us not to back \ndown in this fight against the diseases that still plague us.\n  As I said, we have made major strides against Alzheimer's, \nParkinson's disease, stroke disease. We have made great strides in \ndoing things that help alleviate the struggle many people have with \nmental illness. We have come a long way. Now we are on the cusp of \nfinding the interventions, the vaccines, the drugs that will alleviate \nthis human suffering and make life better for so many people. Now is \nnot the time to turn back.\n  This budget resolution before us would say that investing in NIH is \nnot that important. This budget resolution says investing in medical \nresearch is not as important as giving a big tax cut to people who make \nover $1 million a year.\n  I disagree with that priority. I believe the priority is elsewhere. \nMr. President, .4 percent, that is all it takes. Four-tenths of 1 \npercent of the tax cuts of those Americans in the top 1-percent bracket \nwould pay for us keeping our commitment to fund medical research at \nNIH.\n  I wholeheartedly support this amendment. I hope it has strong \nbipartisan support on the Senate floor.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, a quick word on why I voted against the \nSpecter amendment which made extra room in the budget for $700 million \nin National Institutes of Health research spending.\n  I voted against the NIH amendment not because I oppose the valuable \nresearch that NIH does, but rather because I wanted to draw attention \nto the fact that we risk focusing on NIH spending to the exclusion of \nother important initiatives.\n  Biomedical research at NIH is important, but we must recognize we \nhave other priorities as well.\n  The NIH is important, but so is the basic scientific research that we \ndo at the National Science Foundation. Basic research is the foundation \non which applied science and technology rests. Understanding how the \nworld works has applications in every field, including health. Without \nincreased funding for basic research, we will soon find that our basic \nscientific understanding is too limited to get the maximum value from \nthe applied research NIH does.\n  The NIH is important, but so are community health centers. These \nlocal clinics provide basic primary care services to close to 12 \nmillion Americans at over 3,000 sites in medically-underserved urban \nand rural communities across the country. Yet the demand is still \ngreat--millions are still uninsured, and millions more simply don't \nhave access to health care providers. The NIH does great work expanding \nthe high-tech envelope of medicine, but the people that health centers \nserve often cannot get even low-tech services like immunizations and \nbasic doctor visits.\n  The NIH is important, but so are children's hospitals. These \npriceless resources care for our sickest children, train a significant \nportion of our children's doctors, and themselves perform much of the \npediatric research that NIH funds. But for three decades we have not \ntreated these children's teaching hospitals fairly. Through the \nMedicare program, we have provided billions of dollars to help other \nteaching hospitals train physicians. But until recently, we barely gave \nchildren's hospitals pocket change to support their physician training. \nWe still do not have parity between children's hospitals and other \nteaching hospitals, we need to get there.\n  I support the President's budget and his tax cut, and thus I \nsupported this budget resolution, at least as it was introduced. \nKnowing that the appropriations bills that actually provide funds for \nall of these priorities will be written later this year, I was content \nto bide my time and deal with funding totals then.\n  But when the NIH amendment was brought up earlier, I started to \nworry. Would our focus during this debate be only on the NIH, and not \nin other areas? Would this mean that later appropriations bills thus \nfocus only on the NIH and ignore others areas? Would the NIH become the \nguest at the dinner party who stays too long and eats everyone else's \nfood? We must not let this happen.\n  We voted to make room in the budget for a total increase in NIH \nspending of $3.5 billion, more than 16 percent above the current \nspending level. None of these other important programs, the National \nScience Foundation, community health centers, children's hospitals, \nreceive anywhere close to that much of an increase.\n  In the remaining time here on the budget resolution, I intend to \noffer amendments that will address each of these priorities. I hope the \nSenate will recognize that they are just as important as the vital work \nthe NIH does. And I hope to see those amendments pass in a similarly \noverwhelming way.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, whatever time Senator Specter had I \nyield back.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We yield back our time on our side as well.\n\n[[Page S3402]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will be sending an amendment to the \ndesk in just a few moments on behalf of myself and Senator Carnahan to \ncorrect the Record. We will be offering this amendment together this \nafternoon, along with Senator Corzine, Senator Breaux, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Levin, Senator Graham, Senator Nelson, and Senator \nReed. There may be others who will be joining us in offering what we \nhope will be a bipartisan amendment because this is surely a principle \nthat both Democrats and Republicans have supported for many years.\n  Before I get to my prepared remarks, I thank my colleagues, Senator \nConrad and Senator Domenici, for their fine work in handling this \ndebate. I will begin by giving a very graphic description of our \nnational defense outlays as a share of GDP.\n  It is helpful for our party, for the other side, and for our \nconstituents to understand that these numbers have varied widely and \nfluctuated dramatically based on the current needs and crisis at hand.\n  As my colleagues can see, we were spending in the 1940s almost 40 \npercent of our gross domestic product when this country geared up to \nfight the greatest war machine ever built in the history of the world, \nwhen we defended the world. Then we came down to a low of below 5 \npercent as we recovered from that war and then had to invest again for \nthe Korean war.\n  This number has fluctuated wildly. I hope this chart can be seen \nclearly because it is very important for the public to get a sense of \nthis debate and to understand why this amendment is so important and \nwhy I am hoping we will have many Members support it.\n  This is an effort to improve the budget resolution we are debating, \nand it is a very important debate clearly for the future of our Nation.\n  As one can see, we came down a great amount in spending, of course, \nfrom the 1950s to the current year of 2001, and rightly so perhaps \nbecause we used this as a peace dividend. The world generally being at \npeace, we were able to contribute to our economy, to investments in \nother areas, and to stabilizing our budget. This was done in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n  We can see under President Reagan's leadership these numbers went up \nslightly, which is referred to as the Reagan buildup, but the numbers \nhave come down. Both candidates for President, Governor Bush and now, \nof course, President Bush, and Vice President Gore talked about the \nneed to stabilize this line, to make strategic investments now, to not \nallow this line to continue to slide because the world is not becoming \nsafer. The cold war may be over, but there are still many challenges.\n  In addition, there has been study upon study, speech upon speech \ngiven by our chairman, our ranking member, and members of the committee \ntalking about the time to invest now in our military to help turn \naround this sliding line; to help stabilize. Words they used: Let's be \nreliable; let's reinvest in our men and women; let's increase morale; \nlet's improve housing; let's recapitalize. This amendment is a modest \nstep toward that end.\n  To remind all, during the 2000 election campaign, President Bush made \na very compelling national security address at the Citadel, a military \nschool with a rich tradition of history and honor. While we commonly \nrefer to that as the ``Citadel speech,'' the speech has a name. \nPresident Bush entitled his remarks that day ``A Period of \nConsequences.''\n  That title is not just a casual descriptive phrase. It has an \nimportant legacy. It was first used by a man facing the most \nconsequential period in his nation's history--Sir Winston Churchill.\n  Assuming the reins of power at a time when Britain was threatened by \nthe greatest war machine ever created, Churchill proclaimed:\n\n       The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing \n     and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to a close. In \n     its place, we are entering a period of consequences.\n\n  When he cited those remarks last September, President Bush was right. \nI agree with him, and so do many Members in the Senate.\n  Our military has reached a period of consequences, and many difficult \ndecisions need to be made. I will ask the Senate today to make one of \nthose important decisions. This body will go on record with a clear \nchoice of priority: we can either spend everything we have or think we \nhave in a surplus that has not yet materialized or we can give \ncommonsense tax relief, a realistic level of tax relief and also--which \nis most important--have money to make some strategic investments in one \nparticular area with known shortfalls, and that is in defense.\n  We just passed Senator Harkin's amendment. I was proud to support \nthat amendment because this body, in a bipartisan way, made it clear \nanother strategic investment we must make is in education. We must take \na second step and make an important decision today to invest in \nshortfalls in defense.\n  The President seemed to understand this problem during the campaign \nwhen he said:\n\n       Not since the years before Pearl Harbor has our investment \n     in national defense been so low as a percentage of GNP. Yet \n     rarely has our military been so freely used--an average of \n     one deployment every 9 weeks in the last few years. Since the \n     end of the cold war our ground forces have been deployed more \n     frequently, while our defense budget has fallen by nearly 40 \n     percent.\n\n  One cannot argue with the numbers or argue with the trend line on \nthis chart. The budget we are debating, unfortunately, without this \namendment, will not stabilize this line. It will not turn it around. It \nwill not invest in the quality of life issues so important to retain \nour soldiers and their families, to build morale, and to strengthen our \ntroops, and most importantly, live up\n\n[[Page S3403]]\n\nto promises we have made to them in terms of their pay, in terms of \ntheir benefits, in terms of the kind of housing we promised them.\n  These words do not sound like those of someone advocating the status \nquo. I and many of my colleagues are baffled. I didn't imagine, \nfrankly, that this amendment would need to be offered. But here we are, \n7 months after the election, having this debate.\n  Let me ask my colleagues, since the election, has the world gotten \nautomatically safer? Did our military find a secret storage site filled \nwith spare parts? Did the 13-percent civilian pay gap disappear? Did \nthe dilapidated facilities we heard about in the campaign start \nrepairing themselves? Maybe all of our military families at wit's end \nwith TRICARE have been cured.\n  We know that is not the reality and the needs still exist. The budget \nwe are debating is deficient in that regard. The amendment of Senator \nCarnahan and myself which we are now debating we hope will begin to fix \nthis and make a modest investment.\n  Let me show a couple of pictures to highlight some of the problems we \nhave in our own State. I have the great privilege of representing Fort \nPolk, one of the premier training centers in the Nation, in the view of \nour commanders. This is where our men and women train before being sent \nto Bosnia or to Korea or other places where we have either conflicts or \nhave engaged in serious peacekeeping efforts. This is just one picture. \nI could show 100 pictures of housing, of dilapidated structures, of \nmold and mildew.\n  If you go to Fort Polk's website, you will see old photographs taken \nat its creation in 1941. These are the same makeshift wooden huts, now \nused as dining facilities, that were there when Churchill was making \nhis speech about ``a period of consequences.'' How long does this \nbuilding need to serve its country before it can retire? I would say \nWorld War II, Korea Vietnam, Grenada, Desert Storm, and Kosovo should \njust about cover any building's life span. Not at Fort Polk.\n  This is only one of many examples of situations repeated all across \nour country at our military bases. There are a variety of reasons for \nthis crumbling infrastructure. However, if you talk to the base \ncommanders you hear one refrain again and again. Real property \nmaintenance is the first casualty. When officers are forced to choose \nbetween installing air conditioners for the Louisiana summer, or \ncontinue training their men and women for war, officers correctly \nchoose training. However, it is wrong for Congress to force our \nmilitary leadership to opt between essential quality of life \ninitiatives and basic readiness, maintenance and safety. Yet that is \nthe choice our post commanders are forced to make year after year. \nFurthermore, while the newer housing that the military is building is \nvery nice, there is not nearly enough of it to go around. In the \nmeantime, we force our servicemen and women to live in substandard \nhousing. I would be willing to bet that you could go on nearly every \nbase in America and find military housing that does not meet HUD's \nstandards. Nonetheless, we wonder why we have a recruiting and a \nretention problem. If it were not for the extraordinary patriotism of \nour men and women, our ``problem'' would be an epidemic.\n  Still, I suspect that many colleagues will respond that we are \nundertaking a strategic review, and we should not prejudge and rush to \nany conclusion. We should wait. To that, I refer my colleagues back to \nWinston Churchill. We are in a period of consequences. We should be \ndone with the era of procrastination. In any case, we can study this \nproblem to death, and it will not change the fundamental reality. These \nproblems need a resolution today, not ten years from now. They will \nrequire a greater portion of our nation's resources to address. Yet if \nwe do not set those resources aside in this budget resolution, they \nwill not be there for us to invest later.\n  The other irony about the supposed need for delay is the study \nitself. In all the reports that have come out, there has not been any \nindication that these quality of life initiatives are even being \nconsidered. Even if they were considered, it is extremely unlikely that \nany study would conclude that we need to spend less money on these \nissues. More likely than not, this amendment adding $10 billion a year \nwould be viewed as a modest down-payment on a much larger debt coming \ndue.\n  Perhaps the real savings comes from military transformation? Maybe if \nwe adopt new technologies and techniques we can forestall the need for \nmore military spending? Not likely. Although Secretary Rumsfeld and Mr. \nMarshall may be the latest to study military transformation, they are \nnot exactly the only study. I have brought with me a stack of studies \nthat reach the same conclusion. We need military transformation. We \nneed to recapitalize our forces. We need to encourage joint \nexperimentation and operations, and we must prepare for the emerging \nthreats of the 21st century. All the reports have a different emphasis. \nThey come from the broadest possible political spectrum, but they all \nendorse these same principles. What is more, they all believe we need a \ntop line increase in defense to accomplish these goals. Again you will \nfind a range of perspectives from about a $30 billion annual increase \nat the low end, to a $100 billion annual increase at the very high end. \nEither way, the conclusion is the same.\n\n  The problem is that if we do conclude that we need a significant \ninvestment, there will be no money for us to invest. I support the \nstrategic review. I imagine that I will support a good deal of what \nSecretary Rumsfeld has to say. We have reason to believe there is a big \nbill on the horizon. We have the money in the bank. I suggest we \nallocate some of that money toward this bill that is due today. \nUnfortunately, the Republican leadership is taking those savings and \nliving for the moment. How they will account for this decision, I do \nnot know.\n  The other important point to keep in mind is that this amendment does \nnot change the bottom line need for reform at the Pentagon. I agree \nwith Senator Byrd's insistence that the Pentagon get its books in \norder. Furthermore, the low end estimates for the need to recapitalize \nour current force are an additional $30 billion per year. My amendment \nis providing the services $10 billion. If this is all the services get, \nthey still have to cover that two-thirds gap somehow. To do so will \nrequire the services to rethink what they are doing, and how they are \ndoing it. This fundamental rethinking is an exercise we all should \nendorse. It will not be any less necessary should our amendment pass.\n  I invite the Senate to look at the build rates for the Navy. Last \nyear, the Navy CinC's stated that they could not perform their missions \nwith fewer than 360 ships. Yet, for the past eight years, the Navy has \nbeen procuring only an average of six ships per year. This build rate \nis the lowest since 1932, and will result in a Naval fleet of 180 ships \nif continued. All of our military forces serve the dual function of \ngood-will ambassadors and ``cooperation builders'' with our allies. \nThis role is even more prominently performed by our Navy. It also \nserves as an important signal of American resolve at crisis points. \nHowever, we may soon reach a point where our Navy, rather than an \ninstrument of American power projection, is relegated to protecting an \nincreasingly tenuous forward-presence.\n  I might also mention that we take a hard look at what we are saying \nto our NATO allies about their defense budgets. As we insist that our \nallies take greater strides to bridge the capability gap, we also \nremind them that the whole solution will not be found in greater \nefficiency or reform. We consciously assert that transformation costs \nmoney, and no nation can expect to improve capabilities without an \nincrease in the top-line budget. I would submit that the logic of these \narguments applies no less to the United States than it does Belgium or \nNorway.\n  This amendment acknowledges the truth, we are in a period of \nconsequences for our military. We can acknowledge that fact and pass \nthis amendment, or stick our heads in the sand. With the People's \nRepublic of China increasing defense spending 15 percent, with the \nMiddle East edging toward open conflict, with the conflict in the \nBalkans spilling over to Macedonia, with increased military cooperation \nbetween Iran and Russia--this seems like a very dangerous time to \nignore reality for the sake of political posturing. A tax cut that robs \nour\n\n[[Page S3404]]\n\nmilitary of much needed reinvestment is wrong-headed and reckless.\n  Another great English Prime Minister Lloyd George once said of \nAmerica that ``she always does the right thing, after she has tried all \nother options.'' Today I present the Senate with the option to do the \nright thing. Pass this amendment, put the needs of our military and our \nnation before short-term political gain.\n  When we asked people to reenlist, we asked the spouses: Would you \nlike your spouse to reenlist? Have your children live in places that we \ndon't even allow our Housing and Urban Development to build and to \nfund? We ask our service men and women to live in substandard housing \nwith inadequate pay, with health care that is less than what was \npromised when they signed up to serve. These are the things I hope my \namendment will fix and make the minimum downpayment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might I inquire how much time we have consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 11 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 15 minutes off the resolution to the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Parliamentary inquiry: It is the intention of the Senator \nfrom Virginia at the appropriate juncture to offer an amendment in the \nsecond degree. I value greatly the participation of my distinguished \ncolleague on the Armed Services Committee. I find myself in a position \nof requiring to express my views and those of others in the form of a \nsecond degree. My amendment would be very simple. It would ask for an \n$8.5 billion increase solely for 1 fiscal year, which is 2002, and at \nthe appropriate time I will give further details.\n  Could I inquire of the leadership, I want to be very careful with the \nprotocol toward my good colleague, and presumably I can put the \namendment at the desk now, but I wish to have the Senator complete her \nopening remarks first, and at that time if I might inquire of the \ndistinguished managers, what would be their desire with respect to a \nsecond degree? I would need but 15 minutes to describe it. There may be \nothers who would like to speak.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be pleased, if the other side agrees, to make \nit in order that the Senator offer it, but we have to use up the time \non the amendment before it would be in order under current practice. It \nis in their hands. I would be glad to let you send it up so people \ncould see it. It would not be ripe until all time were yielded on the \namendments.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might I inquire of the Senator from Virginia, would the \nSenator consider offering his amendment in the first degree with an \nunderstanding that he would get the first vote? If the Senator offers \nhis amendment in the second degree----\n  Mr. WARNER. In the nature of a substitute, yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Not as a substitute, as a first degree.\n  I am suggesting this for this reason: We are going to want to get a \nvote on the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana. We can go through \nall kinds of parliamentary maneuvers to do that and ultimately succeed. \nWe have found so far it works better if we handle both amendments in \nthe first degree. You would get the first vote because you would have \nbeen offering it in the second degree.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield to the distinguished managers. They are handling \nthis bill. I want to hear from the Senator from New Mexico on that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, from what I understand, we don't want to deny \nher a vote. We want a vote on his first. Whatever happens to it, you \nget a vote. But we will have a vote on it first. Is my understanding \ncorrect?\n  Before I do that, if we could proceed and let me make an inquiry. It \nlooks as if that is what we ought to agree to. For now, let us proceed \nin the normal course.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Fair enough. We appreciate the chairman looking into \nthat, and we appreciate the consideration of the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee as well.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank all colleagues. Basically, I sought recognition \nso the Senate will understand there will be an amendment of some type \nwhich will be, in a sense, in opposition to my distinguished friend and \ncolleague from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I appreciate that. Let me comment briefly as we decide \nthe appropriate way to proceed. I must certainly note we will have a \nvote on this amendment that Senator Carnahan and I are offering. I \nsuggest to the distinguished managers, our amendment and that of \nSenator Warner could be complementary. His amendment deals only with 1 \nyear of an increase, which I actually support. I agree we need an \nincrease for the 2002 budget. My amendment makes a longer, more \nreliable, stable commitment over 10 years. Given the underlying budget \nresolution does the same, we are not necessarily in disagreement, \nexcept for the fact that mine has a 10-year outlook and his has only 1 \nyear. I simply argue that while his amendment might be a step to take, \nwe could certainly take this step as we make a decision for the \nstrategic investment that we need to make over this decade--not just \nfor 1 year.\n  On another point, some may say: Senators, you know there is a \nstrategic review under way. Shouldn't we wait before we consider this \namendment?\n  I have brought to the floor today studies that I could submit for the \nRecord. This one is a ``Strategy For Long Peace,'' by the Center for \nStrategic and Budgetary Assessments. I am just going to refer to two.\n  This one is called ``Averting the Defense Train Wreck in the New \nMillennium'' by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in \nWashington, DC. These are two very well known and well-respected think \ntanks.\n  As I said, I have with me an additional 15 studies that I have \nbrought, from conservative to liberal think tanks, that have looked at \nthis issue and are actually probably part of the strategic study \nunderway. In no case that I can find, after reviewing all of these \nstudies, do any at all indicate that a strategic review would result in \nless of an increase or reduction in defense spending--not one. Even \nwith those arguing for transformation from a cold war structure to a \nnew structure, even for those who are arguing for very aggressive \ntransformation, there is not a study that we can find, no expert on \neither side of this debate, who is going to make an argument that this \nspending line is going to go down. It is going to go up. Yet the budget \nresolution we are debating is not, in the current form, going to allow \nfor that.\n  So our amendment will set aside $100 billion out of the tax cut, $10 \nbillion a year, to make room for the strategic study, to make room for \nthe quality of life, to make room for the improvements that need to be \nmade to boost the morale and to boost the vigor of our Armed Forces. \nWaiting is not only going to force us to make some very tough decisions \ndown the road, but waiting is also going to cost the taxpayer billions \nof dollars because of the delay, because of this budget gap. It is not \nfair and it is not right and it is not smart. We can do it all if we \nuse common sense and reasonableness and we are careful about what \nnumbers we put on the tax cut and on certain strategic investments.\n  I am going to try to wrap up in just a moment, only to say the \nPresident campaigned on this issue when he ran for President. People \nvoted for him based on a promise to support an increased military \ninvestment. Many of us who even voted for the other candidate believe \nit is a very important step to take now, to improve and to strengthen \nour investments, particularly the quality of life issues of housing, \npay, other compensation, and health care; to strengthen our retention \nof our forces and to provide for them the things that we promised when \nthey signed on the bottom line.\n  If we are careful, if we make the right decisions today, we can have \na reasonable tax cut, we can pass strategic investments in education \nand defense, and we can pass a budget that will work, not only for this \nyear but for next year and for many years to come. So I am proud to \noffer this amendment on behalf of my colleagues. I could give many more \nexamples where it comes to our Navy, to our Army, to our Air Force, to \nMarines, to the things we need to maintain our ships and planes, as \nwell as our quality of life issues.\n  In closing, let me say with all due respect to my chairman, who is \ngoing to offer another amendment, whether he\n\n[[Page S3405]]\n\ndoes it before I do or after I offer mine, I agree with him that we \nneed to increase spending by his amendment of $8.5 billion for 2002. \nBut that does not go far enough. We are laying down a budget for the \nnext 10 years. Are we just going to offer our military an increase for \n1 year and say you are on your own for years after? We need to be \nreliable. We need to be trustworthy. We need to live up to our \npromises. We need to support the Landrieu-Carnahan amendment that will \nbegin to make a modest investment to keep this line stable, to keep our \ncountry secure, and to put the money where our mouth is. When we say we \nsupport our men and women in the Armed Forces, let's do it now. If we \ncannot do it now, when are we going to do it?\n\n  Once this budget resolution passes without my amendment, it will not \nmatter if 100 strategic studies come back. There is not going to be any \nmoney to fund it. Let us, while we can, make the investment for our men \nand women in the Armed Forces.\n  I yield the remainder of my time back. I think the manager has done a \nbeautiful job. Senator Carnahan would like to speak for a few minutes \non this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana, who is \na distinguished Member of the Armed Services Committee, for her \namendment. I think it is an important amendment, one of the most \nimportant amendments we will consider in the context of a budget \nresolution. On the Budget Committee we heard witness after witness tell \nus we needed to add $5 billion to $10 billion a year over the next 10 \nyears to the defense budget to be responsible. The Senator from \nLouisiana has added that $10 billion.\n  Let me say we had a hearing before the Budget Committee with four \nwitnesses: two Republican witnesses, two Democrat witnesses. They were \nin agreement on the amount of money needed to be added to defense, \ngiven the stress on the defense budget, with the higher rate of \noperations, with the need for additional resources to meet demands we \nhave put on the Defense Department.\n  President Bush has called for a strategic review. We agree absolutely \nthat is important and that is appropriate. We also believe there is no \nquestion that additional resources have to be provided to the Defense \nDepartment. We need to strengthen our national defense. If we do not \nprovide the money in a budget resolution, it is not going to be \navailable. So this amendment is critically important.\n  I understand the Senator from Missouri, Mrs. Carnahan, would like to \nspeak on the amendment as well.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Yes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 188\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. If I may interrupt for one moment, I understand the \namendment is now at the desk, so I would like to officially call it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu) for herself, Mrs. \n     Carnahan, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Reed, Mr. Levin, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \n     Corzine, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Nelson of Florida, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 188.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Missouri has requested 10 minutes? The \nSenator from Missouri is provided 10 minutes off the resolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Would it be \nappropriate----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield? Does the Senator from \nMissouri yield to the Senator from Virginia?\n  Mr. REID. Without her losing the floor.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished Republican manager \nwishes to address a unanimous consent request which I think meets the \nobjectives, such that our valued colleague from Louisiana can get the \nfirst vote, then my second-degree would be the second vote. I wonder if \nthe managers would refer to that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \nLandrieu amendment be laid aside and Senator Warner be recognized to \noffer an amendment relative to defense. I further ask the debate run \nconcurrently on both first-degree amendments and be limited to 60 \nminutes equally divided, and following that time the Senate will \nproceed to vote in relation to the Landrieu amendment and then in \nrelation to the Warner amendment. I further ask consent no amendments \nbe in order prior to the votes just described and the votes occur in a \nstacked sequence with 2 minutes prior to each vote for explanation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, I just have a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I have no objection to the 60 minutes divided for the \ndiscussion of the Landrieu-Carnahan amendment and the Warner \nalternative. How will the debate proceed? Will we alternate pro and con \nor will we take our 60 minutes first or alternately allocate the time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it is our intention that the two managers \nallocate time so there is a fair division.\n  Reserving the right to object, since Senator Carnahan was previously \nrecognized off the resolution, I assume this would follow her remarks. \nWould that be the intention?\n  Mr. WARNER. Certainly that would be satisfactory.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In which event we ask 10 minutes be added to our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, there are a number of \nother Members who would want to speak on this amendment. I am wondering \nif Senator Lieberman, who was here, and Senator Reed, who was here, \nwill be given time to speak on this amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sixty minutes divided equally. That is what it says. We \nwill work on rotation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, I would hope that we could \nwork this out so we have a firm understanding of what will occur so \nfeelings are not bruised in the process. It is easy to have happen.\n  Let's be clear. As I understand it, then, Senator Carnahan will \nproceed with 10 minutes off the budget resolution, and then there will \nbe the 60 minutes between the two sides with respect to these \namendments. Is that acceptable?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, I thought you just prevailed. She \nwill get the 10 minutes she had. And then the 1 hour will become \noperative, at which time we agree we each get half of that; but we will \naccommodate back and forth so no side gets unfair treatment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Good.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, when families across the country plan \nfor the future, they first determine their essential priorities. Then \nthey put money aside to make sure they can pay for them. Only after \nthose priorities are met, do our families decide whether money is left \nover to pay for other things.\n  I believe we would be wise to approach the Federal Government's \nbudget the same way.\n  First, we should determine how much we need to invest for vital \nnational priorities. The remaining funds should be returned to the \npeople through a tax cut. We can meet our national priorities and still \nprovide for substantial tax relief to America's working families.\n  But the budget we are considering seems to have been constructed \nexactly the opposite way. It appears to have\n\n[[Page S3406]]\n\nbeen built around the $1.6 trillion tax cut, leaving us without \nadequate funds to meet our budgetary needs.\n  One of the most glaring shortfalls in the President's budget is in \nthe area of national defense.\n  Of the $5.6 trillion in anticipated surpluses, the budget proposed by \nPresident Bush spends only $60 billion--about 1 percent--on defense.\n  I believe that this level of military funding is inadequate to meet \nour military's current and long-term needs. The amendment that Senator \nLandrieu and I have proposed will remedy this flaw by increasing \ndefense spending over the next 10 years by $100 billion above what the \nPresident has proposed. I commend Senator Landrieu for her leadership \non this issue and am pleased to join with her in supporting the men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces and in protecting the national security.\n  Leaders of our Armed Forces tell us that we must invest in both \npersonnel and equipment to preserve our preeminence in the 21st \ncentury. The list of military needs is exceptionally long. That list \nincludes, but is not limited to, modernizing our tactical aircraft and \nother aging weapons systems, increasing the readiness of our forces, \nbuilding decent housing on our bases at home and abroad, improving the \nquality of military life, increasing military salaries and health \nbenefits, maintaining and repairing our aging infrastructure, and \nsecuring our information technology.\n  Virtually every expert that has looked at the state of our military \nagrees that major new investments are required.\n  Just last September, the Joint Chiefs of Staff estimated that $50 \nbillion per year in additional funds were needed to maintain readiness \nand to modernize our forces. And the Joint Chiefs were only talking \nabout modernization and readiness. The $50 billion figure did not \ninclude the investments needed to increase retention of personnel and \nimprove the standards of living for military families.\n  Examples of urgent funding requirements abound. But let me take a few \nminutes to discuss the situations on the two major bases in Missouri, \nFort Leonard Wood and Whiteman Air Force Base, with a special focus on \nhousing.\n  Fort Leonard Wood's housing units were constructed between 1958 and \n1964. Only one out of six units has been fully renovated. The floor \nplans are outdated. There are insufficient playgrounds and storage \nspace. Many homes are below Army standards in size and quality. The \npoor grade of housing at Fort Leonard Wood is one of the factors that \nmakes it difficult for us to retain our highly trained and skilled \nsenior enlisted personnel and officers.\n  Numerous other infrastructure improvements are needed at Fort Leonard \nWood. The most disturbing one that has been reported to me is the lack \nof running water or sewers on the 48 ranges used to train our young men \nand women. The latrines on the ranges are some of the worst in the \ncommand. Some soldiers are said to limit their water intake to avoid \nusing these decrepit facilities.\n  Military personnel at Whiteman Air Force Base face other indignities. \nFamily housing suffers from termite damage, water seepage, and flooding \nof playgrounds. Twenty percent of all units have been vacated due to \ntermite and water damage.\n  Unfortunately, I cannot say that help is on the way.\n  The backlog of deferred maintenance at Fort Leonard Wood comes to \nabout $66 million. The current annual budget of $13 million is $2 \nmillion less than necessary to sustain the current housing stock and \n$6.6 million less than what is necessary to reducing the backlog. To \nmake matters worse, high utility costs this year have caused a \nshortfall of $1.8 million, which is being taken from the housing \nmaintenance budget.\n  At Whiteman, $125 million are needed to fix 900 units, construct 129 \nnew units, and repair playgrounds, streets, and other common areas. But \nWhiteman's annual housing budget is $7 million less than necessary to \nimplement this plan.\n  The problems in Missouri are duplicated across the country and at our \nbases abroad. The Commander in Chief of the European Command, General \nRalston, testified last month before the Armed Services Committee on \nwhich I sit. He said that 70 percent of the housing in Europe did not \nmeet Army standards. And the Department of Defense reports that the \nbacklog of real property maintenance is $27.2 billion.\n  The Landrieu-Carnahan amendment is designed to meet these needs in \nthe years to come.\n  The amendment will reduce the President's tax cut by $100 billion and \ndedicate these funds to defense spending.\n  Reducing the tax cut by this amount will only slightly lessen the \namount returned to the wealthiest Americans under the President's plan. \nI believe that these Americans would be willing to take this sacrifice \nif they knew that the money would be spent for better equipment, \nhousing, and salaries for our military personnel.\n  When I asked new appointees to the Pentagon how they plan to address \nthe shortfall in the budget, they have all told me that these issues \nare currently being considered in the Pentagon's comprehensive \nstrategic review. I applaud the new administration for conducting this \nreview and for proposing to ``transform'' the military to meet the \nsecurity threats of this new century. But no one believes that this new \nreview is going to lead to reduced defense spending over the next \ndecade.\n  Quite the contrary. One expert, Dr. Andrew Krepinevich of the Center \nfor Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, testified before the Senate \nBudget Committee. He said that there is a $120 billion mismatch between \nour current defense plans and projected defense budget. The Pentagon's \nstrategic review may result in some cuts to existing programs. These \ncuts, however, will not cover both the $120 billion shortfall, plus \nwhatever new costs are required to transform the military.\n  The bottom line is that there will be calls to spend more, not less, \non defense after the strategic review is over.\n  We should prepare for that certainty now by adopting a budget that \ncontains realistic spending levels for national security.\n  The problem with waiting until after the review is over is that \nCongress is poised to pass the President's tax cut now. If this tax cut \npasses, the necessary funds simply will not be available for the \nrequired level of defense spending.\n  This amendment is a much more prudent approach. It sets aside the \nfunds for our military needs over the next decade.\n  In the unlikely event that the strategic review calls for less \nspending than this amendment provides, that money can always be used \nfor tax cuts, or other purposes in the future. But everyone in the \nChamber knows that we will not be able to undo a tax cut, not even to \nincrease defense spending. If the President's tax cut goes forward, our \nmilitary budget is going to feel the squeeze in the years and decades \nto come.\n  So I strongly advocate this amendment. I urge the Senate to stand \nbehind the men and women who defend our country by adopting this \nimportant measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 189\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Virginia is recognized to offer his amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I send to the desk an amendment. It is a \nfirst-degree amendment. As I understand, under the UC there will be \nsequential votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself, Mr. \n     Hutchinson, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Inhofe, Ms. Collins, Mr. Miller, \n     and Mr. Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 189 to amendment \n     No. 170.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase the levels of new budget authority and budget \n   outlays provided for the National Defense (050) major functional \n category for fiscal year 2002, and to make corresponding adjustments \n                    necessitated by those increases)\n\n       On page 10, line 21, increase the amount by $8,500,000,000.\n\n[[Page S3407]]\n\n       On page 10, line 22, increase the amount by $6,460,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 15, decrease the amount by $8,500,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 16, decrease the amount by $6,460,000,000.\n       On page 48, line 8, increase the amount by $8,500,000,000.\n       On page 48, line 9, increase the amount by $6,460,000,000.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I first pay tribute to my two \ncolleagues, members of the Committee on Armed Services. As I listened \nvery intently to their comments, there is not much with which I can \ndisagree with respect to the need for additional funds.\n  Where we differ, I say with due respect, is that we have a new \nPresident, a new Secretary of Defense, and there are a number of \nMembers in this Chamber on both sides of the aisle who have commended \nPresident Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld in their initiatives to go back \nand reexamine the entirety of America's defense posture and to give \ngreater emphasis to the emerging and ever-changing threats poised \nagainst our Nation and providing everyday risk to the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces who are posted beyond our shores standing watch in the \ncause of freedom.\n  This amendment prejudges the end result of these studies and \nprejudges the Bush administration and how they are going to reorient \nour defense posture for the outyears. It lays out a 10-year program; in \na sense it allocates the 10 for each of the years.\n  My amendment addresses but 1 fiscal year, 2002. It is the budget \nwhich we are working on now. President Bush, when he came to office, \nlooked at the Clinton budget and decided to add $14.2 billion for this \nparticular fiscal year. That was done very early on when he arrived \ninto office. Subsequent thereto, the work of our committee produced \npapers, an analysis which showed that even funding of 14.2 falls short \nof what is desperately--I use that word very cautiously but very \ntruthfully--needed by all the military departments to get our military \nthrough the 2002 fiscal year, to maintain its readiness, to maintain \nthe quality of life for the men and women of the Armed Forces, and to \nhope to strengthen the ability of the services to retain. I cannot \nemphasize too strongly the need to retain middle-grade officers and \nsenior enlisted men and women.\n  We are falling short in those areas, and we now realize we must do \nmore. Whether it is pay, housing, medical, hopefully less deployment, \nbut we are falling short in that way. Every time we lose a pilot, the \nAmerican taxpayers lose several million dollars of investment in the \ntraining that he or she has received through the years. Only a small \namount of money, only a small amount of improvement in housing, only a \nsmall amount of improvement in health care could well have retained \nthat highly skilled aviator and/or the maintenance chief down on the \nline working night and day to repair and keep the planes flying.\n  This amendment by my two colleagues really prejudges what our \nPresident and Secretary of Defense will come up with. I would like to \nhypothetically put this to my colleagues. I think we should give this \nPresident the opportunity to make his judgments and to come back in \nsubsequent fiscal years to the Congress and say: This is precisely what \nI need, or I don't need the full 10 billion, should this amendment \nbecome law.\n  Stop to think about that. It could be in fiscal 2003 that our \nPresident wishes to increase the defense budget by 20 billion and \nrepresents to the Congress at that time, absent unforeseen \ncontingencies, the following fiscal year he could have level funding \nand/or maybe just a billion or two additional funding.\n  This President is reorienting the budget more and more towards the \nthreat, beginning to scale down the number of deployments and hopefully \nimprove the retention.\n  On the committee--I speak of the committee in terms of its staff \nbecause we worked on this in a bipartisan way; I presume my colleague, \nMr. Levin, will join in this debate--the figures that were worked up \nwere produced in conjunction with analyses supplied by the Department \nof Defense. We broke out the following amounts in various line items, \nall in the 05, which is the readiness account:\n  Three-tenths of a billion for force protection. More and more we \nrecognize that our bases overseas are subjected to terrorism. We have \nexperienced very serious accidents this year, the U.S.S. Cole being the \nmost severe. So we need three-tenths of a billion to help augment those \nexpenditures.\n  Six-tenths of a billion for personnel. Again, special pay, pay \ndirected at those specialties, whether it is flying or maintenance or \nmedical or computers or the like, where we are having difficulty \nretaining those individuals with the competitive forces in the private \nsector.\n  Energy costs. It simply requires that we have this to maintain the \nbarracks, to maintain the housing, to maintain the office buildings, to \nmaintain the hangars, to maintain the ships. Our energy costs have gone \nup not unlike those being experienced by the civilian sector.\n  Maintenance. The Senator from Louisiana put up a chart with which I \nagree. Deterioration of the base infrastructure all throughout our \nservices, Seven-tenths of a billion for that. Base operations. Again, \nwe were underfunded in the accounts. That brings in another nine-tenths \nof a billion--nine-tenths of a billion in real property maintenance, \nthe buildings. We will, hopefully, go through a base closure piece of \nlegislation within the next 24 months to complete that. But in the \nmeantime, it is absolutely essential to maintain the infrastructure we \nnow have in a condition so that it protects the airplanes in the \nhangars and protects the personnel in the barracks.\n\n  Then we go to the direct health care system. We passed historic \nlegislation last year--TRICARE. It was something that the retired \ncommunity has wanted for many years, something they were really \npromised when they joined the military services. Now that is going to \nbe a significant cost item. In years past, we had not even funded \nTRICARE to the levels that were needed to maintain the costs before our \nlegislation takes effect. As a consequence, we were drawing funds out \nof the major military hospitals.\n  I went by and visited both Bethesda and Walter Reed recently in \nconnection with seeing friends there, and the commanding officers, all \nin a very respectful way, said: Senator, we do not have sufficient \nfunds to maintain these hospitals that are taking care of the active \nduty, primarily--some retired--and their dependents. And that requires \n$1.2 billion. But that ties directly to retention. The degree that we \nproperly care for the families and the active-duty personnel reflects \nthe degree to which we can retain these valuable people in uniform.\n  Fuel. This is different from base. This is for flying the aircraft. \nThis is manning the ships. This is training in the trucks, in the \ntanks, the artillery pieces, mobile. This is where the fuel is needed. \nThat is a significant cost. Then, of course, in addition, it is for \nflying hours and the spares.\n  I expect every Member of this Senate has learned of the \ncannibalization going on, where you take parts from perfectly good \nequipment and put them in other pieces to make them run. That is no way \nto run a first-class military. But, regrettably, those dollars \nassociated with the normal maintenance and the spares have been \ninadequate for a number of years, and we are asking $1.6 billion to put \nback on the shelves sufficient spares to enable our troops to train and \nkeep their equipment in readiness. This was very carefully documented.\n  It is interesting; in the amendment of my distinguished colleague--\nthe Senator from Louisiana--she has the exact sum. My guess is that \nshe, quite rightly, has access to the same information. I must ask that \nin the form of a question at an appropriate time. But she predicated \n2002 on this figure.\n  I say the proper course of action is to be respectful of the fact \nthat this President has taken an initiative to study our military very \ncarefully, analyze the threat, and then to put together carefully a \nplan to make such revision as he deems necessary for this year and our \noutyears under the normal 5-year fit-up program--not 10. I think, in \nfairness, he should be given that opportunity.\n  I will leave it to others to address the question of how this reduces \nthe overall proposed tax cut, how it goes to other areas of the budget. \nBut my responsibility as chairman of the Armed Services Committee is \nsimply to stick, at this moment in the debate, to those\n\n[[Page S3408]]\n\nfacts as they relate to how this Nation should go forward in providing \nfor the men and women of the Armed Forces. I say out of respect for \nthis President, we should give him the right, the authority, to go \nahead and do the studies. We augment, by my legislation, a single \nfiscal year for necessities, and I don't think anybody can dispute the \nneed. I would be anxious to hear from the proponents of the other \nlegislation. I think the 2002 figure is direct and for the right \nreasons. For the years beyond 2002, let our President come forward--it \nmay be greater in 2003, and 2004 could be less--and we go about our \nresponsibility under the Constitution to maintain our Nation strong and \nfree, in accordance with the wishes of this President.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time did Senator Warner use?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator used 14 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This is coming out of the 60 minutes, and then I will, \nobviously, yield to the other side.\n  What Senator Warner is saying to the Senate is, under our unanimous \nconsent request, the Senate will get to vote on the amendment of the \nSenator from Louisiana, to be followed by a vote on the Senator's \namendment, which he has described, an $8.5 billion increase for 2002.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Having said that, I want to tell everybody there is a \nbig difference between these two amendments, beyond the fact that this \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee is saying fund \nat 2002 and let's wait for the President's request.\n  The opposition amendment of the junior Senator from Louisiana is an \ninteresting amendment as it deals with defense because it actually cuts \nthe taxes--the taxes the people thought they were going to get back. It \nreduces that by $100 billion. At first, it was $200 billion. So it \nreduces that by $100 billion out of the tax cut in order to pay for \nthis amendment.\n  It seems to me the distinguished Senator who chairs Armed Services \nhas a good point, and I hope everybody who wants to follow his lead \nwill, indeed, understand that the second vote tonight will be on his \namendment. He very much desires that this position be made. As \nchairman, he wants it to be taken by the Senate. We will be here for \nthe next 15, 20 minutes if anybody has any questions. But I send out a \nlittle signal that we have a unanimous consent, which means we are \ngoing to vote pretty soon. I might speculate with Senator Reid that we \nare going to vote within 30 or 40 minutes. So everybody should know \nthat. All time will be used up.\n  Senator Conrad has indicated he may give me an additional 10 minutes \nif I need it because there was an additional 10 minutes used on that \nside. You can add that to the mix and figure out the time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2001.\n     Senator Pete Domenici,\n     Chairman,\n     Senator Kent Conrad,\n     Ranking Member,\n     Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Pete and Kent: In accordance with your request, I am \n     forwarding my recommendations on funding for the programs in \n     the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee for the \n     Fiscal Year 2002 Budget Resolution.\n       In the near term, I believe there are some urgent needs for \n     which a Fiscal Year 2001 supplemental is appropriate, \n     including the shortfalls that experts in the Department of \n     Defense have identified in the defense health care program, \n     increased flying hour costs, and full funding for the higher \n     housing allowances currently being paid to military personnel \n     living off base.\n       With respect to Fiscal Years 2002 through 2006, I agree \n     with the Secretary of Defense that it is prudent for him to \n     conclude his strategy review and present it to the President \n     and the Congress for our consideration before we make final \n     decisions on the shape and overall funding levels for our \n     future defense program.\n       However, I believe there are certain requirements that must \n     be addressed regardless of the outcome of the ongoing \n     strategy review. Some increases above the projections \n     contained in the President's budget outline of February 28 \n     will be needed to continue the transformation of our military \n     to meet the threats of the new century, to fulfill the \n     commitments the Congress has made to provide quality health \n     care to active and retired military families, and to continue \n     the progress we have made in recent years to improve \n     compensation, housing and other quality of life programs for \n     our military families. I also recommend that the Budget \n     Resolution provide a sufficient mandatory spending allocation \n     for the Armed Services Committee to permit enactment of \n     legislation providing full funding for (1) the \n     transferability of benefits under the Montgomery G.I. Bill to \n     family members; and (2) reform of the statute prohibiting \n     concurrent receipt of military retirement and veterans \n     disability compensation.\n       For these reasons, I believe it would be prudent to \n     establish a reserve fund in the Budget Resolution to \n     accommodate the near-term and long-term adjustments to \n     current defense plans that the Administration and the \n     Congress may decide to implement once the Secretary's \n     strategy review is completed. I recommend that this reserve \n     fund provide in the range of $80 to $100 billion for the \n     national security priorities I have identified above the \n     levels projected by the President over the next ten years, \n     pending the completion of this review.\n       In my review, this reserve fund should be over and above \n     amounts set aside to fully protect the Social Security and \n     Medicare Trust Funds, pay down the national debt, and meet \n     other priorities, and should not be lumped into a single \n     reserve fund in which defense funding needs would have to \n     compete against other vital national priorities. I also \n     believe this reserve fund should be established in the Budget \n     Resolution before a decision is reached on the various tax \n     proposals before Congress. I have serious concerns that a tax \n     cut of the size proposed by the President would not leave \n     sufficient funds for future increases in defense and other \n     important programs.\n       I look forward to working with you on a Budget Resolution \n     for Fiscal Year 2002 that provides the necessary funding to \n     preserve our strong national defense and the other important \n     programs that are essential to our nation's security and \n     prosperity.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, this is a letter from Senator Levin, the \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee, to the distinguished \nChairman Domenici and the ranking member, Mr. Conrad, of the Budget \nCommittee addressing the needs, as we see them, for defense in the \nyears to come.\n  I will read one paragraph which I think is really dispositive of what \nwe are discussing. I quote Mr. Levin:\n\n       In the near term, I believe there are some urgent needs for \n     which a Fiscal Year 2001 supplemental is appropriate, \n     including the shortfalls that experts in the Department of \n     Defense have identified in the defense health care program, \n     increased flying hour costs, and full funding for the higher \n     housing allowances currently being paid to military personnel \n     living off base.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       With respect to Fiscal Years 2002 through 2006, I agree \n     with the Secretary of Defense that it is prudent for him to \n     conclude his strategy review and present it to the President \n     and the Congress for our consideration before we make final \n     decisions on the shape and overall funding levels for our \n     future defense program.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Conrad, the manager \nof the bill, I yield time to the Senator from Rhode Island, but prior \nto doing that, I want to indicate how fortunate we are in the Congress, \nin the Senate, to have someone of his knowledge.\n  Senator Jack Reed is a graduate of the United States Military Academy \nat West Point. He was an airborne ranger, a company commander. He was \npart of the 82nd Airborne. He had 35 jumps. His career in the military, \nincluding his time at West Point, consisted of 12 years. He was a \nprofessor at West Point.\n  He not only is a member of the Armed Services Committee in the \nSenate, but during the time he served as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, he served on the very important Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  This man has served our country, including his time at West Point, \nsome 12 years. I do not know of anyone I would rather have speak on \nissues relating to the military than Jack Reed, the senior Senator from \nRhode Island. I yield 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S3409]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I associate myself with Senator Reid's \nremarks. Senator Jack Reed is a very valuable and well-informed member \nof the Armed Services Committee, as well as his colleagues, the \nprincipal sponsors of the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Senator from Virginia and I have a \nmutual admiration society. We have served on the same committee since I \nhave been in the Senate. I am always impressed with the seriousness of \neverything he says, especially on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. I share his view.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to lend support to the amendment of \nSenator Landrieu and Senator Carnahan and commend my chairman for his \namendment. All of these individuals recognize the need for additional \nresources in defense spending. In fact, when it comes to Chairman \nWarner, there is no one in this Chamber who has been more solicitous \nand supportive of the welfare of American fighting men and women and \nthe readiness of those forces than the Senator from Virginia, but I \nbelieve this is an important moment in the debate to make a broader \npoint about this budget and defense spending.\n  Explicitly, this budget calls for a $1.6 trillion or $1.7 trillion \ntax cut over 10 years. It reserves the money for that tax cut. Yet it \nignores anticipated expenses that we already know will be incurred in \ndefense. When it comes to defense spending in this budget, there is \nonly one word for it: this budget is disingenuous.\n  We are not prejudging President Bush. We are taking him at his word. \nI quote the President:\n\n       At the earliest possible date, my administration will \n     deploy antiballistic missile systems, both theater and \n     national, to guard against attack and blackmail.\n\n  When we look at the estimated costs for a national missile defense, \nit is approximately $115 billion, and that total is growing with each \nnew reestimation. The $115 billion was an estimate that was included in \nthis week's Defense Week magazine.\n  This national missile defense is a centerpiece of the President's \nstrategic program. I hardly believe that at the end of the strategic \nreview conducted by the Secretary of Defense--and I commend him for \nthat review--that the Secretary of Defense or the President will \nrecommend that they withdraw their support for national missile defense \nor theater missile defense.\n  We already know the President may urge us to spend as much as $115 \nbillion just on national missile defense, and there is nowhere in this \nbudget over 10 years that these costs are recognized. This is in \naddition to the cost that Senator Landrieu was talking about--quality \nof life for troops and readiness issues.\n  Let us look again at some of these costs we know will be urged upon \nus. We will debate these costs. We will debate these programs. Some may \nbe eliminated. But right now we know there is a multibillion-dollar \ndefense program coming our way, and this budget does not provide for \nit.\n  What this budget does is cut taxes explicitly to the tune of $1.7 \ntrillion, yet ignores defense programs to which the President is \nemotionally, passionately committed. I think that is disingenuous, as I \nsaid before.\n  If you look at national missile defense, we started and are \ndeveloping a land-based system. It is estimated that the cost of 100 \ninterceptors, a very rudimentary system, will be $43 billion. Again, I \ndo not think that number is properly accounted for in this budget going \nforward 10 years. That system is criticized by many, including \nPresident Bush, as being not robust enough; that we have to build a \nsystem that is layered, not just a midcourse interception of enemy \nmissiles coming to the United States by land-based systems, but also we \nhave to have sea-based systems perhaps that will intercept in the boost \nphase and other systems that can intercept in other phases in flight. \nAll of this adds additional cost.\n  If the Administration chooses to go to a sea-based system, the likely \ncandidate is called the Navy theater-wide missile defense system. That \nis one system. That system is just being developed now. Estimates for \nthat system--to buy the ships, deploy the radar, deploy the missiles--\nis about $5.5 billion. Again, we are not talking about this cost.\n\n  If we look at another aspect--the spaced-based laser is the program \nthe Air Force is developing--this system would be designed to be \norbiting in space and also intercept enemy missiles. That is another \nmultibillion-dollar program that is hardly off the drawing board. Yet \nthe administration may choose to pursue this option and the cost is not \naccounted for.\n  That is the realm of national missile defense--about $115 billion and \ncounting. Indeed, every time there is an estimate of costs, the costs \ngo up.\n  This is a revolutionary innovative system that the Defense Department \nis already developing. But none of these costs are provided in this \nbudget.\n  If we look at theater missile defense, we just had good news. The \nPAC-3 missile system has been successfully tested. It is an advanced \ntheater missile defense, but the sobering fact is that the PAC-3 \nmissiles cost has increased more than 100 percent over the last few \nyears, another cost not appropriately factored into the system.\n  There is another Navy lower-tier missile defense system with \nestimates of about $7 billion to develop. Again, it is not recognized \nin this budget.\n  The Army is developing a missile defense called THAAD. Once again, \nthat is struggling forward, being tested, being developed, estimated at \nbillions of dollars.\n  There is the Air Force airborne laser on aircraft, estimated at $6.5 \nbillion in acquisition costs. That, too, is being considered but not \nbudgeted.\n  After we look at these programs, one after the other, and the \nPresident's commitment to have a robust comprehensive national missile \ndefense and theater missile defense, we are talking about hundreds of \nbillions of dollars. It is not in this budget.\n  Just as the President eloquently and passionately called for a tax \ncut, he called for national missile defense. This budget is silent \nabout those costs as it trumpets tax cuts.\n  I do not think that is the way to do a budget. I do not think that is \nfair to our military forces because we know what will happen. These \nprograms will be urged upon us. We will have a choice to borrow money \nbecause there is no money left after the tax cut to fund military \nprograms, or to take money from domestic priorities.\n  I do not think we should put ourselves in that position. We should \nhonestly and fairly put in this budget those costs we know and the \nsignificant costs that are coming regardless of the outcome of this \nstrategic review.\n  We can illustrate, talk about other costs. We have other \nresponsibilities. In the last few weeks, as a member of the Strategic \nSubcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, we have had several \ndifferent commissions report to us. They have already done their \nstudies.\n  Secretary Schlesinger, former Secretary of Defense and former \nSecretary of Energy, reported to us on the status of our nuclear \nsafeguarding procedures and all the laboratories that guard the \nreadiness of our nuclear devices. His estimate is $800 million just for \nmaintenance backlog; $300 million to $500 million per year for ten \nyears for recapitalization--new equipment, new computers--billions of \ndollars a year to clean up nuclear waste sites. We know these costs \nalready. They are not in this budget.\n  The Department of Energy also runs programs to reduce the threat of \nweapons in the former Soviet Union, in Russia. We have been funding \nmultimillion-dollar programs which we have to continue to fund to \nensure our national security.\n  The Strategic Subcommittee has heard the Space Commission's report. \nThe Space Commission was chaired by Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld. This \nSpace Commission has urged significant investments in our space \ncapability. They rightly point out we don't have the situational \nawareness from space to understand what type of missiles might be \nfired, what might be a threat to us, or not a threat to us. They have \nnot put a price tag on it. But again, we are talking about a very \ninnovative, very expensive system, that the Secretary of Defense is \nvery committed to. Another total not reflected in the budget.\n  We just had this week a report about the National Reconnaissance \nOffice\n\n[[Page S3410]]\n\nwhich is responsible for overhead coverage, our satellites, our \nintelligence satellite. They, too, are indicating additional moneys \nmust be spent.\n  These studies have been completed. The verdict is in: We need more \nresources. Yet this budget does not reflect those costs. We are talking \nabout billions and billions of dollars in military programs. One could \ndebate and argue the merit of each, but we know they will be urged upon \nus.\n  We have a budget that ignores the obvious costs in order to fund a \nvery large tax cut. I think we have to be straightforward and honest \nabout this budget. We have to recognize the need for defense. Again, we \nare not prejudging the President; we are taking him at his word that he \nwants to build a national missile defense, that he wants to continue on \nthe work of our nuclear stockpile safeguard program, that he wants us \nto be a leader in space as we have been on the oceans and in the skies \nand on land. And all of this costs money. There is none of this money \nin the budget.\n  I urge the passage of Senator Landrieu's amendment. I also urge as \nfervently that we look carefully at this budget and honestly reserve \nfrom this proposed tax cut the real resources we will be asking for and \nthis administration will be asking for within months of our vote on \nthis budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, on my time, if I could ask my \ndistinguished colleague a question. I pride myself on being among those \nwho are strong supporters of the concept of a limited missile defense. \nI have been on this floor much of the 23 years I have been privileged \nto be in this body arguing for the need for this country to provide for \nits defense against that threat.\n  I listened to the very careful recitation of all the options in the \noutyears. I think some of those options require significant \nmodification of the ABM Treaty. Do I glean from that the Senator could \nbe in favor of modifications to the ABM Treaty, or maybe the abrogation \nof the treaty if we are unsuccessful in modifications?\n  Mr. REED. I respond at this juncture the question is premature since \nthe systems we are testing have not proven effective technologically. I \nwould be reluctant to abrogate a treaty until I knew we had a system \nthat worked with a high degree of confidence. I hope some day we have \nthat choice.\n  Mr. WARNER. I doubt we could proceed to some of the naval systems, \nwhich would require modification. You certainly have to concur in that.\n  Mr. REED. The Senator is likely right about those. As I understand \nthe ABM Treaty, there are restrictions on anything other than a limited \nland-based system.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is a point of reference. I also add the historic act \nadopted by Congress in response to the bill by the distinguished \nSenator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, carefully spells out that we can \nonly proceed as technologically feasible, and that would be the pacing \nitem. I am not so sure we can prejudge here in this limited review that \nwe will spend all this money on missile defense that my colleague \nsuggests. It seems to me we will have to pace ourselves as technically \nfeasible.\n\n  I think to ask this Chamber at this time to accept as a premise that \nall of this money is going to develop in the hundreds-plus of billions \nof dollars at this early date is a little premature.\n  Mr. REED. I don't think the Senator is saying he suspects that the \nPresident is not serious about a missile defense.\n  Mr. WARNER. No, I am not saying that. I am dead serious. But I think \nwe will pace ourselves, and it is a little early to begin to think \nabout the magnitude of the budgets associated with missile defense.\n  I didn't hear my distinguished colleague from Louisiana mention \nmissile defense in the course of her direct testimony unless I missed \nit.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. No, the Senator from Virginia did not hear me, but our \ncolleague did such a beautiful job on missile defense.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, how much time remains on the amendment \non our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 minutes, and there are 9 \nminutes remaining on the other side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have agreed that if Senator Domenici thinks he needs an \nadditional 10 minutes, we will grant that in the interest of fairness.\n  If I might briefly say, I am kind of surprised at what I am hearing \ntonight. I hear from the other side they are fully ready to make a 10-\nyear commitment to a tax cut, but they don't want to make a 10-year \ncommitment to defense. There is not a soul in this body who doesn't \nknow when the President's strategic review is completed they will come \nback and ask for additional money. Does anybody believe they will not \ndo that? When they come back, the cupboard will be bare; the money will \nbe gone.\n  What we are saying with this amendment is, let's put some money in \nthe cupboard so when we are asked to fund defense with additional \ndollars, we have it. That is a responsible thing to do.\n  I commend the Senator from Louisiana. I commend the Senator from \nMissouri. I commend the Senator from Rhode Island. This is responsible \nnational defense policy.\n  I understand the Senator from Connecticut is seeking time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I was hoping the Senator would have commended me, too, \nfor cosponsoring this amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am always glad to commend the Senator from Connecticut, \nand I yield 10 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend and colleague from North Dakota for \nhis thoughtful and persistent and effective leadership on these \nbudgetary matters. I thank the Chair and will see if I can use less \nthan 10 minutes.\n  I rise today to support this amendment offered by the lead sponsor, \nmy friend and colleague on the Armed Services Committee, Senator \nLandrieu of Louisiana, and also cosponsored by Senator Carnahan, a new \nmember of the committee, from Missouri.\n  This is an important amendment. The Senator from North Dakota spoke \nsome words that struck me as I listened to my chairman from Virginia \nabout going ahead with this for 1 year but not for the 10 years. Of \ncourse, the powerful reality is, we are arguing about priorities and \nfiscal responsibility.\n  The concern of so many Members is we are committing to this enormous \ntax plan from the President which, by the Concord Coalition estimate, \nwill cost $2.3 trillion over the next 10 years, threatening to take us \nback--not just threatening but likely to take us back--into deficit, \nhigher interest rates, higher unemployment and we are prepared to \nconsider on a 10-year basis. When it comes to the needs of our \nmilitary, we are only prepared to allot the appropriate amount of money \nfor 1 year.\n  I think what is appropriate on the revenue side is appropriate on the \nspending side. What is most appropriate is fiscal responsibility. What \nthis amendment by Senator Landrieu puts at issue is what this debate on \nthe budget resolution is all about, which is priorities. I suppose it \nis not only about that. The other part is fiscal responsibility.\n  We say it over and over again, and it is true, when it comes to the \nhealth of our economy, most of it happens in the private sector. \nGovernment doesn't create jobs. The private sector does. But there are \na few things that Government can do to create the environment for jobs \nand give some incentives for jobs and economic growth. The first and \nmost important is to remain fiscally responsible. The second is to make \nthe kinds of investments that help the private sector \ngrow. Incidentally, one of those is to support research and development \nthrough the Defense Department, which has traditionally, in our \ncountry, led to enormous economic growth.\n\n  So this is about fiscal responsibility. But then this amendment \nreally is about priorities. You cannot have it all. You cannot have it \nall and be fiscally responsible. If you go for the Concord Coalition \nestimate of $2.3 trillion on the Bush tax plan, then you are making it \nimpossible to do a lot of other things that we must do and that the \npeople want us to do.\n  Of course, one of the most fundamental responsibilities that \nGovernment has is to provide for the common defense of our Nation. That \ndoes not come cheaply. There is no free lunch when it comes to national \nsecurity.\n\n[[Page S3411]]\n\n  Others have said, and I need not belabor the fact, that in the last \ncampaign then-Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney were very critical of \nour allocation of resources for the military and assured the military, \nparticularly personnel, that help was on the way. Here we are in April \nof 2001. President Bush sends his budget to us, at least in general \nterms. I think we have to conclude that help may be on the way, but \nwhen it comes to our defense budget, the check must have been lost in \nthe mail because we are not meeting the needs all of us know are there.\n  This amendment, introduced by the two Senators, one from Louisiana, \nthe other from Missouri, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor, would \nright that wrong. It takes $100 billion from money that would be spent \non the tax cut and allocates it, $10 billion a year, to our national \nsecurity. It also does what folks at the Pentagon will tell you they \ndesperately need, which is to allow for an emergency defense \nsupplemental of $7.1 billion this year. That would make up for the $1.4 \nbillion deficit now in the defense health program and provide immediate \nassistance for the real serious near-term readiness and personnel needs \nthat have resulted from the military reductions and operating tempo \nincreases we have seen since the end of the cold war.\n  There are real and present needs now that this amendment would meet. \nI know there has been reference to the strategic review being done in \nthe Defense Department. I support that review. I am very encouraged by \nthe instructions that Secretary Rumsfeld has given to those who are \nworking on the review. We need to transform our military. We need to \nuse the technology that is available around the world today to make \nsure that we are ready for the threats that will come in the future and \nthat we are not just prepared to fight the last war, or wars of the \npast.\n  But two things about that strategic review: One is that everyone \nknows there are needs now and there will be needs next year and the \nyear after and for the coming decade that deal with shortfalls--\ncertainly in the near term--shortfalls that are basic, in items as \nbasic to the military as ammunition, flying hours, housing, quality of \nlife for our military personnel as documented by my colleagues who have \nalready spoken, force protection, and aircraft and ship maintenance, \nincluding, incidentally, repairs to the U.S.S. Cole. There are \nimmediate needs now, regardless of what the strategic review brings.\n  Second, as my colleagues have said already, and I will say it, \ntherefore, briefly, no one should be under the illusion that whatever \nthe strategic review brings will it say that we can maintain our \nnational defense by spending less money. We are working through our \ncommittee on a bipartisan basis to push the Pentagon to be as efficient \nas possible. Some members of the committee have come out again with a \ncall for another round of the BRAC, of the base realignment and closure \noperation, to avoid wasteful spending. But there has never been a \nstrategic review--never been an historic transformation such as we are \ngoing through in our military today, attempting to apply the lessons \nand the products of information technology and high technology to our \nmilitary--that has cost less. So this is a very measured and moderate \namendment.\n\n  The fact is, I would wager, my colleagues, that if we had the ability \nto take ourselves 10 years forward and look back, assuming that we in \nour time and those who follow us are responsible, which I hope and \ntrust they will be, we will, in fact, spend much more than the extra \n$100 billion that Senator Landrieu's amendment allocates to the \nmilitary because we will feel it is necessary.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? I \nwill ask him on my time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes, indeed. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Did I understand the Senator to say his interpretation of \nthe amendment is that it covers the fiscal year 2001 for the \nsupplemental? I bring to the attention of the Senator the amendment. I \ndo not find that provision in it.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Responding to the Senator from Virginia, noting a very \ndefinitive but subtle shake of the head by the Senator from Louisiana, \nI therefore reached the conclusion that what I thought was the original \nintention of the amendment, which was to include an emergency \nsupplemental for the defense, is not true?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for a clarification?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I yield to my colleague from Louisiana.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I may continue the colloquy--but go right ahead.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Which makes it even more important we adopt the \nLandrieu-Carnahan amendment because at least there will be some money \nin the bank to pay some bills we know are coming due, in addition to \nthe real and urgent needs that the supplemental represents. So I thank \nmy colleague for raising that issue. This amendment does not cover it, \nbut if there was a way for it to, we most certainly should because that \nis an additional obligation that we should meet.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I recognize this Senator was one of the \nfirst to say there is a need for a supplemental, even at the time when \nmy respected President wasn't totally in agreement with what I was \nsaying, but now there is thinking within the department that this \nsupplemental will be necessary and will be forthcoming. But I don't \nwant anybody coming tonight thinking that supporting the Landrieu \namendment is going to provide for the 2001 shortfalls which this \nChamber will have to address at some point in time when the \nAppropriations Committee brings to the floor a supplemental.\n  I think my good friend slightly misspoke. I wanted to correct it in a \nvery polite way. If I could move on to the second part of my question--\n--\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. If I might respond, on my time, I thank the Senator \nfrom Virginia, my respected chairman of the committee. I am encouraged. \nI know the military was very hopeful, as this administration began, \nthat they would have the opportunity to receive a supplemental \nappropriation. I commend the Senator from Virginia. As I recall, on \nFebruary 7 he sent a letter, along with 8 colleagues, to the President, \nstating that there are bills ``which must be paid now. If money is not \nprovided in these areas there could be a significant negative impact on \nreadiness for this fiscal year and beyond.''\n\n  So as Senator Landrieu says, this amendment would take care of the \n``beyond.'' I hope you and I and Senator Landrieu and others can stand \non this floor in this fiscal year and support a supplemental for the \nPentagon.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let us proceed on the second part of my \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 10 minutes of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. I want to ask my questions on my time. Perhaps he could \njust be given another minute or so to respond to the question. Is that \nagreeable? On his time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is up to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on this \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask the time be charged to the Senator raising the \nquestion. We have additional time that we can grant to the Senator from \nNew Mexico for that purpose.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Are you asking the question?\n  Mr. WARNER. I am going to ask my colleague from Connecticut another \nquestion which I thought I would ask on my time but he can respond on \nhis time. It would take him less than a minute, I am sure. He has it \nright on his fingertips.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The problem is we do not have the additional time on this \nside.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will yield my colleague a half a \nminute--a minute on my time to answer the following question.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator from Virginia is showing his normal \ngenerosity.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me address again the letter to the budget chairman, \nranking member, from Senator Levin, which is written in very clear, \nplain language:\n\n       In the near term, I believe there are some urgent needs for \n     which a Fiscal Year 2001 [as we have discussed] supplemental \n     is appropriate, including the shortfalls that experts . . . \n     have identified in the defense . . .\n\n\n[[Page S3412]]\n\n\n  We got that.\n\n       With respect to Fiscal Year[s] 2002 [which we are talking \n     about] . . . I agree with the Secretary of Defense that it is \n     prudent for him to conclude his strategy review and present \n     it to the President and the Congress for our consideration \n     before [Senator] we make final decisions [which this \n     amendment asks] on the shape and overall funding levels for \n     our future defense program.\n\n  Do you agree with him?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Very briefly, I do. Of course, Senator Levin's hope, \nand the rest of us, many on the committee, was that the defense \nsupplemental would come to us before the budget resolution. But here we \nare on the budget resolution now, needing to make judgments about next \nyear and years after. That is the purpose of this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the language is clear. I simply ask: Do \nyou agree or disagree with his statement again, that we should receive \nthe results of these studies ``before we, the Congress, make final \ndecisions on the shape and overall funding levels for our future \ndefense program?'' Our time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Very briefly, I say, I think my distinguished \ncolleague from Virginia is misapplying what Senator Levin was saying.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have read it.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Which is, he wanted an immediate defense supplemental. \nBut here we are on the budget resolution, so our responsibility is to \ngo forward. I will read one sentence. He says very clearly in another \nsentence:\n\n       However, I believe there are certain requirements that must \n     be addressed regardless of the outcome of the ongoing \n     strategy review.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. The letter is in the Record. I cannot take more of our \ntime.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from Virginia and the Chair. I \nyield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I believe I have 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 6\\1/2\\ minutes under the control of \nthe Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time remains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Six minutes on the Republican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And we have 6 minutes on our side. I should remind the \nSenator from Louisiana that I indicated we would be willing to provide \nanother 10 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico in fairness.\n  Would the Senator from New Mexico like that time at this point?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. I think to allocate it would be splendid. I may \nnot use it all. I may give some of it back.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think in fairness we should do that. And I so move that \nwe provide an additional 10 minutes to the Republican side so that it \nis a fair distribution of time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, thank you.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have now from the amendment and \nthe 10 minutes added?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am sure the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner, would desire to speak with some additional time, \nand I am sure I will not use all of it.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is all right. Go ahead.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, let me say, it is important we put into \nperspective, for those who are concerned about defense, what the Warner \namendment will do for defense this year. This amendment sets a new \nlevel for national defense spending for the year 2002. It adds $22.4 \nbillion in budget authority over the 2001 budget. That is a 7.2-percent \nincrease. Compared to the President's budget, this proposal adds $8.5 \nbillion in 2002. The proposal is also a $23.5 billion increase for \nnational defense over what President Clinton sought for the year 2002.\n  So I believe those who are concerned about what we ought to spend in \nthe year 2002 should be rather comfortable that when you have this, \nplus what is in the President's budget, you have a very substantial \nincrease for the year 2002.\n  I want to make a few assumptions that I don't need anybody to concur \non, but I want to make sure the Record reflects what I assume.\n  First, this amendment assumes all the increases in President Bush's \nplans for pay raises for military personnel--I do not believe there is \nany disagreement over that--for retention, for housing, for TRICARE, \nand research and development.\n  I would also assume that it includes $3.1 billion more for the \nDefense Health Program. I am not asking does the distinguished Senator \nagree, but I am suggesting those who support that program expect $3.1 \nbillion out of that $23.5 billion we are speaking of which is added for \ndefense this year. In addition, it will restore the TRICARE costs and \nall direct care in military treatment facilities.\n  That is going to be tough. But remember, we voted for it. We voted \nfor it. Now we cannot say we are not going to fund it.\n  The Defense Health Program has been experiencing annual shortfalls, \nand this has been occurring recently because the budget requests--I am \nnot speaking of this budget but the budget requests from the \nadministration--have underestimated inflationary costs for health care \neach and every year when they send the allowance up here for health \ncare programs.\n  This year Defense Health Program officials have been instructed to \nuse an inflation rate of 4.2, I say to my friend. But this year the \nHealth Care Financing Administration estimates that inflation will be 7 \npercent, I say to all those interested in our defense. And that can be \ncovered if we are careful in terms of what we use this increase for.\n  There is going to be a shortfall in the Defense Health Program, and \nwe all know that. I think it is a matter of making sure, with the give-\nand-take with the administration, we do right by it. Yes, it is a $3.1 \nbillion shortfall. That means we underestimated what they need.\n  The Surgeons General of the military services have told Congress that \nthey will have to furlough healthcare personnel, close pharmacies, and \nrefuse service at military treatment facilities if additional funding \nis not found for 2001 very soon. If we do not fully fund the program \nfor 2002, we will have the same problem again next year. This is not \nacceptable. Does any Senator know of a worse way to address moral and \nretention?\n  There is another important element of this amendment. It also \nrestores cuts in the defense activities of the Department of Energy. \nThe proposal fully funds DOE's Stockpile Stewardship Program and its \nnonproliferation activities. It adds $800 million for the Stockpile \nStewardship Program and $100 million for nonproliferation.\n  Frankly, I do not expect my friend to agree this money is going to be \nused for that. But I want everybody to know I am going to work hard so \nit will be. Because one of the things that the defense establishment \nforgets about every year is that they have a little buddy over there \ncalled ``nuclear weapons,'' you see. They pay for all the rest of \ndefense when they start allocating, but when they start having to give \nup defense money to the Department of Energy to do stockpile \nstewardship, which I say to my friend from Virginia is a fancy name for \nmaking sure we maintain healthy nuclear weapons--the totality of it to \nbe safe and ready--they do not put enough money in it because it seems \nthat it is not defense money.\n  But I am here to tell you, we are not going to be doing that in the \nfuture because this Senator is going to be here saying the nuclear \narsenal is part of the defense of our Nation. It is underfunded. Its \nbuildings are falling down.\n  I say to my good friend, while you never get to appropriate for it, \nyou take a trip up there to the State where they have this Y-12 in the \nState of Tennessee.\n  Do you know what is happening up there, Mr. Chairman? There is a \ngreat big building that is part of the work being done on three of our \nnuclear weapons. And the roof is falling in on top of the heads of the \nworkers. They all wear hardhats, even though it is not a hardhat \nenvironment. So we have to start by building that building, you see. \nAnd then there are a lot of others. We are asking, and so is the \ngeneral in charge of nuclear weapons asking, that we fund that.\n  I am willing to add some more money later if somebody wants to argue \nabout it, but I just want to make sure everybody knows I am voting for \nadditional\n\n[[Page S3413]]\n\nmoney because I do not think the President funded adequately what I am \ntelling you about. I do not think his budget funds them adequately.\n  They are going to get funded adequately this year because the Senate \nis going to understand the precarious nature of not doing it. It might \nbe one of the few times the Senator from New Mexico would ask for a \nclosed session, which I have never done on an issue. But I am very \nworried about the condition of the science-based stockpile stewardship.\n  Let me close. If any of you do not understand that, it just means we \nare no longer doing underground testing, I say to my friends. We are no \nlonger doing that because it is the policy of America.\n  Underground testing was how we proved the efficacy of nuclear \nweapons--their health, their effectiveness, their wellness. Now we do \nnot do that anymore. So how in the world would you think we would be \nsure that some of our 20-, 30-, and 35-year-old weapons are safe and \nhave a well-being about them? We start a science program. We are going \nto do it through science without underground testing.\n  That isn't something you get on the cheap. That is one of the most \nexpensive science programs ever invented by man, to prove, without \ntesting, that a nuclear weapons arsenal is safe. And it is very \nimportant for America.\n  So I am voting for the Senator's amendment tonight because I think we \nneed to add some money to defense this year. I do not think we have to \ndream about missile systems. I think we have to take care of and create \na robust, high-morale establishment that maintains and perfects our \nnuclear weapons.\n  I never get a chance to tell Senators about this. That is why I asked \nthem to give me 10 minutes because I didn't want to take it away from \nyou. I can't find a better time to discuss it than here tonight when we \nspeak of this very large add-on to the Defense Department. I hope I \nwasn't too technical. I hope everybody understands a little better what \nthe nuclear weapons issue is all about.\n  I reserve whatever time we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand that I have approximately 5 \nor 6 minutes to close this argument.\n  First, I thank the Senators from Rhode Island, Connecticut, and \nMissouri for lending their voice to this important amendment and to \nthis important debate. I also acknowledge the great respect I have for \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, who \nhas just spoken passionately about an issue he has spent a great deal \nof time and energy working on for many years. He has called us to task \nmany times to try to deal with an issue that is sometimes technical and \ndifficult to explain but nonetheless an obligation this Nation has to \nprotect our children and our grandchildren.\n  He was speaking so beautifully in the 10 minutes given to him, it \ncould have been allocated to our time, because he made so many of the \narguments more eloquently than I can about the fact that this \nunderlying budget does not have enough money or resources to do the \nthings we know we need to do now. He has really helped make the \nargument of why the Landrieu-Carnahan amendment is so important.\n  Point No. 2, regarding the costs mentioned by our distinguished \nchairman for nuclear stockpile stewardship, for the health care \nshortfall, for TRICARE, for housing, I ask this question: Do these \nrequirements cease after the year 2002? Do these expenses not continue \nto recur? It defies logic that we could provide for this funding for 1 \nyear and then simply turn our backs and walk away. That is why a 1-year \namendment, although it is helpful and I could probably vote for it \nbecause it is better than nothing, certainly falls short, terribly \nshort, of what we need to do to make a long-term, 10-year commitment to \nthe basics.\n  The third point: With all due respect to Senator Warner, whom I \nadmire so much, the distinguished Senator from Virginia submitted this \nletter, dated March 19, to Senator Domenici and Senator Conrad signed \nby Senator Levin. He read the first two paragraphs. The most important \nparagraph is the fourth paragraph, which goes on to say, after saying \nwe should consider the study:\n\n       However, I believe there are certain requirements that must \n     be addressed regardless of the outcome of the ongoing \n     strategic review. Some increases above the projections \n     contained in the President's budget outline of February 28 \n     will be needed to continue the transformation of our military \n     to meet the threats of the new century, to fulfill the \n     commitments the Congress has made to improve quality health \n     care to active and retired military families, and to continue \n     the progress we have made in recent years to improve \n     compensation, housing and other quality of life programs for \n     our military families.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I also recommend that the Budget Resolution provide a \n     sufficient mandatory spending allocation for the Committee. . \n     . .\n\n  Point No. 4. Please be clear. Our amendment does not try to prejudge \nthe President. We are trying to prepare to implement the strategic \nstudy. We are not standing in the way of the study. We are laying the \ngroundwork that we can walk on, that we can fight on, that we can \ndefend. This is about laying down a priority in our budget for the next \n10 years. Are we going to say yes to defense or no? Are we going to \nlive up to our promises or turn our backs again? Are we going to \nprovide help or say, as the Senator from Connecticut said, the check \nmust have been lost in the mail?\n  I know the Senators from Virginia and New Mexico too well to think \nthey would walk away from obligations we have already made. I know that \nis not their intention. So let us do what is right. Let us choose the \nright priority, take the right step, be fiscally responsible. We know \nthis bill is coming due. The question is, Is there going to be any \nmoney in the bank to pay it? If we don't vote for my amendment, the \nbank will be empty. There is nothing you can tell them. We are sorry; \nwe spent the money.\n  I am not going to do that. Because I am on the committee, because I \nlive in the State of Louisiana, I know how important this is. I know we \nare not asking for too much: $10 billion a year for 10 years. It is a \nminimal requirement to lay the groundwork for this study.\n  I ask the Senate to take this amendment seriously. This is a very \nimportant vote. We need to say yes. We can say yes to next year, with \nSenator Warner at $8.5 billion, and we can say yes the next year \nbecause the need for health care doesn't stop. People aren't going to \nmove out of their homes on the bases. We are not going to end the \ndistribution of spare parts. We are not going to run out of the need \nfor ammunition. We need it in 2003 and 2004.\n  I say to the Senate, let us live up to our promises, let us make the \nright decisions, and let's vote for the Landrieu-Carnahan amendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \nchairman, Senator Warner, in cosponsoring this amendment to increase \nthe budget for defense by $8.5 billion in fiscal year 2002. This \namendment would help address current readiness shortfalls that the \nDepartment of Defense faces today, even as the new administration \ncontinues its strategic review.\n  I am hopeful that this strategic review will not only examine these \ncurrent readiness challenges, but also take a hard look at the current \nshipbuilding rate and our shrinking industrial base. The numbers are \nastonishing: the U.S. Navy has shrunk from a fleet of 594 ships in 1987 \nto 315 ships today, while, during the same period, deployments have \nincreased more than 300 percent. Regional Commanders-in-Chief have \nrepeatedly warned that the fleet is stretched perilously thin and needs \nto be increased to 360-ships to meet present mission requirements.\n  Numbers do matter; on a typical day about half the ships in the Navy \nare at sea, with one-third deployed in the Mediterranean, the Persian \nGulf, and the Western Pacific, putting wear and tear on our ships and \nsailors. In addition to combat over the last 10 years, naval forces \nhave conducted 19 non-combat evacuation operations, 4 maritime \nintercept operations with more than 5,000 boardings in support of \nUnited Nations sanctions or U.S. drug policy, 32 humanitarian \nassistance operations, and 20 shows of force to send powerful messages \nto friends and foes alike.\n  Even though our deployments are at an exceptionally high rate, the \nU.S. shipbuilding industry is at risk of deteriorating if the current \ninadequate build rate for the Navy continues. At the current low rate \nof production, the\n\n[[Page S3414]]\n\ncost for per ship will go up and the efficiency at the yard will go \ndown.\n  The new administration and this Congress will be faced with the \nchallenge of rebuilding and re-capitalizing the Nation's naval fleet. \nThe numbers are just as clear as can be: At the present rate of \ninvestment our Navy is heading toward a 220-ship fleet, which is \nalarmingly inadequate.\n  A few other critical areas that have seemed to get little attention \nin a budget constrained environment are research and development and \ntraining. Steps need to be taken today to attract and retain a highly-\nskilled workforce necessary to build the complex warships required for \nour U.S. naval ships to operate against the emerging and traditional \nthreats in the 21st century. Regardless of the result of the strategic \nreview, forward deployed combat power will not only be required, but \nwill continue to be a key element to our strategic posture.\n  I am standing here before you to support Senator Warner's amendment \nand to highlight that the readiness issues facing our Nation's defense \nare only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the defense challenges \nfacing the new administration and this Congress. Today's shipbuilding \naccount is woefully under-funded and does not provide the financial \nsupport necessary to maintain a viable industrial base. We, as the \nlegislative body, need to take aggressive steps to ensure that our \narmed forces are equipped with the most capable and advanced ships in \nthe world to defend our Nation's interests.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I intend to vote for the amendment by \nSenators Landrieu, Carnahan, Conrad, Lieberman, Reed and Levin because \nI believe that providing for a strong national defense is our most \nserious obligation.\n  Two years ago, President Clinton sent a letter to Secretary of \nDefense Bill Cohen that stated: ``Although we have done much to support \nreadiness, more needs to be done.'' President Clinton made this \nstatement in response to a briefing he had attended with Secretary \nCohen, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Commanders-in-Chief of the \nmilitary combat commands.\n  I applauded President Clinton then for his reversal of 6 previous \nyears of vastly underfunded defense budgets and for the reversal of the \nService Chiefs in 1998, who confirmed many of the alarming readiness \nproblems that had been identified in countless sources.\n  The imperative for increasing military readiness and reforming our \nmilitary is as strong today, as it was two years ago. Anyone who \ndismisses our serious readiness problems, our concerns with morale and \npersonnel retention, and our deficiencies in everything from spare \nparts to training is either willfully uniformed or untruthful.\n  What concerns me the most is that the highly skilled service men and \nwomen who have made our military the best fighting force the world has \never seen are leaving in droves, unlikely to be replaced in the near \nfuture. Their reason is obvious; they are overworked, underpaid, and \naway from home more and more often. Failure to fully and quickly \naddress this facet of our readiness problem will be more damaging to \nboth the near and long-term health of our all-volunteer force than we \ncan imagine.\n  The cure for our defense decline will neither be quick nor cheap. The \nproper solution should not only shore up the Services' immediate needs, \nbut should also address the modernization and personnel problems caused \nby years of chronic under funding. The solution will be found by using \na comprehensive approach in which the President, civilian and uniformed \nmilitary leadership, as well as Congress, will be required to make \ntough choices and even tougher commitments.\n  I further hope that we do not fall into the trap of comparing defense \nexpenditures of the U.S. versus potential threat countries, because \ndollar to dollar comparisons are meaningless. Only the U.S. has the \nglobal responsibilities that come with being the lone superpower. Our \nfoes can employ asymmetric forces against our weaknesses and achieve a \ndisproportionate level of success.\n  I was concerned that recently, the USS Kitty Hawk battle group, \nstationed in Japan, reported less-than-favorable readiness numbers, \nshort some 1,000 sailors, at the same time that tensions have increased \nin the South China Sea.\n  I hope we do not focus solely on the readiness of front-line forces, \nbecause the Army divisions that have good readiness numbers are being \nsupported by units that have less-impressive ratings. We need a \ncomprehensive remedy, not a shotgun approach. These support forces, \nsome of them reserve component forces, have become the backbone of our \nfighting forces and need the most attention.\n  This degradation of the ``tail'' that trains and supports the \n``teeth'' of the U.S. military must be reversed. We have the world's \nfinest military, but that is principally because the people in the \nmilitary, primarily the young enlisted, our NCOs, petty officers, \nchiefs, Gunnies, and sergeants, continue to do more with less. Our \nability to field credible front-line forces is due to the efforts of \nour service members, as we live off of the deteriorating remnants of \nthe Reagan buildup. That is difficult to admit, until you review the \nlist of aircraft, ships, artillery, and tanks in our current weapons \ninventory.\n  The administration must take several steps: propose realistic budget \nrequests; specifically budget for ongoing contingency operations; \nprovide adequately for modernization; ensure equipment maintenance is \nadequately funded; resolve the wide pay and benefits disparity that \nprecludes the Services from competing successfully for volunteers with \nthe private sector; and demonstrate strong support for additional base \nclosure rounds.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as the Senate debates President Bush's \nfirst budget proposal, I want to join my colleagues in congratulating \nthe President on his commitment to revitalize our Nation's economy and \nnational security. The President's budget proposal is fiscally \nresponsible and represents a prudent first step as he organizes his \nadministration and focuses on the issues facing both the Nation and the \nWorld. I especially want to recognize the President's challenge to \nSecretary of Defense Rumsfeld to conduct a strategic review of our \nnational security requirements. This review is long overdue and I \nanticipate it will bring about significant changes to our national \nsecurity strategy and our military services.\n  I have been privileged to be a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee since 1959. During this period I have been a witness to both \nthe greatness and tragedy of military service. After the tragic \nconflict in Vietnam, we saw a sharp decline in the readiness and morale \nof our armed forces. The Reagan era brought about a revitalization in \nour armed forces that culminated in the end of the Cold War and the \ngreat victory in the desert of Iraq. Now again, our military is showing \nits age and neglect. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines are \nstill the best, but the equipment and facilities are wearing out \nbecause of under funding and overuse.\n  In a recent interview on the state of our Armed Forces, the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton, stated: ``If we go back \n15 to 16 years, America was spending roughly 6.5 percent of our gross \ndomestic product on defense. Today we spend right at 3 percent. Put \nanother way, if we were spending the same percent of our national \nwealth, our GDP, on the armed forces today that we were spending in \n1985, the defense budget would be double what it is today. The Army in \n1989 had 18 divisions. Today it's down to 10. The Air Force had 36 \nfighter wings. Today it has 20. The Navy had just short of 600 ships. \nToday it's got just over 300 ships. We have taken 700,000 out of the \nactive force. That is greater than the armed forces of the UK, Germany, \nthe Danes and the Dutch put together. So we have restructured, and we \nhave downsized. As an example, our Army is right now the seventh-\nlargest in the world.''\n  General Shelton's comments show that we have adjusted to the new \nworld, although in my judgement we have gone too far both in terms of \nforce structure and funding. I am especially concerned over the \nshortfall in funding over the past ten years. We have frequently heard \nabout the aging equipment and lack of spare parts. I would like to \nfocus on our aging military facilities. According to the GAO, in 1992 \nthe military had accumulated an estimated $8.9 billion in deferred \nfacility\n\n[[Page S3415]]\n\nmaintenance. By 1998, that had grown to $14.6 billion. The backlog now \nexceeds $16 billion and it is still growing. If we do not reverse this \ntrend, our military installations will continue to deteriorate and \nquality of life and readiness will continue to decline.\n  President Bush has proposed a $14.2 billion increase over last year's \ndefense budget. Although this is significant, it will not provide the \nnecessary resources to fix the immediate readiness shortfall identified \nto the Armed Services Committee by the military services. Chairman \nWarner's amendment to increase the defense budget by another $8.5 \nbillion is a modest increase to fund critical manpower and readiness \nissues. In my judgement, it is a down payment to the increase that the \nPresident will seek after Secretary Rumsfeld completes his strategic \nreview. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and prove our \nsupport to the men and women who wear the uniforms of our military \nservices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished colleague, when \nI addressed the letter from Senator Levin, I put it in its entirety \ninto the record. I didn't in any way try to deceive the Senate as to \nhis feelings about a different approach than my distinguished colleague \nfrom Louisiana, his approach being that we should begin to plan for the \noutyears, but it wasn't sort of a mandatory $10 billion for the \noutyears. It was more in the nature of some sort of a reserve fund.\n  The key to it is, who is going to run defense? The Constitution of \nthe United States says very clearly that the President is the Commander \nin Chief. It is the function of the executive branch to make the \ndetermination with regard to the needs and the requirements of our \nArmed Forces. As Senator Levin said very explicitly, he supports the \nreviews, and he says in absolutely clear language: And Congress, before \nwe make our final decisions on the shape and overall funding levels for \nour future, let's hear from the President.\n  That is consistent with the Constitution. That is the way we have \ndone business. I think that is the way we should continue to do \nbusiness. It may well be in the year 2003 we need additional funding \nover and above the 10, but the subsequent fiscal years may require less \nfunding.\n  I say with all due respect to my colleague, let us follow the \nconstitutional mandate: The Commander in Chief, the President, \nproposes; Congress disposes. Someone far brighter than I in the history \nof this venerable institution, the Congress of the United States, made \nthat statement. And it has been with us for these years.\n  Let our President propose, as he is entrusted to do under the \nConstitution, and then each year we will go through the normal cycles \nthat we do year after year.\n  What is here is a means by which to reduce the President's tax bill. \nI respect the difference of opinion on this side of the aisle where I \nfind myself very comfortably ensconced for the remainder of this \ndebate. We should respect your views. But if you are going to do it, \nlet's knock out all the business about defense and say you want to \nknock down the tax bill by $100 billion, and put the issue straight \nbefore the Senate. But as it relates to defense, I don't think we want \nto start a radical departure. I have been associated with defense for a \nnumber of years, starting in the Navy Secretariat in 1969, and now 23 \nyears here. I have never seen the Congress allocate specific sums of \nincreases without the budget request from the President of the United \nStates, which has to be justified. You are speculating--and it may be \ncorrect--that we will need increases for one or more fiscal years. But \nI don't think it is our responsibility now to subvert the Constitution, \nwhich says the President is the Commander in Chief. The President will \npropose and, in due course, the Congress will dispose.\n\n  With all due respect to my colleague, I certainly support the basic \nthrust of 2002. Our bills parallel in many respects. Mine takes care of \n2002, lets the President finish his studies, and lets Congress analyze \nthem and then makes the decision.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. My colleague from Virginia knows how much I respect him \nfor his leadership on this subject and how difficult I know this debate \nis for him because he has been a champion of defense spending and \nstrengthening our defenses and actually appropriating money in very \nwise ways, as we say about boosting the morale.\n  But I have to go back to this letter. I most certainly know we have \nboth turned it in for the Record. I think it is important because \nSenator Levin is on his way to this debate--since this letter is \nwritten by him--to make sure the Members understand the context of this \nletter. If it is read in its entirety, which I tried to do--not just \nreading the paragraph to which you referred but the next paragraph--it \nis clear that Senator Levin says that, while we do need to support the \nstudy, we must set aside now the resources necessary to fund the \noutcome of the study.\n  I know the Senator from Virginia is familiar with the Congressional \nBudget Office study. I know he is familiar with ``Defending America, \nThe Plan to Meet Our Missile Defense''--the numerous studies that have \nbeen done. Not one study indicates that we will be spending less money, \nbut all suggest that we will be spending more, but differently.\n  So again, I will conclude because I think my time is up. We are going \nto have a bill coming due. The question is, Is there money in the bank \nto pay it? Please vote for the Landrieu-Carnahan amendment so we have \nmoney to pay these bills when they come due and live up to our promises \nto our men and women in uniform. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I simply say to my colleague, we have had \na good debate. We have framed the issue very clearly. My posture is we \nshould proceed to let the Commander in Chief conduct his studies. There \nis nothing in this debate to refute Mr. Levin. He said, ``. . .before \nwe make final decisions on the shape and overall funding levels for our \nfuture defense programs,'' we should have those studies. I am saying \nthat we are encroaching on what my distinguished ranking member said in \nclear English language. I say that with respect to the Senator.

The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with several of my \ncolleagues, including Senators Bond, Hutchinson, Mikulski, Ensign, \nSnowe, Cochran, Gordon Smith, and Santorum, in introducing this \namendment to eliminate the automatic 15-percent reduction in Medicare \npayments to home health agencies now scheduled to take effect on \nOctober 1 of next year.\n  Our amendment will create a reserve fund of $13.7 billion that can be \nused solely to eliminate the 15-percent reduction in payments to home \nhealth agencies now scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 2002. Our \namendment contains a safety mechanism that protects the Medicare HI \ntrust fund for each year covered by the budget resolution. In other \nwords--I want this to be clear--the Medicare trust fund will not be \nused to pay for the elimination of the scheduled reduction in home \nhealth payments.\n  Health care has gone full circle. Patients are spending less time in \nthe hospital, more and more procedures are being done on an outpatient \nbasis, and recovery and care for patients with chronic diseases and \nconditions have increasingly been taking place in the home. Moreover, \nthe number of older Americans who are chronically ill or disabled in \nsome way continues to grow with each passing year as our population \ngrows older.\n  As a consequence, home health care has become an increasingly \nimportant part of our health care system. The kinds of highly skilled \nand often technically complex services that our Nation's home health \nnurses provide have enabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable \nelderly individuals to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just \nwhere they want to be--in the comfort, security, and privacy of their \nown homes.\n  The rapid growth in home health spending, from 1990 to 1997, \nunderstandably prompted the Congress and the Clinton administration, as \npart of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, to initiate changes that were \nintended to slow the growth in spending and make this important program \nmore cost effective and efficient. Unfortunately, these measures have \nproduced cuts in home health spending far beyond what Congress ever \nintended.\n  According to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, home \nhealth spending dropped to $9.2 billion in the year 2000, just about \nhalf the amount we were spending in 1997. This is at a time when demand \nand the need for home health services have only increased. On the \nhorizon and very troubling is an additional 15-percent cut that would \nput our already struggling home health agencies at risk and would \nseriously jeopardize access to critical home health services for \nmillions of our Nation's seniors.\n  The Medicare home health benefit has already been cut far more deeply \nand abruptly than any other benefit in the history of the Medicare \nprogram. It is now abundantly clear that the savings goals set for home \nhealth in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have not only been met but \nfar surpassed. The most recent CBO projections show that the post-\nBalanced Budget Act reductions in home health services will amount to \nabout $69 billion between fiscal years 1998 and 2002. This is more than \nfour times the $16 billion that the CBO originally estimated for that \ntime period and is a clear indication that the Medicare home health \ncutbacks have been far too deep.\n  Moreover, the financial problems home health agencies have been \nexperiencing have been exacerbated by a host of ill-conceived \nregulatory requirements imposed by the Clinton administration. As a \nconsequence of these burdensome and costly regulations, as well as the \nreductions in reimbursements, approximately 3,300 home health agencies \nhave either closed their doors or stopped serving Medicare patients.\n\n  Moreover, the Health Care Financing Administration estimates that \n900,000 fewer home health patients received services in 1999 than in \n1997. That is 900,000 frail, elderly, ill individuals who have lost \ntheir access to home health services.\n  This startling statistic points to the central and most critical \nissue: Cuts of this magnitude simply cannot be sustained without \nultimately harming patient care.\n  The impact of these cutbacks has been particularly devastating in my \nhome State of Maine. The number of Medicare home health patients in \nMaine dropped by 23 percent in just 2 years' time. That translates into \nmore than 11,000 home health patients no longer receiving services. \nThere was also a 40-percent drop in the number of home health visits in \nMaine and a 31-percent cut in Medicare payments to home health agencies \nin the State.\n  Keep in mind, Maine's home health agencies were already very prudent \nin their use of resources. They were low-cost agencies in the \nbeginning. They simply had no cushion to absorb this cut. Indeed, these \ncutbacks cut to the bone and are harming care in the State of Maine.\n  Last year I had the opportunity to meet and visit with a number of \nhome health patients and nurses throughout my State. I heard \nheartbreaking stories about the impact of Medicare cutbacks and how \nregulatory restrictions have affected both the quality and the \navailability of home health care services, jeopardizing the health and \nwell-being of numerous senior citizens. For example, a nurse told me of \nthe tragic story of one of her patients, an elderly Maine woman who \nsuffered from advanced Alzheimer's disease, pneumonia, and \nhypertension, among other illnesses. This patient was bedbound, \nverbally nonresponsive, and had a series of other troubling health \nproblems, including infections and weight loss. This woman had been \nreceiving home health services for approximately 2 years. During that \ntime, due to the care of the skilled and compassionate home health \nnurse, her condition had stabilized.\n  Unfortunately, the care provided to this patient had to end when the \nhome health agency received a Federal notice indicating that this poor \nwoman no longer qualified for home health care.\n  Mr. President, less than 3 months later this woman died as a result \nof a wound from an untreated infection in her foot. One cannot help but \nspeculate that this tragedy might well have been prevented had this \nwoman continued to receive home health care.\n  This is only one of the heart-wrenching stories that I have heard \nfrom both patients and dedicated home health\n\n[[Page S3418]]\n\nnurses throughout the State of Maine. I am, therefore, extremely \nconcerned that there is yet another cut in home health care looming on \nthe horizon, that an additional automatic 15-percent cut is scheduled \nto go into effect on October 1 of next year. This cut would sound the \ndeath knell for many of our already struggling home health agencies, \nand it would further jeopardize access to critical home health services \nfor millions of our Nation's seniors.\n  Since we have already surpassed the savings target set by the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997, further cuts simply are not necessary.\n  Mr. President, the fact that Congress has delayed the automatic 15-\npercent cutback for 3 straight years demonstrates that the cut is not \njustified, it is not warranted. To simply keep delaying this cut 1 year \nat a time, year after year, is to leave a ``sword of Damocles'' hanging \nover the heads of these home health agencies. It makes it impossible \nfor them to plan how they are going to serve their patients. It causes \nthem to turn down patients who are complicated and costly to serve \nbecause they can't count on the reimbursement. This further cut is not \nneeded, and it should be eliminated altogether once and for all.\n  Mr. President, the amendment we are introducing today will enable us \nto eliminate this cut once and for all. It will provide a needed \nmeasure of relief and certainty for cost-effective home health care \nproviders across this country that are experiencing serious financial \ndifficulties that are inhibiting their ability to deliver much needed \ncare, particularly to those chronically ill elderly with complex care \nneeds.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support my amendment. I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to commend my colleague from \nMaine for her comments. I could not agree more about the importance of \nhome health care for families all across America. We all know there are \nmore and more people who desire to live at home, and they can because \nof modern medicine. There are more and more of us as baby boomers, and \nothers, who have parents or grandparents we wish to help care for in \nour own homes or in their homes. Home health care is a critical part of \nthe network of health care for our citizens.\n  I could not agree more that we need to make sure the next cut--this \n15-percent cut that has been delayed three times by the Congress--does \nnot actually take effect in October of 2002.\n  My problem with the amendment spoken to is it does not guarantee that \ncut will not take place. In fact, the amendment I am offering would \nguarantee--no ifs, ands, or buts about it--that this cut would not take \neffect. When I look at my colleague's amendment, first of all, it says \nif there is a repeal of the 15-percent reduction, the House and Senate \nBudget Committees ``may'' increase the allocation of new budget \nauthority--not that they ``shall'' or that they ``have to'' but they \n``may.'' I believe we have to say that they ``must.''\n\n  Secondly, unfortunately, the way this is put together, it creates a \nshell game once again. While appearing to protect the Medicare trust \nfund and saying that these dollars do not come out of the Medicare \ntrust fund, they, in fact, set up a scenario that does, in fact, \nguarantee, I believe, that the $13.7 billion will not be available \nbecause with all of the things being talked about, with all of the on-\nbudget surplus being used for the tax cut being talked about, with the \nefforts going on here, and what will be happening with all the other \npriorities, it will be impossible to keep this commitment; in fact, we \nwill see that cut happen--at least there is no guarantee under this \namendment that that horrendous 15-percent cut will not happen.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I have offered is for the same amount of \ndollars, $13.7 billion. But instead of having the ifs, ands, maybes, \nand the mays, what we say is that these dollars are taken off of the \ntop--a small amount of money--of the tax cut and shall be guaranteed \nand put aside for home health care to guarantee that this 15-percent \ncut will not take place.\n  This is a very small amount of dollars. I know people in my State--\nthe people who want us to put forward a balanced approach, who support \na tax cut and also want to make sure we are continuing to pay down the \ndebt--also are very concerned about putting aside a small amount of \ndollars to make sure that our seniors can live at home in dignity; that \nfamilies can care for loved ones and have the opportunity to have \nvaluable home health care services available to them.\n  As my colleague from Maine indicated, when the Balanced Budget Act \nwas put into place, it was anticipated that the Medicare home health \ncuts would be $16 billion, and we find just a few years later that it \nis estimated to be four times that amount. We did not realize that when \nthe BBA was passed. I argue that it was a case of unintended \nconsequences, and that we have recognized that by delaying the 15-\npercent cut three different times, because we know they are excessive, \nthat there is something wrong when there has been a 24-percent drop in \nthe number of patients served by home health agencies.\n\n  When we see a 30-percent reduction in the number of agencies serving \nMedicare patients nationwide--30 percent--we are talking about almost a \nthird of a cut in those serving Medicare patients in home health care \nacross this country, while the demand is going up. The citizens of our \ncountry are getting older and living longer, and we all celebrate that \nwe are living longer. Unfortunately, with that comes a greater and \ngreater demand with home health care services.\n  So I agree with my colleague that, in fact, we need to be serious \nabout this. We can all talk about men and women and children and folks \nof all parts of this country who have been and are today in situations \nwhere they are in desperate need of home health care. We can also talk \nabout how it saves dollars--that through home health care we are saving \ndollars in nursing homes and other institutional care. It means dollars \nand cents, and it makes sense from a quality of life standpoint.\n  I strongly agree that we need to protect these dollars and guarantee \nthat this cut does not take effect. Again, my concern is that the \namendment of my friend from Maine, unfortunately, does not guarantee \nthat this cut will not take effect. We can do that. We can, in this \nprocess, say that we are going to, regardless of the other priorities, \nregardless of what else is passed, put aside this small amount of \ndollars to protect the home health agencies and the people they serve \nall across this country. That is what this is about.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Collins amendment and to support \nthe Stabenow amendment, which is a guarantee that, in fact, we will be \nable to protect home health services for our citizens. I can't think of \nan issue that touches so many homes and families more than this one--\nfamilies who are hoping that they have the opportunity and the \nresources to care for loved ones at home or for people who wish to live \nin dignity in their own home.\n  Again, I commend my colleague on the other side of the aisle for her \ncomments about the importance of home health care. I could not agree \nmore. I believe very strongly that we need to take as firm a position \nas we can, and the amendment that I offer does.\n  The amendment I offered is an absolute guarantee that our home health \nagencies and the people they serve will not lose additional dollars and \nthat those services will be protected.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield me 2 minutes?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I yield as much time as the Senator wants.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, so there will be no confusion, \nthe distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, has an amendment \nthat makes the money available when the committee of jurisdiction \nreports back that the repeal has been accomplished. It is a real \namendment. It is precisely what would have to happen--and the Senator \nis saying that it should happen--in order to repeal that statute about \nwhich the Senator is talking.\n  I do not want anybody to think the Senator offered an amendment that \ndoes not accomplish her purpose. She has been talking about this \nproblem for a long time.\n  If the Senator had offered an amendment that was not meaningful, that \ndid\n\n[[Page S3419]]\n\nnot get the job done, we would have already fixed the amendment. We \nwould have looked at it first.\n  It is a real amendment. It is the real way to do it. I thank the \nSenator from Maine for her persistence and for the amendment which we \nwill vote on tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 22\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I neglected to mention Senator Roberts \nwants to be a cosponsor of the amendment as well. He is on the \namendment I sent to the desk. I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDomenici be added as a cosponsor as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Senator Domenici has been extremely \nhelpful in drafting this amendment. I am grateful for his help. Senator \nRoberts has also been a real leader in this area.\n  I must say I am very disappointed to hear the comments of my friend \nand colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow. There is no one who has \nworked harder than I on home health care during the last few years. It \nwas the legislation I introduced that was incorporated into the \nMedicare Refinement Act that we passed that restored some of the cuts \nto home health agencies.\n  I have been honored to work with the trade associations representing \nour Nation's home health agencies and have been very humbled and \nprivileged to receive their awards as legislator of the year.\n  For my colleague to suggest that I am offering a sham or phony \namendment and to somehow question my sincerity in trying to restore \nhome health care is really most unfortunate and most disappointing.\n  This is, as the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee said, \na very real amendment. In fact, a reserve account is the fairest way to \naddress this problem. We are still going to have to pass legislation, \nwhether it is the amendment of the Senator from Michigan that is \nadopted or whether my version is adopted, to actually carry out the \nelimination of the 15-percent reduction. But my reserve fund amendment \nprovides a mechanism to bring us closer to that goal by reserving those \nfunds that we need, that $13.7 billion that is necessary.\n  As I said, I am very disappointed and think it is very unfortunate to \nhave my efforts misrepresented. I have worked extremely hard on this \nissue. I have introduced legislation that has bipartisan support, that \nhas more than 30 cosponsors expressing support for home health care.\n\n  I have visited elderly people in Maine who are receiving home health \ncare, and I know how absolutely critical it is to them.\n  On my most recent home health visit, I accompanied a very dedicated, \nprofessional, and compassionate home health nurse to a town outside of \nBangor. This woman was receiving home health care while living with her \ndaughter. She had lung cancer. But home health care allowed her to \nspend her final months of her life in her daughter's home--not in a \nnursing home, not in a hospital, but surrounded by her loving family.\n  I do not want anything to jeopardize the ability of such a woman and \nso many other Maine citizens and citizens across this country to \nreceive the home health care services they need.\n  I visited another couple in my hometown of Caribou. They were both in \ntheir mid-eighties. One was in a wheelchair. Each of them had very \nserious health problems. Home health care allowed this elderly couple \nto stay together in their own home where they had lived for more than \n60 years rather than be separated and having one sent to a nursing \nhome.\n  That is how important home health care is, and there is no one who is \nmore committed than I to making sure we undo the damage that was \ninadvertently done by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the very \nburdensome and onerous regulations imposed by the Clinton \nadministration.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment that I and many others \nhave offered so that we can bring ourselves a step closer to making \nsure we eliminate once and for all this 15-percent ill-advised cut in \nMedicare home health care reimbursements.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Michigan yield?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Maine wishes to offer a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am sorry; I could not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding the Senator wants to offer a \nunanimous consent request.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I believe the Senator from Nevada knew that before I \ndid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the only first-degree \namendments in order on Friday be those amendments submitted at the desk \nby 2 p.m. on Thursday, with the exception of an amendment to be offered \nby the minority leader and an amendment to be offered by the majority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I in no way intended to express \ndoubt about my colleague's sincerity on this issue. I, in fact, \nindicated in my comments that I appreciated her commitment and \nunderstand this is an issue with which she has been very involved and \nit certainly is an issue she cares deeply about and an amendment, I am \nsure, that is intended for all purposes to move in the right direction. \nI commend her for that.\n  I shared those same experiences when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives working with the home health groups and having the \nopportunity to be very involved as a House Member.\n  I very much appreciate the work of the Senator from Maine.\n  What I question is simply the language in the amendment and the \nmechanism being used. The practical reality is that if we adopt an \namendment that indicates the dollars will be put aside but cannot be \nused if, in fact, the Medicare trust fund is dipped into, that is an \nimpossible situation because the vast majority of the contingency fund \nis, in fact, the Medicare trust fund.\n  When we look at what the President has proposed to spend from the \ncontingency fund, which is the Medicare trust fund predominantly, my \nfear is that we will find a situation where the Senator's well-intended \namendment, if adopted, might be in a situation where it could not take \neffect without dipping into the Medicare trust fund.\n  This bars dipping into the Medicare trust fund, which I support. But \nby using this mechanism, it, in fact, may not provide the protection \nshe desires.\n  My amendment simply takes the same amount of dollars, but by taking \nit off the top rather than through some language about the contingency \nfund and not using the Medicare trust fund, by simply taking it off the \ntop, we guarantee that money can be put aside. We can call it a reserve \nfund. That makes a lot of sense.\n  Let us work together and call it a reserve fund and put it aside but \nnot make it contingent upon all of the other decisions that will be \nmade by the Budget Committee, the Finance Committee, and others, in \nways in which this contingency fund will be structured. That is my \nconcern.\n\n  I appreciate the fact there is a desire to keep intact the \nPresident's tax proposal. I appreciate that. I have a different view in \nterms of priorities, wanting to see the tax cut as part of the \npriorities and paying down the debt, and making sure we can carve out a \nsmall amount of the total for home health care. I would like to see it \nwritten in stone so it is not dependent upon other conditions.\n  The amendment says it would be subject to certain conditions, when \ntaken together with all other previously enacted legislation. In total, \nif the amount involved would reduce the on-budget surplus below the \nlevel of the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund, then it would not \nhappen.\n\n[[Page S3420]]\n\n  The bottom line is, we see this Senate moving in the direction of \n``combining'' when all is said and done because of the desire to move \nthe Medicare trust fund into spending, which is the direction the \nSenate has been moving. The President has asked to move the Medicare \ntrust fund into spending and because all kinds of things have been \npromised out of that Medicare trust fund and out of the contingency \nfund, unfortunately, this language does not guarantee we can protect \nhome health care agencies from the 15-percent cut.\n  I will gladly work with my colleague to find a way to make sure we \ncan guarantee this 15-percent cut will not take effect. I couldn't \nagree more. We see a 24-percent drop in the number of patients served \nby home health agencies. We are talking about real people, real \npeople's lives, families who are struggling, people who need care. I \ncouldn't agree more that we need to make a strong statement in support \nof those who use and need to use home health care services. My concern \nis, as with other amendments that relate to the whole question of the \ncontingency fund, there is no guarantee that, in fact, this will be \nable to happen.\n  I welcome my colleague joining with me to make sure we put aside \n$13.7 billion and that we can work together to make sure that is truly \navailable, regardless of what other decisions are made regarding the \nbudget.\n  As I indicated, in this amendment, unfortunately, it is ``subject to \nthe condition that such legislation will not, when taken together with \nall other previously enacted legislation'' dip into the Medicare trust \nfund.\n  I argue strongly that given that exception, in fact, the goal would \nnot be met. I urge my colleagues to join with me in truly protecting \nhome health care. I welcome the opportunity to work with my colleague \nto do that. I know we both share a strong commitment on this issue. I \nwant to make sure, as I am sure she does, I want to make sure this \nlanguage is the kind of language that will guarantee at the end of the \nday that this 15-percent cut does not take effect, no ifs, ands, or \nbuts about it, that it does not take effect and our families will have \nthe opportunity to use needed home health care services.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let's get this straight. Whether the \namendment of the Senator from Michigan passes or whether my amendment \npasses, the Senate Finance Committee is still going to have to report \nlegislation repealing the 15-percent cut. There is no absolute \nguarantee under either version.\n  The fact is, under the Collins amendment there is far more likelihood \nthat we will see repeal of the 15-percent cut because I specifically \nset aside the $13.7 billion in a reserve fund that can only be used to \nrestore the 15-percent cut to eliminate the cut.\n  By contrast, the amendment of my friend and colleague from Michigan \njust increases funding in the Medicare account, with no guarantee that \nthe money goes for home health care. Instead, she takes money out of \nthe tax cut.\n\n  The approach I have sets aside the $13.7 billion specifically for the \npurpose of eliminating the 15-percent cut. There is far more of a \n``guarantee'' that we will repeal the 15-percent cut under the Collins \namendment than under the amendment offered by the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  I think it is unfortunate the Senator from Michigan has not joined on \nto the Collins amendment. I am very pleased to say, and appreciative of \nthe fact, she is a cosponsor of the legislation that I have introduced, \nwhich more than 30 Members have cosponsored, to eliminate the 15-\npercent cut. If we are talking about what version of the amendment is \nmore likely to bring about the goal that we both share, it is clearly \nthe version I have offered which says that the money can only be used \nfor home health care and for eliminating the 15-percent cut.\n  I also find it ironic that the amendment is being criticized now for \nexempting and providing a mechanism of safeguard for the Medicare HI \ntrust fund. That has been an issue that has been repeatedly raised by \nMembers of the minority party, by Members of the Democratic Party, as a \nconcern about these amendments. In an attempt to respond to that \nconcern, I make sure we shield the Medicare trust fund so it could not \nbe tapped for this purpose and that this would be new money. To now \nhear criticisms of the amendment because we put in those safeguards \nstrikes me as puzzling, to say the least.\n  Again, my goal is to make sure every elderly American who needs home \nhealth care, who wants to receive services in the privacy, security, \nand comfort of their own homes is able to do so. Home health care has \nbecome so important and we must ensure that our frail, vulnerable \nelderly receive the services they need.\n  I yield the floor but reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I make it clear I agree with protecting \nthe Medicare trust fund. That is very laudable. I wish we were totally \nprotecting it from any areas of spending. My concern is simply that \nwhen we protect it, as this amendment does, it makes it impossible to \nfind the $13.7 billion when you look at the conditions put in this \namendment.\n  It is excellent to protect the Medicare trust fund, but the reality \nis the contingency fund that has been put forward by the President in \nthis resolution uses the entire Medicare trust fund to fund it. It is \nreally a Catch-22. That is my concern.\n  I certainly am hopeful we will be able to truly put aside the dollars \nand make sure that, regardless of what else happens in the process, we \nhave dollars put aside to protect home health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Michigan has indicated she is willing to \nyield back time. I don't know if there is anyone who wishes to speak on \nthe other side.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleague from Maine, \nSenator Collins, to offer an amendment on Medicare home health care. \nThis amendment will give us the ability later this year to pass the \nHome Health Payment Fairness Act, a bill I have sponsored with the \nSenator from Maine and 31 other Senators, that tries to ensure that \nseniors and disabled Americans have appropriate access to high-quality \nhome health care.\n  Home health care is a crucial part of Medicare through which seniors \ncan get basic nursing and therapy care in their home. It is convenient. \nIt is cost-effective. But more importantly, home health is the key to \nfulfilling a virtually universal desire among seniors and those with \ndisabilities, to remain independent and within the comfort of their own \nhomes despite their health problems.\n  Yet we have a crisis in home health, too many seniors who could and \nshould be receiving home health are not getting it. This is tragic.\n  We all know the basic history, Congress made cuts in the Balanced \nBudget Act, the Health Care Financing Administration went too far in \nimplementation, providers struggled or disappeared, and now patients \nare having a harder time getting care. This has been true for \nhospitals, for nursing homes, and for home health.\n  But there are two things that distinguish the home health crisis from \nall of the other Balanced Budget Act problems. First and most \nimportantly, no other group of Medicare patients and providers, \nabsolutely none, has suffered as much. The numbers don't lie: In 1999, \ntwo years after the Balanced Budget Act, almost 900,000 fewer seniors \nand disabled Americans were receiving home health care than previously. \nMore than 3,300 of the Nation's 10,000 home health agencies have either \ngone out-of-business, or have stopped serving Medicare patients.\n  Medicare home health spending has actually gone down for three \nstraight years, dropping by 46 percent from 1997 and 2000.\n  In my home state of Missouri, 27,000 fewer patients are receiving \nhome care than before, a drop of 30 percent. And almost 140 home health \ncare providers, almost half, have disappeared since the Balanced Budget \nAct.\n  The second thing that is unique about home health, the biggest cuts \nmay be yet to come.\n  While other Medicare providers will still face some additional \nBalanced Budget Act cuts, nobody faces anything like the 15-percent \nacross-the-\n\n[[Page S3421]]\n\nboard home cuts that are now scheduled for October of 2002. That's a \n15-percent cut on top of everything else that has happened thus far.\n  I do not believe this should happen, and I actually don't know of \nanybody who believes the 15-percent health cuts should take effect. \nThat's why Congress has already delayed the 25-percent cuts three \nseparate times.\n  Our amendment would give us the room in the budget to fix this once \nand for all, no more mere delays, no more half-measures. This amendment \nwill allow us to pass legislation later this year to permanently \neliminate these 15-percent cuts.\n  Home health care has been through enough. Our Nation's dedicated home \nhealth providers deserve to be left alone and given a break so they can \nfocus on patient care rather than survival. The last thing they need is \nmore cuts. And that is all our bill tries to do, we try to spare home \ncare patients and agencies additional cuts that threaten to make a bad \nsituation worse. The seniors and disabled Americans who rely on home \nhealth for the health care, and for their independence, deserve no \nless.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request. \nSenator Burns would like to be added as a cosponsor of the amendment. I \nask unanimous consent that he be so added.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would like at this time to reserve my time, but if \nother Senators wish to speak I have no objection.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, we have reserved 5 minutes for \nthe Senator in the morning and 5 minutes for Senator Stabenow. Senator \nGrassley wishes to speak as in morning business.\n  Unless the Senator has some urge to speak tonight on this subject, my \npoint is, if she has nothing more to say, we will yield back all time \nand allow Senator Grassley to speak as in morning business. He wants to \nspeak for an extended time.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, is all the time yielded back on the \namendment on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I would just like to make certain there \nare no Members on our side----\n  Mr. REID. I have checked with staff and they indicated they know of \nno one.\n  Ms. COLLINS. In view of those assurances, even though this is one of \nmy favorite topics and I would like to continue to talk about it, as a \ncourtesy to my colleagues, I will yield the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 174\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, to move the budget process forward, I \nvoted to support the Grassley amendment today to raise the levels of \nspending for agriculture programs in the budget resolution. Despite my \nfavorable vote, I wish to express my deep concerns about the form and \nlevel of spending included in this amendment.\n  The Grassley amendment will add an additional $63 billion in \nmandatory spending to agricultural programs over ten years, which is \nassumed to be paid from projected budget surpluses. This is above the \namount proposed by my Republican colleagues on the budget committee. By \ndesignating the extra $63 billion as mandatory spending, much of this \nfunding will be targeted toward farm subsidy programs.\n  The needs of American family farmers are not being ignored. Congress \nis in the process of drafting a new Farm bill to reauthorize USDA \nprograms, which many would view as the appropriate vehicle to tackle \nnecessary reform and address farm crises. In the past few years, \nCongress has approved more than $20 billion in emergency farm aid for \ncrop losses and disaster assistance. The agriculture appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 2001 was padded with $300 million in porkbarrel \nspending for towns, universities, research institutes and a myriad of \nother entities. This is already an exorbitant commitment by the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  I believe it is fundamentally wrong that we are asking taxpayers to \npay billions more, above already inflated levels of spending for farm \nprograms and subsidies, particularly when the federal government is not \nmeeting its current obligations for other designated mandatory spending \nprograms such as education. For example, this budget resolution does \nnot account for the federal government's responsibility to pay 40 \npercent of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, for \nspecial education. I believe many of my colleagues would agree that we \nshould prioritize mandatory spending for existing responsibilities not \nbeing fulfilled without requiring the taxpayers to spend an additional \n$63 billion for farm programs that have already been more than \ncompensated.\n  After consultation with the leadership on this particular amendment, \nmy colleagues stated that if Senator Grassley's amendment failed, many \nwould be in the position of having to vote for the Johnson amendment, \nwhich would have raised mandatory spending on agriculture programs by \n$97 billion, as the only available alternative. Therefore, while I \nbelieve this to be irresponsible fiscal policy, I ultimately decided to \nvote in favor of the Grassley amendment to move the process forward on \nthe budget resolution and to avoid even greater wasteful spending. I \nremind my colleagues, however, that we still have an important \nobligation to American taxpayers to ensure that any spending we approve \nthrough the annual appropriations process pursuant to this budget \nresolution is fair, fiscally responsible, and targeted at those truly \nin need.\n\n\n                       JUDICIARY COMMITTEE VIEWS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the Judiciary Committee's views and estimates letter from \nSenator Hatch.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 21, 2001.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Ranking Democrat, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Pete and Kent: Thank you for your recent letter \n     requesting my views pursuant to Section 301(d) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act. As you know, the Committee on the \n     Judiciary has jurisdiction over Department of Justice \n     programs, as well as matters relating to the U.S. Patent and \n     Trademark Office. After consultation with members of the \n     Committee, I have prepared the following comments regarding \n     the budget of the Department of Justice and the Patent and \n     Trademark Office.\n       As I noted last year, the fiscal discipline exhibited by \n     Congress in the past several years, culminating with the \n     historic 1997 balanced budget agreement, has helped maintain \n     and ensure a robust economy not just for now, but for the \n     next generation as well. Maintaining a balanced federal \n     budget will, of course, require us to make tough choices \n     about spending priorities. Such changes must be executed in a \n     fashion to ensure that each dollar is spent in a productive \n     fashion. No department should be exempt from careful \n     scrutiny.\n       Exercising fiscal responsibility, however, does not absolve \n     us of our responsibility to carry out the core functions of \n     government. As I am certain you agree, the administration of \n     justice, including the protection of the public from crime \n     and terrorism, are core functions of government. Indeed, as \n     we begin the new millennium, these threats are becoming more \n     sophisticated and dangerous, making vigilance more important \n     than before. I look forward to working with you to develop a \n     budget resolution that reflects the importance of this \n     category of spending.\n       With these thoughts in mind, I am pleased to provide you \n     with the views and estimates of the Committee on the \n     Judiciary for the FY 2002 budget.\n\n\n               state and local law enforcement assistance\n\n       State and local law enforcement assistance programs, funded \n     largely through the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), are a \n     major component of the Department of Justice Budget. These \n     federal grants to state and local law enforcement allow the \n     federal government to contribute directly to the fight \n     against crime without involving the Department of Justice in \n     prosecuting crimes that are not federal in nature. As you \n     know, most violent crimes, such as murder, rape, and assault, \n     are state crimes, not federal crimes. By providing these \n     grants, the federal government can help to reduce crime in a \n     manner consistent with our constitutional system of \n     government.\n       Local Law Enforcement Block Grants: The Local Law \n     Enforcement Block Grant program (LLEBG) provides assistance \n     on a formula basis to local law enforcement agencies. The \n     LLEBG has made it possible for local police and sheriffs \n     departments to acquire efficiency-enhancing technology and \n     equipment. The LLEBG was funded at approximately $500 million \n     in FY 2000 and FY\n\n[[Page S3422]]\n\n     2001. I urge continued funding of this valuable grant program \n     at a level consistent with the two previous fiscal years.\n       Byrne Grants: The Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law \n     Enforcement Assistance Grant program is a successful and \n     popular program which provides needed assistance to state and \n     local law enforcement for a wide variety of purposes, such as \n     purchasing capital equipment. Like the LLEBG, this program \n     provides needed assistance to state and local law enforcement \n     without entangling the federal government in the prosecution \n     of crimes that are not federal in nature. I urge continued \n     funding of this valuable grant program at a level consistent \n     with the two previous fiscal years.\n       Juvenile Accountability Block Grants: This program provides \n     valuable grants to states for a variety of law enforcement \n     purposes targeting juvenile crime, including graduated \n     sanctions, drug testing, and juvenile detention and \n     incarceration.\n       Juvenile crime continues to be among the greatest criminal \n     justice challenges in America. Juveniles account for nearly \n     one-fifth of all criminal arrests. Even with the recent \n     reductions in juvenile crime, there is a potential for \n     significant increases in juvenile crime as the children of \n     the baby boom generation mature into the prime age for \n     criminal activity.\n       In the last several years, the Juvenile Accountability \n     Block Grants received approximately $250 million per year. \n     This is the only federal money dedicated to juvenile law \n     enforcement and accountability programs. By contrast, the \n     federal government spends billions of dollars in prevention \n     funds for at-risk youth. There should be a balanced approach \n     to juvenile crime with resources dedicated to prevention and \n     accountability. Therefore, I urge continued funding for this \n     program at a level consistent with the two previous fiscal \n     years.\n       State Criminal Alien Incarceration Grants: The State \n     Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) reimburses states \n     and local governments for the costs incurred in incarcerating \n     illegal aliens who commit crimes in this country. Immigration \n     is the responsibility of the federal government. The SCAAP \n     reimbursements fulfill the federal responsibility to at least \n     partially indemnify states for the costs of illegal \n     immigration. These grants should be funded at an adequate \n     level. Last year, the SCAAP grants received approximately \n     $600 million. I urge continued funding for this program at an \n     adequate level which is consistent with the two previous \n     fiscal years.\n       DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Grants: DNA samples must \n     be analyzed by accredited laboratories before the samples can \n     be placed in CODIS, the national DNA evidence database. \n     Unfortunately, there is an approximate two-year nationwide \n     backlog of 700,000 unanalyzed convicted offender DNA samples \n     and unanalyzed DNA evidence from unsolved crimes. Authorities \n     estimate that at least 600 felonies will be solved by \n     eliminating the backlog of convicted offender DNA samples \n     alone. Consequently, I urge funding of the recently enacted \n     DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Grants to help States \n     analyze DNA samples and evidence and expedite their inclusion \n     in CODIS.\n       In addition, state laboratories desperately need funding \n     for buildings, equipment, and training of personnel in order \n     to eliminate the backlog and to process crime scene evidence \n     in a timely manner. Therefore, I urge adequate funding for \n     the recently enacted Paul Coverdell National Forensic \n     Sciences Improvement Act.\n       Criminal Technology Grants: Crime technology is critical to \n     effective law enforcement. Millions of dollars have been \n     invested in national systems, such as the Integrated \n     Automated Fingerprint Identification System and the National \n     Criminal Information Center 2000, which require state \n     participation in order to be effective.\n       Additionally, state and local governments are at a crucial \n     juncture in the development and integration of their criminal \n     justice technology. The Crime Identification Technology Act \n     (CITA) provides for system integration, permitting all \n     components of criminal justice to share information and \n     communicate more effectively on a real-time basis. There is \n     also a tremendous need to integrate the patchwork of federal \n     programs that fund only specific areas of anti-crime \n     technology. Therefore, I recommend funding for CITA at a \n     level consistent with the previous two fiscal years.\n\n\n                               drug abuse\n\n       Combating drug trafficking remains one of the Judiciary \n     Committee's top priorities. As you know, drug use among \n     teenagers rose sharply throughout much of the last \n     administration. However, in the past few years, because of \n     the attention paid to the issue by Congress, drug use among \n     teens has leveled off. Still, the rate of teenage use remains \n     far too high.\n       Drug abuse in not confined to American teenagers. Far too \n     many Americans still abuse illegal drugs, and the problem \n     threatens to worsen as drugs such as methamphetamine and \n     ecstasy become increasingly available throughout the \n     country. We know that an effective drug control strategy \n     can dramatically reduce drug use in this country. Such a \n     strategy must embody a balanced approach and must contain \n     both demand and supply reduction elements. This approach, \n     which has the virtue of being nonpartisan, enjoys wide \n     support. It has been endorsed by the law enforcement \n     community, prevention and treatment experts, state and \n     local government organizations, community-based \n     organizations, and prominent political figures from across \n     the ideological spectrum.\n       As for the supply reduction component of this strategy, the \n     budget should contain sufficient resources to fund vigorous \n     domestic law enforcement activities, including defending our \n     borders, and international interdiction efforts. Such funding \n     includes supply reduction efforts by the Department of \n     Defense, the Coast Guard, and domestic law enforcement \n     agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration, the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Customs Service.\n       While we know that vigorous law enforcement measures are \n     necessary, we must also provide resources for drug prevention \n     and treatment programs. Such community-based programs, as we \n     learned in the 1980's, can significantly reduce drug use in \n     our communities. I recently introduced S. 304, the ``Drug \n     Education, Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2001,'' which \n     sets forth a comprehensive package of prevention and \n     treatment proposals. I am confident that these programs, if \n     adequately funded, will add the necessary demand reduction \n     component to our national drug control strategy. I believe \n     that if we are to win the war on drugs in America, we need a \n     stronger national commitment to demand reduction as a \n     complement to vigorous law enforcement efforts. Only with \n     such a balanced approach can we remove the scourge of drugs \n     from our society. Therefore, I recommend funding for the Drug \n     Education, Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2001 at a level \n     consistent with its authorization.\n\n\n                  Violence Against Women Act Programs\n\n       Congress has consistently supported funding for the \n     majority of initiatives contained in the 1994 Violence \n     Against Women Act. Last Fall, Congress re-authorized most of \n     the programs contained in the original act for a five-year \n     period with adjusted funding levels. I believe that this \n     legislation will continue programs with a track record of \n     effectiveness. Therefore, I recommend funding for this \n     important Act at a level consistent with the new \n     authorization.\n\n\n                       Antitrust Division Funding\n\n       Recognizing the increasingly numerous and complex merger \n     proposals confronting the Department of Justice, as well as \n     the explosive growth of high technology industries, both in \n     the United States and abroad, a reasonable expansion of the \n     Department's Antitrust Division may be appropriate if a \n     sufficient justification could be made. However, given last \n     fiscal year's increase in the Antitrust Division (and the \n     Federal Trade Commission), it appears that both the Division \n     and the Commission are adequately funded absent a \n     justification for a funding increase.\n\n\n              radiation exposure compensation act funding\n\n       The Department of Justice informed the Judiciary Committee \n     last year that there is a severe shortfall in the funding for \n     the Radiation Compensation and Exposure Act (RECA) Trust \n     Fund. As you know, Congress passed the original Act in 1990 \n     as well as subsequent legislation, S. 1515, last year to \n     update the list of compensable illnesses. The Department is \n     currently unable to meet any of the financial obligations for \n     those individuals whose claims have been approved. As a \n     result, hundreds of individuals are receiving ``IOUs'' from \n     the federal government in lieu of their payment. Accordingly, \n     in order to meet the government's obligation to provide \n     financial assistance to these beneficiaries, I am requesting \n     $84 million to pay those claims which have already been \n     approved as well as the projected number of approved claims \n     for fiscal year 2001.\n\n\n               intellectual property rights (ipr) center\n\n       Last year, the President's budget requested $612,000 and \n     eight positions for a joint Intellectual Property Rights \n     (IPR) Center to be co-led by the FBI and the U.S. Customs \n     Service. I supported the creation of this multi-agency \n     enforcement center in last year's budget, which took a very \n     important first step in creating a mechanism for coordinated \n     enforcement of intellectual property rights in the United \n     States. I supported President Clinton's budget request to \n     fund this center this year as a down-payment, and I will \n     continue to be vigilant in seeking to ensure that adequate \n     funding is continued in the years to come. I hope that we \n     will continue to move forward to ensure effective and \n     efficient IPR enforcement and protection against the theft of \n     American technology and intellectual property.\n\n\n               united states patent and trademark office\n\n       Technology and innovation are the driving forces behind our \n     economy. Last year, the budget request acknowledged that \n     ``[i]n the last 50 years, developments in science and \n     technology have generated at least half of the nation's \n     productivity growth, creating millions of high-skill, high-\n     wage jobs and leading to advances in the economy, national \n     security, the environment, transportation, and medical \n     care.'' Yet while President Clinton's budget purported to \n     promote science and technology through increased taxpayer \n     funding, it penalized private sector investment in innovation \n     by siphoning off roughly one-third of the total inventor-\n     derived user-fees paid to the United States Patent and \n     Trademark Office (USPTO) for technology-related services.\n       The USPTO is 100 percent supported by user fees paid by \n     patent and trademark applicants and owners. Since 1992, \n     Congress has\n\n[[Page S3423]]\n\n     been withholding a gradually increasing portion of the \n     USPTO's user fees each year. Examples of recent withholdings \n     include $108 million in Fiscal Year 1999 and $116 million in \n     Fiscal Year 2000. Last December, consistent with the \n     President's budget request, legislation was passed that \n     provides the USPTO with a budget of $1,039 million. Of the \n     $1,039 million, $784 million will be derived from Fiscal Year \n     2001 and $255 million from a carryover from past years and \n     any fees received in excess of $784 million will not be \n     available to the USPTO in Fiscal Year 2001. With a projected \n     revenue of $1,152 million for Fiscal Year 2001, this means an \n     overall USPTO withholding of approximately $368 million \n     for Fiscal Year 2001.\n       As you know, I have long opposed the diversion of patent \n     fees as a debilitative tax on innovation. In my view, such a \n     tax flies in the face of the Constitution's patent clause and \n     its vision of government as a promoter, rather than an \n     inhibitor, of innovation. I was pleased to work closely with \n     you to sunset the patent surcharge fee in FY 1998, which for \n     several years had been the source of the patent fee revenue \n     subject to diversion and rescission. Last year, I was \n     encouraged that the President's budget for the first time did \n     not include fee diversion or recission as a means of funding \n     unrelated spending.\n       Statutory withholding of fees paid for services undermines \n     the integrity of the USPTO's fee-funded agency model and \n     restricts the USPTO's ability to provide service to its \n     customers and to promote American innovation and \n     competitiveness. Withholdings are being made at a time when \n     the USPTO is experiencing unprecedented grown in its \n     workload. In the last five years, patent and trademark \n     filings have been on the rise. Last year, patent filings were \n     up twelve percent and trademark filings were up a staggering \n     forty percent. Reduced availability of fee revenue will \n     prevent the USPTO from replacing and hiring examiners to \n     handle the increased workload. As a result, waiting times for \n     patents and trademarks could drastically increase in 2001 and \n     years to follow and there could be significant delays in \n     bringing important new technologies and products to the \n     marketplace. Companies in high-technology, biotechnology, and \n     many other vital industries depend on prompt and high quality \n     patents and trademarks to protect business investments in R \n     and new product promotion. Moreover, fee diversion will force \n     the USPTO to defer certain imperatives in automation, \n     electronic filing, and other implementation of technology to \n     improve the current ability and efficiency of the USPTO to \n     handle increased workload and increasingly complex \n     technologies.\n       As I understand it, what makes this practice possible is \n     the fact that, in past years, the Budget Committee has \n     delineated a portion of the USPTO's fee revenue as income \n     subject to the discretionary authority of the Committees on \n     Appropriations--an artifact of the patent fee surcharge \n     created by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 \n     (OBRA '90), which expired on September 30, 1998. OBRA '90 \n     segregated a portion of fees that were subject to the \n     appropriation discretion, and the remainder of the USPTO fee \n     income was appropriated to the agency on a dollar-for-dollar \n     basis.\n       With the lapse of the patent fee surcharge, the Judiciary \n     Committee fashioned a modified fee system in which there was \n     no longer a ``surcharge'' component to patent fees. We set \n     the level of the fees to recover the cost of processing \n     applications and intended that all of the fee revenue would \n     be appropriated to the USPTO on a dollar-for-dollar basis, as \n     was done for the majority of fee income under OBRA '90. We \n     did not intend that there should be any discretion to \n     withhold any portion of the fee revenues.\n       Accordingly, I recommend that in the upcoming budget all \n     fee revenue of the USPTO be classified in a manner that \n     requires that it be appropriated to the USPTO on a dollar-\n     for-dollar basis. Thus, none of the fee revenues should be \n     considered as discretionary expenditures for the purposes of \n     the appropriations process. I have appreciated working with \n     you on this particular issue in the past. If legislation is \n     necessary to ensure this result, I am pleased to work with \n     you in that regard.\n       Thank you again for contacting me on this matter and for \n     your consideration of these views. I look forward to working \n     closely with you on this matter and other issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n\n                      Federal Employee Pay Parity\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to commend the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee for addressing the issue of Federal employee pay \nwith the senior Senator from Virginia and me today.\n  The House-passed fiscal year 2002 budget resolution contains \nimportant provisions to ensure parity between the pay raises granted to \ncivilian Federal employees and those provided to members of the armed \nservices. Disparate treatment of civilian and military pay goes against \nlongstanding policy of parity for all those who have chosen to serve \nour Nation--whether that service is with the civilian workforce or in \nthe armed services. In fact, a comparison of military and civilian pay \nincreases by the Congressional Research Service finds that in 17 of \nthese last 20 years military and civilian pay increases have been \nidentical.\n  Mr. WARNER. In the 106th Congress, an overwhelming majority of the \nUnited States Senate agreed, and approved a bipartisan pay parity \namendment by a vote of 94 to 6 during consideration of legislation I \nintroduced providing important pay increases for the military--S. 4, \nthe Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines Bill of Rights. I know \nthat Chairman Domenici supported that Federal employee pay parity \namendment, and has been an advocate for pay parity through his position \non the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the \nSenator from Maryland know, the Budget Committee has included language \nassuming parity between the raises granted to Federal employees and \nmembers of the armed services in the Committee Report on the Budget \nResolution for the past 2 years.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee for his \nstrong past support. Would the Chairman explain what provisions \nregarding Federal employee pay have been included in this budget \nresolution?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In drafting the budget resolution for fiscal year 2002, \nwe have assumed that the historic pay parity between civilian and \nmilitary employees will be maintained, and that the President's \nproposed 4.6 percent raise for military personnel will be similarly \nprovided to all Federal workers next year.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the chairman, and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Virginia for their interest and support. I am sure we all agree \nthat a talented Federal and military workforce is crucial to getting \nthe work of the American people done skillfully and efficiently. In \nmany instances, Federal civilian and military employees work side-by-\nside doing the important work of the Nation, and Congress has \nrecognized that we should not undermine the morale of these dedicated \npublic servants by failing to bring them in line with military \npersonnel. Continuing pay parity is one way to ensure the Federal \nGovernment is able to attract and retain qualified public servants.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3423-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I want to address the issue of tax cuts. \nIt is an issue on which Republicans and Democrats all agree. We may not \nagree on how much taxes should be cut, but we do agree that the Federal \nGovernment is collecting too much tax. The current and projected U.S. \ntax receipts are far in excess of the amounts needed to operate the \nFederal Government. The most troubling news is that the bulk of these \nexcess collections come from individual taxpayers. By coming from \nindividual taxpayers, I mean through the individual income tax.\n  The Congressional Budget Office projects that the Federal Government \nwill accumulate over $3.1 trillion in excess tax collections over the \nnext 10 years. These excess collections are projected at the time when \noverall Federal tax receipts are at one of the highest levels in the \nhistory of the country. You will see from the charts that, even worse, \nindividual income tax collections are near an all-time high, even \nhigher than some levels imposed during World War II.\n  I have a series of charts to illustrate our present situation. The \nfirst chart I\n\n[[Page S3424]]\n\nhave shows total Federal tax receipts as a percentage of gross domestic \nproduct for the last 40 years. As you can see from this chart, tax \nreceipts have fluctuated frequently since 1960. But they have escalated \nvery significantly since 1993. The increase in receipts from 1965 to \n1969 was attributable to the Vietnam conflict. The runup in receipts \nfrom 1976 to 1981 was caused by bracket creep, which occurs when \ninflation causes wages to increase, forcing people into ever higher \nrate brackets. We corrected the problem of bracket creep from inflation \nyears ago.\n  However, the most shocking spike in tax receipts began, as you can \nsee, in 1993. The Congressional Budget Office's January 2001 report to \nCongress shows that, in 1992, total tax receipts were around 17.2 \npercent of GDP. However, since that time, Federal receipts have spiked \nupward very rapidly. By the year 2000, Federal tax receipts had \nexploded to an astronomical 20.6 percent of GDP. The significance of \nthis percentage can only be appreciated in a historical context.\n\n  In 1944, which was at the height of the buildup during World War II, \ntaxes as a percentage of gross domestic product were 20.9 percent, only \none-half percent higher than they are this very day. By 1945, those \ntaxes had dropped to 20.4 percent of GDP, which is lower than the \ncollection level this very day.\n  It is simply unbelievable to me that in times of unprecedented peace \nand prosperity, the Federal Government should rake in taxes at a level \nthat exceeds the level needed to defend America and the rest of the \nworld during World War II. It simply does not make sense that the \nFederal Government should be collecting this record amount of taxes.\n  As bad as what I said sounds, it is not the whole story. That is \nbecause Federal agencies are required to exclude a significant piece of \nFederal collections. I am talking about user fees that taxpayers pay in \norder to obtain Federal services. These are fees but are still money \ncollected from the people of the United States by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  For example, when someone visits Yosemite or Yellowstone National \nPark, they pay an entrance fee. Businesses are often required to pay \nuser fees to obtain services of the Federal agencies. The dirty little \nsecret on user fees is that, under our budget laws, they are not \nincluded as Federal receipts. Instead, they are treated as an offset to \nthe expenses of the Federal agency collecting those receipts. So you \nheard me right, they never really show up on the Federal books as money \nthat the Federal Government collects. Under this treatment, user fees, \nthen, are a stealth receipt, one that understates Federal revenues and \nunderstates Federal outlays by offsetting the agency's operating \nexpenses. These fees I just mentioned are not insignificant. During the \nyear 2000, they accounted for nearly $212 billion in hidden revenue and \nexpenses. You see on this chart that with user fees, we soon get to an \nunprecedented tax level of 22.76 percent of gross domestic product.\n  The most sorry part of this whole story is that this huge increase in \ntaxes has been borne almost exclusively by the individual American \ntaxpayer. As this next chart shows, over the past decade, tax \ncollection levels for payroll taxes, corporate taxes, and all other \ntaxes have been relatively stable.\n  Just look, every color on that chart--other taxes, corporate taxes, \npayroll taxes--have been constant over the last decade. But look at the \nvery significant increase in income taxes during that period of time. \nCorporate taxes during the past 10 years have increased from 1.6 \npercent of GDP to 2.1 percent. Estate taxes have remained essentially \nunchanged. Collections of individual income taxes have soared.\n  As this chart shows, in 1992, tax collections from individual income \ntaxes were 7.7 percent of our gross domestic product. That percentage \nhas risen steadily each year and, as of the year 2000, was an \nastounding 10.2 percent of gross domestic product. Any wonder, then, \nwhy the President and most Members of Congress believe there ought to \nbe a tax cut? That is why the President and most members of his party \nbelieve there ought to be a significant tax cut and it ought to be \nconcentrated on reducing income taxes.\n  Individual income taxes now take up the largest share of gross \ndomestic product in history. Even during World War II, collections from \nindividuals were 9.4 percent of the gross domestic product, nearly a \nfull percentage point below the current level.\n  So, as you can see, the main source of the current and projected \nsurpluses is from the huge runup in individual tax collections that \nhave occurred since the passage of the biggest tax increase in the \nhistory of our country--the 1993 tax Clinton tax increase.\n  Admittedly, some of this increase is due to our booming economy. A \nportion of this increase is attributable to real gains in wages, which \nhas forced people into higher tax rate brackets. This real wage growth \nincrease is not compensated for by the usual indexing of income tax \nbrackets.\n  Since 1992, total personal income has grown an average of 5.6 percent \na year. In contrast, however, the Federal income tax collections have \ngrown an average of 9.1 percent a year, outstripping the rate of \npersonal income growth by 64 percent.\n  That fact alone is outrageous. And it is a simple enough reason why \nwe need to do something about individual income taxes and let American \nworking men and women keep more of their resources.\n  Again, this started with the biggest tax increase in the history of \nthe country under President Clinton in 1993. The results of these \nincreases are obvious from the charts that we have reviewed. Each chart \nshows a large increase in taxes from 1993 to the year 2000. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, at the request of the Joint Economic Committee, \nestimated that just repealing the revenue-raising provisions of \nPresident Clinton's 1993 tax hike would yield tax relief of more than \n$1 trillion over 10 years.\n  So I think the Democrats and Republicans alike can agree, and should \nagree, that individual taxpayers deserve relief from the Federal \nGovernment's overtaxation.\n  We have a tax surplus. That tax surplus should go to the people who \nearned it in the first place. It should be retained by the taxpayers. \nIt will do more economic good in their pockets than in the pockets of \nFederal bureaucrats and Members of Congress, and letting them make a \ndetermination of how that money is spent. Sometimes it burns such a \nhole in our pocket that we do not know how to get rid of it fast \nenough.\n  President Bush has offered a plan to reduce individual income tax \nrates across all rate brackets, and to reduce the number of brackets. \nThis benefits all income tax payers across America. We hear, however, a \nhue and cry from some on the other side of the aisle that not all \ntaxpayers should receive a rate reduction. We hear that the President's \nplan is disproportionately benefitting upper income taxpayers, and does \nnot provide enough relief at the lower end of the income scale.\n  That is a bunch of baloney. We have some news for our colleagues: \nNone of those allegations are true. To begin with, we need to first \nunderstand the current distribution of tax burdens in America. We have \na highly progressive income tax system. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, the top 20 percent of income earners pay over 75 percent \nof all individual income taxes. Now, by contrast, households in the \nbottom three-fifths of the income distribution pay 7 percent of all \nindividual taxes.\n  The President's plan not only preserves this progressive system, but \nit actually makes it more progressive. Now that is going to sound \nstrange to people who have been concentrating on the rhetoric coming \nfrom the other side of the aisle that somehow only the rich are \nbenefitting from the tax cut. But I say--and I can justify through the \nreports of the Joint Tax Committee--that once the President's program \nis passed, we are going to end up with an even more progressive system.\n  So to all those who are trying to engage in class warfare over the \nPresident's proposal, I want you to pay special attention to the \nfollowing two charts.\n  As this first chart demonstrates, the President's marginal rate \nreductions, when combined with his increase in the child credit, the \nadditional deduction for lower earning spouses, and his refundable tax \ncredit for individual health insurance, provide the greatest\n\n[[Page S3425]]\n\nreduction in tax burden for lower income taxpayers. Just see the \ncharts. The $0-to-$30,000 categories actually come out with a 136-\npercent decrease in taxes.\n  The upper income taxpayers receive an 8.7-percent reduction in their \nburdens. Compare a 136-percent reduction at the low income end to the \nhigh income end where the reduction is 8.7 percent.\n  Now, there has to be some reason for a 136-percent reduction in \ntaxes. This is because we take 4 million taxpayers off the income tax \nrolls. A four-person family earning $35,000 a year will no longer have \nany income tax burden.\n  As this chart also shows, a large portion of tax burden reduction is \ntargeted towards taxpayers making between $30,000 and $75,000 a year. \nThese taxpayers will experience relief ranging from 20.8 percent to \n38.3 percent of their current tax burdens. This is an important range \nof benefit because most small business owners and farmers operate their \nbusinesses as sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited liability \ncorporations, or S corporations. The income of these types of entities \nare reported directly on the individual income tax returns of the \nowners, and a rate reduction for individuals reduces rates for farms \nand small businesses.\n  The Department of Treasury has estimated that at least 20 million \nfarmers and small business owners will benefit under the President's \ntax relief plan when it is fully phased in.\n  Remember, I also said that the President's plan actually makes our \ntax system more progressive.\n  The next chart provides the proof. This is a very important chart for \nthose who are constantly demagoging the President's proposal on the \nbasis of income differences. This is the class warfare that we hear \nabout.\n  As this chart clearly demonstrates, under the President's proposal, \nthe overall tax burden goes down for all taxpayers earning below \n$100,000. For taxpayers making $100,000 and above, their share of the \nFederal tax burden will actually increase under the President's \nprogram. That demonstrates the statement I made earlier that based upon \na Joint Tax Committee study, when the President's program is in place, \nthe tax system will be more progressive than it is today.\n  Now, I will give some ``for examples.''\n  The share of the tax burden for taxpayers earning between $30,000 and \n$40,000 will drop from 2.5 percent to 1.8 percent. For those earning \nbetween $50,000 and $75,000, their burden share drops from 12.2 percent \nto 11.3 percent.\n  This is not the case for taxpayers earning $200,000 or more. Their \nshare of the overall burden will increase by a full 3 percentage \npoints. So as you can see, as I have said now for the third time, the \nPresident's plan not only retains the progressivity of our tax system, \nit actually enhances it. The President's plan gives tax relief to all \nincome-tax payers, and it does so in a fair manner, one that requires \nmore from those who are most able to pay and provides the greatest \nrelief to those with the most need.\n  Moreover, this tax cut is needed to redress any longstanding slowdown \nin the economy. No one can witness the events of the past few weeks and \nnot be concerned about where the economy is headed. I was startled by \nwhat I read in the Congressional Budget Office's 2001 Budget Options \nreport. The Congressional Budget Office stated that a typical estimate \nof the economic cost of a dollar of tax revenue ranges from 20 cents to \n60 cents over and above each dollar of taxes collected. Based on these \nnumbers, the negative economic effects flowing from the current \nhistorically high levels of overtaxation obviously cannot be ignored.\n  We know from the Finance Committee hearing a few weeks ago that \nmarginal rate reductions are the most efficient means of disbursing the \nbenefits of any tax cut. Just think of the stimulative effect that \ncould be achieved with a broad-based tax reduction that benefits all \nwho pay taxes and targets the benefits to those who need them the most. \nThat is what President Bush's tax plan does. I hope before this budget \nresolution debate is completed, we will have passed a budget resolution \nthat gives my Finance Committee the ability and the flexibility to get \nthe best possible tax reduction we can in a bipartisan way.\n  I want to run through a hypothetical calculation of a tax cut agenda \nand look at each number to see if it accommodates the agenda of its \nproponents. That is the work of the Senate Finance Committee. I will \nlook at Senator Conrad's number of $900 billion. The proposal Senators \nDaschle, Conrad, and the Democratic leadership have been talking about \nis their stimulus and rate reduction package. Under Joint Tax Committee \nscoring, the proposal loses $506 billion over 10 years. That leaves \nabout $394 billion for tax cuts that Senator Conrad and others have \nsaid they support. We are talking about other bills beyond what is in \ntheir stimulus and rate reduction package.\n  The Finance Committee's Democratic alternative on marriage tax relief \nwithout a sunset contains a revenue loss of $197 billion over 10 years. \nThe Democratic alternative on death tax relief creates a revenue loss \nof $64 billion over 10 years. So using the Democratic proposals and \nlast year's revenue estimates, which would only go up this year because \nof the higher revenue baseline, we have less than $133 billion left. \nKeep in mind, these are only the Democratic proposals we are talking \nabout.\n  Now let's go to the bipartisan tax cuts that have passed either or \nboth Houses recently. There is a retirement security bill; Senator \nBaucus and I will soon be introducing that. That is a bipartisan bill. \nA similar bill passed the House almost unanimously. That bill will run \nabout $52 billion. A bill to repeal the 104-year-old Spanish-American \nWar phone tax passed the House last year by an overwhelming vote. That \nwill run about $50 billion. Then there is the small business and \nagriculture tax cuts that everybody supports in a bipartisan manner. \nThat package adds up to about $70 billion. Then we have the Educational \nTax Relief Act that passed out of our Finance Committee unanimously in \nthe last couple weeks. That runs about $20 billion.\n\n  You have Democratic proposals that eat up more than the tax cuts they \nsay they want. Then we have bipartisan proposals that are out there, \nthat are very popular, and which have to fit into a package. These \nbipartisan tax cuts are left over from last year, and also exceed what \nis left in the Democratic budget.\n  Now we have heard a lot of pointed criticism of President Bush's tax \ncut plan from Senator Conrad and other leaders on the other side who \nare handling the Democratic management of the budget resolution. We \nhave heard them talk about the issue of the alternative minimum tax, \nsometimes referred to as the AMT. Senator Conrad has said it will take \n$200 billion to $300 billion to fix this AMT problem under the Bush \nplan. Remember, under current law, 10 percent of the taxpayers will \nhave to deal with the alternative minimum tax. Senator Conrad is \ncorrect that the President's plan could make the problem worse. As I \nhave said, our Finance Committee should be addressing that problem. \nPlease note, however, that the Senate Democratic economic stimulus \npackage does nothing with the AMT and will in fact make the problem \nworse.\n  According to the Joint Tax Committee, by the year 2011 about 21 \nmillion taxpayers will be subject to AMT under current law. The \nDemocratic bill will add about another 7 million taxpayers to the AMT \nhit. So if the Democratic leaders who make such a point of the AMT \nissue, then let them practice what they preach. These leaders will have \nto raise their budget tax cut numbers to deal with this alternative \nminimum tax situation.\n  Under the tests I have laid out, the Democratic budget number does \nnot accommodate their own tax priorities. We have all of these Democrat \nproposals before us. We have all the bipartisan proposals, some of them \nactually having been voted on by both Houses of Congress. These are all \nideas that everybody wants passed. But the number put forth for tax \nreduction by the other political party will not accommodate all the \nideas they propose. I know there are a lot of people on the other side \nof the aisle, such as Senator Breaux, who know this.\n  I think those who have proposed numbers in the range between $2 \ntrillion and $4 trillion are also pushing a wrong number. Most of those \npeople are on my side of the aisle or, if not in the Senate, in the \nHouse of Representatives. That tax cut number does not\n\n[[Page S3426]]\n\nbalance our priorities of paying down the debt and targeted spending \nincreases.\n  I believe this brings us back to a low Democratic number that doesn't \neven accomplish all the tax policy they want adopted. The other extreme \nis people saying $1.6 trillion is not enough, it ought to be up near \n$2.5 trillion. This brings us to the point of President Bush's number \nthat he proposed as being very appropriate. It is not appropriate just \nbecause President Bush proposed it. It is appropriate because it will \nallow us--particularly the Senate Finance Committee--to accommodate the \nbipartisan tax cut priorities that are before us.\n\n  Senator Breaux's number is better than the Democratic number because \nit allows more tax cuts to be addressed. It is, however, not enough--it \ndoes not provide enough flexibility for the Senate Finance Committee to \ndo its work. Unlike the Democratic number, though, Senator Breaux's \nnumber might be enough to cover Democratic priorities, plus a little \nbit more. But it would ignore the President's priorities. In \nconsidering the number, I want to give you my angle, as Chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee. Senator Baucus and I need the full $1.6 \ntrillion to make the tax cuts that all of the Members of Congress are \ninterested in doing and may have voted on.\n  I think that many in this body are looking at the 1.6 trillion number \nin terms of a win or a loss for President Bush, rather than whether it \nis the right policy. Many Republicans are tending to look at the \nnumber, or anything higher, as a win for the President. Democrats are \nlooking at anything less than the number as a loss for President Bush. \nSenator Conrad and Senator Daschle have been explicit in their \nobjective. They have worked very hard to try to defeat the President's \ntax cut.\n  Let me give you an example. I just talked to my staff on a piece of \nlegislation that I am trying to get budget authority for. I had 20 \nDemocrats lined up for the Family Opportunity Act--a bill that last \nyear had 78 cosponsors--and we are getting close to that number this \nyear. But we weren't taking the money for the bill out of the tax cut. \nSo the message went out: Don't help Grassley.\n  Now, thank God, the main leader on the other side in that effort who \nis working with me, Senator Kennedy, has assured me he is going to be \nwith me on what we ought to do. We are going to do the right thing. But \nthat is how desperate the other side is to make sure that there is some \nvictory of subtraction from the $1.6 trillion, just so the President \ncan be defeated. We have to look at the numbers, whatever those numbers \nare, in terms of the tax cut agenda that is out there, including the \nPresident's and our own.\n  So, Mr. President, when Senator Breaux's amendment comes up tomorrow, \nwhile it is well-intentioned, it just doesn't provide the Finance \nCommittee with the tools necessary to do the job of delivering \nbipartisan tax relief.\n  I want to take about 2 minutes--and then I will finish--on another \nitem related to the recent debate.\n  I was stimulated to give these remarks based upon the overuse of the \nword ``raiding''--the word ``raid'' or the word ``raiding''--like we \nare raiding the Medicare trust fund. I speak mostly about the \nleadership on the other side of the aisle. The manager for the \nDemocrats speaks very well and very clearly. But I want to focus his \nattention on Webster's Dictionary. So I want to speak to Senator Conrad \nand others who have suggested that the Domenici budget and the \namendments that we have adopted will raid the Medicare trust fund.\n  I understand how tempting it is to use such colorful language, but I \nwant to point out to my colleagues what the definition of the word \n``raid'' is. As I read from Webster's dictionary, it says, ``a sudden \nhostile attack by an armed, usually mounted, bandit intent on \nlooting.''\n  Well, I suppose we have to use some words from Sol Olinsky's school \nof political activism--which says that the more extreme you can be, the \nmore attention you are going to get. There are some people in this body \nwho have great aptitude in that respect. But, obviously, any people who \nstudy our budget process and who know what a Medicare trust fund is, or \nwhat any trust fund is, will know that no one is raiding the Medicare \ntrust fund. I will explain what is really going on.\n\n  Under the Domenici budget, Medicare will collect payroll taxes. Those \ntaxes will be credited to the balance in the trust fund. That balance \nwill be reserved for Medicare and is reserved only for Medicare. The \nMedicare trust fund is just like your bank account. When you make a \ndeposit, your bank account increases the balance in your account, and \nonly you can make a withdrawal from your own personal bank account.\n  Now, when Senator Conrad talks about raiding the Medicare trust fund, \nhe is trying to mislead us. He wants people to believe that we are \nreducing the balance in the Medicare trust fund for some other purpose. \nThat is just not true. The balance in the Medicare trust fund can only \nbe reduced to pay Medicare benefits. That is the law.\n  Our budget does nothing to change the law. Once you get past the \nrhetoric, you will see this debate is not about Medicare, it is about \ndebt reduction. In Senator Conrad's view, we have to use the Medicare \nsurplus to pay down the debt, or else we are raiding Medicare. Now, \ngoing back to the example of your own personal bank account, that is \nlike saying your bank has to use your deposit to pay off the bank's \nmortgage, or else it is raiding your bank account. As everybody who has \na bank account knows, that is clearly absurd because when you deposit \nmoney in your bank account, you rely on the bank's ability to collect \non its loans to repay your money. When the Government borrows from \nMedicare, we rely on the Government's ability to do one of three \nthings--raise taxes, reduce spending, or borrow from the public to \nrepay Medicare.\n  It might be easier to repay Medicare if we pay down the debt. But the \nfact is, we are already doing that, as you have heard so many times \nduring these three days of debate. Under our Domenici budget \nresolution, we are going to pay down every dollar of national debt that \ncan be paid down between now and the year 2001.\n  Now, I believe that Senator Conrad knows that is true. So that is why \nhe has stopped talking about public debt and he is now started talking \nabout long-term debt.\n  ``Reducing long-term debt'' is a secret code word for Social Security \nand Medicare reform. Of course, we have not been presented a plan to \nreform Social Security or Medicare from the other side of the aisle. As \na result, we can only conclude that once the Government runs out of \npublic debt to pay down, it will be forced to invest Social Security \nand Medicare funds in private assets.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that such \ninvestments will disrupt the financial market and reduce the efficiency \nof our economy. Chairman Greenspan is not the only one concerned about \nsuch investment. In fact, in 1999, the Senate voted 99-0 against \ninvesting Social Security money in private assets.\n  I suggest that instead of talking about our budget raiding Medicare, \nI believe the Senators on the other side of the aisle who use that word \nneed to explain their secret plan to reduce the long-term debt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my time be \nmarked against the general resolution and that I have 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I want to recognize the exemplary comments \nwe just heard from the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nGrassley. That is one of the most complete discussions I have heard on \nthe President's tax policy and how it impacts our total debt goals, \nactually what we call paying down the public debt and what we are going \nto do to save Medicare.\n  Anybody who listened closely fully understands the balance of the \nPresident's plan before us. I thought it was an extremely good speech, \nand I enjoyed listening to what he had to say.\n  I want to bring a little more discussion to some of the points he \nmade. For example, he talked about the advantage of small business. As \na small businessman, I want to talk about some of\n\n[[Page S3427]]\n\nmy thoughts about how cutting taxes really does help the economy.\n  Senator Grassley talked about paying down the debt. I also want to \ntake some time to talk about my experience in the Congress in efforts \nto pay down the debt and add my two bits' worth as to why I think the \nPresident is on the right track.\n  Just as the Presiding Officer of the Senate, I started my business \nfrom scratch. I know what it is to have to start a small business from \nscratch. I remember the frustration the first several years I was in \nbusiness. I began to build up some revenue. I wanted to do a good job \nof serving my clients as many small businesspeople do. They have a \ngreat idea and want to move forward.\n  At the end of the year, I found the capital I began to accumulate in \nmy business all of a sudden was taken away because of taxes.\n  That has a dramatic impact on the growth of a small business, \nparticularly at the early stage of growth and when they are starting.\n  Small businesspeople, such as myself and the Presiding Officer suffer \na disproportionate impact from rules, regulations, and taxes on our \nsmall business.\n  I point out to the Members of the Senate, most of the innovative \nideas in America and in democracy really start at the small business \nlevel. If we can put incentives out there that allow individual \nbusinesspeople to retain more of their income, to capitalize their \nbusinesses for growth, that means we create more jobs. The end result \nis that we begin to strengthen our economy.\n  I do believe these tax cuts will help the economy, and if we make the \ntax cuts even retroactive starting at the first of the year when they \nbegin to have an impact even on the paycheck that goes home, it will \nhelp us.\n  I encourage Members of the Senate to work hard to put in place the \n$1.6 trillion tax cut that is proposed by the President.\n  Let me talk a little bit about my experiences in trying to pay down \nthe debt. I probably have worked harder than any Member of the House or \nthe Senate to try to put in place a plan to pay down the debt. When I \nfirst brought a plan forward, I was a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, and as a Member of the Senate I introduced several \nplans.\n  When I was first elected to the Senate, I introduced a bill to pay \ndown the debt within 30 years. I had a plan somewhat similar to an \namortization schedule. I had a schedule of how we would pay down more \nmoney each year so that, over a 30-year period, the Federal Government \nwould have paid down the debt. That was 4 years ago.\n  Two years ago, I looked at the amount of revenue coming in to the \nFederal Government, and I was amazed. So I introduced a bill that had a \nplan to pay down the debt within 20 years.\n  What I see now is that we are going to be able to pay down the public \ndebt within 10 years and still be able to have the $1.6 trillion tax \ncut the President is proposing.\n  That is a reasonable plan he has put together. He is taking a quarter \nof the surpluses for tax cuts. It is reasonable and certainly a much \nbetter proposal than what I hear coming from the Democratic side where \nthey want to take $60 billion and redistribute it to everybody. The \nPresident's proposal is that those people who pay taxes are the ones \nwho will get a tax cut.\n  With the $60 billion plan on the other side, they are talking about a \nredistribution of income, so everybody gets a rebate, whether you pay \ntaxes or not. It ends up being a massive redistribution income plan \nbasically.\n  What we need to pass in the Senate is a real tax cut plan that gives \na tax cut to the American taxpayer.\n  I remind Members of the Senate and Americans who might be watching \nright now that a record amount of their dollars is being sent to \nWashington. We saw some figures presented on the other side which \nindicated that as a percentage of gross domestic product, GDP, our tax \nburden is as low as it ever has been, but the growth in our gross \ndomestic product has been so phenomenal for the last 5, 7, 8 years that \nany figure one compares to the gross domestic product is going to look \nlow in comparison.\n  I prefer to look at actual figures. Looking at the actual figures--\nthe amount of money being sent to Washington--the American taxpayer is \nsending a record amount of money to Washington, DC.\n  When we look at the plan that is being proposed by the President, it \nis a very modest tax cut. As was pointed out in testimony before the \nBudget Committee and other speeches made on the Senate floor, President \nKennedy had a greater tax cut than this tax cut. President Reagan's tax \ncut was greater. In fact, as was pointed out by my colleague from Iowa, \nthe largest tax increase in the history of this country, which was in \n1993, with a Democrat Congress and Democrat President, was more than \nthe tax cut that is being proposed by President George W. Bush.\n  We have to keep in mind that when taxpayers send money to Washington \nand then we have some sort of scheme where it is sent back to the \ntaxpayers, one might want to call it a grant or maybe call it a rebate \nor revenuesharing or earned-income tax credits or just a gift. The fact \nis, when you send your money to Washington and we send it back, there \nis a passenger charge. The subtle message is somehow or another it is \nthe Government's money. In reality, it is the taxpayers' dollars. That \nis where it starts. They are the ones who originally send the money to \nWashington.\n  We need to institute a policy that recognizes hard work and \nproductivity of the American taxpayers.\n  I also point out that some of the phenomenal growth we are getting in \nrevenues to the Federal Government is a consequence of having reduced \nthe capital gains tax a couple years back. When you reduce the capital \ngains tax, historically the revenues to the Federal Government have \nalways increased. We have reduced capital gains rates from 28 percent \nto 20 percent. What happened? We opened the floodgates of commerce.\n  With these new dollars coming into the Federal Government from more \ncommerce, you end up having more revenue. I think that is a tax cut. It \nhas been taxpayers who got that advantage. The result is more revenue \nis coming to the Federal Government. I don't think we have recognized \nthat phenomenon enough on the Senate floor, and I want to take a moment \nto point that out.\n  The proposal being suggested by the President is a very balanced \nproposal. I think it has the right amount of tax cuts. I think it \naddresses debt reduction.\n  Now, on debt reduction, as I have looked at the issue of how much you \ncan pay down the debt when you get down to the bottom trillion \ndollars--that is a lot of money still--there are some fundamental \nissues at which this Congress needs to look.\n  For example, in some of the testimony we had before the Budget \nCommittee, the Fed, in managing the money supply of this country, uses \ndebt. There is about $500 billion they use to manage that debt. If we \nare to completely pay down the debt, there has to be a fundamental \ndiscussion as to what you want the role of the Federal Government to \nbe. Do you want the Fed to still have that ability to manage the supply \nof the dollar? If you want that, we will have to keep some debt in \nthere so they can manage it. If you want to turn the dollar completely \nfree on the market without any opportunity for the Fed to regulate \nsupply, then perhaps the proper solution is to go ahead and pay the \ndebt even further. That is a basic fundamental public policy that I \nthink needs to be discussed in the Congress. I think we need to have \nsome discussion among ourselves about how important that is.\n  For some people who don't want to turn in their war bonds or their \nTreasury notes--they have become a collector's item--we find it is \ncosting more today to pay down, in some cases, perhaps as much as 43 \npercent more than the value of the bond to retire.\n  The President, again, I think has a right balance on tax relief, on \ndebt reduction. He takes care of basic needs, which I think can be \nsupported. He has overall spending for the 10 years at 4.7 percent. He \nhas very significant increases in education in 2002, an 11.5-percent \nincrease, a significant increase in defense, 4.5. We passed an \namendment here that provides another $8.5 billion for that. He has \nincreases for\n\n[[Page S3428]]\n\nhealth. I supported doubling NIH research dollars. There is money in \nthere for transportation and veterans health.\n  I think this is a good budget. It is a good starting place. I am \ndisappointed today we chipped away at some of that tax cut. I think \nthat means there will be less opportunity for economic growth for \npeople, particularly in the small business sector, who look for a \nreduction in the burden of taxes in order to be able to grow their \nbusiness and to create jobs.\n  I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator \nStevens, for allowing me to speak. This is an important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask my remarks be charged similarly to those of the \nSenator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3428-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN MEMORY OF SENATOR JOHN HEINZ\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, 10 years ago today Pennsylvania lost a \ngreat U.S. Senator, America lost a future President, and I lost a very \ndear friend. On April 4, 1991, Senator John Heinz was tragically killed \nin an airplane crash. He was not only a close personal friend. I was \nchairman of the campaign committee when he was elected. We sat by each \nother on the floor for years. We traveled together. We fished for blues \ntogether off Nantucket. And we worked on many issues together in the \nSenate.\n  Tonight I make these few comments in remembrance of my colleague. \nJohn Heinz was an extraordinary man. A person of great personal wealth, \nhe was a Senator who cared dearly and deeply about average men and \nwomen, a Senator that fought to tear down antiquated age discrimination \nlaws which failed to recognize and value the importance of older \nworkers, a Senator who championed trade relief and adjustment for \nworking men and women, as well as business, who fought any \nadministration to ensure that workers hurt by our trade laws would not \nbe victims of poverty or despair, a Senator who clearly recognized that \nour Nation's Medicare program was in desperate need of overhaul. But he \nknew his colleagues on each side of the aisle were not then, and are \nstill not today, prepared to fix Medicare.\n  He was a Senator who believed we could address the myriad of \nenvironmental concerns of our Nation while still maintaining a balanced \nrecognition of America's needs for resources and business development, \nand a Senator who cared deeply and loved his family.\n  John Heinz left three sons and a marvelous wife, Teresa. Tonight, I \nbelieve John Heinz looks down upon his family and, with that big smile \nhe had which so many of us remember, he must be very, very proud. His \nfamily has continued his commitment to his values. John Heinz IV has \nstarted a school to help children who are on the verge of being \ndiscarded by the public school system realize their value and \nimportance and that people really do care about them. Andre Heinz is \npursuing his environmental interests advocacy by helping businesses \nacross the globe understand how they and the environment can coexist \nand in many instances make larger returns for investors and working men \nand women. Christopher Heinz is finishing his MBA degree at the same \nschool from which his father graduated. Christopher is likely to follow \na business path, as his father did when Jack left Harvard.\n  But his greatest untold story, the untold story of the family, \nconcerns Jack Heinz's wife, partner, spirit, and true love. Teresa \nHeinz is a personal friend of mine and my wife Catherine, someone we \nhave known for many years. ``Extraordinary'' is the word I use to \ndescribe Teresa. Following John's death, she assumed the helm of the \nmany Heinz family philanthropies and has nurtured them since then. They \nwere among the most innovative and pioneering foundations in this \nNation.\n  Teresa made sure that none of us forgets John or the visionary work \nhe was pursuing by ensuring the Heinz family philanthropies and the \nHoward Heinz Foundation and endowment continue the pioneering work \nstarted by my friend, Jack Heinz. To honor Jack, Teresa created the \nHeinz Awards in 1993, a program to remember Jack, as Teresa said then, \n``in a way that would inspire not just me, but the rest of us.'' When \nshe announced the program, Teresa explained:\n\n       I view the Heinz Awards in a sense as the awards of the \n     21st century because they recognize the very qualities we \n     must embrace if we are to create the sort of future we would \n     want to live in. . . . The Heinz Awards will measure \n     achievements but also intentions.\n\n  I gave the first of those Heinz Awards to Andy Grove to show just how \nimportant they have been to our economy.\n  In 1996 Teresa tested in Pittsburgh her idea on how best to ensure \nearly childhood education development was not just talked about but \nactually pursued. With a coalition of business leaders, the Heinz \nendowments launched Teresa's early childhood initiative, called ECI, to \nbegin to tackle the issues of early childhood education and make sure \nthat no family was left behind. In 1998 Teresa founded the Women's \nInstitute to secure retirement, called WISER, to ensure that women, \nwhether they work in or out of the home, would understand pension and \nretirement issues. Through a partnership with Good Housekeeping \nmagazine, a magazine and supplement entitled ``What Every Woman Needs \nto Know About Money and Retirement,'' women are better able to be \ninformed and educated on how to prepare for their financial \nfuture. That supplement has reached more than 25 million readers and is \navailable in English, Chinese, Portuguese, and Spanish today.\n\n  Perhaps the most notable is the work that Theresa has done to help \nexplain to legislators at the State and Federal levels, Jack Heinz's \nvision which he articulated, by the way, more than 14 years ago, that \nwe need to make available a prescription drug benefit to all people 65 \nand over.\n  Through her work at Heinz family philanthropies, Terry has \nspearheaded an effort to help legislators understand this complex issue \nand how States can design solutions to solve this problem--now reaching \na crisis state in our country. Dubbed HOPE, the Heinz plan to meet \nprescription expenses is used by many States such as Massachusetts, \nMaine, Mississippi, and Pennsylvania, which work with the foundation on \nstrategies to provide prescription drugs for the elderly.\n  That is perhaps the best example of what I believe is the spirit of \nJohn Heinz, designing a blueprint to help States determine whether and \nhow they can and whether they will address such a crisis.\n  Because of Theresa Heinz, the Heinz Family Foundation pursues efforts \nto keep Jack's spirit and vision alive. That is why I am here. And for \nthat, each of us should be grateful. I personally thank her for all she \nhas done.\n  Mr. President, John Heinz, as I said, was my friend. In my own way, I \ncelebrate his spirit each day when I walk on the Senate floor. He is no \nlonger with us in person, but his spirit, his vision, and his \nunrelenting belief in hope lives with all of us.\n  I am proud to have known this man, John Heinz, and I am proud he was \nmy friend. To Theresa, I send this message: Jack's spirit is right here \non the Senate floor. Be assured we will never, ever forget who he was, \nwhat he stood for, or his dream for America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3428-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, 10 years ago today a tragic accident \noccurred in the Philadelphia suburbs claiming the life of a very \ndistinguished United States Senator. In addition, two 6-year-old girls \nwere killed at the Marion Elementary School, as well as four pilots who \nwere in charge of two aircraft which collided in suburban \nPhiladelphia--a small charter plane carrying Senator Heinz from \nWilliamsport, PA, with the destination of Philadelphia, and two pilots \non a Sun Oil helicopter which had attempted to observe the landing gear \nof the small private plane, which, according to the dashboard, were not \nin place.\n  Those two planes collided in midair resulting in the deaths, as I \nsay, of the\n\n[[Page S3429]]\n\nfour pilots and wounding many on the ground, including one young man \nwho had 68 percent of his body covered with burns, and the deaths of \ntwo 6-year-old girls, and it was a fatal accident for Senator Heinz.\n  Senator Heinz had an illustrious career in the Congress of the United \nStates. I first met him in 1971 when he was running for the seat of \nformer Congressman Robert Corbin, who had died. And Elsie Hillman, the \nmatriarch of Pennsylvania politics, and a leading figure nationally, \nhad asked me to come be a speaker for a John Heinz fundraiser in her \nhome.\n  I was then the district attorney of Philadelphia. I recall very well \nmeeting this good-looking young man who was 32 years old, soon to be \nelected to the House of Representatives, and saw him in one of his \nmaiden speeches charm the crowd and move on to the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  My next extensive contact with John Heinz was in the 1976 primary \nelection where we squared off in what was a traditional Pennsylvania \nbattle of east versus west. I was no longer the district attorney but \nhad a significant following within the metropolitan area in eastern \nPennsylvania, and John Heinz was the ``Zion'' of the west. It looked \npromising for a while when Philadelphia came in 10 to 1 in my favor and \nthen United Press International declared me the winner at 1:30. But \nAllegheny County and some of the western counties came in as much as 15 \nto 1. This was a very close vote by 2.6 percent. With 26,000 votes out \nof a million cast, John Heinz became the U.S. Senator following the \n1976 election at the age of 38.\n  He was a very distinguished Senator, as the record shows. He had a \nplace on the Finance Committee. He had a place on the Banking \nCommittee. He was chairman of the Aging Committee. It was rumored that \nhe intended to run for Governor of Pennsylvania in 1994, and that he \nhad aspirations for the White House. Of course, those potentialities \nwere snuffed out by his untimely death.\n  John Heinz had unlimited political potential and was really one of \nthe rising stars on the American political scene. His death left an \nenormous void in Pennsylvania politics, in American politics, and in \nthe Senate.\n  I had seen him just the day before when we were in Altoona, PA, \ntogether. We were speaking at a lunch for the hospital association and \nhad become very good friends after our tough primary battle which had \noccurred some 15 years before. Senator Hugh Scott and his \nadministrative assistant, Bob Kunsic, had counseled John and me when he \nwas elected to the Senate in 1980, that together we wouldn't be twice \nas strong but we would be four times as strong.\n  I used to drive John Heinz home. We both lived in Georgetown--he in a \nmansion and I in a condominium. In the early 1980s, Senator Baker used \nto work us very late, as did Senator Dole, and then Senator Byrd and \nthen Senator Mitchell, our majority leaders. I would drive him home in \nthe wee hours of the morning. And sometimes after 1 a.m., after one of \nthose 20-hour days, we would sit and talk in his back alley before he \nentered his home, and we called it an end to the day.\n  The day before he died, I had Joan with me. I called her Blondie, \nwhich I do from time to time, and he was surprised. The last words I \nheard John Heinz say was, ``Does she call you Dagwood?'' I said, ``No, \nshe doesn't, John.''\n  But in memory of John Heinz there have been many posthumous \nrecognitions. The most important of all are the Heinz Awards, \nestablished by his then-widow Teresa Heinz, with very substantial \nendowments in five categories which were of greatest importance to John \nHeinz. They were: First, arts and humanities; second, environment; \nthird, human condition; fourth, public policy; and, fifth, technology, \nthe economy, and employment.\n  John Heinz left behind three extraordinary sons, Henry John IV, \nAndre, and Christopher. Hardly a day goes by that I don't think of John \nHeinz and the great contributions he made to the United States Senate.\n  I am advised that once a Member has been gone for 10 years, the \nMember is then eligible to have a stamp named after him. I am sure \nthere will be many awards given to John Heinz. Already the numbers are \nsignificant, with the John Heinz Pittsburgh Regional History Center; \nthe H. John Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment; \nthe H. John Heinz, III School of Public Policy and Management at \nCarnegie Mellon University; the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at \nTinicum; and the H.J. Heinz Department of Veterans Affairs Medical \nCenter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3429-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CAPTAIN WILL BROWN\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor Captain \nWill Brown, United States Navy, as he retires upon completion of over \n26 years of honorable and faithful service to our nation.\n  A native of Queens, New York, Captain Brown joined the Navy in 1975. \nA career Supply Officer, he began his service as the Sales Officer \naboard USS GUAM, LPH-9, followed by a shore assignment at Naval \nAviation Technical Training Center, Lakehurst, New Jersey. Captain \nBrown returned to sea as the Supply Officer aboard USS BARNEY, DDG-6, \nand then served as the Combat Systems Analyst at Commander, Naval \nSurface Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. Following graduation from the Naval \nWar College, he was the Director of Consumable Logistics Management on \nthe Chief of Naval Operations Staff followed by an assignment as \nDirector of Repairables at Naval Supply Systems Command, Mechanicsburg, \nPennsylvania. Captain Brown was then selected for the prestigious \nposition of Executive Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy \nfor Financial Management in Washington, DC. Following a successful tour \nof duty, he next reported to the Navy Office of Legislative Affairs as \nCongressional Liaison for Readiness Programs. Captain Brown was then \nchosen to serve as a senior Supply Officer onboard USS PUGET SOUND, AD-\n38. Recognized for his sustained outstanding leadership and \norganizational skills, Captain Brown was then selected to serve as the \nSenior Analyst on the Department of the Navy's Organization, Management \nand Infrastructure Team.\n  Returning to a position working with our nation's lawmakers, Captain \nBrown was handpicked to serve as Director of the Naval Programs \nDivision, Navy Office of Legislative Affairs. In this capacity he was a \nmajor asset to the Navy, Marine Corps, and Congress and has been \nconsidered a valued advisor to the very top echelons of the Navy and \nCongress. His consummate leadership and integrity ensured that Naval \nprograms were appropriate, understood, and well communicated. A role \nmodel and mentor to those who worked for and with him, he made his \nimpact on people as well as programs. Through his brilliant insight and \ndedication, he directly contributed to the future readiness of the \nUnited States Navy and this nation.\n  Captain Brown's distinguished awards include the Legion of Merit, the \nMeritorious Service Medal, the Navy Commendation Medal, the Navy \nAchievement Medal, the Sea Service Ribbon, Battle ``E'' Ribbon, Navy \nMeritorious Unit Commendation and the Navy Unit Commendation.\n  The Department of the Navy, the Congress, and the American people \nhave been defended and well served by this dedicated naval officer for \nover 26 years. Captain Will Brown will long be remembered for his \nleadership, service and dedication. He will be missed. We wish Will, \nand his lovely wife Phyllis, our very best as they begin a new chapter \nin their life together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3429-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3429-S3430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EQUAL PAY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, yesterday, Equal Pay Day, marked the day \nthis year when women's median earnings for 2000 and 2001 to date, catch \nup with what men earned last year.\n  It is disgraceful that hard-working women and people of color are \nstill battling wage disparities and pay discrimination on the job. \nThere is a wealth of evidence that shows that the wage gap still \ncontinues to plague American families, and that wage discrimination \ncontinues to be a serious and pervasive problem in workplaces across \nthe country. In spite of the progress we have made, women still earn \nonly 76 cents for every dollar earned by men. African American\n\n[[Page S3430]]\n\nwomen earn just 64 cents, and Latinos earn only 54 cents for every \ndollar earned by white men.\n  I have long supported the Equal Pay Act, which was signed into law 37 \nyears ago by President Kennedy, and believe that the wage gap in the \nUnited States is unconscionable. Women and people of color should not \nbe treated as second class citizens when it comes to pay. But not \neveryone shares my view. I was deeply troubled to learn this week that \nDiana Furchtgott-Roth, one of the strongest and most vigorous opponents \nto equal pay, was newly named as Chief of Staff to the Council for \nEconomic Advisors.\n  These pay disparities translate into large costs in lost wages and \nlost opportunity. The average working woman loses $4,200 in earnings \nannually, and suffers a loss of $420,000 over her career. This gender \ngap has a long-term impact, since lower wages and lower lifetime \nearnings lead to lower pension benefits in retirement. The median \npension benefit received by new female retirees is less than half that \nof the benefits received by men.\n  While some critics argue that the differences in pay are based on \ndifferent levels of education, years in the workforce, occupational \ndifferences and similar factors, these factors alone do not explain \naway the wage gap. Studies have found substantial pay differences \nbetween men and women even when these factors are held constant. In \nfact, women now surpass men in the percentage of those earning a \ncollege or advanced degree, but college-educated women working full-\ntime earn almost $28,000 less annually than college-educated men. An \nAfrican American woman with a master's degree earns $29,000 less \nannually than a college-educated white male. An Hispanic female with a \nbachelor's degree makes only $872 more than a white male with only a \nhigh school degree.\n  Pay discrimination is not just a women's problem, it's a family \nproblem. The wage gap costs America's families $200 billion a year. \nNearly two-thirds of working women report that they provide half or \nmore of their family income. In addition, nearly one in five U.S. \nfamilies is headed by a single woman, yet these women continue to earn \nthe lowest average rate of pay. Women are entitled to the same \npaychecks as their male colleagues who are performing the same or \ncomparable work. Without pay equality, women are less able to provide \nan economic safety net for themselves and their families.\n  If married women were paid fairly, their family incomes would rise by \nnearly six percent, and their families' poverty rates would fall from \n2.1 percent to 0.8 percent. If single working mothers were paid fairly, \ntheir incomes would rise by 17 percent, and their poverty rates would \nbe reduced from 25.3 percent to 12.6 percent. These figures demonstrate \nthe staggering effects of these unfair pay disparities on the lives of \nwomen and their families.\n  The equal pay provisions of the Democratic leadership bill would \ntoughen the Equal Pay Act by providing more effective remedies for \nwomen denied equal pay for equal work, allowing prevailing plaintiffs \nto recover compensatory and punitive damages. It also eliminates \nloopholes that employers use to evade the law, authorizes additional \ntraining for enforcement agencies to better handle wage disputes, and \nprovides for the study of pay dynamics in the U.S. labor market to \nbetter understand the pay inequity problem. Finally, the bill forbids \nemployers from prohibiting employees from disclosing their wages to co-\nworkers, thereby making it easier for workers to evaluate whether their \nrights are being violated.\n  Congress should pass these equal pay provisions. It is unacceptable \nfor women and people of color to work hard and yet be denied fair \ncompensation. These disparities are particularly alarming, because they \npersist 37 years after the Equal Pay Act was first enacted and at a \ntime when our nation has been enjoying unprecedented prosperity. It's \nthe right thing to do, and the fair thing to do, for working families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3430-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3430-S3431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CERTIFICATION OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today I extend my congratulations to \nPresident Vojislav Kostunica, Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic and the \nGovernment of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on their courageous \nactions this past weekend in arresting former Yugoslav dictator \nSlobodan Milosevic. This important and encouraging development \nunderscores Belgrade's commitment to making real and significant \nprogress on certification requirements as outlined in the fiscal year \n2001 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act.\n  For Belgrade, arresting Milosevic was an important factor in their \nability to achieve certification by the U.S. Therefore, I am pleased \nwith the decision of President Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell \nto grant certification to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FRY. I \nshare their view that the Government of the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia has met the requirements for certification outlined by \nCongress last year, and I fully believe they will continue to make \nprogress in these areas well beyond March 31.\n  It is clear that the government in Belgrade has taken some difficult \nsteps in recent weeks to further democratize. The presence of hundreds \nof pro-Milosevic demonstrators rallying outside of Milosevic's villa \nover the weekend showed that opponents to democratic reform in the \nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia still exist. Despite those who remain in \nopposition, it is critical that President Kostunica's government stand \nstrong in its efforts to promote democracy. To help in that regard, I \nbelieve that the United States should continue to support those in the \nFRY who are committed to a new era of peace, stability and democracy in \nthe Balkans.\n  As one who has a lengthy personal history with southeastern Europe, I \nwas pleased with the certification announcement by the State \nDepartment. To me, it was rivaled only by the excitement I felt at the \nfinal outcome of the presidential elections in the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia last fall which brought Vojislav Kostunica to the \npresidency. For years, I had worked to bring about democratic changes \nin the FRY working with opposition leaders to Slobodan Milosevic in \ndiaspora. Since coming to the Senate, I have made a handful of visits \nto the region to get first-hand perspectives on the situation in the \nBalkans and I have visited and remain in contact with a number of top \npolitical leaders including President Kostunica, Serbian Prime Minister \nZoran Djindjic and U.S. Ambassador to the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia, William Montgomery. I also have my ``ear to the ground'' \nvia e-mail that I receive on a regular basis from a couple of retired \nmembers of the Ohio State Highway Patrol who are now serving as police \nofficers in the United Nations' international police force in Kosovo. \nNeedless to say, I pay attention to what is happening in the region.\n  To help support the new government of Dr. Kostunica, and as an \nincentive for Belgrade to make needed democratic changes, last October \nCongress approved $100 million in assistance for Serbia in the fiscal \nyear 2001 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. To obtain these funds \nafter March 31, and ensure access to international financial \ninstitutions such as the IMF and World Bank, the fiscal year 2001 \nForeign Operations bill outlined three certification requirements on \nthe part of President Kostunica's new government: respect for the rule \nof law and human rights; implementation of the Dayton Accords; and \ncooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \nYugoslavia.\n  As I indicated to Secretary of State Colin Powell when I spoke with \nhim last week, I believe the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has \ncomplied with the spirit of the law outlined by Congress last year. The \nrecent record of the Kostunica/Djindjic government is very positive, \nand it is my view that they have made considerable progress in all \nthree areas outlined in the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act.\n  Regarding the rule of law, governments at both the Federal and the \nRepublic levels in the FRY have taken steps to uphold human rights for \nminorities, particularly in southern Serbia. Deputy Prime Minister of \nSerbia Nebojsa Covic has worked to give ethnic Albanians in Serbia more \ncontrol over their local governments and municipalities. During visits \nto Capitol Hill 2 weeks ago, Prime Minister\n\n[[Page S3431]]\n\nDjindjic indicated that the Serbian Government now includes minorities. \nU.S. Ambassador Montgomery has indicated in conversations we have had \nthat President Kostunica and Deputy Prime Minister Covic have worked \nwell together to make progress on this front, and the Ambassador has \nbeen encouraged by the results that he has seen.\n  Further human rights progress can be witnessed in the freeing of \nKosovo Albanian prisoners. On February 26, the Serb parliament passed \nan amnesty law granting amnesty to more than 100 Kosovar Albanians held \nin Serb prisons. Since the end of the war in 1999, more than 1,500 of \n2,000 ethnic Albanian prisoners have been released. While I believe the \nremaining 500 should be quickly released, especially the Djakovica \ngroup, there has been substantial progress in this area.\n  Regarding implementation of the Dayton Accords, the Federal Republic \nof Yugoslavia and the Republika Srpska have entered into a special \nrelations agreement between the two which makes Belgrade's assistance \nto the RS military consistent with the Dayton Accords. In addition, \nPresident Kostunica has, on a number of occasions, publically declared \nhis support for the Dayton Accords, the peace agreement reached at the \nend of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the FRY and Bosnia have \nestablished diplomatic relations. Prime Minister Djindjic also \nindicated to me during our meeting that the government will cut off \npensions to RS army officers.\n  Regarding cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, President Kostunica's \ngovernment has reopened a War Crimes Tribunal office in Belgrade, and \nthe government helped to facilitate the extradition to the Hague of \nindicted war criminals Blagoje Simic and Milomir Stakic. In addition, \nafter Justice Minister of the FRY Momcilo Grubac and Serbian Justice \nMinister Vladan Batic met with the Chief Prosecutor of the Hague, Carla \nDel Ponte, she described their talks as a sign of ``good progress.'' \nWhen I met with Ms. Del Ponte following the Presidential elections last \nSeptember, she indicated that the cooperation of the new government, \nnot custody of Milosevic himself, was the Tribunal's first priority. \nPresident Kostunica's government has taken a number of additional steps \nin this area, drafting a memo of understanding on how the government \nwill cooperate with the Hague and writing a new measure to change the \ncurrent law in the FRY that prohibits citizens from being extradited. \nThe arrest of Milosevic on Sunday, April 1, is an additional factor \nillustrating the government's commitment to following through with its \npromises to take action and cooperate with the Tribunal.\n\n  I cannot overstate the importance of the Bush administration's \ndecision to grant certification to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. \nBy doing so, they have allowed the FRY government access to much-needed \nsupport from the IMF, World Bank and international financial \ninstitutions. This will help the government deal with a staggering \nnumber of outstanding and pressing emergency situations. For instance: \nthe country's economy is failing, there is ongoing violence in the \nPresevo Valley, there is a nationwide energy crisis complete with \nrolling blackouts, there are calls for an independent Montenegro led by \nMontenegro's President Djukanovic, and they still have 800,000 refugees \nfrom Croatia and Bosnia, and 200,000 refugees from Kosovo.\n  President Kostunica and Prime Minister Djindjic are in a fragile \npolitical situation, which demands that they proceed with caution in \ntheir democratic reform efforts, especially with regard to Milosevic. \nSerb radical parties, including those with ties to Slobodan Milosevic, \nVojislav Seselj and Zeljko ``Arkan'' Raznatovic, claimed nearly 30 \npercent of the vote in the December 2000 parliamentary elections, and \nthe coalition government is partly dependent on the inclusion of the \nMontenegrin Socialist Peoples Party, led by Predrag Bulatovic, who also \nback Milosevic. Outside the realm of government, there are some Serbs \nwho would like to see the United States walk away from the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia due to anti-American sentiment following the \n1999 bombing campaign.\n  As I came to the decision to recommend certification, I carefully \nconsidered the political realities with which the new FRY government is \nfaced. These realities became especially clear last weekend as \nMilosevic supporters, including members of the Serb Parliament, rallied \noutside of Milosevic's villa to protest his arrest. In my view, and in \nthe view of many who follow what goes on in the Balkans, President \nKostunica and his government offer a remarkable opportunity for \nbeneficial change in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. While they \nhave only been in office a short time, Dr. Kostunica has been President \nfor 6 months, while Prime Minister Djindjic and the Parliament in \nSerbia have been in office for just 2 months, I have positive feelings \nabout the direction they are leading the nation.\n  The qualified certification of the FRY guarantees that the United \nStates still has leverage over the FRY if they fail to make good on \ntheir certification requirements. As the Bush Administration has \nindicated, U.S. support for an international donors' conference, \nscheduled to take place this summer, is contingent upon the FRY's \ncontinued cooperation with the Hague. Congress has additional funding \nleverage that may be exercised in the fiscal year 2002 appropriations \nprocess, as well as its oversight and approval authority of the State \nDepartment's spending plans in the FRY.\n  In closing, I applaud the progress that has been made in the FRY \nduring this historic period of democratic transition. I am pleased that \nPresident Bush has chosen to recognize the efforts that President \nKostunica has undertaken to move towards democracy by continuing U.S. \nassistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

Mr. President, I commend an initiative in my State that I \nam quite proud of.\n  I have stood on this floor many, many times over the past 28 years to \nlaud people, programs, and events in Delaware. There is one statistic \nin my State, however, that I am not fond of repeating, but it is a sad \nfact that we must, and are, confronting: Delaware has one of the \nhighest breast cancer death rates in the country.\n  Having said that, I want to commend the efforts of a special group of \npeople who are determined to raise awareness about breast cancer and \nsave more lives.\n  A couple weeks ago, a Wilmington salon, ``Chez Nicole,'' hosted a \nunique event to raise money for breast cancer. A couple hundred women \npacked this hair and manicuring salon on Sunday, March 4th. The owners, \nNicole Testa and Joe Cannatelli, father and daughter, opened their \nbusiness doors and offered the services of their two dozen employees, \nall free of charge. Nicole's husband, Ken Testa, was by her side the \nentire day also. The bottom line: More than $14,000 was raised to fight \nbreast cancer.\n  The Biden Breast Health Initiative is a program designed to educate \nyoung women across Delaware on the importance of proper breast health \nand the life-saving importance of early detection of breast cancer.\n  Awareness and early detection are the best defenses in fighting \nbreast cancer mortality, and for these measures to be most effective, \nthey must be raised among young women.\n  Delaware has ranked, consistently and dismally, number one, two or \nthree nationwide in breast cancer mortality rates over the past ten \nyears.\n  The Biden Breast Health Initiative Committee found that ranking to be \nsimply unacceptable for women, especially for a State as generally \nprogressive as Delaware.\n  Since its inception, the ``breast health for teens'' program has been \npresented to many thousands of young women in nearly every high school \nin Delaware, both public and private.\n  But it takes more than the hard work of highly motivated volunteers \nto make a program like this work as well as it has, it also takes \nmoney.\n  All educational and support materials provided for the program are \nfinanced through fundraisers the committee holds annually, no taxpayer \ndollars are used to fund any aspect of the program.\n\n[[Page S3432]]\n\n  The funds raised at the ``Chez Nicole'' event will be used to reach \neven more high school students and purchase supplies for the ``breast \nhealth for teens'' program. The money also is needed to train school \nnurses and health teachers on how to help young women maintain breast \nhealth throughout their life time.\n  I am proud to commend the generosity of Nicole Testa and Joe \nCannatelli and their ``Chez Nicole'' team for their commitment to \nhelping the Biden Breast Health Initiative educate more young women \nabout breast cancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3432-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HIGHER EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to your \nattention an editorial written by Dr. Harold (Hal) Raveche, president \nof Stevens Institute of Technology that appeared in the Boston Sunday \nGlobe on February 18, 2001. Dr. Raveche is a highly respected \nacademician. His recent Boston Globe editorial discusses the need to \nchange our higher education system to reflect the changing dynamics of \na high technology driven New Economy. Stevens is already teaching its \nstudents in a unique, different way called ``Technogenesis.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Raveche's editorial be printed in \nthe Record and urge my colleagues to give it thoughtful consideration.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  If High Schools can Change, Then why not Colleges? Higher Education \n             Largely the Same, Despite Technology Advances\n\n                         (By Harold J. Raveche)\n\n       College freshmen right out of high school are discovering \n     an amazing contradiction once they cross the threshold into \n     higher education: Colleges are far more expensive to attend, \n     yet offer an education style that is out of date and not even \n     up to par with what these kids experienced in high school.\n       President Bush's first week in office was dubbed education \n     week. If this is truly the case, his administration should \n     see that American colleges are offering students a century-\n     old model of education, still powered by complacency and \n     resistance to change, that lost its relevance nearly 30 years \n     ago. If American high schools and elementary schools were as \n     static as our colleges, the public would demand a major \n     revolution. Yet, colleges continue under systems that seem \n     impervious to change.\n       What's required is the breaking down of the walls that \n     separate the departments in a college, and collaboration \n     among the faculty, instead of the fiefdoms that are the rule. \n     And, it requires quite a bit of capital to retool the system.\n       The more advanced high schools have already done this, and \n     now colleges find themselves in the embarrassing position of \n     having their freshmen become bored quickly by old systems of \n     teaching that lack the excitement and challenge of what the \n     students found in their junior and senior years of secondary \n     schools. (This already occurs as the computer skills of \n     recent high school students surpass the information \n     technology sophistication of their college instructors. The \n     teaching of core subjects such as science, mathematics, and \n     writing has not changed for nearly a century. Computer \n     technologies have festooned teaching with many new bells and \n     whistles, but curriculums and content have remained largely \n     the same. No matter what endeavor future graduates choose, \n     they will increasingly face challenges that are inherently \n     interdisciplinary, involving the overlap of people, \n     technology, and global commerce. Yet, we continue to teach \n     courses as we did in 1900, clinging to the belief that we are \n     giving students critical thinking skills. But we aren't.\n       For example, topics in chemistry and physics, such as acid-\n     base equilibria, electronic structure, Newton's laws, and \n     Einstein's photoelectric effect are important concepts for \n     students to learn. But, must we teach these concepts in the \n     same static way? Can you imagine how many more students would \n     be turned on by science if they studied chemistry through the \n     learning of autoimmune diseases and how synthetic implants \n     become functioning parts of our bodies? Can you imagine \n     learning mechanics through bone and muscle functions? How \n     about teaching quantum physics illustrating how \n     semiconductors in Internet entertainment electronics work?\n       Further, can you imagine requiring writing assignments for \n     computer science and electrical engineering majors, where \n     papers were graded on content, grammar, and literary style? \n     Can you imagine having math, literature, and marketing majors \n     on the same learning team where their assignments include \n     organizing a presentation for faculty review? Such changes \n     would better prepare tomorrow's graduates.\n       Team-based learning prepares students to apply their \n     knowledge and skills in context. You are a recent graduate \n     with an economics degree who has just taken a job with a \n     technology start-up company. Your CEO hired you because of \n     your educational background, but she expects you to challenge \n     the assumptions of the inventor, design engineer, production \n     supervisor, and sales manager. Now, what do you do, because \n     in college you studied only with other economics majors and \n     hung out with your circle of friends? Had your college made \n     the commitment to having you learn, in part, through teams \n     consisting of students from different majors, you might be \n     better prepared.\n       Faculty members also benefit through such curriculum \n     changes because they are better able to assess the overall \n     capabilities of the university's students, whereas today the \n     evaluation of student progress is largely limited to areas of \n     specialization. In this way, faculty will understand the \n     cumulative impact on students of the university's various \n     academic requirements. Graduates, after all, are the product \n     of their total college experience. Beyond academe, it is well \n     understood that organizations thrive when their component \n     elements create synergy. This ``best practice'' applies to \n     colleges.\n       Is such innovation a fad? Perhaps, in the view of \n     traditionalists, I, rather, see these changes as the outcome \n     of a whole new approach to undergraduate education, one that \n     redefines instruction and collaboration according to how the \n     world is evolving. Some colleges may claim that they are \n     attempting change by adding new requirements to existing \n     courses of study. That's the problem--courses have been \n     inserted into yesterday's programs of study because of the \n     tugs of technology and other factors. Instead, we must \n     redesign our curriculums to advance our students.\n       Have you looked under the hood of your car lately? The \n     engine is not just the old one with a few new parts. The \n     former engines have been redesigned and technology is \n     everywhere. Change was necessary to meet environmental, cost, \n     and marketplace issues.\n       Specialists can't repair newer models without extensive \n     training, new knowledge, and skills. To develop new \n     curriculums, a very difficult task, faculty need training and \n     ample time.\n       Realizing the new vision for higher education will be \n     expensive. Faculty need opportunities to partner with faculty \n     in other departments, which means paid leaves, reduced \n     teaching loads, and incentives, particularly to engage \n     research-oriented faculty. Workshops are needed for faculty \n     and graduate teaching assistants, where outside \n     professionals, who see connection between technology, social \n     issues, and business, help shape the new curriculums.\n       Partnerships should include professionals beyond academe. \n     Ongoing input and instruction from accomplished members of \n     the private and government sectors will help ensure that \n     students learn in the context of what they will encounter \n     after graduation.\n       Classrooms with Internet access and new equipment are \n     needed so that faculty can creatively utilize resources \n     beyond the boundaries of their universities. New laboratories \n     are needed that they have equipment that enables students to \n     perform experiments beyond the traditional, narrowly focused \n     exercises in chemistry, physics, and biology labs. \n     Collaboration and innovation must be encouraged. In the \n     current system, faculty are rewarded for teaching in their \n     areas of specialization, research, and service. Faculty \n     should be recognized for collaboration on new courses that go \n     beyond their areas of expertise. How do you reward teamwork?\n       Policies are needed to minimize turf wars that will \n     inevitably arise if academic units fear that curriculum \n     redesign will cause the number of courses they teach to \n     decrease. Perhaps the most important step in ensuring success \n     is for the president to nurture the campus-wide mindset that \n     interdisciplinary and team-based learning will be rigorous \n     and subject to the highest standards of faculty scholarship.\n       Predictably, innovation will be accompanied by opinions, \n     from various quarters, that departure from the tried and true \n     will lower standards. On the contrary, by clinging to the \n     status quo, academic preeminence will slowly, but inevitably, \n     erode because changes in the world are outpacing \n     undergraduate education.\n       Employers are investing more in training college graduates. \n     It takes up to two years before recent graduates are able to \n     contribute at the level expected by their companies. \n     Shortcomings cited include people skills, ability to apply \n     knowledge, and adjusting to projects involving professionals \n     from different backgrounds and with different skill sets.\n       Each college and university has core values upon which \n     their education is built. Such values do not change with \n     time. However, using them as the foundation, institutions \n     must redesign their curriculums to give students the broadest \n     preparation for a world where traditional boundaries are \n     blurred and disappearing. Without such innovation, colleges \n     will be squeezed at both ends--high school seniors and \n     employers will be disappointed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3432-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3432-S3433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ANTI-SEMITISM\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise to make a statement on a \nmatter that troubles me deeply. I do so with considerable reluctance.\n\n[[Page S3433]]\n\n  It concerns a good friend of the United States, a country that for \ntwenty years has been one of the bedrocks upon which the search of \npeace in the Middle East has rested, here I speak about the Arab \nRepublican of Egypt. I am loathe to bring to this floor anything that \nmars the image of the country that produced a leader of the courage and \nvision of Anwar Sadat.\n  I am told that the time is never right for such a statement. This is, \nas the experts always say, a ``critical moment in the Middle East,'' a \n``turning point,'' or a ``cross-roads.'' A wrong word here and a \nmisplaced gesture there, I am told, and the pendulum may swing from \ntension to confrontation. Well, they may be correct. But then the time \nmay never be right to speak out.\n  The wrong that has been committed in Egypt on a daily basis is one \nwith which we in the West sadly have far too much experience. Indeed, \nit is a wrong that mars our history at its very roots and is something \nthat we can never work too hard to remove from our thoughts and our \nconsciousness. But because I know how far we have come in ridding this \ncurse from our minds and hearts, and because I have come to learn how \nmuch it has become daily fare in the newspapers, airwaves, and pulpits \nof Egypt, I have put aside my reluctance to speak out on this issue \ntoday.\n  The issue is anti-Semitism.\n  I am not speaking of critiques of Israeli policy, but a resurgence of \nacerbic anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial. I am speaking of the \ncoarsest sort of hatred of Jews as Jews, the kind of hatred that \npollutes the mind, infects the soul and ensures that peace remains \nstone cold.\n  Caricatures of Jews that could have been lifted directly from the \npages of Der Sturmer seem to have been transplanted directly into the \nleading Egyptian newspapers; accusations of far-fetched Jewish \nconspiracies that are restricted to the radical fringe in our country \nare daily fare of the elite press in Cairo--cartoons that are \ngrotesque, stories that are lurid, articles that are filled with \nnothing but hate, loathing and intolerance. I have a long catalogue of \nvile statements, pictures, cartoons, and articles, but I will not sully \nthe reputation of this chamber in reciting them to you today. I will, \nhowever, request inclusion in the Congressional Record of selections \nfrom several major Egyptian newspapers in recent months. These media \noutlets are all state-owned, pro-government newspapers.\n  It is a sad reality that anti-Semitism exists in many parts of the \nglobe, alongside its first cousins of racism, sexism, xenophobia, and \nother forms of intolerance. And I am the first to admit that we as a \nnation do not have clean hands here. But what separates our experience \nfrom the terrible form of anti-Semitism that we see in Egypt today is \nthat we denounce it from the secular and religious pulpits of our \nsociety. We give it no sanction and no sanctuary in our public life. \nAnd we fight it wherever it rears its ugly head.\n  Unfortunately, in Egypt the opposite seems to be the rule. Some of \nthe vilest forms of anti-Semitic literature are published not in the \nsensationalist opposition press but in the major newspapers owned and \noperated by the Egyptian leaders who either dismiss the numerous \nexamples of anti-Semitism as the stuff of far-left or far-right fringe \ngroups or rush to hide behind the four word safe haven of ``freedom of \nthe press.'' It is disappointing that Egyptian leaders do not take to \nthe airwaves, opinion pages or pulpits of their country to denounce \nanti-Semitism and condemn those who would traffic in hate.\n\n  It is particularly disappointing that Egyptian leaders do not take a \nstand against this hatred because of its history and its role. Egypt is \na leader in the Arab world, which affords her enormous influence. Egypt \nhas been a brave leader in the pursuit of a peace that, on this issue, \nhas sadly lost its moral compass. Two generations after the Holocaust \nand the founding of Israel, I, for one, can no longer sit idly by as I \nwatch a new generation of Middle Easterners grow up inheriting an \nideology of hate. Nor can I sit idly by as we Americans annually funnel \nclose to 2 billion dollars to Egypt, some of which subsidizes a \ngovernment-owned press which promulgates hatred and corrupts the minds \nof its readers.\n  Therefore, I believe that there needs to be a clear, unequivocal and \nsystematic effort by the Government of Egypt to repudiate the purveyors \nof anti-Semitic hatred, to build a culture of tolerance on which the \nprospect of real peace can flourish.\n  As I said at the outset, I rise today with extreme reluctance. I want \nto be clear that this is not an issue regarding the freedom of the \npress in Egypt; rather, it is a call to action. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in sending a message to our friends in Egypt that such \nugly and despicable anti-Semitism rhetoric must be repudiated \nofficially and strongly at every level.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3433-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \nthank Forest Service Chief Michael Dombeck. He served as Chief for four \nyears, beginning in 1997 until his retirement from Federal service last \nweek.\n  During his tenure, Chief Dombeck was a good friend to New Mexico. His \nassistance was critical in crafting the Community Forest Restoration \nAct. Enacted into law last year, this program provides grants to New \nMexico communities to team up with the Forest Service to reduce \nhazardous fuels in and near national forests. I believe this program \nwill set a good precedent for communities and Federal land management \nagencies to work in a collaborative manner to take care of our forests.\n  Chief Dombeck also quadrupled the budget for the Youth Conservation \nCorps, ``YCC''. YCC programs provide extraordinary benefits to both our \nyouth and our natural resources. Through YCC, desperately needed \nrestoration work is completed on our public lands. At the same time, \nyoung people, particularly those living in rural communities in New \nMexico and throughout the West, engage in meaningful summer employment \nand gain new skills. This program also promotes collaboration between \ncommunities and Federal land managers.\n  Thanks in large part to his efforts and support, YCC is now one of \nthe programs eligible for funding set aside by Title VIII of last \nyear's Interior Appropriations Act, referred to as the ``Land \nConservation, Preservation and Infrastructure Improvement'' account.\n  Last year, Chief Dombeck provided invaluable expertise as Senator \nDomenici and I worked to provide relief to communities at high risk \nfrom wildfire that are located in the vicinity of Federal lands. \nSpecifically, he assisted us in targeting additional hazardous fuel \nreduction funds near these communities to reduce the threat of fire. In \naddition, he supported our plans to create employment opportunities in \nthese communities. To accomplish this objective, we provided new \nauthority for the land management agencies to give a preference to \nlocal people and YCC work crews when awarding contracts and agreements \nto complete the projects and conduct monitoring.\n  I commend Chief Dombeck for his efforts to both sustain community \nwell-being and enhance the ecological integrity of the national forest \nsystem. I wish him well as he embarks on a new chapter in his \nlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3434-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF DR. THOMAS E. STARZL\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, it is my privilege to rise today \nto recognize the accomplishments of a living legend. Transplant pioneer \nThomas E. Starzl performed the world's first liver transplant in 1963 \nand the first successful series of kidney transplants between \nnonidentical twins between 1963 and 1964, and he has for four decades \ncontinued to make equally extraordinary advancements in the field of \norgan transplantation.\n  This coming April 27, Dr. Starzl's former students and colleagues, \nrepresenting the span of those 40 years, will pay tribute to Dr. Starzl \nas he enters emeritus status at the University of Pittsburgh. It will \nbe a celebration much to Dr. Starzl's liking--an academic gathering in \norder to share important scientific information.\n  Dr. Starzl is a pioneer. His work has had lasting influence and \nutility in the field of transplantation and on other fields of medicine \nas well. His legacy has and will continue to make an impact on us all.\n  In 1980 he developed a combination of drugs that transformed \ntransplantation of the liver and heart from an experimental procedure \nto a standard treatment for patients with end-stage organ failure. In \n1989, his development of another drug markedly improved survival rates \nfor all kinds of transplants and made possible for the first time \nsuccessful transplantation of the small intestine.\n  When Pittsburgh welcomed him 20 years ago, we had no idea the \nincredible contributions this man would make to medicine and mankind. \nIndeed, the city has enjoyed an enhanced reputation because he chose to \nmake the University of Pittsburgh his academic home. This year marks \nthe 20th anniversary of the first liver transplant he performed in \nPittsburgh. Since then, surgeons at the University of Pittsburgh and \nthe UPMC Health System have performed nearly 6,000 liver transplants \nand more than 11,300 transplants of all organs. These numbers set the \nworld standard, by far.\n  But Dr. Starzl's work goes far beyond Pittsburgh--he is truly a \nnational treasure. He is one of history's greatest surgeons, someone \nwho made saving a life routine. Even patients who have not been under \nhis direct care have benefitted from his work. In fact, most of the \nworld's transplant surgeons and physicians have been trained by Dr. \nStarzl or by those trained by him. By this standard alone his impact is \nimmeasurable and permanent. He has forever changed and improved health \ncare delivery as we know it.\n  Dr. Starzl, please know that every American is indebted to you for \nyour hard work, your refusal to take no for an answer, and most of all, \nfor your genius and skill as a surgeon and a researcher. The world is a \nbetter place because you chose to make Pittsburgh your home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3434-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING BILL RADIGAN\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am saddened to report the \npassing of one of South Dakota's most exceptional public leaders, and a \nlife-long friend in my home town of Vermillion, SD. Bill Radigan led a \nfull life, committed to his family, his nation and his community.\n  Bill answered America's call to the military during World War II as a \nmember of the Army Air Corps. He served the Vermillion region during \nhis 35 years with the U.S. Postal Service, while simultaneously \ncoordinating Vermillion's school bus system. He served as secretary of \nthe South Dakota teener baseball program for over 30 years and provided \nneeded leadership through the American Legion and VFW. Bill was \nsecretary-treasurer of the Vermillion Volunteer Fire Department for 55 \nyears, and served as city councilman and mayor of Vermillion, where he \noversaw the development of progressive new projects in our home town.\n  I had the privilege of working with Bill on issues ranging from \nveterans' benefits to the Vermillion-Newcastle Bridge, which will span \nthe Missouri River by the end of this summer. But for all of Bill \nRadigan's commitment to public service, nothing was more important in \nhis life than his family. He and his wife Susie made a dynamic pair in \nour community, and their 11 children and many grandchildren were of \nutmost importance to them. Bill's national, State, and community \nleadership achievements were extraordinary, but the strong family \nvalues he and Susie lived out every day of their marriage serves as \nwell as an inspiration for all.\n  I had the privilege of attending Bill's funeral this past week, and \nthe outpouring of love and respect from the entire community was \nextraordinary. Our Nation and South Dakota are far better places \nbecause of Bill's life, and while we miss him very much, the best way \nto honor his life is to emulate his commitment to public service and \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3434-4", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3434-S3435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MARY SAMSON LEFEVRE\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today is a special day in our \noffice. We are joining our science fellow, Russ Lefevre, in celebrating \nthe 99th birthday of his mother, Mary Samson Lefevre. She was born on \nApril 4, 1902 and lived on a farm in North Dakota for her early years. \nHer parents were second generation French-Canadian immigrants, and she \nwas one of eight children. She went to grade school at a Catholic \nelementary school in a small farming community but dropped out of \nschool after the 8th grade to help on her parents' farm.\n  She married Ernest Lefevre in 1934. They lived in a small town in \nNorth Dakota. She worked most of her life in a bakery, retiring at age \n74. Mrs. Lefevre lives in a care center in Maplewood, MN near her \ndaughter. She is in good health and good spirits, as she participates \nin the many activities in the center. She continues her interest in \nnational affairs.\n\n[[Page S3435]]\n\n  While she had to leave school early, as often happened at that time, \nMrs. Lefevre places great value on education. One of her sources of \npride is that all three of her children are college graduates. This is \nlargely due to her strong encouragement. Russ has a Ph. D. in \nElectrical Engineering. Shirley has a B.S. in Education and teaches in \nthe White Bear Lake, MN Elementary Schools. Robert has a Bachelors \ndegree in Mathematics and worked in the Software industry for over 35 \nyears.\n  A 99th birthday is a special occasion for her, as well as her family \nand friends. Over the course of her long life, Mrs. Lefevre has seen an \namazing transition in our country and our culture. Such experience \nbrings a wisdom and knowledge that enriches the lives of her loved \nones.\n  Such a celebration is also a chance for each of us to take a moment \nto appreciate our own family and our own family traditions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3435-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF JOHN JOHNSON\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments and commitment of one of New Jersey's great leaders, \nJohn ``J.J.'' Johnson. He has dedicated his life to protecting and \npromoting the rights of his fellow union members and has worked to help \nmany others build on the promise of the American Dream.\n  J.J first became active in the labor movement in 1960, when he \norganized the workers at the Peter Pan factory in East Newark, New \nJersey. Since then, J.J. has worn many hats in his long and \ndistinguished career of public service. For ten years, J.J. served as \nSecretary-Treasurer of Postal Union, Local #10. In 1975, J.J. co-\nfounded Service Employees International Union Local 617, where he \nserved for 25 years as Executive Vice President. Since then, Local 617 \nhas become New Jersey's largest Public Employee Local, representing \nover 3,500 members.\n  Throughout the years, J.J. has been on the front line of progress for \nunion members in New Jersey. In 1996, J.J. became the first African \nAmerican from New Jersey to be elected to the Executive Board of the \nService Employees International Union. As a member of the board, J.J. \nfought for fair wages, better health benefits, and safer working \nconditions, and was later elected president of the SEIU New Jersey \nState Council, which represents over 25,000 workers in the State of New \nJersey.\n  In 1998, J.J. had the honor of being the first African American to \nserve as Grand Marshall of the Essex-West Hudson Labor Council \n``Celebration of Labor Day Parade,'' and received the National \nLeadership Achievement Award from the SEIU Caucus of People of African \nDescent. In 2000, J.J. also became the first African American to \nreceive the New Jersey AFL-CIO Labor Award, and later this month he \nwill be honored by the National African American Caucus of the SEUI for \nhis outstanding leadership in the Union.\n  I am proud to recognize the accomplishments of J.J. Johnson, a man \nwho for thirty years has been a standard bearer of the labor movement. \nHis hard work, determination, and service are a model for our labor \nleaders, indeed all leaders, to follow and learn from.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3435-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3435-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3435-4", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:09 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hanrahan, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas passed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of \nthe Senate:\n\n       H.R. 768.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \nhigher education more affordable by providing a tax deduction for \nhigher education expenses, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce the Higher \nEducation Affordability and Fairness Act.\n  It is easy to forget that less than ten years ago this nation faced \nan endless stream of budget deficits. Today, through fiscal \nresponsibility and the hard work and sacrifice of the American people, \nan unprecedented budget surplus has taken the place of annual deficits.\n  Clearly, there are many priorities to be addressed with this good \nfortune. The time has come to ease the tax burden on the American \npublic through a reduction in tax rates. We must reserve a portion of \nthe surplus for necessary investments in education, a prescription drug \nbenefit, as well as a continuation of the progress we have made in \nreducing the national debt. Among those priorities we must include \nprograms and policies to increase the affordability of a college \neducation. I believe that this can be done through expanding tax \ncredits and making college tuition tax deductible.\n  A college degree is becoming a prerequisite for the advanced skills \nthat have become necessary in this global, information-based economy. \nAnd financially, a college education is integral to achieving middle-\nclass earning power. In 1999, the average male college graduate earned \n90 percent more than the average male high school graduate. In the late \n1970's the difference in pay was only 50 percent.\n  While the benefits and the need of higher education have increased, \nso, too have the costs. In the last decade, the cost of sending a child \nto college has increased 40 percent, nearly two and a half times the \nrate of inflation.\n  Too often, the struggle to send a child to college consumes the \nbudget of working families. In New Jersey, families spend anywhere from \n30 to 50 percent of their incomes on college expenses, leaving little \nfor the mortgage, medical bills, long-term care for a parent, or even a \ncar payment.\n\n[[Page S3438]]\n\n  In years past, Congress has sought to address college affordability \nby providing a HOPE Scholarship tax credit of up to $1,500 for the \nfirst two years of expenses and a Lifetime Learning tax credit of up to \n$1,000 for the third and fourth years as well as for graduate school. \nFor low-income families, Congress has increased funding to $8.75 \nbillion for Pell grants, a need-based grant program that will help send \nfour million Americans to college this year.\n  But more can and should be done.\n  Under existing law, taxpayers cannot deduct higher education expenses \nfrom their taxes, unless the expenses meet a very narrow definition as \n``work-related''. In addition, families living in high cost states like \nNew Jersey or California do not receive the same benefits as those \nliving in lower cost states because of unfair income limitations. \nFinally, a family who invests in an Education IRA cannot use the \nsavings for a child's college education and also receive the benefits \nof the HOPE or Lifetime Learning tax credits. Today, I am introducing \nthe Higher Education Affordability and Fairness Act, HEAFA, to address \nthese issues.\n  HEAFA would allow families who take the HOPE tax credit to deduct up \nto the next $8,000 in tuition expenses not covered by the credit, \ncapping the deduction at $15,000 in tuition expenses in one year if a \nfamily has more than one child in college. Families ineligible for the \nHope Scholarship, due to its income limitations, would be able to \ndeduct $5,000 of tuition costs.\n  The bill would also increase the Lifetime Learning credit to 20 \npercent of $10,000 of tuition, from the current 20 percent of $5,000, \nand provide families with the choice of taking either the credit or a \ndeduction on up to $10,000 of tuition, $5,000 if a family earns more \nthan $120,000 a year.\n  HEAFA would raise the phase-out limit for the HOPE credit to $60,000 \nfor singles and $120,000 for couples, allowing more families to \nbenefit.\n  In order to ensure that savings go to the intended beneficiaries, \nfamilies and students, the bill directs an annual study to examine \nwhether the federal income tax incentives to provide education \nassistance affect higher education tuition rates.\n  Finally, to address the needs of low-income families, the bill \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that the maximum annual Pell Grant \nshould be increased to $4,700 per student.\n  With so many families struggling today to pay their mortgages, afford \nthe high cost of prescription drugs and contribute to the long-term \ncare of their parents, helping families better afford college is the \nleast we can do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 690. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexpand and improve coverage of mental health services under the \nmedicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the \nMedicare Mental Health Modernization Act, a bill to improve the \ndelivery of mental health services through the Medicare health care \nsystem. This improvement and modernization of mental health services in \nthe Medicare system is long overdue. It has remained virtually \nunchanged since it was enacted by Congress in 1965. In the 36 years \nsince then, the scientific breakthroughs in our understanding of mental \nillnesses and the vast improvements in medications and other effective \ntreatments have dramatically changed our understanding and treatment of \nmental illness. Yet, the health care systems, both public and private, \nlag behind in the treatment of this potentially life-threatening \ndisease. As we work to improve health care for all Americans, in all \nhealth care systems, the ever-growing population of older Americans \nmake it all the more urgent that we bring the Medicare system into the \n21st century, and bring mental health care to those in need.\n  Though often undetected and untreated, mental health problems among \nthe elderly are widespread and life-threatening. Americans aged 65 \nyears and older have the highest rate of suicide of any population in \nthe United States. Sadly, these suicide rates increase with age. While \nthis age group accounts for just 13 percent of the U.S. population, \nAmericans 65 and older account for 20 percent of all suicide deaths. \nAll too often, depression among the elderly is ignored or \ninappropriately treated. This disease, and other illnesses such as \nAlzheimer's disease, anxiety and late-life schizophrenia, can lead to \nsevere impairment or death.\n  Major depression is strikingly prevalent among older people, with \nbetween 8 and 20 percent of older people in community-based studies \nshowing symptoms of depression. Studies of patients in primary care \nsettings show that up to 37 percent report such symptoms, although they \noften go untreated. Depression is not a ``normal'' part of aging, but a \nserious, debilitating disease. Almost 20 percent of individuals age 55 \nand older experience a serious mental disorder. What is most alarming \nis that most elderly suicide victims, 70 percent, have visited their \nprimary care doctor in the month prior to their completed suicide. It \nis critical that the mental health expertise be provided within the \nMedicare system, and that screening, diagnosis, and treatment be \nprovided in a timely manner.\n  Despite this need, Medicare coverage for mental health services is \nmuch more expensive for elderly patients than coverage for other \noutpatient services. In order to receive mental health care, seniors \nmust pay, out of their own pockets, 50 percent of the cost of a visit \nto their mental health specialist, an extremely unfair burden to \nplace on the elderly, who are so often facing other health or life \ndifficulties as well. For all other health care services, the copayment \nfor Medicare participants is 20 percent, not 50 percent.\n\n  We know that substance abuse, particularly of alcohol and \nprescription drugs, among adults 65 and older is one of the fastest \ngrowing health problems in the United States. With seventeen percent of \nthis age group suffers from addiction or substance abuse. While \naddiction often goes undetected and untreated among older adults, aging \nand disability only makes the body more vulnerable to the effects of \nthese drugs, further exacerbating underlying health problems, and \ncreating a serious need for treatment that recognizes these \nvulnerabilities.\n  Medicare also provides health care coverage for non-elderly \nindividuals who are disabled, through Social Security Disability \nInsurance, SSDI. According to the Health Care Financing Agency, HCFA, \nMedicare is the primary health care coverage for the 5 million non-\nelderly, disabled people on SSDI. More than 20 percent of these \nindividuals have a diagnosis of mental illness and/or addiction, and \nalso face severe discrimination in their mental health coverage.\n  What will this bill do? The Medicare Mental Health Modernization Act \nhas several important components. First, the bill reduces the 50 \npercent copayment for mental health care to 20 percent, which makes the \ncopayment equal to every other outpatient service in Medicare. This is \nstraightforward, fair, and the right thing to do. By doing so, this \nprovision will increase access to mental health care overall, \nespecially for those who currently forego seeking treatment and find \nthemselves suffering from worsening mental health conditions. Second, \nthe bill adds intensive residential services to the Medicare mental \nhealth benefit package. This provision will give people suffering from \ndiseases such as schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease an alternative to \ngoing to nursing homes. Instead, they will be able to be cared for in \ntheir homes or in more appropriate residential settings. I also ask the \nSecretary for Health and Human Services to conduct a study of the \ncurrent Medicare coverage criteria to determine the extent to which \npeople with these forms of illnesses are receiving the appropriate care \nthat is needed.\n  Finally, my bill expands the number of mental health professionals \neligible to provide services through Medicare to include clinical \nsocial workers and licensed professional mental health counselors. \nProvision of adequate mental health services provided through Medicare \nrequires more trained and experienced providers for the aging and \ngrowing population and should include those who are appropriately \nlicensed and qualified to deliver such care.\n  These changes are needed now. The bill enjoys the strong support of \nmany mental health groups including, among others, the National \nAlliance for the Mentally Ill, the National Mental Health Association, \ntheAmerican Psychological Association, the National\n\n[[Page S3439]]\n\nAssociation of School Psychologists, the National Association of Social \nWorkers, the American Association of Geriatric Psychiatry, the Bazelon \nCenter for Mental Health Law, the International Association of \nPsychosocial Rehabilitation Services, the American Counseling \nAssociation, the American Mental Health Counselors Association, the \nAssociation for Ambulatory Behavioral Health, the American Association \nof Marriage and Family Therapists, the National Association of \nPsychiatric Health Systems, the American Association of Pastoral \nCounselors, the Association for the Advancement of Psychology, the \nNational Association of County Behavioral Health Directors, the \nTourette Syndrome Association, the National Association of Anorexia \nNervosa and Associated Disorders, the Suicide Prevention and Advocacy \nNetwork, the Suicide Awareness/Voices of Education organization, the \nAmerican Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the American Association of \nSuicidology, the Kristin Brooks Hope Center, the The National Hopeline \nNetwork 1-800-SUICIDE, the Suicide Prevention Services of Illinois, and \nthe National Resource Center for Suicide Prevention and Aftercare. I \ncommend these organizations and the American Psychiatric Association \nfor their leadership role in fighting for improved mental health care \ncoverage for seniors under Medicare.\n\n  U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher recognized the urgency of the \nproblems with Medicare in his recent reports on mental health: ``Mental \nHealth: A Report of the Surgeon General'' and ``The Surgeon General's \nCall to Action to Prevent Suicide''. Dr. Satcher stated, ``Disability \ndue to mental illness in individuals over 65 years old will become a \nmajor public health problem in the near future because of demographic \nchanges. In particular, dementia, depression and schizophrenia, among \nother conditions, will all present special problems for this age \ngroup.'' Dr. Satcher also underscored the life-threatening nature of \nthis problem. He noted that the rate of major clinical depression and \nthe incidence of suicide among senior citizens is alarmingly high. This \nreport cites that about one-half of patients relocated to nursing homes \nfrom the community are at greater risk for depression. At the same \ntime, the Surgeon General emphasizes that depression ``is not well-\nrecognized or treated in primary care settings,'' and calls attention \nto the alarming fact that older people have the highest rates of \nsuicide in the U.S. population. Contrary to what is widely believed, \nsuicide rates actually increase with age, and, as the Surgeon General \npoints out, ``depression is a foremost risk factor for suicide in older \nadults.''\n  Clearly, our nation must take steps to ensure that mental health care \nis easily and readily available under the Medicare program. The \nMedicare Mental Health Modernization Act of 2001 takes an important \nfirst step in that direction. It is time to take this potential fatal \nillness seriously. I believe we must do everything we can to make \neffective treatments available in a timely manner for older adults and \nothers covered by Medicare, and help prevent relapse and recurrence \nonce mental illness is diagnosed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill as we begin our work in \nthis new century. It is time to treat the elderly in our society, \nparticularly those with serious, debilitating diseases, with the care, \nrespect and fairness they deserve. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 690\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Older people have the highest rate of suicide of any \n     population in the United States, and the suicide rate of that \n     population increases with age, with individuals 65 and older \n     accounting for 20 percent of all suicide deaths in the United \n     States, while comprising only 13 percent of the population of \n     the United States.\n       (2) Disability due to mental illness in individuals over 65 \n     years old will become a major public health problem in the \n     near future because of demographic changes. In particular, \n     dementia, depression, schizophrenia, among other conditions, \n     will all present special problems for this age group.\n       (3) Major depression is strikingly prevalent among older \n     people, with between 8 and 20 percent of older people in \n     community studies and up to 37 percent of those seen in \n     primary care settings experiencing symptoms of depression.\n       (4) Almost 20 percent of the population of individuals age \n     55 and older, experience specific mental disorders that are \n     not part of normal aging.\n       (5) Unrecognized and untreated depression, Alzheimer's \n     disease, anxiety, late-life schizophrenia, and other mental \n     conditions can be severely impairing and may even be fatal.\n       (6) Substance abuse, particularly the abuse of alcohol and \n     prescription drugs, among adults 65 and older is one of the \n     fastest growing health problems in the United States, with 17 \n     percent of this age group suffering from addiction or \n     substance abuse. While addiction often goes undetected and \n     untreated among older adults, aging and disability makes the \n     body more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol and drugs, \n     further exacerbating other age-related health problems. \n     Medicare coverage for addiction treatment of the elderly \n     needs to recognize these special vulnerabilities.\n       (7) The disabled are another population receiving \n     inadequate mental health care through medicare. According to \n     the Health Care Financing Administration, medicare is the \n     primary health care coverage for the 5,000,000 non-elderly, \n     disabled people on Social Security Disability Insurance. Up \n     to 40 percent of these individuals have a diagnosis of mental \n     illness.\n       (8) The current medicare benefit structure discriminates \n     against the millions of Americans who suffer from mental \n     illness and maintains an outdated bias toward institutionally \n     based service delivery. According to the report of the \n     Surgeon General on mental health for 1999, intensive \n     outpatient services, such as psychiatric rehabilitation and \n     assertive community treatment, represent state-of-the-art \n     mental health services. These evidence-based community \n     support services help people with psychiatric disabilities \n     improve their ability to function in the community and reduce \n     hospitalization rates by 30 to 60 percent, even for people \n     with the most severe mental illnesses.\n\n        TITLE I--ESTABLISHING PARITY FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to convey \ncertain land in the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit, Nevada, to the \nSecretary of the Interior, in trust for the Washoe Indian Tribe of \nNevada and California; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Washoe Tribe \nLake Tahoe Access Act.\n  I introduced this bill in the 106th Congress, and it passed in the \nSenate with unanimous consent. The bill subsequently passed the House \nwith unrelated amendments. Unfortunately, due to a shortage of time, \nthe two versions of the bill were never reconciled and neither version \nbecame law. Although the bill was introduced just last year, it has a \nmuch longer history to it. In 1997, I help convene a Presidential Forum \nto discuss the future of the Lake Tahoe basin. A diverse group of \nFederal, State, and local government leaders addressed the challenges \nfacing the extraordinary natural, recreational, and ecological \nresources of the Lake Tahoe region. Goals and an action plan developed \nduring the Lake Tahoe Forum were codified as ``Presidential Forum \nDeliverables''. These Deliverables include a commitment to support the \ntraditional and customary use of the Lake Tahoe basin by the Washoe \nTribe. Perhaps, most importantly, the Deliverables include a provision \ndesigned to provide the Washoe Tribe access to the shore of Lake Tahoe \nfor cultural purposes.\n  The ancestral homeland of the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California \nincluded an area of over 5,000 square miles in and around the Lake \nTahoe basin. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that the members of \nthe Washoe Tribe have the opportunity to engage in traditional and \ncustomary cultural practices on the shore of Lake Tahoe including \nspiritual renewal, land stewardship, Washoe horticultural and ethno-\nbotany, subsistence gathering, traditional learning, and reunification \nof tribal and family bonds forever. The parties that participated in \nthe Lake Tahoe Presidential Forum endorsed this important bill, and \nnearly four years later, the concept embodied by this bill continues to \nenjoy broad support. For example, the Lake Tahoe Gaming Alliance had \nindicated its support for this bill. The lands conveyed by this bill to \nthe Washoe Tribe would be managed in accordance with the Lake Tahoe \nRegional Plan, and would not preclude or hinder public access around \nthe lake.\n  This act will convey 24.3 acres from the Secretary of Agriculture to \nthe Secretary of the Interior to be held in trust for the Washoe Tribe. \nThis is land located within the Lake Tahoe Management Unit north of \nSkunk Harbor, Nevada. The land in question would be conveyed with the \nexpectation that it would be used for traditional and customary uses, \nand stewardship conservation of the Washoe Tribe, and will not permit \nany commercial use. The provision of this bill prohibiting development \nof this land was specifically requested by leaders of the Washoe Tribe. \nThe bill provides that if the Tribe attempts to exploit the land for \nany commercial development purpose, title to the land will revert to \nthe Secretary of Agriculture. Again this is a safeguard, not just \nagreed to by the Washoe Tribe, but suggested by them. Finally, I would \nlike to highlight the fact that Senator Ensign of Nevada joins me today \nto introduce this important bill. I know that Senator Ensign values the \nwonders of Lake Tahoe, and his support for this bill will help ensure \nthat the Washoe Tribe will one day call the shores of Lake Tahoe home \nonce again.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 691\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. WASHOE TRIBE LAND CONVEYANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the ancestral homeland of the Washoe Tribe of Nevada \n     and California (referred to in this Act as the ``Tribe'') \n     included an area of approximately 5,000 square miles in and \n     around Lake Tahoe, California and Nevada, and Lake Tahoe was \n     the heart of the territory;\n       (2) in 1997, Federal, State, and local governments, \n     together with many private landholders, recognized the Washoe \n     people as indigenous people of Lake Tahoe Basin through a \n     series of meetings convened by those governments at 2 \n     locations in Lake Tahoe;\n       (3) the meetings were held to address protection of the \n     extraordinary natural, recreational, and ecological resources \n     in the Lake Tahoe region;\n       (4) the resulting multiagency agreement includes objectives \n     that support the traditional and customary uses of National \n     Forest System land by the Tribe; and\n       (5) those objectives include the provision of access by \n     members of the Tribe to the shore of Lake Tahoe in order to \n     reestablish traditional and customary cultural practices.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to implement the joint local, State, tribal, and \n     Federal objective of returning the Tribe to Lake Tahoe; and\n       (2) to ensure that members of the Tribe have the \n     opportunity to engage in traditional and customary cultural \n     practices on the shore of Lake Tahoe to meet the needs of \n     spiritual renewal, land stewardship, Washoe horticulture and \n     ethnobotany, subsistence gathering, traditional learning, and \n     reunification of tribal and family bonds.\n\n[[Page S3443]]\n\n       (c) Conveyance on Condition Subsequent.--Subject to valid \n     existing rights, the easement reserved under subsection (d), \n     and the condition stated in subsection (e), the Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall convey to the Secretary of the Interior, in \n     trust for the Tribe, for no consideration, all right, title, \n     and interest in the parcel of land comprising approximately \n     24.3 acres, located within the Lake Tahoe Basin Management \n     Unit north of Skunk Harbor, Nevada, and more particularly \n     described as Mount Diablo Meridian, T15N, R18E, section 27, \n     lot 3.\n       (d) Easement.--\n       (1) In general.--The conveyance under subsection (c) shall \n     be made subject to reservation to the United States of a \n     nonexclusive easement for public and administrative access \n     over Forest Development Road #15N67 to National Forest System \n     land, to be administered by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n       (2) Access by individuals with disabilities.--The Secretary \n     of Agriculture shall provide a reciprocal easement to the \n     Tribe permitting vehicular access to the parcel over Forest \n     Development Road #15N67 to--\n       (A) members of the Tribe for administrative and safety \n     purposes; and\n       (B) members of the Tribe who, due to age, infirmity, or \n     disability, would have difficulty accessing the conveyed \n     parcel on foot.\n       (e) Condition on Use of Land.--\n       (1) In general.--In using the parcel conveyed under \n     subsection (c), the Tribe and members of the Tribe--\n       (A) shall limit the use of the parcel to traditional and \n     customary uses and stewardship conservation for the benefit \n     of the Tribe;\n       (B) shall not permit any permanent residential or \n     recreational development on, or commercial use of, the parcel \n     (including commercial development, tourist accommodations, \n     gaming, sale of timber, or mineral extraction); and\n       (C) shall comply with environmental requirements that are \n     no less protective than environmental requirements that apply \n     under the Regional Plan of the Tahoe Regional Planning \n     Agency.\n       (2) Termination and reversion.--If the Secretary of the \n     Interior, after notice to the Tribe and an opportunity for a \n     hearing, based on monitoring of use of the parcel by the \n     Tribe, makes a finding that the Tribe has used or permitted \n     the use of the parcel in violation of paragraph (1) and the \n     Tribe fails to take corrective or remedial action directed by \n     the Secretary of the Interior--\n       (A) title to the parcel in the Secretary of the Interior, \n     in trust for the Tribe, shall terminate; and\n       (B) title to the parcel shall revert to the Secretary of \n     Agriculture.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HELMS:\n  S. 692. A bill to issue a certificate of documentation for the vessel \nEagle: to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, today I sending to the desk S. 692, a bill \nthat would grant a waiver of the so-called Jones Act to the Scour Barge \nEagle, a ship owned by the State of North Carolina. Enactment of this \nessential legislation will enable the Eagle to clear silt buildup on \nthe river bottom along the dock and wharf facilities of the North \nCarolina State Ports Authority.\n  The Scour Barge Eagle is an old U.S. Army barge outfitted with a pump \nand pipe system, commonly known as a ``scour jet.'' The ship directs \npressured water at silt build-up points along areas adjacent to the \ndocking facilities of the North Carolina State Ports Authority in \nWilmington. Proper drafts at berths along the docking facilities must \nbe maintained in order for ships to on-load and off-load cargo, \nespecially bulk cargos.\n  While it is clearly documented that the Scour Barge Eagle was built \nby Peden Steel Company in Raleigh, around 1943, this legislation is \nnevertheless essential because the State of North Carolina is unable to \nestablish a continuous title chain. In the past Congress has passed \nsimilar legislation to grant Jones Act waivers so that similar vessels \ncould operate in the coastwise trades.\n  Mr. President, a bill identical to the one I'm offering today was \nincorporated into S. 1089, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2000, \nwhich the Senate approved by unanimous consent last year. The House \nfailed to pass the Senate bill, making it necessary to re-introduce \nthis bill as I am doing today.\n  I do hope that the Senate will swiftly adopt this legislation. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of the text of this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 692\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

App. 883), chapter 121 of title 46, United States \n     Code, and section 1 of the Act of May 28, 1906 (46 U.S.C. \n     App. 292), the Secretary of Transportation shall issue a \n     certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement for \n     employment in the coastwise trade for the vessel EAGLE (hull \n     number BK-1754, United States official number 1091389) if the \n     vessel--\n       (1) is owned by a State, a political subdivision of a \n     State, or a public authority chartered by a State;\n       (2) if chartered, is chartered to a State, a political \n     subdivision of a State, or a public authority chartered by a \n     State;\n       (3) is operated only in conjunction with--\n       (A) scour jet operations; or\n       (B) dredging services adjacent to facilities owned by the \n     State, political subdivision, or public authority; and\n       (4) is externally identified clearly as a vessel of that \n     State, subdivision, or authority.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 693. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to provide additional \nsafeguards for beneficiaries with representative payees under the Old-\nAge, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program or the Supplemental \nSecurity Income program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \naimed at protecting Social Security benefits of some of the most \nvulnerable people in our society.\n  Today, I am introducing, along with my colleagues Senator Breaux and \nSenator Burns, the Social Security Beneficiaries Protection Act of \n2001. This legislation, identical to legislation introduced in the \n106th Congress, is meant to provide additional safeguards for \nbeneficiaries with organizational representative payees. Sometimes, \nbeneficiaries are not capable of managing their benefits on their own. \nUsually, in these situations, a family member or close friend manages \ntheir benefits for them. However, there are those who, for whatever \nreason, don't have family or friends who are able to act as the \nrepresentative payee. In those cases an organizational representative \npayee can handle their benefit checks.\n  Approximately, 750,000 Social Security beneficiaries have an \norganization handling their monthly checks. These organizations include \nsocial service agencies, banks and hospitals. Most of these \norganizations provide a much needed service.\n  However, in the spring of last year, the Senate Special Committee on \nAging, which I chaired at the time, held a hearing examining the \nfraudulent misuse of benefits by some organizational representative \npayees. The hearing highlighted the findings of an investigation \nconducted by the Social Security Administration's, SSA, Office of \nInspector General, OIG. James Huse, Inspector General for SSA testified \nthat since fiscal year 1998 the Social Security Administration has \nidentified over $7.5 million in losses to beneficiaries. In several of \nthose cases, hundreds of individuals were victims of severe abuses by \norganizational representative payees.\n  Another witness at the hearing, Ms. Betty Byrd testified to the \nhardship that is placed on a beneficiary who is the victim of a \ndishonest representative payee. Ms. Byrd was 70 years old and required \na representative payee because of an extended hospital stay 100 miles \nfrom her home, followed by placement in an assisted living facility. \nHer fee-for-service organizational representative payee, Greg Gamble, \nwas responsible for collecting Ms. Byrd's benefits and paying her \nutility bills, medical expenses, and rent. However, Mr. Gamble had his \nown ideas for how to spend Ms. Byrd's money. He stopped paying her rent \nand as a result she was forced to sell her trailer. The power was \nturned off because he stopped paying her utility bills. Her care \nfacility informed her that Mr. Gamble was several months behind on her \npayments. The nursing home threatened to evict her. In her own words \nshe was left, ``almost homeless, without medical care, and in serious \nfinancial trouble.'' Mr. Gamble was caught and pled guilty to using his \nclients' benefits for his own purposes. He has agreed to pay back \n$303,314.\n  The primary purpose of this legislation, which is based on \nrecommendations by Social Security Administration Office of Inspector \nGeneral, is to provide immediate relief to victims of representative \npayee fraud. By providing SSA with the authority to re-\n\n[[Page S3444]]\n\nissue benefits victims would be made whole again.\n\n  This legislation would also provide for additional accountability by \npayees to the SSA in an effort to prevent abuses from taking place in \nthe future. While the Social Security Administration does have a \nselection process in place, it needs strengthening.\n  The Social Security Beneficiaries Protection Act of 2001 would \nrequire that non-governmental fee-for-service organizational \nrepresentative payees be licensed and bonded. Under current law, an \norganization representative payee is only required to get one or the \nother.\n  For any month in which the Social Security Commissioner or the courts \nhave determined that an organizational representative payee misused all \nor part of an individual's benefits he or she would be required to \nforfeit the fees. The legislation would also make the representative \npayee liable for any misused benefits.\n  Ms. Byrd's story demonstrates there is a need for stronger safeguards \nto protect the elderly and disabled who require an organizational \nrepresentative payee. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important \nlegislation and help protect the most vulnerable Social Security \nbeneficiaries.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Dodd, \n        Mr. Cochran, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 694. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat a deduction equal to fair market value shall be allowed for \ncharitable contributions of literary, musical, artistic, or scholarly \ncompositions created by the donor; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, the \nArtist-Museum Partnership Act, to enable our country to keep cherished \nart works in the United States and to preserve them in our public \ninstitutions, while erasing an inequity in our tax code that currently \nserves as a disincentive for artists to donate their works to museums \nand libraries. This is the same bill I introduced last year with my \ncolleagues Senator Bennett and Senator Lieberman. I would like to thank \nthem for their leadership in this area and also to thank Senators Dodd, \nCochran, Lincoln, Reid, and Domenici for cosponsoring this bipartisan \nbill.\n  In a nutshell, our bill would allow artists, writers and composers \nwho donate works to museums and libraries to take a tax deduction equal \nto the fair market value of the work. This is something that collectors \nwho make similar donations are already able to do. If we as a nation \nwant to ensure that art works created by living artists are available \nto the public in the future, for study or for pleasure, it is something \nthat artists should be allowed to do as well. Under current law, \nartists who donate self-created works are only able to deduct the cost \nof supplies such as canvas, pen, paper, ink, which does not even come \nclose to their true value. This is unfair to artists and it hurts \nmuseums and libraries, large and small, that are dedicated to \npreserving works for posterity.\n  In my State of Vermont, we are incredibly proud of the great works \nproduced by hundreds of local artists who choose to live and work in \nthe Green Mountain State. Displaying their creations in museums and \nlibraries helps develop a sense of pride among Vermonters and \nstrengthens a bond with Vermont, its landscape, its beauty and its \ncultural heritage. Anyone who has gazed at a painting in a museum or \nexamined an original manuscript or composition, and has gained a \ngreater understanding of both the artist and the subject as a result, \nknows the tremendous value of these works. I would like to see more of \nthem, not fewer, preserved in Vermont and across the country.\n  Prior to 1969, artists and collectors alike were able to take a \ndeduction equivalent to the fair market value of a work, but Congress \nchanged the law with respect to artists in the Tax Reform Act of 1969. \nSince then, fewer and fewer artists have donated their works to museums \nand cultural institutions. The sharp decline in donations to the \nLibrary of Congress clearly illustrates this point. Until 1969, the \nLibrary of Congress received 15 to 20 large gifts of manuscripts from \nauthors each year. In the four years following the elimination of the \ndeduction, the library received only one such gift. Instead, many of \nthese works have been sold to private collectors, and are no longer \navailable to the general public.\n  For example, prior to the enactment of the 1969 law, Igor Stravinsky \nplanned to donate his papers to the Music Division of the Library of \nCongress. But after the law passed, his papers were sold instead to a \nprivate foundation in Switzerland. We can no longer afford this massive \nloss to our cultural heritage. This loss was an unintended consequence \nof the tax bill that should now be corrected.\n  More than 30 years ago, Congress changed the law for artists in \nresponse to the perception that some taxpayers were taking advantage of \nthe law by inflating the market value of self-created works. Since that \ntime, however, the government has cut down significantly on the abuse \nof fair market value determinations. Under this legislation, artists \nwho donate their own paintings, manuscripts, compositions, or scholarly \ncompositions, would be subject to the same new rules that all taxpayer/\ncollectors who donate such works must now follow. This includes \nproviding relevant information as to the value of the gift, providing \nappraisals by qualified appraisers, and, in some cases, subjecting them \nto review by the Internal Revenue Service's Art Advisory Panel.\n  In addition, donated works must be accepted by museums and libraries, \nwhich often have strict criteria in place for works they intend to \ndisplay. The institutions must also certify that it intends to put the \nwork to a use that is related to the institution's tax exempt status. \nFor example, a painting contributed to an educational institution must \nbe used by that organization for educational purposes. It could not be \nsold by the institution for profit. Similarly, a work could not be \ndonated to a hospital or other charitable institution that did not \nintend to use the work in a manner related to the function constituting \nthe donee's exemption under Section 501 of the tax code. Finally, the \nfair market value of the work could only be deducted from the portion \nof the artist's income that has come from the sale of similar works, or \nrelated activities.\n  This bill would also correct another disparity in the tax treatment \nof self-created works--how the same work is treated before and after an \nartist's death. While living artists may only deduct the material costs \nof donations, donations of those same works after death are deductible \nfrom estate taxes at the fair market value of the work. In addition, \nwhen an artist dies, works that are part of his or her estate are taxed \non the fair market value.\n  Last year, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that our bill \nwould cost $48 million over 10 years. This is a moderate price to pay \nfor our education and the preservation of our cultural heritage. The \ntime has come for us to correct an unintended consequence of the 1969 \nlaw and encourage rather than discourage the donations of art works by \ntheir creators. This bill could, and I believe would, make a critical \ndifference in an artist's decision to donate his or her work, rather \nthan sell it to a private party, where it may become lost to the public \nforever.\n  I want to thank my colleagues again for cosponsoring this bipartisan \nlegislation. I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters from the Association of Art Museum Directors, The Museum of \nFine Arts, Houston, the Theatre Communications Group, Inc., and the \nWhitney Museum of American Art in support of this bill.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                               Whitney Museum of American Art,\n\n                                      New York, NY, April 3, 2001.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Senator Robert Bennett,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Bennett: On behalf of the staff and \n     Board of Trustees of the Whitney Museum of American Art, I \n     thank you for introducing the ``Artist-Museum Partnership \n     Act''. This legislation, which would allow artists, writers \n     and composers to deduct the fair-market value of a \n     contribution of their own work to a charitable institution, \n     will benefit museums, and their visitors, across the country.\n       As a result of changes to the tax code of 1969, visual \n     artists, writers and composers\n\n[[Page S3445]]\n\n     can no longer take a deduction based on the fair-market value \n     of a contribution of their own work. The artists' deduction \n     is limited to the cost of materials in preparing the work--in \n     the case of a visual artist, canvas and paint. However, a \n     collector, making an identical donation, may take the fair-\n     market value deduction for the work. Once the artist dies, \n     his or her spouse may donate the work for a fair-market value \n     deduction. In addition, works of art left to an artist's \n     estate are evaluated at the fair-market value for purposes of \n     determining estate taxes.\n       Since the 1969 repeal, contributions to museum and \n     libraries by living artists and writers have all but \n     disappeared, depriving the public of access to its cultural \n     heritage. Many of these pieces are sold abroad or into \n     private collections and never seen again.\n       Thank you again for your continued support of artists and \n     arts institutions in this country.

The legislation is long overdue and will \n     be useful to museums in soliciting original works of art from \n     artists. May museums do not have funds to purchase art and \n     must rely on donations. Since 1969, when the law was repealed \n     that allowed artists to take a fair-market value deduction, \n     contributions from living artists to museums has dramatically \n     decreased.\n       Many important works by regional or ethnic artists are sold \n     rather than donated because the majority of artists simply \n     cannot afford to donate their works when they can only take a \n     deduction equal to the cost of materials. The bill you have \n     drafted is an important step in helping small and mid-sized \n     museums add these works to their collections for the public \n     to enjoy.\n       Thank you again for this thoughtful piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Peter C. Marzio,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am proud to join the Senator from \nVermont today to introduce the Artist-Museum Partnership Act. This \nimportant legislation will remove an unfortunate inequity in our tax \ncode by allowing living artists to deduct the fair-market value of \ntheir art work when they contribute the work to museums or other public \ninstitutions.\n  As the tax code is currently written, art collectors are allowed to \ndeduct the fair market value of any piece of art donated to a museum. \nAt the same time, if the artist who created that work of art were to \ndonate the same piece, he or she would be allowed to deduct only the \nmaterial cost of the work, which may be nothing more than a canvas, a \ntube of paint, and a wooden frame. This inequity has created a \ndisincentive for artists who would otherwise donate their work to \nmuseums. The solution is simple: treat collectors and artists the same \nway. This bill will do just that.\n  While this bill will certainly help artists, the real beneficiaries \nare museums, historians, and most importantly, the general public. This \nchange in the tax code will increase the number of original pieces \ndonated to public institutions, giving scholars greater access to an \nartist's work during the lifetime of that artist, as well as providing \nfor an increase in the public display of such work. Museum-goers will \nhave a greater opportunity to learn not only from the master artists of \npast centuries, but also from artists who are at the forefront of their \nfields today.\n  I want to thank Senator Leahy for his work on this bill. He and I \nhave introduced similar legislation in the past, and we hope that our \ncolleagues will see this bill for what it is a reasonable solution to \nan unintentional inequity in our tax code. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this common-sense legislation. The fiscal impact of the Artist-\nMuseum Partnership Act on the federal budget will be minimal, but the \nbenefit to our nation's cultural and artistic heritage cannot be \noverstated. This minor correction to the tax code is long overdue, and \nthe Senate should act on this legislation to remedy the problem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Byrd):\n  S. 695. A bill to provide parents, taxpayers, and educators with \nuseful, understandable school report cards; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Standardized \nSchool Report Card Act, along with Senators Bingaman and Byrd.\n  Every six to nine weeks, schools all across the country send parents \nreport cards evaluating how their child is doing. Rarely, however, do \nparents ever get any sense of how their child's school is performing. \nAnd let's face it: The two are inextricably linked. It is not as \nmeaningful for a child to be among the best in his or her school if the \nschool itself is among the worst.\n  As a parent of two children in public school, I believe it is very \nimportant for parents, taxpayers, teachers, and the public to have some \nway of measuring how their school is performing, relative to other \nschools in the area, the state, the country, and even the world. The \nlegislation I am introducing today along with Senators Bingaman and \nByrd would give parents and taxpayers an important tool for evaluating \nhow their school is doing.\n  Our legislation would require that schools and states develop an \nannual, easily understandable report card and widely disseminate it to \nparents, taxpayers, teachers, and the public.\n\n[[Page S3446]]\n\n  I am pleased that the concept of school report cards has bipartisan \nsupport. President Bush called for school-by-school report cards on \nstudent achievement in his ``No Child Left Behind'' education plan. In \naddition, Senator Daschle and the others have provided for school \nreport cards in S. 10, the Educational Excellence for All Learners Act. \nAnd the Better Education for Students and Teachers Act, which was \nreported by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions, includes some limited school report card language that I \nthink can form the basis for helpful reports for parents and taxpayers.\n  The Standardized School Report Card Act that I am introducing today \nwould require schools and states to cover eight key, basis areas in \ntheir report cards, plus any other areas of indicators of quality they \nwant to include. The eight subject areas schools would be ``graded'' on \nare: Student performance; attendance, graduation and dropout rates; \nprofessional qualifications of teachers; average class size; school \nsafety; parental involvement; student access to technology; and whether \nthey have been identified by the State for improvement. These eight \nareas were chosen largely because they were the ones parents themselves \nsaid they felt were most critical, in focus groups around the country \nconducted by the Center for Community Change.\n  Some might say this legislation is unnecessary. After all, according \nto Education Week, 36 states already require schools to publish a \nschool report card. In addition, the Congressional Research Services \nhas looked at the kinds of data that states already require their \nschools to report and/or collect. According to the CRS, 47 states have \n``report cards'' in at least one of the eight areas specified by the \nStandardized School Report Card Act.\n  However, the content of these report cards varies widely. In fact, \naccording to a report by Education Week, no two state report cards \ncover exactly the same information, so they cannot be a useful tool for \nparents and educators to compare their school with other schools in the \nstate or nation.\n  For instance, in my state of North Dakota, the state Department of \nPublic Instruction has designed a ``school district profile'' that is \npublished for each school district in the state. These profiles include \nlots of interesting and helpful information, including a lot of data \nnot required by my legislation. However, there is also some valuable \ndata missing from this report that parents would want to know about, \nsuch as the number of teachers who have emergency certification or the \nincidents of school violence.\n\n  By requiring all schools to report on at least these eight key areas, \nmy school report card legislation will provide parents with the ability \nto measure how their school is doing relative to other schools.\n  Schools will also have to be sure that they widely disseminate their \nreport cards. According to Education Week, most people have never seen \na report card for their local school, even though 90 percent think a \nschool report card would be helpful.\n  This legislation is not about the Federal government wresting control \nof education away from local school boards, where it belongs. Rather, \nit is about whether parents, no matter where they live, have an \nopportunity and the ability to measure how well their children are \ndoing from community to community, school to school, state to state?\n  As a nation, we spend more than $375 billion annually to provide an \neducation to our elementary and secondary children. Parents and \ntaxpayers deserve to know what we are getting for the money we are \nspending on K-12 education.\n  Those in this country who are concerned about our education system \nknow that we must make some improvements. How do we make improvements? \nYou create a blueprint, a plan, for fixing what is wrong. But before \nyou can do that, you must first assess what is right and what is wrong. \nAnd we do not have a basic approach by which parents can measure what \nis right or wrong with their local school.\n  The lack of obtainable, understandable information is a major barrier \nto parents' more active involvement in the education of their children. \nIn Georgia, the number of schools developing local school improvement \nplans increased by 300 percent following the first publication of \nreport cards in 1996. I feel strongly that's because parents will hold \ntheir schools accountable if they have the information they need to \ndetermine whether improvements are needed.\n  Times have changed. This is not 40 years ago when we as a country \ncould tie one hand behind our back and beat anybody else in the world \nat almost anything, and do it easily. We now face shrewd, tough \ninternational competition in every direction we look. We now face \ncompetition in the job market, in our economies, and in our schools. \nOur children compete with countries that send their kids to school 240 \ndays a year, while we send our kids to school 180 days a year.\n  In short, parents have a right to know whether their kids are \nreceiving a quality education, no matter what State they live in, no \nmatter what city or school district they live in. I encourage my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this legislation. When the Senate begins debate \non the Better Education for Students and Teachers Act, I intend to work \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to strengthen the school \nreport card provisions already in the Senate bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 695\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Standardized School Report \n     Card Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the report ``Quality Counts 99'', by \n     Education Week, 36 States require the publishing of annual \n     report cards on individual schools, but the content of the \n     report cards varies widely.\n       (2) The content of most of the report cards described in \n     paragraph (1) does not provide parents with the information \n     the parents need to measure how their school or State is \n     doing compared with other schools and States.\n       (3) Ninety percent of taxpayers believe that published \n     information about individual schools would motivate educators \n     to work harder to improve the schools' performance.\n       (4) More than 60 percent of parents and 70 percent of \n     taxpayers have not seen an individual report card for their \n     area school.\n       (5) Dissemination of understandable information about \n     schools can be an important tool for parents and taxpayers to \n     measure the quality of the schools and to hold the schools \n     accountable for improving performance.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to provide parents, taxpayers, \n     and educators with useful, understandable school report \n     cards.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from \napplying spectrum aggregation limits to spectrum assigned by auction \nafter 2000; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I rise to reintroduce the Third \nGeneration Wireless Internet Act. This legislation, which I first \nintroduced in the 106th Congress, is needed today more then ever. The \nAct requires The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to lift the \ncurrent cap on the amount of spectrum any one company may be licensed \nto use in a market.\n  Today, over 104 million Americans are benefitting from the products \nand services being offered by our nation's wireless industry. The \npublic has benefited from stiff competition among industry participants \nas 244.8 million Americans can choose between three and eight wireless \nservice providers, with 181.7 million of them able to choose from at \nleast five service providers. The result of this competition has been a \nfifty percent decrease in wireless rates between 1988 and 2000, while \nthe total number of minutes used has increased forty-two percent over \nthat same period.\n  Impressive as is the development of the wireless marketplace, our \nnation's wireless industry is fast approaching a crossroads where it \nwill transition from voice and text messaging services to a marriage of \nwireless mobility with the power of the Internet and broadband Internet \naccess: the ability to deliver voice, video, and data simultaneously \nover one wireless device. This transition will be made possible by the \ndeployment of third generation technology, commonly referred to as \n``3G,'' which combines wireless mobility with transmission speeds and \ncapacity resembling that of the broadband pipes being laid primarily in \nurban markets by wireline companies.\n  Congress, the FCC, and the National Telecommunications and \nInformation Administration continue to work to identify sufficient \nspectrum resources for a timely 3G deployment. The Third Generation \nWireless Internet Act will ensure that companies currently at the \nlimits of the spectrum they are permitted to use under FCC regulations \nwill still be able to participate in 3G deployment once the spectrum is \nidentified.\n  Just as Internet access, especially broadband Internet access, \npromises to\n\n[[Page S3448]]\n\nbe a great equalizer across socio-economic lines, 3G promises to be a \ngreat equalizer between those consumers with access to broadband and \nthose without. As Congress continues to look for ways to close the \ndigital divide as it relates to broadband, wireless technology can play \na key role in ensuring that all Americans have access to broadband \nirrespective of their geographic location. It is incumbent upon \nCongress to recognize and act upon the potential of 3G to close the gap \nbetween urban and rural broadband access, and the Third Generation \nWireless Internet Act does just that.\n  I request that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows;\n\n                                 S. 696\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Third-Generation Wireless \n     Internet Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Mobile telephony has been one of the fastest growing \n     industries of the telecommunications sector, offering \n     consumers innovative services at affordable rates.\n       (2) Demand for mobile telecommunications services has \n     greatly exceeded industry expectations.\n       (3) Mobile carriers are poised to bring high-speed Internet \n     access to consumers through wireless telecommunications \n     devices.\n       (4) Third Generation mobile systems (hereinafter referred \n     to as ``3G'') are capable of delivering high-speed data \n     services for Internet access and other multimedia \n     applications.\n       (5) Advanced wireless services such as 3G may be the most \n     efficient and economic way to provide high-speed Internet \n     access to rural areas of the United States.\n       (6) Under the current Federal Communications Commission \n     rules, commercial mobile service providers may not use more \n     than 45 megahertz of combined cellular, broadband Personal \n     Communications Service, and Specialized Mobile Radio spectrum \n     within any geographic area.\n       (7) Assignments of additional spectrum may be needed to \n     enable mobile operators to keep pace with the demand for 3G \n     services.\n       (8) The application of the current Commission spectrum cap \n     rules to new spectrum auctioned by the FCC would greatly \n     impede the deployment of 3G services.\n\n     SEC. 3. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.\n\n       Section 332(c) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     332(c)) is amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following:\n       ``(9) Non-Application of Spectrum Aggregation Limits to New \n     Auctions.--\n       ``(A) The Commission may not apply section 20.6(a) of its \n     regulations (47 C.F.R. 20.6(a)) to a license for spectrum \n     assigned by initial auction held after December 31, 2000.\n       ``(B) The Commission may relax or eliminate the spectrum \n     aggregation limits of section 20.6 of its regulations (47 \n     C.F.R. 20.6), but may not lower these limits.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Craig, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. Lincoln, \n        Mr. Brownback, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Warner, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \n        Roberts, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Daschle, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Hutchinson, Ms. Milkulski, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Carper, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n        Biden, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Bayh, and \n        Mr. Miller):\n  S. 697. A bill to modernize the financing of the railroad retirement \nsystem and to provide enhanced benefits to employees and beneficiaries; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Baucus, and 18 \nother of our colleagues, I rise today to introduce the Railroad \nRetirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001. This bill represents \nan important opportunity in the 65-year history of the Railroad \nRetirement system. Rail labor and rail management, working together, \ndeveloped a proposal that would build on the system's strengths to \nmodernize Railroad Retirement to provide better, more secure benefits \nat a lower cost to employers and employees. This proposal was further \nrefined as a result of extensive discussions last year between rail \nlabor and management and the congressional committees of jurisdiction.\n  The bill we are introducing today builds on our efforts in the 106th \nCongress to reform the Railroad Retirement system. Last year, the \npredecessor to this bill, H.R. 4844, passed the House by a vote of 391-\n25, and received similar bipartisan support in the Senate. Eighty \nsenators signed a letter urging quick passage of the legislation, and \non September 28, 2000, it was favorably reported by the Finance \nCommittee. H.R. 4844 was placed on the Senate legislative calendar, but \nunfortunately, this is where the bill remained. Despite an overwhelming \nmajority of Members in both houses in support of the bill, time ran out \nand the 106th Congress adjourned without this bill being brought up on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Both rail labor and rail management have come to the Congress to seek \nchanges to their pension plan because Railroad Retirement is a unique \nsystem. It is the only private industry pension plan established in \nstatute and administered by the federal government. As such, any \nchanges in Railroad Retirement can be made only through legislative \naction. Historically, such legislation has reflected negotiated \nagreement by management and labor with the Congress followed by \ncongressional consideration and enactment of necessary statutory \nchanges. The legislation we introduce today continues this practice and \nembodies the reform principles agreed to by rail management and the \nvast majority of rail labor this past year.\n  Some may ask, why reform the Railroad Retirement system at this time? \nRailroad Retirement has served railroad workers, their families, and \ntheir surviving spouses well for 65 years. Its roots reach back to the \nstruggle to find answers to the hardships that resulted from the Great \nDepression of the 1930s. Today, the Railroad Retirement system is \nfiscally strong, providing benefit payments to more than 673,000 \nretirees and other beneficiaries. The most recent report to Congress by \nthe Railroad Retirement Board's chief actuary, which addressed the \n2000-2073 period, indicated that no cash-flow problems are expected to \narise over that period. This strength, combined with the willingness of \nrail labor and rail management to work together constructively, \nprovides an opportunity to address a number of concerns about Railroad \nRetirement that have developed in recent years.\n  First, Railroad Retirement is very costly, both to employers and \nemployees. It has two components: Tier I, which is largely equivalent \nto Social Security, and Tier II, which provides additional benefits and \nis similar to a private, defined benefit pension plan. Tier I and Tier \nII are funded primarily through payroll taxes on employers and \nemployees--15.3 percent combined for Tier I, including Medicare, and 21 \npercent for Tier II. Together, these payroll taxes make up a staggering \n36.3 percent of taxable payroll, a figure substantially higher than the \ncost other industries face to provide retirement benefits to their \nemployees. This high cost represents a major financial burden to both \nemployees and employers. Perhaps worse still, it constitutes a major \ndisincentive for employers to hire new employees under Railroad \nRetirement.\n  A second factor that led to the development of this legislation is \nthe adequacy of the Railroad Retirement benefit structure. One special \narea of concern among retirees has been the widow's and widower's \nbenefit under the Tier II portion of Railroad Retirement. Indeed, this \nwas the subject of a 1998 hearing by the Ground Transportation \nSubcommittee of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. \nThat hearing was a spur to rail management and rail labor to engage in \ndiscussions about a broad range of issues affecting the system.\n  Let me explain the reasons why this bill has the strong support of \nrailroad retirees, railroad management, and the great majority of rail \nlabor.\n  First, it provides for increased responsibility by the railroad \nindustry for the financial health of Railroad Retirement. Under current \nlaw, if changes in tax rates or benefits are needed to assure the \nfinancial health of the system, Congress is required to pass new \nlegislation. The bill being introduced today would make Tier II tax \nrates more responsive to actual financing needs by establishing an \nautomatic tax adjustment schedule. Under this statutory schedule, \npayroll taxes would be\n\n[[Page S3449]]\n\nraised or lowered automatically, without any further action by \nCongress, depending on the level of funds available to pay Railroad \nRetirement benefits. The schedule is designed to maintain a minimum \nbalance of 4 years of benefit payments and a maximum balance of 6 \nyears. The four year minimum reserve balance represents a higher \nbalance than has existed in the Railroad Retirement Account (RRA) for \nmost of the past 40 years. Rail employers have agreed to bear entirely \nany tax schedule increases--employees and employers would share any tax \ndecreases that might occur. Employees would have the option of seeking \ncongressional action to convert any planned decrease in the employee \ntax rate to a benefit increase, and management has agreed to support \nsuch action.\n  Second, the bill provides for greater flexibility in the investment \nof Railroad Retirement assets. This investment provision would apply \nonly to Tier II, the portion of the program that is similar to a \nprivate pension plan and is funded entirely from industry sources. Tier \nI, the portion that is similar to Social Security and is linked to the \nSocial Security system, would not be affected.\n  Currently, investment of RRA assets is limited by law to U.S. \nGovernment securities. Actuarial projections for the RRA assume an \nannual return of 6 percent on investments. Between 1985 and 1998, the \naverage annual return on RRA investments was unusually high at 9.12 \npercent, but this still lagged far behind the average annual return to \nlarge multi-employer pension plans of 15.17 percent over the same \nperiod. The differential in returns between RRA investments and private \npension plan investment portfolios contributes significantly to the \nhigh cost of funding the benefits provided from the RRA.\n  This bill would provide the authority for the industry assets in the \nRRA to be invested in a diversified investment portfolio, as are the \nassets of private sector retirement plans. In the process of developing \nthis proposal, concerns were raised by some Members of Congress that \nthis aspect of the legislation could result in government intrusion \ninto the equity markets. While the funds that would be invested are, in \neffect, railroad industry pension funds which, through historical \ncircumstance, have been maintained in a government account, we have \nincluded a provision to draw a bright line distinction from current \ninvestment practice.\n  The Congressional Committees of jurisdiction worked with labor and \nmanagement last year to create a new structure that separates the new \ninvestment activity from the Railroad Retirement Account. This \nstructure has been included in the legislation we introduce today. It \nwould establish a new Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (RRIT), \nwhose exclusive purpose would be the investment of RRA assets entrusted \nto it by the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB). The RRIT would not be an \nagency or instrumentality of the federal government. RRA assets would \nbe transferred to the RRIT for investment and from the RRIT to a \ncentralized disbursement agent that would pay the various components of \nthe aggregate railroad retirement benefit in a single check to \nbeneficiaries.\n  The RRIT would have seven trustees chosen by the Railroad Retirement \nBoard: three representing labor, three representing management and one \nrepresenting the public interest. Trustees of the RRIT would be \nrequired to have experience and expertise in the management of \nfinancial investments and pension plans, and would be subject to \nfiduciary standards similar to those required by ERISA. The RRIT \ntrustees would set investment guidelines for the prudent management of \nthe assets entrusted to it, and select outside investment advisors and \nmanagers to implement its policies. Earnings on RRIT investments would \nbe available only for the purpose of paying Railroad Retirement \nbenefits and necessary expenses of the RRIT. I believe that these \nmeasures will allow for increased returns on the industry's pension \nplan while building an effective firewall between the government and \nthe private markets.\n  Third, this legislation would improve benefits for retirees and their \nfamilies. In particular, it would resolve the concern regarding the \nbenefit for widows and widowers under Tier II. Under current law, while \nthe retired employee is alive, the couple receives a Tier II benefit \nequal to 145 percent of the retiree's benefit--the retiree's benefit \nplus a spousal benefit of 45 percent of the retiree's benefit. When the \nretiree dies, the spouse is left with a Tier II benefit of 50 percent \nof the retiree's benefit--a reduction of almost two-thirds. Under this \nbill, the surviving spouse would receive a Tier II benefit equal to \nthat received by the retiree, preventing such a drastic reduction in \nsurvivor income.\n  Also of key importance is a reduction in the current early retirement \nage of 62 with 30 years of service to age 60 with 30 years of service. \nThis would return the age at which a railroad employee can retire with \nfull benefits to what it was prior to 1984. It is significant that rail \nlabor and rail management have agreed to revise their national \ncollective bargaining agreement to conform the age of eligibility for \nretiree health benefits to 60, if this legislation is passed. There are \nalso two other benefit improvements: the vesting requirement would be \nlowered from 10 to 5 years, a change which would align Railroad \nRetirement with current private industry pension practices; and the \nbill would also eliminate an arbitrary cap on Tier II benefits, known \nas the ``Railroad Retirement Maximum'', which can result in retirees \nand their spouses having their earned benefits substantially reduced.\n  Fourth, Tier II payroll tax rates would be reduced for employers. \nRailroad employers currently pay 16.1 percent of taxable payroll into \nthe RRA, which, as I have mentioned, is a rate substantially higher \nthan other industries' pension contributions. The reduction of employer \ntaxes would be phased in over the first 3 years following enactment of \nthe bill. Employee tax rates would continue at the current 4.9 percent. \nFurther tax reductions for employers and tax reductions for employees \nwould be possible as provided under the tax adjustment mechanism I have \nalready described. In addition, the supplemental annuity tax, a 26.5 \ncents-per-hour tax paid entirely by rail employers, would be \neliminated. Supplemental annuity benefits would continue to be paid to \neligible beneficiaries.\n  The legislation being introduced today is nearly identical to the \nlegislation that was reported last year by the Senate Finance \nCommittee, with the exception of updated effective dates.\n  I am concerned that certain aspects of this bill have been \nundeservedly criticized since it was first introduced last year, and I \nbelieve it is important to put these criticisms to rest in order to \navoid any further misconceptions.\n  First, the legislation's budget impact has been mischaracterized and \noverstated. Under current scoring rules, CBO is required to treat the \ninitial purchase of private securities by the Railroad Retirement \nInvestment Trust as a government ``outflow.'' These private securities \nwould become an asset of the RRIT, but would not be scored as a \ncorresponding government ``inflow'' under current budget scoring rules, \na decision which, I am told, the CBO characterized as a ``close call.'' \nCBO further indicated that some budget experts believe that OMB's long-\nstanding practice under ``Circular A-11'' may be ``ill-suited to \npurchases of financial assets that the government acquires as a way of \npreserving, or enhancing, the value of cash balances,'' and that they \n``may consider a different budget treatment in the future.''\n  Simply put, even if the estimated $14.8 billion acquisition of \nprivate securities is scored as an initial outlay, the assets received \nin return would produce on-budget revenues in the form of interest, \ndividends and capital gains. Over time, these revenues will contribute \nto increasing future surpluses and reducing debt service. In fact, CBO \nestimated that after the third year under the Railroad Retirement and \nSurvivors' Improvement Act, the program would add to the surplus in \nevery succeeding year in ever-increasing amounts.\n  Second, some have expressed concern that the transfer of federal \nincome taxes on railroad retirement benefits into the Railroad \nRetirement trust fund is a Government subsidy. In fact, railroad \nretirees, concerned about the future of Railroad Retirement, agreed in \n1983 to the taxation of their benefits and the dedication of the \nproceeds to Railroad Retirement as a form of benefit cut to help \nsupport the long-term solvency of the program. If benefits\n\n[[Page S3450]]\n\nhad been cut in the conventional way, there would be no question as to \nwhether this would be considered a subsidy.\n  Third, critics' claims that this legislation relies on Social \nSecurity funds or makes any changes to Social Security reflect a total \nmisunderstanding of the relationship between Railroad Retirement and \nSocial Security. Since 1950 there has been a financial interchange \nmechanism between Railroad Retirement and the Social Security system \nthat ensures that neither system is advantaged or disadvantaged by \nwhich system covers a worker. The current bill would make no changes to \nthis interchange process or to Social Security. As in the past, these \nTier I funds would be available to pay benefits, would be considered \nassets of the Railroad Retirement program, and would be limited to \ninvestments in federal government securities.\n  Railroad Retirement has always been a bipartisan concern. I hope that \nmany more of our colleagues will join us in taking this opportunity to \nimprove Railroad Retirement and the lives of its more than 673,000 \nbeneficiaries, and that we act early to ensure that there is plenty of \ntime in this session to accomplish this important task.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Hatch as a \nlead cosponsor of the Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement \nAct of 2001. The intent of this legislation is quite simple: improve \nthe benefits of Railroad Retirement and modernize the financing of \nsystem. Many would agree that the current railroad retirement system is \narchaic and inequitable. As an example, one need look no further than \nthe severe reduction in benefit payments faced by the 178,000 widows \nand widowers under the current policy. This is something that must be \naddressed promptly and the legislation we are introducing today \nimproves survivor benefits substantially. Montana has about 6,600 \nrailroad retirement beneficiaries and about 3,200 active rail \nemployees. Railroads are an important industry in Montana and many \nMontanans count on the railroad. I am cosponsoring this legislation to \nmake sure railroad employees, retirees and their families receive \nadequate benefits from a system they can count on.\n  This legislation has strong support from railroad companies, labor \norganizations, and retirees. When enacted, this legislation will \nprovide earlier vesting and a lower minimum retirement age for railroad \nlabor; improved benefits for widows and widowers of railroad retirees; \nand enhance the investment of pension contributions from rail companies \nand employees.\n  Rail labor and rail management have come to the Congress to seek \nchanges to their pension plan because Railroad Retirement is a unique \nsystem. It is the only private industry pension plan established in \nstatute and administered by the federal government. As such, any \nchanges in Railroad Retirement can be made only through legislative \naction. Historically, such legislation has reflected negotiated \nagreement by management and labor followed by Congressional \nconsideration and enactment of necessary statutory changes. This \nlegislation continues this practice and embodies reform principles \nagreed to by rail management and a majority of rail labor.\n  I am pleased we have a significant bipartisan group of Senators \njoining us as original cosponsors, an indication of the broad support \nthis legislation has earned. I also note that many of the original \ncosponsors are also members of the Senate Finance Committee, the \ncommittee that will receive the bill after its introduction today. I \nhope the committee will be able to take action on the bill soon.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of the bipartisan Railroad Retirement and Survivors' \nImprovement Act 2001, and I hope to work closely with Senators Hatch \nand Baucus and the bipartisan coalition to get this legislation enacted \ninto law this year.\n  In West Virginia, we have over 11,000 retirees and their families \ndepending on railroad retirement. Almost 3,500 West Virginians are \nworking for the railroads and will need their railroad retirement at \nsome point in the future. Nationwide, there are about 673,000 railroad \nretirees and families, and about 245,000 active rail workers. They \ndeserve a better retirement program, and I want to work with them to \npromote this historic package supported by both rail labor and rail \nmanagement.\n  There can be no doubt that improving retirement benefits for railroad \nworkers, retirees, and their families must be one of our top \npriorities, and I am fully supportive of that effort. Right now, it \ntakes ten years of service before a railroad worker becomes vested in \nthe retirement plan, while private companies covered by Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act, ERISA, vest their employees in just \nfive to seven years. The need to dramatically improve benefits for \nwidows and widowers is obvious and has gone unaddressed for too long. \nIt is tragic to slash the benefits of the widow of a railroad retiree \nupon the death of her spouse, as the current policy does. I understand \nthe importance of these and other changes in retirement benefits for \nworkers.\n  Today, experts predict that the Railroad Trust Funds are solvent for \nthe next twenty-five years, and existing policy guarantees benefits to \nrailroad retirees and their families. Under the new plan, the railroads \nwould pay a lower sum of taxes into the Railroad Retirement Trust \nFunds, but the fund would create an investment board to invest its \nreserves in private equities so the increased rate of returns would \ncover the expanded benefits. Under the plan, there is a provision to \nincrease railroad taxes in the future, when necessary, to fully fund \nthe railroad retirement benefits.\n  As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I want to enact \nlegislation that will improve benefits for railroad retirees and their \nfamilies, and I will be working with my colleagues to achieve that \ngoal.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join as a cosponsor of \nthis important legislation to modernize the investment policies of the \nRailroad Retirement System. This legislation reflects an historic \nagreement reached between rail labor and rail management. it is good \nfor workers, good for retirees, good for widows and widowers, good for \nrail employers, and good for the rail industry as a whole.\n  This reform legislation is the product of two and a half years of \nnegotiations and has had the grassroots support of nearly one million \nemployees and beneficiaries who will benefit from its provisions. We \ncame very close to enacting this measure into law at the end of the \nlast Congress. I hope my colleagues will join me in moving the bill as \nexpeditiously as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 698. A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to designate \nchromium-6 as a contaminant, to establish a maximum contaminant level \nfor chromium-6, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Ms. BOXER. Mr. President, today Senator Harry Reid and I are \nintroducing a bill for the first time ever will require the Environment \nProtection Agency, EPA, to set a federal standard for chromium 6 in \ndrinking water.\n  The recent movie, ``Erin Brockovich'' made front page news of the \nsubstance hexavalent chromium, otherwise known as chromium 6, that \nuntil last year had only received attention from the scientific \ncommunity. But Hinkley, California, the town depicted in the movie, is \nnot the only place where chromium 6 has been found in the drinking \nwater supply.\n  For example, last September, PG National Energy Group agreed to \nclose down five unlined wastewater basins and two landfills at its \npower plants in Massachusetts because they were being sued for dumping \nwaste contaminated with chromium 6 into these basins and landfills, \nendangering the safety of the groundwater.\n  Over one year ago in Painesville Township, Ohio, large amounts of \nchromium 6 were removed from a construction site. Workers at the site \nwere replacing 2,000 feet of pipe in the sewer main when they \nencountered the contaminated water, which was described as \n``phosphorescent yellow-green liquid.''\n  Chromium 6 is a chemical that is used by a variety of industries \nthroughout the country. When improperly disposed of, chromium 6 can \ncontaminate ground water, which is the\n\n[[Page S3451]]\n\nvery same water that many communities use to supply their drinking \nwater.\n  We now know for a fact that chromium 6 causes a host of serious \nhealth problems, including cancer, liver damage, kidney damage, immune \nsystem suppression, respiratory illness, skin rashes, nose bleeds and \nneurological damage. What we do not know is the level at which chromium \n6 in drinking water causes these problems.\n  That is why I am introducing this bill today with my colleague \nSenator Harry Reid. Our bill will require the National Academy of \nSciences to study the health effects of chromium 6 in drinking water \nand to make recommendations to the EPA on an appropriate maximum \ncontaminant level goal. The EPA, based on these recommendations, will \nthen list chromium 6 as a regulated contaminant under the Safe Drinking \nWater Act and set a federal standard for the levels of chromium 6 that \ncan safely be found in drinking water.\n  This bill will also ensure that communities are able to get \ninformation about the chromium 6 levels in their drinking water from \ntheir local water supplies by applying existing right-to-know laws and \nwill provide funding to state and local water authorities to help \ndefray the cost of cleaning up chromium 6.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to secure passage of \nthis vitally important health safety measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 698\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for substantial reductions in the price of \nprescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \nPrescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act of 2001, legislation that \naddresses the critical issue facing our older Americans--the cost of \ntheir prescription drugs. Studies have shown that older Americans spend \nalmost three times as much of their income on health care than those \nunder the age of 65, and more than three-quarters of Americans aged 65 \nand over are taking prescription drugs. Study after study has shown \nthat seniors and others who buy their own prescription drugs, are \nforced to pay over twice as much for their drugs as are the drug \nmanufactures' most favored customers, such as the federal government \nand large HMOs. Even more alarming is the fact that consumers in the \nUnited States pay far more for their prescription drugs than do \ncitizens of other developed nations, resulting in price discrimination \nagainst millions of Americans. U.S. consumers are footing the bill for \ndrug manufacturer's skyrocketing profit margins year in and year out. \nThis is wrong and unfair.\n  The Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act will protect senior \ncitizens and disabled individuals from drug price discrimination and \nmake prescription drugs available to Medicare beneficiaries at \nsubstantially reduced prices. The legislation achieves these goals by \nallowing pharmacies that serve Medicare beneficiaries to purchase \nprescription drugs at the drugs' low ``average foreign price.'' Under \nthe bill, the ``average foreign price'' means the average price that \nthe manufacturer realizes on drugs sold in Canada, France, Germany, \nItaly, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Last year, the ``reimportation'' \nbill had broad bipartisan support. Estimated to reduce prescription \ndrug prices for seniors by over 40 percent, this bill will help those \nseniors and disabled individuals who often times have to make \ndevastating choices between buying food or medications. Choices that no \nhuman being should have to make.\n  Research and development of new drug therapies is an important and \nnecessary tool towards improving a persons quality of life. But due to \nthe high price tag that often accompanies the latest drug therapies, \nseniors are often left without access to these new therapies, and \nultimately, in far too many instances, without access to medication at \nall. This legislation is an important step towards restoring the access \nto affordable medications for all Medicare beneficiaries.\n  While this may not be the magic bullet that meets all of the long \nterm needs of providing Medicare prescription drug coverage, it does \nprovide a mechanism for immediate relief from rising drug costs. \nWorking together, reaching across the aisle, we can use this time of \nunparalleled prosperity to do the right thing by our seniors. We should \ndo it this year for their sake, and for the sake of the future of \nMedicare.\n  I look forward to working on this important issue in the months to \ncome and hope that Congress will work swiftly in a bipartisan manner to \nenact this legislation that will benefit millions of senior citizens \nand disabled individuals across our nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 699\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Prescription Drug Fairness \n     for Seniors Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Manufacturers of prescription drugs engage in price \n     discrimination practices that compel many older Americans to \n     pay substantially more for prescription drugs than consumers \n     in foreign nations and the drug manufacturers' most favored \n     customers in the United States, such as health insurers, \n     health maintenance organizations, and the Federal Government.\n       (2) Older Americans who buy their own prescription drugs \n     often pay twice as much for\n\n[[Page S3452]]\n\n     prescription drugs as consumers in foreign nations and the \n     drug manufacturers' most favored customers in the United \n     States. In some cases, older Americans pay 10 times more for \n     prescription drugs than such customers.\n       (3) The discriminatory pricing by major drug manufacturers \n     sustains their high profits (for example, $27,300,000,000 in \n     1999), but causes financial hardship and impairs the health \n     and well-being of millions of older Americans. Many older \n     Americans are forced to choose between buying their food and \n     buying their medicines.\n       (4) Foreign nations and federally funded health care \n     programs in the United States use purchasing power to obtain \n     prescription drugs at low prices. Medicare beneficiaries are \n     denied this benefit and cannot obtain their prescription \n     drugs at the lower prices available to such nations and \n     programs.\n       (5) Implementation of the policy set forth in this Act is \n     estimated to reduce prescription drug prices for many \n     medicare beneficiaries by an average of 40 percent.\n       (6) In addition to substantially lowering the costs of \n     prescription drugs for older Americans, implementation of the \n     policy set forth in this Act will significantly improve the \n     health and well-being of older Americans and lower the costs \n     to the Federal taxpayer of the medicare program.\n       (7) Older Americans who are terminally ill and receiving \n     hospice care services represent some of the most vulnerable \n     individuals in our Nation. Making prescription drugs \n     available to medicare beneficiaries under the care of \n     medicare-certified hospices will assist in extending the \n     benefits of lower prescription drug prices to those most \n     vulnerable and in need.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect \n     medicare beneficiaries from discriminatory pricing by drug \n     manufacturers and to make prescription drugs available to \n     medicare beneficiaries at substantially reduced prices.\n\n     SEC. 3. PARTICIPATING MANUFACTURERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Each participating manufacturer of a \n     covered outpatient drug shall make available for purchase by \n     each pharmacy such covered outpatient drug in the amount \n     described in subsection (b) at the price described in \n     subsection (c).\n       (b) Description of Amount of Drugs.--The amount of a \n     covered outpatient drug that a participating manufacturer \n     shall make available for purchase by a pharmacy is an amount \n     equal to the aggregate amount of the covered outpatient drug \n     sold or distributed by the pharmacy to medicare \n     beneficiaries.\n       (c) Description of Price.--The price at which a \n     participating manufacturer shall make a covered outpatient \n     drug available for purchase by a pharmacy is a price no \n     greater than the manufacturer's average foreign price.\n       (d) Enforcement.--The United States shall debar a \n     manufacturer of drugs or biologicals that does not comply \n     with the provisions of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 4. SPECIAL PROVISION WITH RESPECT TO HOSPICE PROGRAMS.\n\n       For purposes of determining the amount of a covered \n     outpatient drug that a participating manufacturer shall make \n     available for purchase by a pharmacy under section 3, there \n     shall be included in the calculation of such amount the \n     amount of the covered outpatient drug sold or distributed by \n     a pharmacy to a hospice program. In calculating such amount, \n     only amounts of the covered outpatient drug furnished to a \n     medicare beneficiary enrolled in the hospice program shall be \n     included.\n\n     SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       The Secretary shall issue such regulations as may be \n     necessary to implement this Act.\n\n     SEC. 6. REPORTS TO CONGRESS REGARDING EFFECTIVENESS OF ACT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary \n     shall report to Congress regarding the effectiveness of this \n     Act in--\n       (1) protecting medicare beneficiaries from discriminatory \n     pricing by drug manufacturers; and\n       (2) making prescription drugs available to medicare \n     beneficiaries at substantially reduced prices.\n       (b) Consultation.--In preparing such reports, the Secretary \n     shall consult with public health experts, affected \n     industries, organizations representing consumers and older \n     Americans, and other interested persons.\n       (c) Recommendations.--The Secretary shall include in such \n     reports any recommendations the Secretary considers \n     appropriate for changes in this Act to further reduce the \n     cost of covered outpatient drugs to medicare beneficiaries.\n\n     SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Average foreign price.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``average foreign price'' means, \n     with respect to a covered outpatient drug, the average price \n     that the manufacturer of the drug realizes on the sale of \n     drugs with the same active ingredient or ingredients that are \n     consumed in covered foreign nations, taking into account--\n       (i) any rebate, contract term or condition, or other \n     arrangement (whether with the purchaser or other persons) \n     that has the effect of reducing the amount realized by the \n     manufacturer on the sale of the drugs; and\n       (ii) adjustments for any differences in dosage, \n     formulation, or other relevant characteristics of the drugs.\n       (B) Exempt transactions.--The Secretary may, by regulation, \n     exempt from the calculation of the average foreign price of a \n     drug those prices realized by a manufacturer in transactions \n     that are entered into for charitable purposes, for research \n     purposes, or under other unusual circumstances, if the \n     Secretary determines that the exemption is in the public \n     interest and is consistent with the purposes of this Act.\n       (2) Covered foreign nation.--The term ``covered foreign \n     nation'' means Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the \n     United Kingdom.\n       (3) Covered outpatient drug.--The term ``covered outpatient \n     drug'' has the meaning given that term in section 1927(k)(2) \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r-8(k)(2)).\n       (4) Debar.--The term ``debar'' means to exclude, pursuant \n     to established administrative procedures, from Government \n     contracting and subcontracting for a specified period of time \n     commensurate with the seriousness of the failure or offense \n     or the inadequacy of performance.\n       (5) Hospice program.--The term ``hospice program'' has the \n     meaning given that term under section 1861(dd)(2) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(dd)(2)).\n       (6) Medicare beneficiary.--The term ``medicare \n     beneficiary'' means an individual entitled to benefits under \n     part A of title XVIII of the Social Security Act or enrolled \n     under part B of such title, or both.\n       (7) Participating manufacturer.--The term ``participating \n     manufacturer'' means any manufacturer of drugs or biologicals \n     that, on or after the date of enactment of this Act, enters \n     into a contract or agreement with the United States for the \n     sale or distribution of covered outpatient drugs to the \n     United States.\n       (8) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services.\n\n     SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The Secretary shall implement this Act as expeditiously as \n     practicable and in a manner consistent with the obligations \n     of the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 700. A bill to establish a Federal interagency task force for the \npurpose of coordinating actions to prevent the outbreak of bovine \nspongiform encephalopathy (commonly known as ``mad cow disease'') and \nfoot-and-mouth disease in the United States; read the first time.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am joined by my friends and \ncolleagues, Senator Kohl and Senator Hatch in introducing an expanded \nversion of the Mad Cow Prevention Act of 2001, which we previously \nintroduced on March 14, 2001. Our original bill would establish a \nfederal Task Force to prevent the spread to and within the United \nStates of Mad Cow Disease, Foot-and-Mouth Disease, and related \nlivestock diseases. This new bill, entitled the Mad Cow and Related \nDiseases Prevention Act of 2001, would add the Secretary of State and \nthe Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to the Task \nForce.\n  We also are invoking Rule 14 to have the bill placed directly on the \nSenate Calendar. We are taking this rare step because of the growing \nseverity of this threat and testimony presented at a hearing this \nmorning before the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs, Foreign \nCommerce and Tourism.\n  We can not take for granted that our food supply will not be tainted \nby Mad Cow Disease, which has infected over 175,000 cattle in Great \nBritain and Europe, and other livestock diseases. This is an issue that \nhas a direct impact on my home state of Colorado, and the rest of the \nnation as a whole.\n  We need to proceed in a prudent, cautious way to do everything we can \nto prevent Mad Cow Disease and other devastating livestock diseases \nfrom entering and spreading in the United States. Only then can we \nensure continued consumer confidence in the safety of the American food \nsupply.\n  The bill we reintroduce today establishes a Federal Interagency Task \nForce, to be chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture, for the purpose \nof coordinating actions to prevent the outbreak of Mad Cow Disease. The \nagencies will include the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of \nCommerce, the Secretary of Health and Human Service, the Secretary of \nTreasury, the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, the \nDirector of the National Institutes of Health, the Director of the \nCenters for Disease Control, the Commissioner of Customs, the Secretary \nof State, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and \nany other agencies the President deems appropriate.\n  No later than 60 days after the enactment of this legislation, the \ntask force will submit to Congress a report which\n\n[[Page S3453]]\n\nwill describe the actions the agencies are taking and plan to take to \nprevent the spread of Mad Cow and other livestock diseases and make \nrecommendations for the future prevention of the spread of this disease \nto the United States. The Task Force should also consider and report on \nfoot-and-mouth disease, chronic wasting disease and other diseases \nassociated with our meat industries.

Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a resolution \ncommending Clear Channel Communications and the American Football \nCoaches Association, AFCA, for their efforts to protect children by \nproviding a vital means for locating America's missing, kidnapped, and \nrunaway children.\n  In 1997, the AFCA created the National Child Identification Program \nwith a goal of fingerprinting 20 million children across the country. \nThe AFCA began the program after discovering some startling statistics \nregarding missing children. The statistics showed that every year \n450,000 children run away, 350,000 are abducted by a family member, and \nover 4,500 are abducted by a stranger. A total of 800,000 children are \nmissing somewhere in America each year, that is one child every 40 \nseconds.\n  The National Child Identification Program provides free inkless \nfingerprint kits for children. These kits allow parents to take and \nstore their child's fingerprints in their own home. If ever needed, \nthis fingerprint record can give authorities vital information to \nassist them in their efforts to locate a missing child. In its first \nyear, the AFCA distributed 2.1 million child I.D. kits at college \nfootball games across the country. To date, there have been 12 million \nfree child I.D. kits distributed.\n  I am proud to say that many in Tennessee have contributed to this \neffort. Phil Fulmer, Head Football Coach at the University of \nTennessee, has been an active participant in this program. With his \nhelp, the AFCA was able to distribute over 200,000 I.D. kits at \nUniversity of Tennessee football games. Last year, Tennessee Governor \nDon Sundquist declared March 2000 as ``Child Identification Awareness \nMonth'' and acknowledged that the program will affect the lives of \nchildren all over Tennessee.\n  Last year, Clear Channel Communications, a Texas-based media company, \npartnered with AFCA to raise funds to provide 60 million schoolchildren \nwith free I.D. kits. They have committed to raising $78 million over \nthe next three years for this effort.\n  This revolution gives special recognition to the American Football \nCoaches Association and Clear Channel Communications for their efforts. \nI ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3453-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3453-S3454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 32--HONORING THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR THE \n PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS FOR ITS 135 YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE \n             PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES AND THEIR ANIMALS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nhonoring The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals \non the 135th Anniversary of their founding.\n  The dedicated volunteers of The ASPCA have provided shelter, medical \ncare, and placement for abandoned and abused animals for more than a \ncentury.\n  The ASPCA is the oldest animal welfare organization in North America. \nHenry Bergh began the organization in 1866 as a platform to prevent the \ncruel beating of carriage horses in New York City. Today, The ASPCA is \na national organization, employing 680,000 workers and providing \nservices to millions of people and their animals. The success of the \norganization has made the term ASPCA synonymous with ``animal rescue'', \n``animal shelter'', ``animal adoptions'' and ``humane education.''\n  In my homestate of Illinois, The ASPCA has an Animal Poison Control \nCenter--the first and only non-profit animal-dedicated poison control \ncenter in the U.S. In 1996, The ASPCA acquired the center from the \nUniversity of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana. The center is committed to \nrelieving pain, fear and suffering in animals who have been poisoned, \nand to provide education on toxicology.\n  The ASPCA continues to educate adults and children that kindness, \ncaring and respect for all creatures benefits both humans and animals. \nIn addition, millions of Americans have participated in ``Prevention-\nof-Cruelty-to-Animals'' activities in the month of April through their \nschools and civic organizations.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in congratulating the \nstaff, directors and volunteers at The ASPCA on a successful 135 years \nof service\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3454-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 179.

Res. 55, as \nfollows:\n\n                               S. Res. 55\n\n       Whereas the month of April has been designated National \n     Child Abuse Prevention Month as an annual tradition initiated \n     in 1979 by former President Jimmy Carter;\n       Whereas the most recent Government figures show that almost \n     1,000,000 children were victims of abuse and neglect in 1998, \n     causing unspeakable pain and suffering to our most vulnerable \n     citizens;\n       Whereas among the children who are victims of abuse and \n     neglect, more than 3 children die each day in this country;\n       Whereas the rate of child fatalities resulting from child \n     abuse and neglect in 1998 for children aged 1 and younger \n     accounted for 40 percent of the fatalities, and for children \n     aged 5 and younger accounted for 77.5 percent of the \n     fatalities;\n       Whereas head trauma is the leading cause of death of abused \n     children, including the trauma known as Shaken Baby Syndrome;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome is a totally preventable form \n     of child abuse, caused by a caregiver losing control and \n     shaking a baby that is usually less than 1 year of age;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome can result in loss of vision, \n     brain damage, paralysis, seizures, or death;\n       Whereas an estimated 3,000 children are diagnosed with \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome every year, with thousands more \n     misdiagnosed and undetected;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome often results in permanent, \n     irreparable brain damage or death to an infant, and more than \n     $1,000,000 in medical costs to care for a single, disabled \n     child in just the first few years of life;\n       Whereas the most effective solution for ending Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome is to prevent such abuse, and it is clear that the \n     minimal costs of education and prevention programs may \n     prevent enormous medical and disability costs and untold \n     grief for many families;\n       Whereas prevention programs have been shown to raise \n     awareness and provide critically important information about \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome to parents, caregivers, day-care \n     workers, child protection employees, law enforcement \n     personnel, health care professionals, and legal \n     representatives;\n       Whereas prevention of Shaken Baby Syndrome is supported by \n     groups such as the Shaken Baby Alliance, an organization \n     which began with 3 mothers of children who had been diagnosed \n     with Shaken Baby Syndrome, and whose mission is to educate \n     the general public and professionals about Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome and to increase support for victims and victim \n     families in the health care and criminal justice systems;\n       Whereas child abuse prevention programs and ``National \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'' are supported by the \n     Shaken Baby Alliance, Children's Defense Fund, American \n     Academy of Pediatrics, American Medical Association, Child \n     Welfare League of America, Prevent Child Abuse America, Brain \n     Injury Association, National Child Abuse Coalition, National \n     Exchange Club Foundation, American Humane Association, Center \n     for Child Protection and Family Support, Inc., National \n     Association Of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions, \n     and many other organizations including the National \n     Basketball Association, which is sponsoring a series of ``NBA \n     Child Abuse Prevention Awareness Night 2001'' events to \n     generate public awareness about the issue of child abuse and \n     neglect during National Child Abuse Prevention Month 2001;\n       Whereas a year 2000 survey by Prevent Child Abuse America \n     shows that \\1/2\\ of all Americans believe child abuse and \n     neglect is the most important issue facing this country \n     compared to other public health issues; and\n       Whereas Congress strongly supports efforts to protect \n     children from abuse and neglect: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the third week of April, as ``National \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'' for the year 2001 and \n     all future years; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation urging \n     the people of the United States to remember the victims of \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome and participate in educational programs \n     to help prevent Shaken Baby Syndrome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/04/senate-section/article/S3459-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 700\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.
