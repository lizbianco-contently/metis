Mr. President, today we have the opportunity to file \namendments on the antiterrorism legislation. The last 2 weeks have been \nvery productive in the Senate. We completed the very big, important, \nsupplemental appropriations bill providing for many important things, \nnot the least of which is, because of September 11, homeland security.\n  The work done--I have said this on the floor on a number of \noccasions--by the Appropriations Committee, led by the President pro \ntempore and Senator Stevens, is a hallmark piece of legislation. I \ncertainly hope we can get this out of conference in basically the same \nform that it left the Senate. It is very important legislation, \nimportant for the country. Not only does it take care, as I have \nindicated, of the homeland defense measures, but it also gives \nadditional support to our troops. And there is money there for some of \nthe other things we are doing in international relations. We ran out of \nmoney for disabled veterans. There are many things there that need to \nbe done.\n  In addition to that, we were able to get up the hate crimes \nlegislation. We on this side are terribly disappointed the minority \nwould not allow us to go forward on that. We thought we were \nthreatened. I guess they, the minority, followed through on their \nthreat that they were going to basically kill this bill by offering all \nkinds of amendments. They were unable to do that, but they did prevent \ncloture from being invoked.\n  The debt limit is now out. It is important. I am disappointed that \nthe country has turned on its head basically. Last year at this time, \nwe had a $4.7 trillion surplus. We now are basically spending in the \nred. That is too bad. But we had to extend the debt limit. We did that. \nIt was the responsible action. I hope the House will follow suit \nwithout games being played there.\n  We were able to dispose of the estate tax. I was interested. I \nlistened on public radio Saturday to Bill Gates's father, Mr. Gates, \ntalking about why he believed the estate tax was an important part of \nAmerica. Remember, this is Bill Gates's father. He basically said he \nwanted his children well taken care of, and he wanted his grandchildren \nwell taken care of, but it wasn't right to have no tax on an $85 \nbillion estate. That is basically what his son has. We were able to get \nrid of that.\n  Finally, we were able to have a good debate on the terrorism \nlegislation dealing with the insurance aspect of it. Now, in the \nmorning at 9:45, I feel confident we will invoke cloture on that very \nimportant legislation. We have been trying to move forward since last \nyear in December.\n  We have had a productive time. After this week, we have 1 week prior \nto going out for the Fourth of July recess. The leader announced on \nFriday that as soon as we complete the antiterrorism insurance \nlegislation, we are going to go to the Defense authorization bill. That \nis also extremely important. Senators Levin and Warner have worked very \nhard on that legislation. It is always a bill where there are lots of \namendments. I think this year will be no different. But it is something \nwe will finish prior to the July 4 recess.\n  We have our work cut out for us. I hope those people who have \namendments to offer on this legislation will do so.\n  As I have indicated, there will be no votes today. The vote will \noccur tomorrow morning on cloture. All first-degree amendments must be \nfiled before 4 p.m. today. All second-degree amendments must be filed \nbefore 9:40 a.m. tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S5624]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/17/senate-section/article/S5623-6", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5623-S5624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nnow resume consideration of S. 2600, which the clerk will report.\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2600) to ensure the continued financial capacity \n     of insurers to provide coverage for risks from terrorism.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Brownback amendment No. 3843, to prohibit the patentability \n     of human organisms.\n       Ensign amendment No. 3844 (to amendment No. 3843), to \n     prohibit the patentability of human organisms.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. What is the will of the Senate?\n  The Senator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3843\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nbringing up the issues. They are important ones before the country.\n  We are on the terrorism reinsurance bill, an amendment I have pending \non this bill. The amendment I have pending has to deal with the issue \nof whether you can patent a human embryo, patent a person, whether you \ncan patent a clone. I regret we are considering this amendment in this \nway. It was my hope that we would be able to have a set amount of time \non the floor to be able to openly debate the overall issue of human \ncloning. I was hopeful we would be able to have that debate in February \nor March of this year, but things came up, apparently, and we were not \nable to take this debate forward.\n  I am left with the only recourse I have as a Member of this body, and \nthat is presenting amendments to the body to consider the issue of \nwhether or not we should proceed forward with the issue of human \ncloning, which is proceeding forward in America today. I think the wise \ncourse of action at this time is for us, overall, to have a moratorium \non human cloning of all types for a 2-year time period. This will \nenable us to sort out what people really think and where this science \nwould take us. I would favor a ban on human cloning, in order that we \nwould not create human beings just for research purposes or for spare \nparts. But those issues will be left, perhaps, to address later this \nyear.\n\n  For now, we have a narrow issue before the body, and that is whether \nor not human clones should be allowed to be patented. The Patent Office \nhas issued a statement that it believes they should not grant patents \non human clones, that this is a violation of the 13th amendment to the \nConstitution on slavery.\n  The Patent and Trademark Office has a longstanding policy of not \npermitting patents on people. Within the past year, they have awarded a \npatent to the University of Missouri on the process of human cloning, \nas well as what is referred to as the products of that process.\n  It is clear that while the Patent and Trademark Office has an \nannounced policy and, in view of recent patents that have been issued, \nas well as the fate of some of the patents that are currently pending, \nthat the Congress should codify the view of the PTO in order to remove \nany ambiguity. We need to make it clear to the Patent Office that a \nhuman embryo created by a cloning process is a person, not a piece of \nproperty, not livestock that can be owned, and therefore should not be \nallowed to be patented. But there is a rub here because the Patent \nOffice is being asked to issue these patents on people. They are \nsaying, no, we should not grant these. A number of lawyers are \nchallenging that and saying: What is a human clone? What is the young \nhuman embryo. They are stating: It is not a person, it is a piece of \nproperty; therefore, we can patent this. That is why we want to have \nclarity coming out of the Congress--a clear determination that you \ncannot patent a person. That should be illegal and should back up the \nposition of the Patent and Trademarks Office.\n  We all know this debate is really about the future of humanity. It is \nmoving at a very rapid rate. Just a few years ago, the debate was over \nwhether or not the Federal Government should subsidize the destruction \nof embryos for the purpose of harvesting their inner-cell mass. That \ndebate was over the disposition of human embryos already in existence.\n  Then the debate moved to whether or not embryos can be specifically \ncreated for their destruction. Human cloning--and whether or not we \nshould utilize some of the most recent developments in the field of \nscience--to create embryos for research purposes has been one of the \nlatest debates. The next debate will be the issue of whether or not we \ncan take outside genetic material and put it into the human species to \nthe point where it can be reproduced in future generations of humans--\nwhere one generation of humans would decide the future of following \ngenerations. That is called germ line manipulation, and that will be up \nnext.\n  This involves the issue of slavery again. It is a debate about \nwhether or not individuals, and whether or not corporate America, can \nin fact patent and therefore control the destiny of a group of humans.\n  It is clear, as several have already commented, that the patenting of \npeople could very well lead to a commercial eugenics movement--where \npeople and traits are bought and sold by those in a position of power \nand authority.\n  The time will come--if this is allowed to continue--where human \nattributes are determined by a parents' pocketbook perhaps, rather than \nnature.\n\n  Human cloning tampers with nature in a very significant way. Now what \nsome in the corporate world want to do is start trafficking in human \nembryos--creating human embryo farms where embryos are mass produced on \nassembly lines by specific specifications and harvested for parts.\n  These corporate interests are now trying to begin patenting the \npeople they produce. As my colleagues are well aware, the University of \nMissouri has already been granted a patent on the human cloning \nprocess.\n  The time for clarity is now. This disturbing bioindustrialization of \nlife is continuing as I speak on the Senate floor. This debate is no \nlonger about yet another step down the path toward a brave new world; \nit is, as the commentator Charles Krauthammer put it, ``downhill \nskiing.'' It is not just a step, it is downhill skiing. We need to stop \nit now.\n  By denying private companies the ability to patent a human person, \nand barring them from patenting the process of human cloning, we will \nbe sending a very clear message that it is unacceptable to turn people \ninto property and then buy and sell them as if they were commodities.\n  We should not allow corporate America to traffic in human embryos. By \npreventing the patenting of people, we will be stopping this practice.\n  My amendment makes clear that it is not acceptable to patent people \nand not acceptable to patent the process of human cloning for the \npurpose and process of making people.\n  This is a very important issue--one that demands our immediate \nattention. I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture on the \nterrorism reinsurance bill so that we can have our debate on the \nemerging biotech sector that I have mentioned.\n  I want to address a couple of other issues. I have a letter I want to \nput forward for Members of the body to consider. It is from the \nPresident of the Biotechnology Industry Organization on the issue of \npatenting people and of embryos, Carl Feldbaum. He was writing to an \nindividual and stated their organization's opposition to the patenting \nof human embryos.\n  He states this:\n\n       Thank you for your thoughtful letter, which posed \n     reasonable, provocative questions. With regard to the primary \n     question you raised, BIO opposes patents on cloned human \n     embryos. Many issues surrounding the research remain to be \n     resolved, but on that matter our position is decided.\n\n  That is from Carl Feldbaum, President of Biotechnology Industry \nOrganization, the lead organization for biotechnology, which is opposed \nto the patenting of people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record at \nthe end of my statement.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I urge Members to look at this. Here is \nthe lead organization in the country that one might think is probably \nmost in favor of patenting clones; yet they state they are opposed to \nit.\n\n[[Page S5625]]\n\n  By passing this amendment to ban the patenting of human clones, it \ndoes not ban, does not stop, does not even slow down the issue of human \ncloning. That will proceed. The research is allowed. I don't think it \nshould be. I think we should join the House and the President in \ncalling for an end to human cloning. This body has not done that. But \nthis amendment does not address that issue. The only issue in front of \nthe body in this amendment is whether or not the Patent Office will be \nallowed to patent human embryos and human clones. That is the only \nissue involved in this amendment--whether or not that patenting will \noccur.\n\n  If my amendment passes, we will say: Patent Office, do not allow \npatents of human clones or embryos, but if people want to continue \nresearch on human clones, they can do so. If they want to continue to \ndevelop human clones, they can do so. I don't think it is wise or the \nright thing. I think it should stop, but that is not involved in this \namendment. This is strictly about the issue of whether patents can be \nissued on a human clone. In that sense, it is a very clear issue of the \ndivision of what do you think a clone is? A person or property? In our \njurisprudence system, it is one or the other--a person or a piece of \nproperty. If it is a piece of property, it can be patented. If it is a \nperson, it cannot. That is against the 13th amendment to the \nConstitution on antislavery. If it is property, it can be patented.\n  So it really goes to your fundamental view of how you view young \nlife, the human embryo. Is it a person on the continuum of life, or is \nit a piece of property to be disposed of as its master chooses? Which \nis it? That is the issue in front of this body--whether this young \nhuman at this stage, if it were nurtured to grow into a full birth, \nfull human, by anybody's definition, is considered a person or \nproperty.\n  Now, some arguments were put forward last week on what this would do \nin the field of human cloning. Again, I state to my colleagues that it \nis not going to ban human cloning. This would simply limit the \npatenting process of human clones, and this is something that the \nPatent Office seeks clarifying authority on as well.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, to \nnot support the cloture motion on terrorism reinsurance. This is the \nonly vehicle we have open to us to be able to get these important and \nvital issues in front of the body.\n  We would like to get a clear up-or-down vote on this issue, and this \nis what we need to do to get that vote before the body. I hope my \ncolleagues will study this carefully and realize what they are and are \nnot voting on with this particular motion.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The cloture motion having been presented \nunder rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Brownback \n     amendment No. 3843:\n         Jon Kyl, Jeff Sessions, Don Nickles, Jim Inhofe, John \n           Ensign, Rick Santorum, Michael B. Enzi, Bob Smith, \n           Chuck Hagel, Mitch McConnell, Tim Hutchinson, George \n           Allen, Peter Fitzgerald, Trent Lott, Sam Brownback, \n           Larry E. Craig.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I admit filing a cloture motion is a \nvery strong statement to make. However, I believe I have been very \npatient. The Senate has a responsibility to begin addressing this very \nimportant issue. It started last fall. We thought we were going to get \nit addressed in the February-March timeframe, and now we are in June.\n  My cloture motion is meant to ensure that if the majority leader \nfails to invoke cloture on the underlying bill, we will then get a vote \non this amendment of patenting people. The Senate needs to begin voting \non these issues, and I am going to begin trying to get votes on my \namendment as we go along the process.\n  I was a little surprised last week to see that the Senate majority \nleader filed a cloture motion on the terrorism insurance bill so \nquickly--another parliamentary move to close debate on this very \nimportant issue of human patenting. I had hoped we could have had a \nfair debate and vote on my amendment. Unfortunately, the leadership is \ntrying to prevent my amendment coming to a vote. Therefore, in the \nevent the majority leader fails to invoke cloture on the underlying \nbill tomorrow, I am going to get a vote on my amendment, and that is \nwhat I seek.\n  This should be a clear issue for people to decide where they stand on \nthe issue of patenting of human clones and human embryos. That is why I \nfiled this cloture motion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. What is the will of the Senate?\n  The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there has been some discussion as to why the \nmajority leader filed a motion to invoke cloture. Remember, last week \nwe finished work on a bill and were asked by those who said they \nfavored a discussion and favored the antiterrorism legislation to go to \nit on Wednesday, and they said: Give us an extra day. Of course, the \nextra day did not mean anything. Basically, there were no amendments \nfiled. One amendment was filed, and we waited and waited. Then Friday \nwas the same.\n  We have a lot of work to do. As the President pro tempore knows, we \nhave all the appropriations bills to do. They are going to have to be \ndone in a very condensed period of time. As soon as we get some \nnumbers, all the subcommittee chairs in the Senate will be anxious to \nproceed.\n  Again, as the Presiding Officer knows, we tried very hard when we \nwere doing the supplemental appropriations bill to get some numbers, \ncomplete it, have it a part of that legislation, but people objected. \nThat is too bad because we could this week be marking up some \nappropriations bills.\n  In the Senate, we have a finite amount of time to do an infinite \nnumber of items. I certainly support the majority leader filing a \nmotion to invoke cloture, and in the future, when people are not \nserious about offering amendments to legislation, then he should do so \nagain.\n  We have been very patient waiting for people to file amendments on \nlegislation. We just cannot stand around in quorum calls all day and \nthen deal with amendments that have nothing to do with the basic \nlegislation that the whole country says is important.\n  I understand the seriousness of the Senator from Kansas. He believes \nvery deeply in what he is trying to do. I admire his conviction. But \nothers have different convictions and feel just as strongly. The \nSenator will have other opportunities to move this issue. Also, the \nmajority leader lived up to his commitment to the Senator from Kansas. \nHe said he would make sure there was an opportunity to bring this up.\n  A unanimous consent request was offered. The only thing wrong with it \nwas who got to vote last. The Senator from Kansas, for reasons he \nbelieves are important, would not agree to the unanimous consent \nrequest because he did not get the last vote. As a result of that, we \nare in the posture of these issues being brought up on unrelated \nlegislation.\n  I think the best thing to do is to bring up a freestanding bill and \ndeal with the issues he believes are important. It can be debated on \nboth sides. It would be a clean way to do it. Everyone realizes--the \nBanking Committee is dealing with terrorism insurance legislation--no \nmatter what happens, something dealing with cloning is not going to \nstay in conference. It is a banking bill. We would be better off with a \nfreestanding bill.\n  I personally do not understand why my friend, the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Kansas, would not accept the unanimous consent \nrequest, but that is a decision he made. I still underscore the fact \nthat he has a right to do what he is doing, and the majority leader has \na right to do what he is doing to terminate debate on this bill which I \nam confident and hopeful will happen in the morning.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the Senator \nfrom Nevada. I have a great deal of respect for Senator Reid and for \nwhat he is doing. There was a unanimous consent request propounded \nbefore, and I\n\n[[Page S5626]]\n\nagreed not to amend the basic bill on cloning. We had it agreed to with \nno amendments. I have a series of four or five amendments. This was not \ngoing to be an open debate about the issue. This was going to be two \ncloture motion votes at the end. There were to be no amendments, which \nI thought was a relinquishing of my rights, and we would just do two \ncloture motion votes. The order of the cloture motions became very \nimportant.\n  If we are going to have two votes on a very big issue, the last one \nis going to be the one that would have the most possibility. Most \nMembers of the body believe we should be doing something on cloning. If \nthe first one does not get 60, it is highly likely the second one will \nbe in a better position because a number of Members of the body may \nsay, I am with you on this because something needs to be done on \ncloning, and would peel over and vote for the second cloture motion.\n  I gave up a lot of ground and rights by agreeing to a tight timeframe \nand only two votes on arguably one of the biggest bioethical issues of \nour era. When we were not given a better position in the vote, it \nlooked to me that the process was set to come up with a certain \noutcome. I cannot agree to that, not after this much effort has been \nput into the overall issue. That is why I disagreed to the unanimous \nconsent request, and that is why I am bringing this issue up now. We \nneed to get it considered. This is a vehicle on which we can consider \nit.\n  We have a limited number of legislative days. The body needs to speak \non these important issues. I think it is better if we just pull this \nissue up for a vote even before the cloture motion vote so it is a \nclean issue and people can decide. It does not remove the issue of \ncloning. Cloning can continue to take place in America and \nwill, whether this amendment passes or not. This is strictly about \nwhether the process of creating human beings or the human person itself \ncan be patented. I think that this vote should be relatively easy for \nmost Members of this body to take. That is why I bring it forward and \ncontinue to ask that the cloture petition of the majority leader not be \nagreed to at this time so we can consider this important legislation.\n\n  I thank the floor manager for being willing to work with us. He has \nbeen very gracious and thoughtful, but I wanted to express my reasons \nfor wanting to take the stance that I did.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                            Biotechnology Industry\n\n\n                                                 Organization,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2002.\n     Mr. William Kristol,\n     Chairman, Stop Human Cloning, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Kristol: Thank you for your thoughtful letter, \n     which posed reasonable, provocative questions. With regard to \n     the primary question you raised, BIO opposes patents on \n     cloned human embryos. Many issues surrounding the research \n     remain to be resolved, but on that matter our position is \n     decided.\n       I would like very much to discuss in person and at length \n     your other concerns about our industry, and stem cell \n     research in particular. Perhaps we can arrange something \n     after the Brownback vote. Although I wish we had begun this \n     conversation before the issues became so polarized, I welcome \n     the opportunity you've opened for a dialogue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Carl B. Feldbaum,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, \nnotwithstanding the recess of the Senate, Members may still file \namendments until 3 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I rise to address the pending \nlegislation, S. 2600 which is designed to provide financial assistance \nto the insurance industry concerning coverages and losses due to acts \nof terrorism--for the purpose of ensuring the continued availability of \nterrorism insurance coverage. I must say from the outset that I \ndisagree with this legislation, not based on its aims, but the manner \nin which the legislation is structured and the way it seeks to \naccomplish its stated goals.\n  This is an issue that the Senate sought to address last fall, during \nthe height of the national market and security crises that were \nprecipitated by the September 11 terrorist attacks. In light of the \nfact that our commercial markets had never experienced a terrorist \nattack and losses in the magnitude that occurred on September 11, a \ngreat deal of uncertainty was stirred in the marketplace. Claiming that \nthey had no experience in pricing such events, insurance companies \nthreatened wholesale cancellations of terrorism coverage by the end of \nthe year of 2001. Given these circumstances--and the severe threat that \nwas posed to the stability of key industries and markets--clearly \nCongress was compelled to act.\n  Consequently, I, along with Senator McCain, decided it was necessary \nfor the Commerce Committee to take action. We made this decision in \nlight of the Commerce Committee's longstanding jurisdiction over the \nbusiness of insurance, and given that the committee had been working on \nlegislation to address the availability of property and casualty \ninsurance in areas prone to natural disasters, which involved issues \nsimilar to those relating to terrorism insurance. I would like to \nemphasize that the Commerce Committee has exercised jurisdiction over \nthe business of insurance for the past 50 years. We have considered \nlegislation relating to: the creation of risk pools and special \ninsurance funds for insuring against natural disasters; the repeal of \nMcCarran-Ferguson Act and the Federal regulation of insurance; Federal \noversight of the solvency of insurance companies; the prohibition of \ndiscrimination in the sale of insurance; insurance redlining; Federal \nregulation of automobile insurance; and the availability of liability \nand property and casualty insurance, which are the very issues this \nlegislation seeks to address.\n  The committee convened a hearing, which included testimony from \nTreasury Secretary O'Neill, as well as state insurance officials, \nacademics, the Consumer Federation of America, CFA, the National \nTaxpayers Union, NTU, and the insurance industry. I should note that \nthe main point that was emphasized by the independent witnesses is that \na program could and should be designed to ensure the insurance \ncompanies used their own resources to provide the necessary backstop to \nstabilize the market. As they, and state officials advised, the best \nway to do this was through the creation of a risk pool.\n  Following the hearing, along with Senator McCain and other members of \nthe committee, I began to work with state regulators, CFA and NTU to \ncraft legislation along these lines. Senator McCain and I came to an \nagreement except for on the matter of punitive damages. Consequently, \nwe introduced two separate bills--S. 1743, my bill, and S. 1744, his \nbill--both of which would have required a payback by the companies.\n\n  I will briefly describe my legislation. As I noted, the legislation \nwas constructed from risk pool proposals submitted by the insurance \nindustry, state insurance commissioners, the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, CFA, and the National Taxpayers Union. It has been endorsed by \n13 current state insurance commissioners--Republican and Democrat.\n  The legislation would establish a risk pool through the creation of a \nnational fund--known as the National Terrorism Fund hereinafter \nreferred to as ``the fund''. The fund will be created within the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce, in conjunction with a 10-member Advisory \nCommittee, which would include the Secretary of Treasury, State \ninsurance regulators, and insurance industry representatives.\n  The fund will be capitalized through an annual assessment of 3 \npercent of an insurer's previous calendar year direct written gross \npremiums. The companies writing coverages for the major property and \ncasualty lines would be required to participate.\n  All commercial insurance companies will be required to participate in \nthe fund. Providers of personal insurance coverage will have the option \nof participating if they believe they need additional reinsurance.\n  Companies will be authorized to pass through the 3 percent assessment \nto\n\n[[Page S5627]]\n\ntheir policyholders. Companies seeking to raise rates beyond these \nlevels will be required to report and justify, with substantial \nevidence, such actions to State insurance regulators. This is designed \nto deter companies from using terrorism as an excuse to raise rates \noverall. Additionally, the bill will maintain enforcement of states' \nfair trade practices and fair claims practices and laws.\n  Each participating insurer would have a 10 percent retention level \nbased on its previous year's direct written premiums. Once a company \nsuffers losses due to terrorism that exceeds its retention level, the \ncompany would be permitted to receive payments from the fund. For \nexample, if a company has direct written premiums of $100 million, its \nretention would be $10 million. Some have advised that the retention \nlevel should be as high as 20 percent. The bill originally contained a \n20 percent retention, but it was lowered to 10 percent in response to \nconcerns by the industry.\n  Once a company has met its retention levels, the fund will cover its \nremaining losses as follows: 90 percent during the first year (90/10). \nFor the second and third years, a company will be permitted to select \nthe amount of coverage from the following options: 90 percent coverage \nof losses for a premium of 5 percent of its direct written premiums and \nsurplus; 80 percent coverage for a 4 percent premium; and 70 percent \ncoverage for 3 percent premium.\n  If at any time during the 3 years of the program, the losses from the \nparticipating companies exceed the fund's capacity, the fund will be \nauthorized to borrow, from the Federal Treasury, moneys to cover the \nlosses up to $100 billion. The fund, through assessments on \nall participating companies, would be required to repay the loan. The \nfund and the companies would be given as long as 20 years, if \nnecessary, to repay the loans at standard market interest. If there are \noutstanding loans due after the expiration of the fund on December 31, \n2004, the companies will continue to be assessed until the loans are \nrepaid.\n\n  If at the end of the program the fund has a positive balance, the \nparticipating companies would be allowed to recoup the funds--based on \nthe proportion of each company's contribution--contingent upon a \nguarantee that the money will be placed in a special catastrophic \nreserve account. That account could be used only to pay for losses \nrelated to terrorism, and major catastrophes, earthquakes, hurricanes, \nand tsunamis. Any company seeking to use the money for other purposes \nwould be subject to criminal penalties.\n  I should also note that as time began to run out last year, I \nreceived a call from Secretary O'Neill offering to work together to \nensure the passage of a measure to deal with the crisis. I accepted the \ninvitation and had my staff and the administration officials working \ntogether the next morning on a compromise bill. We agreed to work upon \nthe outlines of a 1-year stopgap measure. Unfortunately, the Secretary \nmet strong objections from the Republican side of the Chamber.\n  I still believe that any legislation that is passed at this point \nshould require a payback. This is especially the case given reports \nthat the market has stabilized and insurance coverage is available for \nmost businesses. The bill before us essentially provides for 2 years of \npotential unnecessary payments to insurance companies, who could reap a \nwindfall at the expense of the taxpayers.\n  I also believe that this legislation should not be used as a vehicle \nfor Federal tort reform. This issue killed the bill last year, and may \nvery well derail it this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/17/senate-section/article/S5627-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, today the Senate Republican Leader and I \nare pleased to reestablish the bipartisan Senate NATO Observer Group, \nor SNOG. We originally established the SNOG in April 1997 to advise the \nfull Senate on the historic first round of enlargement of the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization, NATO. It served as an important line of \ncommunication between the Senate and NATO and the Senate and candidate \ncountries in the months prior to the July 1997 NATO summit in Madrid at \nwhich Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary were admitted to the \nalliance. The SNOG and the information it generated was central to the \nSenate's ratification of the protocols of accession in April 1998.\n  The Senate debate in 1998 foreshadowed further enlargement of NATO, \nand in June 2001, the North Atlantic Council determined that NATO would \nadmit at least one candidate country at the November 2002 summit in \nPrague. In reestablishing the SNOG, we are asking this bipartisan group \nof our colleagues to closely monitor the enlargement process and to \nkeep the rest of the Senate fully informed as we move to another \nhistoric decision at Prague. The SNOG will work with the \nAdministration, our NATO allies, and the NATO candidate countries, of \nwhich there are nine. The fact that nine countries have been designated \nas candidates only highlights the importance of the SNOG in assessing \neach country's progress in meeting the qualifications for accession and \nreporting to the Senate on that progress.\n  The Senate takes its constitutional role of advise and consent on \ntreaties very seriously. The protocols of accession signed by new NATO \nmembers are considered amendments to the North Atlantic Treaty and will \nrequire the advice and consent of the Senate. The inclusion of new \nmember countries into NATO involves a commitment, under Article V of \nthe Treaty, to defend those countries in case of attack--a solemn \ncommitment and one we will not undertake lightly. It is in the security \ninterests of the United States to see NATO expanded, to create a Europe \nthat is whole and free. But it is also the solemn responsibility of the \nU.S. Senate to look carefully at any new commitments to which American \ntroops might be subject.\n  The SNOG will be chaired by the Chairman of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware, and co-chaired \nby Senator Helms. The Senate Majority Leader and Republican Leader will \nbe members, ex officio. The other Democratic Senators on the SNOG will \nbe Senators Robert Byrd of West Virginia, Jean Carnahan of Missouri, \nMax Cleland of Georgia, Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, Richard Durbin of \nIllinois, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, Tim Johnson of \nSouth Dakota, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, \nCarl Levin of Michigan, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, Barbara \nMikulski of Maryland, Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, Robert Torricelli of \nNew Jersey, and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Daschle in \nreestablishing the Senate NATO Observer Group. When we first \nestablished the SNOG in April 1997, I emphasized that the Senate be in \non the ground floor of the NATO enlargement process. Because it was \nbipartisan, the SNOG cut across party lines as well as committee \njurisdictions, and ensured that the Senate would be heard both during \nthe NATO enlargement process and after the decisions were taken in \nMadrid. Today, by reestablishing the SNOG, we are ensuring that the \nSenate will be fully informed prior to the next round\n\n[[Page S5628]]\n\nof enlargement this November in Prague and in its consideration of \nratification.\n  On June 15, 2001, President Bush gave an historic speech in Warsaw, \nPoland at which he said that ``all of Europe's new democracies, from \nthe Baltic to the Black Sea and all that lie between, should have the \nsame chance for security and freedom, and the same chance to join the \ninstitutions of Europe, as Europe's old democracies.'' His audience, \nthe Poles, understood what he was talking about. Less than two decades \nago, they suffered under the oppressive weight of the Soviet Union. \nToday, they enjoy freedom, protected by their membership in NATO. As \nthe Senate considers the expansion of NATO to include other Eastern \nEuropean countries, we should remember the words of the President. We \nmust also act deliberately, examining the qualifications of each \ncandidate country and the commitments that their accession to NATO \nentails. It is for that purpose that we are reestablishing the SNOG.\n  The other Republican Senators on the SNOG will be Wayne Allard of \nColorado, Sam Brownback of Kansas, Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado, \nThad Cochran of Mississippi, Mike DeWine of Ohio, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, \nChuck Hagel of Nebraska, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Don Nickles of \nOklahoma, Pat Roberts of Kansas, Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Jeff \nSessions of Alabama, Gordon Smith of Oregon, Ted Stevens of Alaska, \nGeorge Voinovich of Ohio, and John Warner of Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/17/senate-section/article/S5628-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN HONOR OF BECKY MILLS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fine public servant, \ngreat Nevadan, and friend, Ms. Becky Mills. On May 3, 2002, after \nnearly 25 years of employment with the National Park Service, Becky \nretired from her position as Superintendent of Great Basin National \nPark.\n  Becky Mills learned to love the great outdoors as a young child. Her \ngrandfather took her on camping and fishing trips to Yosemite, where \nshe interacted with Park Rangers around the campfire, and her \nparticipation in the Girl Scouts allowed her to explore more national \nparks: Yellowstone, Sequoia/Kings Canyon, Grand Canyon, Zion, Bryce, \nLake Mead, and others.\n  Her lifelong interest in nature contributed to her decision to \ndedicate her life to protecting the environment. While hiking to the \nMount Everest Base Camp in the Himalayas in the fall of 1976, Becky \ndecided to change careers so her professional life would match her \npersonal commitment to the environment. Becky joined the National Park \nService in May of 1978 as Regional Chief of Youth Programs for the \nPacific West Region. Her decision proved to be beneficial for the Park \nService and, ultimately, for Nevada.\n  In 1995 Becky was appointed Superintendent of Great Basin National \nPark in Nevada. In this capacity, she worked to protect and enhance the \nnatural and cultural resources of the park and the surrounding lands \nand community. To help preserve the park's history, Becky has been \ninstrumental in planning and designing a new Great Basin National Park \nVisitor Learning Center. Her dedication to the Park Service, and \nparticularly to the people of east-central Nevada is both inspirational \nand much appreciated.\n  I extend to her my most sincere congratulations and appreciation for \nher commitment to Great Basin National Park, the environment, and \npublic service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/17/senate-section/article/S5628-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         POEMS ON SEPTEMBER 11\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I received two poems written by a \nconstituent of mine, Ira Somers from Nevada, about the terrorist \nattacks of September 11. Reading these poems, I was reminded of the \ncountry's great sorrow following that tragic day and the ensuing \nstrength and compassion that Americans demonstrated afterwards as they \ncame to the aid of those in need, made donations, cleaned up, and put \ntheir lives back together. But what struck me most was the poet's \nreminder to reaffirm and continue this spirit, to seek out ways every \nday to lend a helping hand and to promote peace and goodwill.\n  I would like to share these two poems written by Ira Somers. I ask \nunanimous consent that the poems be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows.\n\n                        The Day of Nine-One-One\n\n        (Written the day of the memorial service for this event)\n\n     It began as a quiet day\n     Lives were normal in every way.\n     The sun arose with fullest light\n     And moved the shadows of the night.\n     But this was not to last for long,\n     Two big giants tall and strong\n     Which seemed to stand for what is good\n     Were struck by evil where they stood.\n\n     'Twas on the day of nine-one-one\n     That they were lost to everyone.\n     There they were, and now they're not,\n     And where they stood's a gruesome spot.\n     How could these giants of our day\n     Be brought to naught in such as way\n     To leave this mass of jumbled parts\n     And bring such grief to all our hearts?\n\n     We sensed the feelings of despair\n     In those who walked most everywhere\n     To find the ones that they had lost\n     And bring them back at any cost.\n     Souls were touched by the kindly deeds\n     Of those who toiled for other's needs,\n     And how they struggled day and night\n     Against this wrong that had no right.\n\n     A vicious crash at the Pentagon\n     Tore at the souls of every one,\n     And word of heroes in the air\n     Brought tears to eyes most everywhere.\n     We all can learn from such great loss\n     To look at need before the cost\n     When giving help to anyone\n     And not say quit 'til peace has won.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Post Nine-One-One\n\n(Written the day the recovery and cleanup operations were concluded by \n               a ceremony at the World Trade Center site)\n\n     There where those giants stood so tall\n     They've cleared away and moved it all,\n     And nothing's left for one to see\n     But empty space with memories.\n\n     Thinking back to pre-nine-one-one\n     And the kinds of things we'd have done.\n     No red flag would have caused a stir\n     We were so vain and so cocksure.\n\n     But hearts were changed by nine-one-one\n     Which touched the souls of everyone.\n     There was oneness not seen before\n     With firm resolve there'd be no more.\n\n     Now, time can take a ho-hum toll\n     So let's not slack on our real goal.\n     To these vile men this was no game\n     And there are more who'd do the same.\n\n     In all we do let us never cease\n     To be a force in the cause of peace,\n     And let the acts of that sad day\n     Change our lives in permanent ways.\n\n     Let us avoid all selfish goals\n     And lift our sites and pledge our souls\n     To always stand and work as one,\n     And keep it up 'til peace has won.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/17/senate-section/article/S5628-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5628-S5629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GAO REPORT ON CAMBODIA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the conclusion of the General \nAccounting Office's, GAO, recently released report on Cambodia is \ndeeply troubling--but comes as no surprise to those of us who have long \nfollowed developments in that country.\n  While GAO has noted some progress by the Royal Government of \nCambodia, RGC, to implement public finance, military, and land \nmanagement reforms, the lack of headway in other areas--including legal \nand judicial, public administration, anticorruption, and forestry \nmanagement--is glaringly absent.\n  Until the RGC fully implements legal reforms and embraces the rule of \nlaw, the international community has no choice but to consider any and \nall progress in Cambodia as limited and impermanent.\n  The obstacles to good governance in Cambodia are many, but the lack \nof political will by the ruling Cambodian People's Party, CPP, to \nimplement much needed reforms poses the single greatest challenge to \nmeaningful democratic, economic and social development.\n  The abuses of Prime Minister Hun Sen and the CPP are legion, and it \nis past time that the international community holds them accountable \nfor their repressive actions. This Senator has not forgotten the many \ninnocent Cambodians killed and injured in the March 1997 grenade attack \nin Phnom Penh, or the Prey Veng farmers who continue to gather in the \ncapital following massive floods caused by the Cambodian military's \nrampant illegal logging.\n  The international community would be wise to hold the RGC accountable \nnot for what it says, but for what it does.

Mr. President, I rise with pleasure today to commend the \nNational Association of Letter Carriers, NALC for their unprecedented \ncommitment to answering the call of reducing hunger in the United \nStates. Over 30 million Americans go hungry everyday. In the summer \nmonths, the problem is particularly acute because the demand for \nemergency food is high and donations are at their lowest yearly point. \nHowever, on May 11, almost 62.7 million pounds of food was collected in \nthe 10th Annual ``Stamp Out Hunger'' food drive as a result of the \ndedication of NALC members.\n  Through a combined effort by the Priority Mail division of the U.S. \nPostal Service and the Campbell Soup Company, postcards promoting the \nfood drive were delivered to over 100 million postal customers in all \n50 States, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. Then, on \nMay 11, in addition to their daily postal duties, letter carriers \nvolunteered to pick up donations, sort through them, and deliver the \ncontributions to local community food banks. About 1,500 local NALC \nbranches throughout the U.S. were involved in the drive.\n  Others involved in the success of the nation's largest one-day effort \nto combat hunger were Saturn-UAW Union partnership Initiative, local \nUnited Ways, the AFL-CIO, and Family Circle creator and cartoonist Bill \nKeane. The Campbell Soup Company donated one million pounds of canned \ngoods.\n  The National Association of Letter Carriers is the union of city \ndelivery carriers employed by the U.S. Postal Service which has a long \ntradition of participating in community service. The NALC ``Stamp Out \nHunger'' food drive is just one example of the members' generosity and \ncommitment to the communities that they serve.\n  It is fitting that we applaud the sense of community displayed by the \nmembers of the NALC, who like their fellow postal workers, have \ndemonstrated their dedication and pride in carrying out their daily \njobs. I urge my colleagues to join me in commending the National \nAssociation of Letter Carriers, their sponsors, and the millions of \nAmericans who donated food on May 11. Their geneorsity will help ease \nthe plight of hunger for millions for men, women, and children in the \nUnited States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/17/senate-section/article/S5629-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MATTHEW EVANS\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a valued member \nof our Senate family, Matthew Evans, the Senior Landscape Architect \nhere at the United States Capitol, who was recently honored by the \nNational Arbor Day Foundation with their 2002 Good Steward Award.\n  Through the years, Matthew has earned numerous awards including the \nAmerican Society of Landscape Architects' once-in-a-century Centennial \nMedallion in recognition of the Capitol Grounds as a national landmark \nfor outstanding landscape architecture. Gardens designed by him have \nbeen featured in films and magazines. These awards recognize him for \nhis outstanding professional abilities and his invaluable contributions \nto our U.S. Capitol Building and Grounds.\n  We are fortunate to have Matthew's practiced eye and professional \nskill at work for us here at the Capitol. He and his staff are \nmeticulous in the care they provide a preserve and enhance the grounds \nof this treasured national landmark. Matthew also collaborates with \ncountless groups and representatives from other government agencies, \ncivic organizational and community groups to ensure that the many \nimportant ceremonial and special events held on these historic grounds \noccur in a way that protects and preserves our invaluable greenery.\n  Each day of the year, thousands of Americans as well as foreign \ndignitaries and guests tour our Capitol and grounds. Many of them \nlinger to snap photos and to view the magnificent old trees and \nbeautiful plantings here on our Capitol grounds. These landscape \ntreasures add immeasurably to the memories our visitors carry away from \ntheir visits here. Matthew Evans now faces perhaps the greatest \nchallenge of his career. He must protect, to the greatest extent \npossible, the trees and grounds of the Capitol during the construction \nof the new Visitors Center and then restore this historic property to \nits beautiful state. We all wish him well in this important endeavor.\n  I congratulate Matthew on receiving the prestigious Good Steward \nAward and I thank him for his dedicated service. I am glad to know he \nwill be continuing his skillful and wise stewardship of the invaluable \narchitectural landscape legacy we enjoy here at the U.S. \nCapitol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/17/senate-section/article/S5629-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL HISTORY DAY\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I stand to honor three \noutstanding California students: Michael Crowe, Jennifer McWilliams, \nand Heather Scott.\n  These students are finalists in the National History Day Contest. \nThey are also among 15 students who have been selected from a national \npool of 700,000 to display their work at the White House Visitors \nCenter this week.\n  National History Day is a year-long event in which students prepare \nexhibits, papers, documentaries, and performances to explain not only \nthe ``who'' and the ``what'' of history but also the ``why.''\n  In his performance ``Castro, Cuba, and the Revolution the World Will \nNever Forget,'' Michael Crowe, a seventh grader at Fruitvale Junior \nHigh School in Bakersfield, explores the relations between the United \nStates, Cuba, and Russia during the Cold War.\n  As part of his research, Michael spoke to former Secretary of Defense \nRobert McNamara and to CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite.\n  He also gained a unique perspective on the era by interviewing the \nchildren of Fidel Castro and Nikita Khrushchev.\n  Working together, eighth graders Jennifer McWilliams and Heather \nScott, who also attend Fruitvale Junior High, created an exhibit \nentitled ``On the Trail to Revolution: Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam \nWar.''\n  In addition to speaking with Robert McNamara and Walter Cronkite, the \ngirls interviewed veterans, refugees, and a Vietnamese expatriate who \nlived in Vietnam during the war to understand the conflict and its \neffects on our Nation.\n  Like other National History Day participants, Michael, Jennifer, and \nHeather chose their topics last fall. They spent a year conducting \nextensive research and analyzing past events.\n  Michael, Jennifer, and Heather then joined over half a million other \nstudents and entered their National History Day projects in local \ncompetitions.\n  From these local competitions, approximately 2,000 participants are \nchosen to proceed to the national finals. There, they compete for cash \nand scholarships.\n  Michael, Jennifer, and Heather are among this year's finalists, an \naccomplishment remarkable in itself. However, these students also \ndemonstrated great enthusiasm and superior effort while completing \ntheir projects.\n  This earned them the privilege of exhibiting their work at the White \nHouse Visitors Center.\n  Michael, Jennifer, and Heather performed truly first-rate research \nand demonstrated initiative and dedication beyond their years. Their \nprojects are of exceptional quality.\n  These young people have earned my sincere admiration, and I \ncongratulate them on their achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/17/senate-section/article/S5629-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5629-S5630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak \nabout hate crimes\n\n[[Page S5630]]\n\nlegislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last year. \nThe Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred April 27, \n2001 at Kent State University in Ohio. Mikell Nagy, an openly gay \nuniversity student, was eating breakfast with friends when he heard \nsomeone make an anti-gay comment toward another friend across the room. \nWhen Mr. Nagy went to see if his friend was okay, a man walked up \nbehind him, called him ``faggot'' and punched him in the face. \nAccording to witnesses, blood was pouring from cuts above his left eye \nand his two front teeth were chipped during the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/17/senate-section/article/S5630-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING CAPTAIN STEPHEN A.

Mr. President, I am proud to take this moment to \nsalute the incredible 25-year record of SunLine Transit Agency, which \nprovides service to the Coachella Valley. SunLine Transit Agency is a \nleader in clean fuels technology, operating all its transit buses and \nother vehicles on alternate fuels.\n  SunLine is clearly ahead of its time. It was the first public transit \nagency in the nation to convert its fleet to cleaner burning natural \ngas, the first to co-develop, with private and public sector partners, \nrenewable hydrogen generation and education facilities, and the lead \nagency in the Coachella Valley's award-winning U.S. Department of \nEnergy Clean Cities program.\n  SunLine's clean fuel buses have driven 25 million clean air miles, \nand have carried 4 million passengers per year in 1999, 2000 and 2001. \nSunLine has hosted visitors from near and far, including foreign \nministers, ambassadors, energy officials, automakers and energy \nproviders. It has also helped other transit properties and fleet \noperators around the world convert to clean fuels.\n  I had the great pleasure to tour SunLine's state-of-art facilities \nand meet its wonderful staff. Last February, I presented the agency \nwith my Conservation Champion Award and took a ride in its hydrogen \npowered SunBug. As I stood under the brillant blue sky of the Coachella \nValley, I felt proud knowing that California's SunLine Transit Agency \nis leading the way for the nation with innovative approaches to provide \nrenewable energy.\n  I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to Richard \nCromwell, III, General Manager and CEO of SunLine, and all of SunLine's \nstaff. They have successfully made it a leader for California and the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/17/senate-section/article/S5630-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/17/senate-section/article/S5630-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/17/senate-section/article/S5630-5", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-7463.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relative to the \n     rights of women in Afghanistan; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n                           Senate Resolution\n\n       Whereas, During the past four years, the Taliban had gained \n     military control over virtually all of Afghanistan; and\n       Whereas, The Taliban's earliest action upon establishing \n     rule in Kabul was to impose strict segregation of clinics and \n     hospitals by gender and to prohibit access by women and \n     girls; and\n       Whereas, The Taliban had prohibited most women from \n     working, required the wearing of an enveloping burqa on pain \n     of punishment, denies girls access to schooling, prohibited \n     women from leaving their homes without a close male family \n     member for escort and imposed other draconian restrictions on \n     women's mobility and access to humanitarian aid, health care \n     and education; and\n       Whereas, A full-length study of the effects of the \n     Taliban's policies on women's health and human rights, \n     conducted by the human rights organization Physicians for \n     Human Rights (PHR), was published in the August 1998 edition \n     of the Journal of the American Medical Association; and\n       Whereas, The study, which has been revisited and updated in \n     1999 and 2000, showed that 81% of respondents reported a \n     decline in their mental health, 42% met the criteria for \n     post-traumatic stress disorder, 97% met the criteria for \n     major depression and 86% demonstrated significant symptoms of \n     anxiety; and\n       Whereas, The women interviewed by PHR overwhelmingly \n     rejected the Taliban's interpretation of Islam and of Afghan \n     history and culture and expressed their strong support for \n     women's equality and immediate access to health care and \n     education; and\n       Whereas, In July 1998, the Taliban ordered all humanitarian \n     nongovernmental organizations out of Afghanistan for refusing \n     to move their living quarters into a facility on the \n     outskirts of Kabul which lacked water and electricity; and\n       Whereas, The vicious and unprecedented attack on the United \n     States on September 11, 2001, that resulted in thousands upon \n     thousands of deaths of American citizens, has been linked to \n     the Taliban; and\n       Whereas, Subsequent attacks on Afghanistan by the United \n     States Armed Forces as well as civil unrest between Afghan \n     factions have led to the fall of the Taliban in some Afghan \n     cities, including Kabul; and\n       Whereas, The new Afghan government has made efforts to \n     restore the voice of Afghan women by naming two women to \n     cabinet-level positions, including Health Minister and the \n     Minister of Women's Affairs; and\n       Whereas, While these very recent developments in \n     Afghanistan seem to indicate a movement toward establishing \n     women's rights and restoring their civil liberties, a great \n     deal of time and money needs to be invested to elevate the \n     status of women and to allow them full participation in \n     society: Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania condemn the Taliban's discrimination against \n     women; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania memorialize the President and the Congress of \n     the United States to publicly disapprove of these atrocities, \n     take whatever steps necessary to end the discrimination and \n     violence against women and urge the full restoration of their \n     rights; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate of Pennsylvania urge the United \n     States Government, as well as the United Nation's \n     humanitarian organizations, to provide whatever assistance \n     may be necessary to the new government of Afghanistan for the \n     purpose of restoring the rights of Afghan women; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, to the presiding officers \n     of each house of Congress and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-254. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the \n     addition of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n[[Page S5632]]\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 6\n\n       Whereas, For more than fifty years, the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO) has played a pivotal role in \n     promoting stability and peace in Europe. This highly \n     successful venture is predicated on the commitment of its \n     member nations to ideals that closely parallel the precepts \n     of democracy, internationally recognized human rights, and \n     civilian control of the military that are fundamental to the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, Since its establishment, NATO has gradually \n     expanded its membership to reflect the changing face of \n     Europe. Countries that have joined this aliance have shared \n     the same commitment to the long-term strength and stability \n     of the region that is vital to our nation and the world. The \n     most recent additions have in common the peaceful transition \n     to a free-market economy after long years under the yoke of \n     Communism; and\n       Whereas, The Baltic nations of Latvia, Estonia, and \n     Lithuania have clearly demonstrated the principles of NATO. \n     These three countries, each with strong dedication to peace \n     and exemplary records of resisting oppression, have a great \n     deal to contribute to the alliance. Latvia, Estonia, and \n     Lithuania have set examples of the ideals of freedom through \n     their institutions and cultures. The addition of these \n     nations to NATO will only make more secure the bonds of peace \n     and democracy: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the senate (the house of representatives \n     concurring), That we memorialize the President and the \n     Congress of the United States to support the addition of \n     Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Office of the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-255.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Torricelli, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 2628. A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to require a State to promote financial education under the \ntemporary assistance to needy families program and to allow financial \neducation to count as a work activity under that program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators \nTorricelli and Kennedy to introduce the Financial Literacy for Self-\nSufficiency Act.\n  Our bill would require states to promote financial education through \ntheir TANF, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, programs. Financial \neducation, education that promotes an understanding of consumer, and \npersonal finance concepts, is extremely important for all families, and \nis especially important for low-income families who are moving from \nwelfare to work.\n  While TANF focuses on moving families off cash assistance and into \nwork, it fails to provide recipients with the tools they need to \nmaximize their earnings and manage their expenses in order to achieve \nfinancial stability once they are employed. If we truly expect to move \nthese families to achieve financial independence, we must give them the \ntools they will need to make that transition.\n  One of these tools is a bank account. Millions of low-income families \nremain outside of the formal banking system, with many of them spending \ntoo much of their hard-earned dollars at costly check cashing \noperations. In fact, more than eight million families earning under \n$25,000 a year lack a checking or savings account. A study conducted by \nthe United States Department of the Treasury in 2000 found that a \nworker earning $12,000 a year would pay approximately $250 a year just \nto cash their payroll checks at such an outlet. And, nearly 16 percent \nof the checks cashed at check cashing outlets are government benefits \nchecks, including welfare benefit checks.\n  In addition to expanding the number of banks that do business in low-\nincome communities, educating low-income unbanked families about the \nbenefits of formal checking and savings accounts can significantly \nimprove access to financial services.\n  But, financial education isn't just about bank accounts and savings. \nIt is also about protecting low-income families from predatory lending \nand devastating credit arrangements. Financial education that addresses \nabusive lending practices can help prevent unaffordable loan payments, \nequity stripping, and foreclosure. I strongly support legislative \nefforts to end predatory lending practices in our country, but until we \ndo, ensuring that consumers are aware of unfair and abusive loan terms \nis a measure that will provide them some protection from these tactics.\n  Finally, families leaving welfare for work face many challenges, \nincluding securing child care and transportation. One challenge that \noften is not mentioned, however, is the challenge of transitioning from \na benefits-based income to a wage income. Financial literacy programs \nthat educate families transitioning from welfare to work about taxes \nand tax benefits that they may be eligible for, such as the Department \nCare Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit, will ensure that they \nhave access to these important work benefits.\n  The Financial Literacy for Self-Sufficiency Act will allow states to \nuse their TANF funds to collaborate with community-based organizations, \nbanks, and community colleges to create financial education programs \nfor low-income families receiving welfare and for those transitioning \nfrom welfare to work. As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has \nnoted, ``Educational and training programs may be the most critical \nservice offered by community-based organizations to enhance the ability \nof lower-income households to accumulate assets.''\n\n[[Page S5634]]\n\n  I hope members of the Senate Finance Committee will join my \ncolleagues Senator Torricelli and Senator Kennedy and me in promoting \nfinancial education for our nation's TANF recipients when they act to \ncreate a reauthorization framework for our Nation's welfare program.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2628\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``TANF Financial Education \n     Promotion Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Most recipients of assistance under the temporary \n     assistance to needy families program established under part A \n     of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et \n     seq.) and individuals moving toward self-sufficiency operate \n     outside the financial mainstream, paying high costs to handle \n     their finances and saving little for emergencies or the \n     future.\n       (2) Currently, personal debt levels and bankruptcy filing \n     rates are high and savings rates are at their lowest levels \n     in 70 years. The inability of many households to budget, \n     save, and invest prevents them from laying the foundation for \n     a secure financial future.\n       (3) Financial planning can help families meet near-term \n     obligations and maximize their longer-term well being, \n     especially valuable for populations that have traditionally \n     been underserved by our financial system.\n       (4) Financial education can give individuals the necessary \n     financial tools to create household budgets, initiate savings \n     plans, and acquire assets.\n       (5) Financial education can prevent vulnerable customers \n     from becoming entangled in financially devastating credit \n     arrangements.\n       (6) Financial education that addresses abusive lending \n     practices targeted at specific neighborhoods or vulnerable \n     segments of the population can prevent unaffordable payments, \n     equity stripping, and foreclosure.\n       (7) Financial education speaks to the broader purpose of \n     the temporary assistance to needy families program to equip \n     individuals with the tools to succeed and support themselves \n     and their families in self-sufficiency.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Holocaust Victims \n     Insurance Relief Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Holocaust, including the murder of 6,000,000 \n     European Jews, the systematic destruction of families and \n     communities, and the wholesale theft of their assets, was one \n     of the most tragic crimes in modern history.\n       (2) When Holocaust survivors or heirs of Holocaust victims \n     presented claims to insurance companies after World War II, \n     many were rejected because the claimants did not have death \n     certificates or physical possession of policy documents that \n     had been confiscated by the Nazis.\n       (3) In many instances, insurance company records are the \n     only proof of the existence of insurance policies belonging \n     to Holocaust victims.\n       (4) Holocaust survivors and their descendants have been \n     fighting for decades to persuade insurance companies to \n     settle unpaid insurance claims.\n       (5) In 1998, the International Commission on Holocaust Era \n     Insurance Claims (in this section referred to as the \n     ``ICHEIC'') was established by the National Association of \n     Insurance Commissioners in cooperation with several European \n     insurance companies, European regulators, representatives of \n     international Jewish organizations, and the State of Israel, \n     to expeditiously address the issue of unpaid insurance \n     policies issued to Holocaust victims.\n       (6) On July 17, 2000, the United States and Germany signed \n     an Executive Agreement in support of the German Foundation \n     ``Remembrance, Responsibility, and the Future'', which \n     designated the ICHEIC to resolve all insurance claims that \n     were not paid or were nationalized during the Nazi era.\n       (7) The ICHEIC will not accept claims applications received \n     after September 30, 2002.\n       (8) Three years into the process of addressing the issue of \n     unpaid insurance policies, companies continue to withhold \n     thousands of names on dormant accounts.\n       (9) As of June 15, 2001, more than 84 percent of the 72,675 \n     claims applications filed with the ICHEIC remained idle \n     because the claimants could not identify the company holding \n     the policy.\n       (10) Insurance companies doing business in the United \n     States have a responsibility to ensure the disclosure of \n     insurance policies of Holocaust victims that they or their \n     related companies may have issued, to facilitate the rapid \n     resolution of questions concerning these policies, and to \n     eliminate the further victimization of policyholders and \n     their families.\n       (11) State legislatures in California, Florida, New York, \n     Minnesota, Washington, and elsewhere have been challenged in \n     efforts to implement laws that restrict the ability of \n     insurers to engage in business transactions in those States \n     until the insurers publish the names of Holocaust-era \n     policyholders.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to provide \n     information about Holocaust-era insurance policies to \n     Holocaust victims and their heirs and beneficiaries to enable \n     them to expeditiously file their rightful claims under the \n     policies.\n\n     SEC. __03. HOLOCAUST INSURANCE REGISTRY.\n\n       (a) Establishment and Maintenance.--Chapter 21 of title 44, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``Sec. 2119.

FULL DISCLOSURE OF HOLOCAUST-ERA POLICIES BY \n                   INSURERS.\n\n       (a) Requirement.--In accordance with subsection (b), an \n     insurer shall file a report with the Secretary of the \n     Treasury and the Secretary of State that contains the \n     following information:\n       (1) The first name, last name, date of birth, and domicile \n     of the policyholder of each covered policy issued by the \n     insurer or a related company of the insurer.\n       (2) The name of the entity that issued the covered policy.\n       (3) The name of the entity that is responsible for the \n     liabilities of the entity that issued the covered policy.\n       (4) The extent to which claims made under each covered \n     policy have been paid.\n       (b) Proper Filing.--A filing under subsection (a) shall be \n     made not later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act or September 1, 2002, in an \n     electronic format approved jointly by the Archivist of the \n     United States and the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n     SEC. __05. PROVISION OF INFORMATION TO ARCHIVIST.\n\n       The Secretary of the Treasury shall provide to the \n     Archivist of the United States any information filed with the \n     Secretary under section __04(a) promptly after the filing of \n     such information.\n\n     SEC. __06. PENALTY.\n\n       The Secretary of the Treasury shall assess a civil penalty \n     of not less than $5,000 for each day that an insurer fails to \n     comply with the requirements of section __04, as determined \n     by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. __07. USE OF AMOUNTS RECEIVED AS CIVIL PENALTIES.\n\n       To the extent or in the amounts provided in advance in \n     appropriation Acts, the Archivist of the United States may \n     use amounts received by the Government as civil penalties \n     under section __06 to maintain the Holocaust Insurance \n     Registry.\n\n     SEC. __08.
