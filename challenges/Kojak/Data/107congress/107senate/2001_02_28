Mr. President, I have been given a few moments this \nmorning to share with you a concern I have over legislation that \nundoubtedly will be introduced at some time in the Senate. It involves \nthe issue of ANWR, which is an area in my State of Alaska that is \nlooked upon by many as a partial solution to our energy crisis and to \nothers as a sacrifice of our environmental character and quality. Let \nme, just for reference, identify the ANWR area because, again, I think \nwe need to keep things in perspective.\n  This is ANWR. It is about 19 million acres, the size of the State of \nSouth Carolina. You see this area way up in the corner, that is a \nproportion, the proportion of how it looks in relation to the entire \nlandmass of the State of Alaska. The point I want to bring out to my \ncolleagues is that roughly half, 8.5 million acres, are in wilderness \nin perpetuity. The other portion is refuge, leaving a coastal plain of \nabout 1.5 million acres about which only Congress can make a \ndetermination whether or not it could or should be opened.\n  As a consequence, in our energy bill which we introduced yesterday, I \nfound there was very little focus on the bill itself. Most of the focus \nseems to be on the issue of ANWR. I want to make sure everyone \nunderstands, as we look at this energy crisis, ANWR is not the answer. \nIt is not intended to be the answer. But it is part of the solution to \nour energy crisis for specific reasons. A, we are 56-percent dependent \non imported oil. B, as a consequence of that, one has to question at \nwhat time, at\n\n[[Page S1658]]\n\nwhat point we begin, if you will, to jeopardize our national energy \nsecurity because of our increased dependence on imported oil.\n  I was asked the other day: Senator what was our dependence in 1973 \nwhen we had the Arab oil embargo; it was 37 percent, it is 56 percent \nnow. The Department of Energy says if we keep going the way we are, we \nwill be over 62 percent or 63 percent by the year 2006 or 2007. At what \npoint do we really compromise our national security by being so \ndependent on outside sources: Do we rely on Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, \nMexico, and other areas?\n  Let's look back to 1991-1992. We fought a war over oil. We stopped \nSaddam Hussein from going into Kuwait. He had his eyes on Saudi Arabia \nas well. He wanted to control the world's supply of oil. So we have \nalready pretty much made the commitment of just how far we will go. Now \nthe question is, As we become more dependent, when does our national \nsecurity really become jeopardized? I think we are there already.\n  As a consequence, any effort, in my opinion, by Members to consider \nintroducing legislation that would put ANWR in a wilderness in \nperpetuity really puts our national security at risk. I ask Members who \nobviously have a sensitivity concerning the environment--which we all \ndo--to reflect a little bit on the merits of this legislation. At a \ntime when we have an energy crisis in this country, is it appropriate \nthat Members, who obviously are extremely sensitive to the pressures by \nthe environmental community, would yield to those pressures and suggest \nwe put the area where we are most likely to make a major discovery, in \nNorth America, off limits at a time when we have an energy crisis? At a \ntime when we have previously fought a war over oil?\n  Let me share a couple of other observations because I think they \nreflect meaningfully on the message I would like to deliver briefly \ntoday. That is the myth associated with ANWR, that somehow this is the \nlast untouched area in the United States. That is absolutely incorrect.\n  Let me show a beautiful picture of this 1002 area. This is the \nmillion and a half acres that, indeed, are part of ANWR. There are \nprobably 100,000 caribou in that picture. It is a little bit difficult \nto see it. But it is interesting to reflect the place from which the \npicture was taken.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the certification from the photographer, \nKenneth Whitten, in a letter to Senator Barbara Boxer, be printed in \nthe Record. It was June 20, 2000, and it identifies specifically where \nthe picture was taken.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                Fairbanks, AK,\n\n                                                    June 20, 2000.\n     Senator Barbara Boxer,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: Following are specific answers to \n     questions you asked about photographs I took that were \n     produced as a poster by the Porcupine Caribou Management \n     Board.\n       1. The photos were taken at Beaufort Lagoon, an abandoned \n     DEW line station on the arctic coast east of Kaktovik, \n     Alaska. Beaufort Langoon lies within the 1002 area, about 6-8 \n     miles from its eastern boundary. The photos were taken July \n     4, 1991. About 100,000 caribou walked past Beaufort Lagoon \n     that day.\n       2. The photos were taken from a rooftop, looking south and \n     southwest across the lagoon toward the mainland and the \n     coastal plain. All the flatter terrain in the foreground of \n     the photos and all of the visible caribou are within the 1002 \n     area. The Brooks Range mountains in the distance are south of \n     the 1002 area, but are readily visible from all parts of the \n     1002 area on clear days. The snowcapped peaks in the photo \n     are the highest peaks in the Brooks Range. In the far western \n     part of the 1002 area, the mountains are even closer to the \n     coast, but the peaks are not as high. East of the 1002 area \n     the mountains are also lower, but closer to the coast.\n       3. The image is typical of the 1002 coastal plain. However, \n     a person standing at ground level on flat terrain would not \n     have quite as good a view. There are many low hills or bluffs \n     along watercourses in the 1002 area that offer similar \n     overviews of the coastal plain, but the old buildings at \n     Beaufort Lagoon may be the only place right on the coast in \n     the 1002 area where one can get high enough to see so much of \n     the plain at once. Similar or better views are readily \n     available throughout the 1002 area from aircraft.\n       4. All of the lower, flat terrain in the photo (where the \n     caribou are) is within the 1002 area and potentially \n     available for oil and gas development.\n       5. The coastal plain within the Arctic Wildlife refuge and \n     the 1002 area is generally narrower than the coastal plain \n     further west on the North Slope. Thus wildlife tends to be \n     more concentrated than elsewhere, with waterfowl and \n     shorebird nesting, other migratory birds, caribou calving, \n     muskoxen, land predators, and marine birds and mammals all in \n     closer proximity and denser concentrations than elsewhere on \n     the North Slope. Some other areas of the North Slope have \n     higher abundances of one or a few species, but the ANWR \n     coastal plain has the greatest variety and concentrations for \n     such relatively small area.\n       6. I was the Alaska Department of Fish and Game research \n     biologist in charge of Porcupine Caribou Herd research and \n     monitoring from 1978-1997. I spent 2-6 weeks each summer \n     working on the ANWR coastal plain, plus additional time \n     throughout the rest of the year following the caribou \n     elsewhere on their migrations through northern Alaska and \n     Canada. I served on the Porcupine Caribou Technical Committee \n     (now advisory to the International Porcupine Caribou Board) \n     from about 1979-2000 and I represented the State on the \n     International Porcupine Caribou Board at most meetings from \n     about 1993-2000. From 1996-2000 I was the Regional Research \n     Coordinator for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game for \n     interior and northeastern Alaska, but I still maintain an \n     active role in Porcupine Caribou matters. During the late \n     1970s and most of the 1980s I was also involved in research \n     on the Central Arctic Caribou herd in the Prudhoe Bay area. I \n     retired after 24\\1/2\\ years with the Alaska Department of \n     Fish and Game on May 31, 2000.\n       If I can be of any further assistance in your efforts to \n     protect the ANWE coastal plain, please don't hesitate to \n     contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Kenneth R. Whitten.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. ``The photos were taken from a rooftop looking south \nand southwest across the lagoon.'' And it is in the area of the lagoon.\n  The significance of it is, if it is in wilderness, what is a rooftop \ndoing there?\n  The reality is that also within this area is the village Kaktovik, \nwhich is in the 1002 area, which is often overlooked. This is the same \npart of the land, and it shows the village of about 227 people. It \nshows a radar station, an airport, the ocean, and so forth. It is a \npretty harsh environment.\n  Let me show you another contrast, and the contrast is caribou \nbrowsing in the Prudhoe Bay area. There is moderate activity. There \nhappens to be a drilling rig in that particular picture. You see a \npipeline. The realization is if the caribou are undisturbed and they \nare not threatened, why do they have a tendency to become used to \nactivity?\n  The point of these two pictures I think shows the contrast that, \nindeed, we are talking about two different areas. We are talking about \nthe Coastal Plain. We are talking about two different herds of caribou. \nBut we are still talking about caribou, and we have been able to \nprotect those caribou as a consequence of not allowing any harassment, \nshooting, or otherwise as opposed to the Porcupine herd which is \nsubject in that area to subsistence hunting, which is traditional among \nthe Native people.\n  I want to show you the contrast, and I want you to recognize that \nthis picture was taken from a roof in a wilderness and in a wilderness \nthere is not supposed to be any rooftop. Part of that wilderness \nincludes the village where 227 people live. They have children. They \nhave schools and so forth.\n  Again, I refer to the reality of how Alaskans live in the Arctic. I \nwant to show you pictures of some children. This is the little village \nof Kaktovik. These are kids going to school in the morning. You notice \nhow they are dressed in their parkas. It is pretty bleak and harsh. The \nrealization of that kind of a lifestyle relates to a friend of mine \nnamed Oliver Leavitt, who is with the Arctic Slope Regional \nCooperation. The last time I was in Barrow with a group of Senators he \ntook us to the new school in Barrow. He said: I use to come to school \nto keep warm. He said: I had to pick up driftwood on the beach early in \nthe morning, take it home to our sod home, and then I went to school to \nkeep warm.\n  I quote a friend of mine by the name of Jacob Adams, who is the \npresident of the Regional Corporation:\n\n       I love life in the Arctic. But it is harsh, expensive, and \n     for many, short. My people\n\n[[Page S1659]]\n\n     want decent homes, electricity, and education. We do not want \n     to be undisturbed. Undisturbed means abandoned. It means sod \n     huts and deprivation.\n\n  There is another side to this; that is, the residents who live there, \nand their attitude and their commitment to their lifestyle that depend \non the caribou.\n  We recently had comments by former President Carter. President Carter \nsigned the Alaska national interest lands bill in 1980. Alaskans \nassumed at that time that the land issue was resolved. We have put 59 \nmillion acres in wilderness in the State of Alaska. These are the \nareas. I don't expect the President to really reflect on where these \nare. But when you talk about wilderness and talk about ANWR, you also \ntalk about other areas that are larger than ANWR that are wilderness \nin Alaska. The question is, How much? Under statehood in 1959, we \nthought we could get a commitment from the Federal Government as to how \nmuch would be enough. In 1980, we signed an agreement basically under \nthe Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Here is a two-page \nlist. The point I want to make is that the Wrangell-St. Elias \nwilderness has 87 million acres. We have 8 million in ANWR. Gates of \nthe Arctic has 7 million acres. It goes on and on to total roughly 58 \nmillion acres.\n\n  I simply point this out to counter those who suggest that we need \nsome area of wilderness in Alaska that is untouched. ANWR is not \nuntouched. Gates of the Arctic, for all practical purposes, is \nuntouched. Wrangell-St. Elias, for all practical purposes, is \nuntouched. Let's keep the arguments in perspective.\n  I will conclude with the statement from President Carter in signing \nthe Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act in 1980.\n\n       This act of Congress reaffirms our commitment to the \n     environment. It strikes a balance between protecting areas of \n     great beauty and value and allowing development of Alaska's \n     vital oil and gas and mineral and timber resources.\n\n  Mr. President, I quote from the same signing ceremony Mo Udall, the \nchief sponsor of the legislation.\n\n       I'm joyous. I'm glad today for the people of Alaska. They \n     can get on with building a great State. They're a great \n     people. And this matter is settled and put to rest, and the \n     development of Alaska can go forward with balance.\n\n  There you have it. That is what Alaskans believed in at the time this \nwas accomplished.\n  Let me also advise you that in the President's budget, which came out \ntoday, on page 69 the President also proposes linking near-term and \nlong-term approaches by encouraging new oil and gas production on \nFederal lands and using Federal income from that sale to support \nincreased efforts to develop solar, and to develop renewable energy \nsources. The administration's legislative proposal will include opening \na small part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Let me show you again that chart because it suggests that we are \nopening only a sliver. You have to keep these things in perspective. \nThis is 19 million acres--the size of the State of South Carolina. This \nsliver up here is 1.5 million acres. Industry says that the oil is \nthere and they can develop it in less than 2,000 acres.\n  The percentage is something that is very hard to communicate to \npeople, but it is very real. It is a sliver we are proposing, and it is \nnot the total answer to our energy crisis, by any means. But what it \ndoes is send a very strong signal to OPEC that we mean business about \nreducing our dependence on imported oil. I am convinced once we come to \ngrips with that, you are going to see OPEC relax a little bit. They are \ngoing to increase their production.\n  I think you will see the price drop. If we don't do this, they are \ngoing to get the message. And the message is to reduce production and \nkeep the high prices up.\n\n  Again, I encourage my colleagues and the staff listening to recognize \nthe significance of any effort to put this permanently away at a time \nwhen we have an energy crisis that would send terrible signals to OPEC \nand would jeopardize our national energy security. I said this on this \nfloor time and time again.\n  But as we look at our increasing dependence on imported oil and where \nthat oil is coming from now that we are seeing about 750,000 barrels a \nday coming from Iraq that we fought a war with in 1991 and 1992, we are \nforgetting that we lost 147 lives. We are forgetting that as we buy \nSaddam Hussein's oil we are putting it in our airplanes and going over \nand bombing it. That may be an overly simplistic statement. But it is \nfactual. We have had over 20,000 sorties where we have enforced the no-\nfly zone over Iraq.\n  What is he doing with our money? He is developing a missiles and \nbiological capabilities. And at whom are these weapons aimed? They are \naimed at Israel, our greatest ally.\n  I hope the American people and my colleagues will reflect a little \nbit on this. Again, this isn't the answer to the energy crisis. This is \none small part, but it is, I think, fair to bring this up to my \ncolleagues and recognize that as we look at the comprehensive energy \nbill that we put in, along with Senator Lott and a number of other \ncosponsors, nobody seems to be paying any attention to the merits of \nthis broad, comprehensive bill. It is like you go to a bullfight and \nyou want to see some blood. The media and attention seem to be focusing \non one single thing, ANWR.\n  I think it is appropriate that we respond in some detail. We have \nletters from organized labor. This isn't a benefits issue for labor; \nthis a job issue for labor. It is estimated there would be about \n750,000 jobs in the United States associated with the development of \nthis if, indeed, the oil is there. So it is very real.\n  Let me show you what this area looks like in wintertime because it is \ntough, it is harsh. The winter is roughly 10 months of the year. This \nis a picture of it. There it is. That is the tundra in the wintertime. \nIn the summertime, why, it looks a little different. I will show you a \npicture with one well to give you some idea of the technology we have \nbecause we have been able to use ice roads. I think we have a picture \nassociated with development in the Arctic. This picture shows that is \nthe kind of footprint there is because of technology we have been able \nto develop.\n  Let me close with one other observation to my friends from \nCalifornia, Washington, and Oregon specifically. The oil production out \nof Alaska goes to the west coast of the United States--virtually all of \nit. We used to export a little of that oil only when it was surplus to \nwhat the West coast could use. We have not had an export since April of \n2000. If we do not develop a replacement for declining Prudhoe Bay, \nthen California, Washington, and Oregon are going to get their oil \noverseas--from Saudi Arabia, from Venezuela, from the rain forests of \nColombia, these are places where there is no environmental oversight. \nThey are going to get it in foreign tankers.\n  As a consequence, I think the risk is much higher than getting it \nhere in our own country where we can contribute meaningfully to the \nbalance of payments, keep jobs in the United States, and have the \nenvironmental oversight that is appropriate.\n  One of the things that bothers me is how many people are concerned \nabout developing oil and gas in the United States; yet we have \nenvironmental laws, both Federal and State, and the highest technology \nin the world. But they do not reflect on the oil coming from overseas \nand what kind of an environmental oversight is associated there. In \nmany cases there is virtually none.\n  It is manageable. We do have the technology to develop it. And we \nshould listen, I think, to the people who live in the area with regard \nto their concerns in relation to the opportunities for a choice of a \nlifestyle, education, and so forth.\n  Mr. President, I do appreciate the time allotted to me today. Again, \nI want to emphasize ANWR is not the solution to the energy crisis, but \nit can make a significant difference because as we commit to reduce our \ndependence on imported energy to less than 50 percent by opening ANWR \nalone, if the volume is in the area of a million barrels a day, we \nwould be able to achieve that.\n  Mr. President, obviously, I will have other opportunities to speak, \nand there are time commitments this morning. But I think the timeliness \nof the matter, and some Members contemplating the merits of going to a \nwilderness bill,\n\n[[Page S1660]]\n\nthat they consider the merits of the points I have brought up today.\n  Indeed, we have the capability to open up this sliver--and it is a \nsliver--it is a very small fraction of a huge area the size of the \nState of South Carolina. We have 30 years of experience in the Arctic. \nAs a consequence, nothing is risk free, but we have learned how to \neliminate the risk dramatically.\n  I hope Members will visit ANWR when we take our Senate trip up there \non March 30, 31, and the first day of April because I think it is \nnecessary to see it, to talk to the people, to look at the old \ntechnology, reflect on the new technology, and get an appreciation for \na very unique part of our great Nation, but a very, very harsh \nenvironment that is blessed with extraordinary resources in the oil and \ngas reserves that exist in the area.\n  Mr. President, I conclude my remarks and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/28/senate-section/article/S1660-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1660-S1663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PRESIDENT BUSH'S ADDRESS TO THE NATION\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know there will be other Democrats \ncoming to the floor to respond to President Bush's address last night \nto the Nation. I thought I might just take a few minutes. First of all, \nI want to start by congratulating the President. When it comes to \ndelivery and a sincere presentation, he deserves very high marks.\n  I am more worried about the substance. I am more worried about what \nthe President was not very explicit about; in other words, what was \nleft out of the speech, what were some unpleasant realities that were \nkind of put in parentheses.\n  I would like to just make a couple of points--because I think the \npeople in the country ultimately, where this budget debate becomes most \nimportant and where the rubber meets the road and how all of these \npriorities affect people where they work, where they live, where their \nchildren go to school--about what wasn't in this speech last night.\n  In focusing on families and the benefits for families and children, \nthe President neglected to say yesterday that one-third of all children \nin the United States of America live in homes that will not see one \npenny of the tax cut; about 56 percent of Spanish children in homes \nwill not receive one penny of relief from the President's tax proposal, \nto the fact that over 40 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 \npercent.\n  That doesn't meet the Minnesota standard of fairness. I don't think \nit meets the standard of fairness for people in the country.\n  What the President didn't really focus on was whether or not in his \nbudget proposal he is committed to having the Federal Government live \nup to its commitment on a very important program called the IDEA \nprogram for kids with special needs.\n  Governors talked about this at the conference. Our Governor from \nMinnesota talked about it. Every school, on demand, about every 2 weeks \npeople talk about it. This is the program for children with special \nneeds, the IDEA program that Senator Harkin and others fought so hard \non.\n  We are really supposed to be contributing 40 percent of the costs. I \nbelieve Minnesotans and people around the country, when they see the \nPresident's budget, are going to see a Robin Hood in reverse; a tax cut \nof 40 percent-plus of the benefits going to the top 1 percent, and \ncrowding out any money or any investment or any commitment on our part \nto dramatically expanding our funding for the IDEA program. It is not \ngoing to be there. You are going to see no new significant investment \nof Federal resources in the IDEA program. The President didn't talk \nabout that.\n\n  What was left out? The President did not focus on his proposal to \ndrill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  In just a few minutes, I will be at a press conference with Senator \nLieberman and others at which we are all going to support preserving \n125 million acres of the Coastal Plain, a very precious area, as a \nwilderness area. We are going to be proposing that we not drill our way \nto energy security. Drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge would be similar to doing it in the Boundary Waters Conservation \nArea in Minnesota. It really defines the very value that we should have \nas to preservation and conservation. We are all but strangers, I guess, \non this land, and we ought to leave it better for our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  The President did not talk about his proposal for oil drilling in the \nANWR, and he didn't talk about the cuts that are going to take place. \nBecause if you have huge tax cuts, to be really honest about what it \nwill cost and the surplus, and if you are not willing to raid the \nMedicare and Social Security trust fund--the President didn't talk \nabout the fact that in order to make his numbers add up, they may very \nwell have to do that--we are going to see some reductions.\n  There was a piece yesterday in USA Today that the President intends \nto cut the budget for renewable energy policy by 30 percent. For States \nsuch as Minnesota, a cold weather State at the other end of the \npipeline, we are interested in the environment. We are not interested \nin importing more barrels of oil or millions of cubic feet of natural \ngas. We are interested in biomass, electricity, wind, saving energy, \nand fuel efficiency standards which are clean technology, and where \nsmall business is more respectful of the environment and, indeed, where \nit would enable our country to be more energy independent. The \nPresident didn't focus on that in his speech last night.\n  There were rumors--only rumors because we don't have the numbers \nyet--that the SBA is going to take a huge cut. I tell you that small \nbusinesses are similar to family farms. We love them in the abstract. \nBut when it comes to actually making the commitment to small \nbusinesses, that is where we fall short. The 504 program has leveraged \na tremendous amount of money in the State of Minnesota to enable people \nto start a small business and to grow that business. I feel an outrage \nin just telling you that when people get a chance to look at the \nspecifics of these numbers, they are going to see a set of priorities \nthat is not going to be pretty. And I don't think they are going to be \nconsistent with what most people believe.\n  Most people are saying tax cuts for all families. Don't do it \ndisproportionately for the wealthy. Please make sure there is help for \npeople who need help, and let's do it based on the standard of \nfairness. Most people are saying don't touch the Social Security and \nMedicare trust fund. Most people are saying we are interested in \nwhether or not for our parents and grandparents we can cover \nprescription drug costs. We are committed to education and children. We \nwant to see a commitment. What happened with expanded health care \ncoverage?\n  All of that prioritizing goes out the window when you get rigorous in \nyour analysis. It is the Yiddish proverb, ``You cannot dance at two \nweddings at the same time.'' You can't have a tax cut over $2 trillion \nand do what the President says he wants to do and make these \ninvestments. It won't happen.\n  Finally, I was at a joint congressional hearing where the VFW \ntestified. There was a huge delegation of VFW representatives from \nMinnesota.\n  I would like to put all Democrats and Republicans on alert. The \nveterans are already very focused on this budget. They came up with an \nindependent budget proposal. We fell short. Senator Johnson and I had \nsome comments on this. We were only partially successful.\n  I will tell my colleagues that the veterans community wants us to \nlive up to our commitment to them. This is a community that is getting \nolder, and the issue is long-term care. In my State, it is an issue of \nwhether or not our region gets its fair share of resources. There are \ntoo many veterans--about 2 percent of the homeless population in the \nUnited States--who are homeless, and many of them are Vietnam \nvets. That is a national disgrace.\n\n  They are interested in the commitment to those veterans. They are \ninterested in making sure we can do good outpatient care. They are \ninterested in\n\n[[Page S1661]]\n\nmaking sure there are not long waits for veterans who need health care. \nThey are interested in whether or not we are going to fund veterans' \nhealth care. They are interested in whether or not this budget is going \nto make any sense.\n  Frankly, in the context of all these tax cuts mainly going to the \nwealthy, I am going to go on record today on the floor of the Senate to \nsay that this administration will not be able to follow through on its \ncommitment to veterans, its commitment to children, its commitment to \nleaving no child behind, its commitment to education, its commitment to \ncovering prescription drug costs for senior citizens.\n  My mom and dad both had Parkinson's disease. Don't say to a couple: \nYou make $20,000 a year or $21,000 a year; therefore, you make too much \nmoney to get any help. You are not making much money when you try to \nlive on $21,000 a year, or whatever it is.\n  So I simply say, I think ultimately what we have before us could be a \ngrand and important debate. I am absolutely confident as to where \npeople in the country will come down on this matter when they see the \nspecifics and how it affects them, their children, where they live, \nwhere they work, where their children go to school. It is a value \nquestion. I think it is a spiritual question. We have done well. We \nhave the prosperity.\n  The question is, What decisions do we make as a nation and as a \ncommunity? What are our priorities? Is it going to be mainly Robin-\nHood-in-reverse tax cuts, with the top 1 percent getting over 40 \npercent of the benefits or will we be talking about tax cuts that \nbenefit all families? And will we be talking about making sure we \nprotect Social Security and Medicare? And, yes, will we live up to our \nwords, to our commitments for children, for education, for prescription \ndrug costs, for expanded health care coverage? That is what we are \nabout. That is what this debate is about.\n  I think it is more of a conservative saying, but I like it as a \nliberal, as a Senator from the State of Minnesota: There is no such \nthing as a free lunch. We can't do it all. So we need to make our \npriorities clear. We are going to have to make value choices.\n  I make a choice, as a Senator, for children and education. I make a \nchoice for affordable prescription drugs. I make a choice for expanded \nhealth care coverage. I make a choice for two very important social \ninsurance programs: Social Security and Medicare. And I make a choice \nfor tax cuts that benefit all families, not just having benefits that \ndisproportionately go to the top 1 or 5 percent.\n  I think that is what this debate is about. I think we are ready for \nit. I think the outcome of this debate is going to be hugely important \nto people in Minnesota and all over our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, are we in morning business? That is my \nunderstanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois controls the time \nfrom 11 until 12 o'clock.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I salute my colleague from Minnesota. I know he is \nleaving the floor. I came in at the end of his remarks. I know he was \nresponding to the President's State of the Union Address and probably \nhas another meeting to go to, but he captured my sentiment on this \ncompletely.\n  I think what we have to look at now is what is in the best interest \nof this Nation in terms of the long haul. We have just finished the \n20th century which we called the ``American Century.'' Will the 21st \ncentury be an American century? I think some of the decisions we are \nmaking today will decide that.\n  I think the Senator from Minnesota put his finger on it: What are the \nmost important things for the future of families in America? I think \nover and over they tell us: Education, Senator, Congressman, Governor. \nWe want you to do something about education.\n  I heard the President talk about education last night. I think the \nSenator from Minnesota believes, as I do, there is a lot we can do to \nmake this a stronger nation in this century, but it means an investment \nin education. If we decide, instead, that we are going to give a tax \ncut primarily to the wealthiest people in America instead of investing \nin education, instead of expanding health care coverage, instead of \nprotecting Social Security and Medicare, then it is very shortsighted.\n  The President's remarks were well received. I thought he did an \nexcellent job in his first State of the Union Address. But now it is \ntime to step back and reflect. We not only reflect on his remarks, but \nwe reflect on his record in Texas where he tried the same thing--a tax \ncut that did not work, a State that is now out of money. We do not want \nto go down that same road.\n  I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his remarks.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I apologize; I am \ngoing to be with other Senators at a gathering that will focus on oil \ndrilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, to which we are \nopposed. That is the only reason I leave the floor.\n  One thing I wish to say to my colleague from Illinois, I congratulate \nthe President's delivery, and I think he is sincere in what he said. \nThat is the good part. I think there is one maybe bad part to last \nnight, and I think it is a very important challenge for President Bush, \nwhich is, that if you talk about education and children and leaving no \nchild behind and you talk about covering prescription drug costs for \nelderly people and helping people with that hardship--to use but two \nexamples--then people hear that and they say: You know what, this is \ngoing to be a Government that responds to us. The hope builds up, and \nultimately, if you are not able to back that with the investment of \nresources, and it is just symbolic because you basically put it all \ninto a tax cut, mainly going to the wealthy people, the top 1 percent \nor 5 percent, then that really invites--mutiny is too strong a word--\nanger.\n  You can't play around with those issues. You have to back the \nrhetoric with the resources. If I had to critique the President's \nspeech last night, to me that is the disconnect. I am troubled by that \nbecause these issues affect real people and their lives. And why are we \nhere except to do better for people.\n\n  I think we have to back up our speeches and our rhetoric with our \npriorities.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Really, after the President's speech last night, the question most \npeople in America are asking is, Can we have it all? Frankly, last \nnight the President said: Yes, we can have it all. We can have a tax \ncut for the wealthiest people in America. They receive 43 percent of \nthe Bush tax cut. Sadly, there are literally millions of families that \nreceive no benefit from the President's tax cut. They are people who \npay a payroll tax and not an income tax. They are taxed families. They \nneed relief. They need help with heating bills and paying education and \nhealth care expenses. There is no help for them in the President's tax \ncut package.\n  We on the Democratic side believe we have to take a sensible, \nfiscally responsible approach to this. We have been down this road \nbefore. It was not that many years ago that we were deep into deficits. \nWe had these deficits that now have accumulated into a national \nmortgage, a national debt of $5.7 trillion. It is still there. When the \nPresident says we are going to pay off $2 trillion on the national \ndebt, the debt is $5.7 trillion.\n  We on the Democratic side believe that we have a responsibility to \ncontinue to bring down that debt even more. We collect $1 billion in \ntaxes a day--every day--to pay interest on the old debt. It does not \neducate a child, pay for a teacher, or make America's defense stronger. \nIt is money paid to bondholders all over the world who own America's \nmortgage.\n  We believe the President, in saying he would spend $2 trillion in \npaying down the debt, has really broken a promise. If he is going to \nkeep the promise that Congress has made to keep Social Security first, \nto protect the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, the $2 \ntrillion paydown does not do it. In fact, it requires the President, \nunder his projections, to reach into the Social Security and Medicare \ntrust funds to create his so-called rainy day fund. I do not think that \nis going to work.\n  As someone said yesterday, if a businessperson wanted to reach in the \npension plan of his employees for some\n\n[[Page S1662]]\n\nother purpose, he would find himself in a Federal institution, and it \nwould not be the White House. In this situation, we believe that paying \ndown that debt and protecting the Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds is really a solemn obligation and a first priority.\n  We also believe that if there is to be a tax cut, it should not be \none that primarily benefits the wealthy and leaves millions of families \nbehind. We believe there should be a tax cut for everyone in this \ncountry. And we believe the tax cut should be fair. If you talk about \n43 percent of his tax cut going to the top 1 percent in income, these \nare people who make over $319,000 a year. People who have an income of \nover $25,000 a month receive the most benefit from President Bush's tax \ncut.\n  I would like to see our tax cut be something we can afford, something \nthat is sensible, consistent with debt reduction, consistent with \nimportant investments in this country, and one that really focuses on \nfamilies.\n  I just did a radio talk show with WLS Radio in Chicago. They asked \nme: What are you thinking about when you talk about these families? I \nsaid: I think about a couple who are Chicago public school teachers, \nand their combined income might be $100,000 a year. I do not consider \nthem to be a wealthy family. They are the type of family that struggles \nwith mortgage payments and school expenses and all the things that go \nwith bringing up a family.\n  If we focus our attention on people with family incomes below \n$100,000 and say these are the folks who need a helping hand, that is a \nsensible starting point. Yes, there will be a tax break for the \nwealthiest among us, but why should they take 43 percent of the total \ntax cut?\n  People believe they are overtaxed. I think we can help them. In time \nof surplus, we should help them. We also should help them to understand \nthat we want America's economy to start moving again. We hope this \nslowdown will come to an end soon, that we will turn away from this \ndownturn, or recession, or whatever it might be, and once again get on \nthe path of prosperity on which we have been for the last 8 or 10 \nyears. If we are going to return to that path, we have to make the \nright decisions now. The President's tax cut, sadly, is not the right \ndecision.\n  Unfortunately, he will spend over 90 percent of the projected surplus \nover the next 10 years on this tax cut and leave little or nothing for \nprescription drug benefits under Medicare, for investments in \neducation, for expanding health insurance coverage for more American \nfamilies, or for putting more money in our national defense.\n  We cannot have it all. Last night the President told us: You can have \nit all. You can give a tax cut to the wealthiest in America, primarily; \nyou can go ahead and spend all this money I am promising and everything \nis going to be fine.\n  Those of us who have studied the history of our Nation know that \nsometimes the most pleasing and appealing political promises don't pay \noff for America. I am afraid what the President has proposed is just \nsuch a promise.\n  I understand the President is now going out, touring America, to sell \nthe idea of a tax cut. I can't imagine this political assignment. The \nPresident has to convince America we need a tax cut. If the President \nwere going out trying to sell a tax increase, I could understand it. \nThat is a tough job. You have to explain the circumstances and try to \nconvince the American people you are right. Here he is, trying to sell \nthe American people on the idea of a tax cut. They are reluctant; they \nare not buying it. They want to have some questions answered.\n  One of the questions they ask is, How do you know we are going to \nhave a surplus? If we are not going to have a surplus next year, 5 \nyears, 10 years from now, why would you change the Tax Code in a \npermanent way and give a tax cut that gives away a surplus that you are \nnot sure of? That is a valid question.\n  What it boils down to is that a lot of people think the President is \ngambling with the economy on budget predictions that are no more \nreliable than weather forecasts. These people who make these \npredictions have been wrong in the past, consistently wrong. Many of us \nbelieve we should deal with a tax cut and a spending program phased in \nto make sure there is always enough money for America's priorities, \npriorities such as Social Security, Medicare, education--to make \ncertain that if we have a surplus, the tax cut is really shared by all \nAmericans and does not go just to the wealthiest among us.\n  We are facing a balloon payment in Social Security in just a few \nyears. The baby boomers are going to turn up at the Social Security \nwindow. When they do, there will be a lot of them, a lot more than we \nhave ever had in our history. If you know that balloon payment is \ncoming, should you not plan ahead?\n  Remember what the President said last night. He is going to appoint a \nSocial Security commission to look into the future of Social Security.\n  Time out. He appoints the commission after he has already announced \nthe tax cut. He will have used up the surplus and then said to the \ncommission: How are we going to take care of Social Security? Wouldn't \nresponsible leadership suggest we do it just the opposite, that we have \na Social Security evaluation or commission, decide what we are going to \nneed, and make sure the money is there, that if there is a surplus, it \nwill be there for Social Security and for Medicare, and then decide if, \nwith the remaining surplus, we can afford a tax cut? Not so. The \nPresident wants the tax cut first. That is the mistake he is making.\n  It also troubles me that after all of the years or promising that the \nSocial Security and Medicare trust funds would be sacred and inviolate, \nthe President's approach calls for taking out $1 trillion from these \ntrust funds. That is going to be a hard sell. Somebody said: Is the \nPresident going to be grabbing the third rail of politics if he does \nthat? I think he will.\n  Many of us on both sides of the aisle believe you do not play with \nthe Social Security trust fund. This is part of a sacred contract, a \npromise we made to people, an investment that today's wage earners are \nmaking in a trust fund so the money will be there when they need it as \nwell.\n  Taking money out of the trust fund, as the President's proposal would \nlead us to, to create a rainy day fund or whatever it is is not going \nto fly. Congress is going to resist it. We are going to insist that \nthose trust funds be protected.\n  On Medicare, the President, unfortunately, has not proposed any new \nspending. These baby boomers and others who retire count on Medicare to \npay for their health care bills. If we don't take Medicare seriously, \nwe will find ourselves facing budget shortfalls in that critical \nprogram, and 40 million Americans today and even more in the future \nwill wonder whether or not there are adequate funds in Medicare to pay \nfor their medical expenses.\n  In making this commitment to our future, we have to talk sense to the \nAmerican people. Maybe we won't say the most popular things on Capitol \nHill, maybe we won't hold out the prospect of the big tax cut \nimmediately, but we do believe that a tax cut is something we can \nsupport, as Democrats and as Republicans, once we put it all in \nperspective. The perspective is, what is a realistic projection, a \nrealistic prediction in terms of the surplus we are going to have? What \nis the safe way each year to decide how much we can afford to put in a \ntax cut? How can we take care of other priorities such as paying down \nthis national debt in a systematic way, a way that brings us to a point \nwhere we can say to our children: We just burned the mortgage. It is \nyour America now, mortgage free. Make your own plans for your own \nfuture, and you won't have to compete with the Federal Government when \nit comes to interest rates, because we are not borrowing money any \nlonger for a $5.7 trillion national debt. We are not competing with you \nwhen you want a mortgage for your home or a loan for your car or your \ncredit bills, whatever it is.\n  These things are good for the future of this country. Although they \nmay not be as popular as the two words ``tax cut,'' they offer things \nAmericans will look forward to.\n  When it comes to education, people always say: That is our highest \npriority. If it is our highest priority, are we willing to set goals \nfor this Nation and live up to them? Are we willing to\n\n[[Page S1663]]\n\nsay that the schoolday our children live through each day should be a \ncomplete day that is positive and constructive, that from the moment \nthose children are left at school until they can be returned to a \nparent, they are going to be in a positive, safe, and learning \nenvironment?\n\n  That isn't the case today in schools across America. Children are \nturned loose at 2:30, 3, 3:30 in the afternoon, long before their \nparents come home. Afterschool programs should be part of a schoolday. \nMaybe it will not be tutorials for kids who are doing well. It might be \nenrichment classes or art classes or music classes--even sports, for \nthat matter--but something that is constructive and positive. America's \nschools should reflect America's families.\n  When we talk about a vision for the 21st century in education, our \nschools have to be part of that vision. They ought to be safe \nbuildings, too. In my home State of Illinois, we have many great school \ndistricts but a lot of them where the schools are just crumbling around \nthe students. Schools are not what they should be so the students are \nable to learn in a safe, clean, and healthy environment. The Federal \nGovernment should make that investment with the States, with the local \nschool districts, to make those schools safer.\n  In the classrooms themselves, our teachers are facing a lot of \nchallenges. I think about how little I know about computers, though I \ntried to learn a little bit more. I wonder if I could ever teach a \ncourse in computers even to a youngster. Most kids know a lot more \nabout computers than I do. If our teachers are going to be able to use \ncomputers and teach our kids technology that will make their lives more \nmeaningful, teachers need training and opportunities and they need \nadequate pay. We should treat them as the professionals they are and \nhold our schools accountable.\n  I agree with the President on this: Let's make sure our schools are \nproductive. If we have testing, it is a good way to see whether or not \nthe kids are making progress. I believe in tests. The President was \nright last night: You can overdo it in teaching to a test. However, if \nyou are teaching to a standard of learning so that a child can move to \nthe next grade successfully, I support it. We did it throughout my \nschool career many years ago, and we do it now in the city of Chicago \nand across the State of Illinois.\n  It makes sense; I support the President's proposal, but if we are to \nleave no child behind, if we are going to invest in education as we \nshould, then certainly we have to step back and say, is this tax cut of \n$1.6 trillion--primarily for the wealthiest people in this country--the \nfirst thing America needs in the 21st century?\n  I don't believe it is. I think the first thing we need to do is \ncarefully look at the books, see what is on hand, and then a tax cut \nacross the board for all families, pay down the national debt, and \ninvest in these priorities--Social Security, Medicare, and education.\n  Finally, I will mention the issue of health insurance. It is almost \ndisgraceful that at this moment in our history, with our prosperity, \nover 43 million Americans have no health insurance at all. I can't \nimagine getting up and going to work as the head of a household with a \nfamily without the protection of some type of health insurance. Yet we \nknow that happens day after day.\n  I was glad to see the National Governors' Association come together \nin Washington this last week. They are proposing changes in Medicaid--\nchanges that could lead to universal coverage so that every family in \nAmerica would at least have a primary health insurance plan. I think we \nought to move in that direction--not a Government plan or a Government-\nrun program but a program that opens up to private health insurance \nsources and others so we can allow people to have that basic protection \nand peace of mind.\n  That is not the case today. As a consequence, many kids in America go \nwithout immunization. People with basic care who can live a long period \nof time don't have the chance. I am sorry that the President's speech \nlast night really didn't address this. I think if the President, as he \nmoves around and talks to working families, sits down and asks families \nabout their priorities, they will tell him that health care is one of \nthe most important, and that they are worried about the cost and \navailability of it.\n  The last point is this. Last night the President brought in from \nPhiladelphia a family who seemed to be two people who were working very \nhard to make a good living. We stood and applauded them as the \nPresident described them as a ``typical American family.'' I am glad \nthey were with us as a reminder of why many of us serve in the Senate \nand in the House of Representatives. The President said this lower \nincome family is going to need the help of a tax break. I think lower \nincome families do need the help of a tax break.\n  I remind the President and his party that for the last 6 years they \nhave consistently resisted every effort to raise the minimum wage in \nAmerica. It has been stuck at $5.15 an hour for 14 million Americans. \nSo if we have sympathy for these families, if we value hard work, if we \nbelieve in the dignity that comes with those activities, for goodness' \nsake, why aren't we increasing the minimum wage? We have waited too \nlong. That wage is continuing to deteriorate because of inflation, and \nwe should be sensitive to it.\n  I hope as we get into this tax cut discussion we will not forget the \nbasis--that is, that these folks who get up every morning and go to \nwork, to clean off the tables in restaurants, make the beds in hotels, \ntend to our parents and grandparents in nursing homes, to be there to \nmake sure the workplace is safe for kids in day-care centers, are the \npeople making $5.15 an hour.\n  The Republican Party has resisted for 5 years now every effort to \nraise that minimum wage. For that family in Philadelphia, for 350,000 \nIllinois families that are working for a minimum wage, I implore the \nPresident and the Republican Party not only to think of tax cuts but to \nthink about increasing the minimum wage to show that they value work, \nas we all should in America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/28/senate-section/article/S1663-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1663-S1666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PRESIDENT BUSH'S BUDGET FOR AMERICA\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, last night I had the \nprivilege of personally witnessing President Bush deliver remarks \noutlining his budget for America and outlining the priorities of that \nbudget. I must say, it was refreshing, for one who has long fought over \nthe past 16 to 17 years in both the House and the Senate, to hear tax \ncuts being proposed, and not only tax cuts being proposed, but also the \nopportunity to finally downsize the national debt so we can stop \nmortgaging our children's future.\n  The President, in that plan for America's priorities, included tax \nrelief, debt reduction, and some much needed reform for some very \nimportant programs. One of the negatives over the past 20 or 30 years \nis that as our deficits and our debts became larger, many times we \nneglected a lot of key initiatives, areas where the Federal Government \ncould be helpful to the American people. So it is a pleasure to see the \ndebt diminished and money being returned to the taxpayers at the same \ntime, and, in conjunction with that, we are going to provide dollars in \nmuch needed areas. I want to talk about that.\n  First, in President Bush's budget, we will see the largest debt \nreduction in American history. Think of that: The largest debt \nreduction in American history. It is good news and bad news. It is good \nthat it is the largest debt reduction; it is bad that we have debt that \nlarge in the first place.\n  The key thing to understand is that this proposal pays down the \nnational debt by $2 trillion over the next 10 years. That is the \nlargest reduction in debt to the lowest share of the economy since the \nFirst World War. With the leadership of the Republican Congress, we \nhave already paid off an enormous portion of the national debt--\n\n[[Page S1664]]\n\nnearly $363 billion so far. If you stop to think about it, it costs \nabout $60 million to borrow every billion dollars.\n  Multiply $60 million times 363 and see how much we save in interest \non that debt. That $60 million will go a long way in New Hampshire. It \nwas a lot of money where I grew up. That is just on $1 billion of \nborrowed money; we have paid $363 billion of it already, and we are \nproposing to pay off $2 trillion--with a ``t''--in the next 10 years. \nThere is a ripple effect through the economy when taking the American \nGovernment out of the borrowing market and putting money back into the \ntaxpayers' pockets.\n  By the end of this fiscal year, we will pay off another $262 billion. \nThat is $625 billion of debt reduction. Putting it in perspective, in \n1997, the first year we balanced the budget, the debt held by the \npublic was $3.7 trillion. By the end of this year, the debt will be \n$3.1 trillion, still a lot. Over the next 10 years, we will take $2 \ntrillion more off that debt, leaving a little over $1 trillion in debt. \nOver the next 2 years, our Social Security-Medicare lockbox policy will \nreduce the national debt by an additional $400 billion.\n  I was very proud to support President Bush's plan to reduce this \nenormous national debt which for so long has mortgaged our children's \nfuture.\n  It is important to understand everything else. I will discuss some \nitems, including returning money to the taxpayers, providing dollars \nfor Social Security and Medicare, education, defense. Put the increases \nin perspective. You will get a tax refund. We will talk about that in a \nmoment. Reduce the debt by $2 trillion, and there is still money to do \nthose things. That is amazing.\n  That is a great tribute to this President who didn't come into the \nWhite House and say, this is the way we did it last year; we will \nbudget the same way we did last year. He sat down with his key advisers \nand worked through this budget and found out where the needs were. At \nthe same time, he said he will reduce the debt, put money back into the \ntaxpayers' pocketbooks, and fund programs that deserve to be funded.\n  The tax reduction is fair. It is responsible. It is tax relief for \nall Americans. It is certainly welcome news to my own State of New \nHampshire. Do I think the tax cut could be bigger? Sure. But I plan to \nwork with the President to expand tax relief. The President's tax cut \nis bold. I support it. I will be with him all the way through this \nprocess.\n  Good men and women of my State--and I am sure it is true all over \nAmerica--have always been weary of taxes. New Hampshire is one of the \nonly States in the Union that does not have, at this date, a sales or \nincome tax. There are some in our State who want to impose a sales tax. \nI am very encouraged to see the President provide tax relief to the \ncitizens of my great State and this Nation.\n  There is some irony. When I came to Washington several years ago, I \nwanted to bring the New Hampshire example to Washington--less taxes, \nless spending. Now we are seeing the reverse. President Bush comes in \nto cut taxes, cut spending, reduce the national debt. Ironically, some \nofficials in New Hampshire are doing just the opposite--raising taxes, \ntrying to find more revenue.\n  Now more than ever, I believe that hard-working Americans deserve tax \nrelief. If you buy a television set and pay $600, and you get home and \nthe price tag says $450, you were overcharged. So you go back to the \nstore and get your money back.\n  We hear all the fancy and somewhat bureaucratic terms--surplus; we \nhave a big surplus in the Federal Government. What that means is the \ntaxpayers of America have been overcharged. That is more money than we \nneed to operate our Government. It ought to go back to you. It is that \nsimple. We will hear it today. We have heard it all week. We heard it \nlast night in the response to the President that we don't need this tax \ncut; it is too big.\n  I make a suggestion to those who don't need it and don't want a \nrefund: When you send in your tax return, put a little check mark on it \nthat says you don't want the money, and send a check back to the \nFederal Government. You don't have to take the tax credit if you don't \nwant it. If you don't want the tax cut, send the money back and we will \nput the money on the debt. I am fascinated by those who say they don't \nwant the tax cut. Fine, you don't have to take it; you can turn it \nback.\n  There are a lot of people out there who do want it. For starters, \nAmericans spend more money paying taxes than they do on food, clothing, \nand shelter combined. That is wrong, pure and simple. We need to change \nthat.\n  President Bush last night in a bipartisan, nonconfrontational but \nfirm and resolute way said let's do this for the American people. We \nalways hear the debates. That taxes will get cut, and they don't get \ncut. It seems to be a bunch of words that don't mean anything. The \nPresident reached out and said: Let's not get into class warfare; let's \njust reduce taxes on the American people. It is good for the economy. \nIt is good for the people. It is their money. It is not ours; it is \ntheirs.\n  Federal taxes alone cost American families $7,238 per year. That is \nmore than any other item in their budget for most people. Taxpayer \nfreedom day, the average day Americans first start working for \nthemselves, was May 10 last year. So from January 1 to May 10, you \nworked to pay your Federal taxes. Where is the incentive to move \nforward and to succeed and do better? I say return the money.\n  Not only are we returning money to the people from whom we took it; \nwe are paying down the debt at the same time. A lot of people say, I \ndon't want tax relief; don't give me tax relief; just pay down the \ndebt. We are saying we are doing both. If you own a Government savings \nbond, we cannot pay that because we owe that to you. And you may have a \n20- or 30-year bond. If we wanted to pay it off in one fell swoop, we \ncouldn't. But a $2 trillion reduction over 10 years is pretty doggone \ngood.\n  For every 8 hours of work performed, the average taxpayer in America \nworks 3 hours to pay the tax collector. I think that is too much. I \nknow some who hem and haw, saying, I don't know whether I can support \nthis tax cut; it is too big, too small--a thousand different reasons. I \nthink if the average taxpayer has to work until May 10 to pay their \nFederal taxes, has to work 3 hours of every day to pay the tax \ncollector, it is time the taxpayer got a break.\n  This is a big break. Today's average taxpayer faces a combined \nFederal, State, and local tax burden of nearly 50 percent of their \nincome. I am delighted to support this President in providing the \ntypical family of four paying income taxes a full $1,600 in tax relief.\n  We are in Washington talking about trillions. I don't know what is \nafter trillion. I hope we don't have to deal with it during my tenure \nin the Senate. We are talking trillions and billions and occasionally \nmillions. Let's talk in hundreds and thousands. That is what the \naverage American deals with--hundreds of dollars and thousands of \ndollars, not trillions and billions. Let's bring it down. Ask yourself \nwhat you could do with $1,600 if you didn't have to give it to the \nFederal Government. What could you do? There are a lot of things you \ncould do. I am sure you can think of them as well as I can. If you have \na child, say, born this year, if you multiply $1,600 times 18 years and \nadd the compounded interest if you put it in a bank account somewhere \nor a CD, you will find you have a pretty doggone good downpayment on a \ncollege education--for the first year anyway--or perhaps a little more \nmoney for groceries, a little more money for clothing, perhaps a little \nbit for that first home mortgage. Add it up. That is real money, as \nEverett Dirksen used to say.\n\n  I think we have to get away from talking about all these trillions \nand billions of dollars and think about what that means to the average \ntaxpayer of America. I say this in all sincerity: If there are \ntaxpayers out there who do not want that $1,600, send it back. But for \nthe rest of us who might like to have it and the families all across \nAmerica who struggle really hard to make ends meet who would like that \n$1,600, why should we take it away from them? But some are proposing we \ndo that.\n  President Bush is not. President Bush is saying we need to give that \nback to the taxpayers; nobody ought to spend more than one-third of \ntheir paycheck to support the Federal Government. I agree with him. It \nis refreshing to hear it.\n  But the President also believes a tax rate of 15 percent is too high \nfor hard-\n\n[[Page S1665]]\n\nworking men and women who earn low wages. So he has proposed we lower \nthat even to 10 percent, down from 15 percent--I agree with that--and \ndouble the child tax credit to $1,000 per child, and eliminate the \nmarriage penalty, penalizing people who get married.\n  We in the Federal Government should be encouraging the makeup of the \nfamily not breakup, and, of course, eliminating the infamous death tax \nwhich the President mentioned last night. All your life, you work hard \nto earn money, pay taxes on that money, and have perhaps a business or \nhome or some asset you want to leave to your children, and they cannot \nafford to receive it from you upon your death because they cannot pay \nthe taxes on it, so they have to sell it, whether it be a business or \nhome. That is not right. We ought to change it. Yet there are some who \nstill want to fight the President on that--a million-dollar threshold \nor whatever. When you start talking about a business or what you build \nup all your life, if you have to sell it to pay all the taxes, what are \nyou going to do?\n  This is a good plan: Pay down the debt and give money back to the \ntaxpayers who provided the money for us. We--all of us, the taxpayers--\nfunded the cold war. We won the cold war. We funded that national debt, \nunfortunately, for all those years, and now we are going to defund it. \nWe are going to pay it off, and we are going to give money back to the \ntaxpayers who earned it.\n  There is one great thing about this budget. I have been around here \nfor a few years, and I have seen many budgets come and go. Most of them \nare dead on arrival, but I am hopeful this one will not be because this \nPresident not only reduces debt and provides tax relief for the \nAmerican family but he also funds important priorities.\n  I can remember--and many of my colleagues can, too--year after year, \npeople coming down here saying we were going to lose our money, we were \ngoing to lose this and that, we were going to get cut here and there \nbecause we were fighting for every single dollar because the interest \non the debt was going up $300 billion, $400 billion a year just to fund \nthat debt.\n  We are changing that now. We are reversing that. It is a new \nparadigm. It is a new America, a new century, a new President. There is \nnew excitement here in Washington because we are paying off debt, we \nare paying back taxpayers the money they deserve to get back, and we \nare funding new initiatives and new priorities, good initiatives and \ngood priorities.\n  Let's talk about some of them. One is the environment. I chair the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee in the Senate. I commend \nPresident Bush's budget. It invests in one of our Nation's most \nimportant assets, our environment. Where are we without it? He is \nproposing to accelerate the cleanup of toxic waste sites called \nbrownfields. It is a reflection of the bill that Senator Chafee and I \nhave introduced to clean up brownfields. The administration has \nendorsed that bill. I am very excited about it because brownfields, \nthese toxic waste sites, are all over America. There are some 400,000 \nto 500,000 of them, some in New Hampshire.\n  What is a brownfield? A brownfield is a site that has toxic waste in \nit. It is not a Superfund site, not as bad as some of them, but for \nyears and years contractors have been afraid to come on these sites and \nclean them up for fear the Federal Government would come in and say \nthey did not do a good enough job and fine them, and so forth. We have \nnow clarified this in the law so these sites can be cleaned up.\n  Here is what it accomplishes: No. 1, it cleans up a blight in a \ncommunity. These are not just large cities. It is also the small town \nof Bradford, NH. I say to any of my constituents in Bradford, if you \nare listening, help is coming for you. In the town of Bradford, there \nis a toxic waste site that needs to be cleaned up. It has not been \ncleaned up because the law has not allowed it to be cleaned up. They \nwant to make a park there. All they have been trying to do is get the \nfunds to clean up this site to make a park. This is what we can do \nbecause the President has laid out a budget that pays down that debt, \nputs money back in the taxpayers' pockets, and allows us to fund \nprograms such as this for the first time in so many years--truly fund \nthem.\n  I am excited about it. When you clean up that brownfield, you are \ngoing to create jobs because somebody is working to clean it up; No. 2, \nyou are going to eliminate the blighted site in the community; and, No. \n3, maybe somebody builds something there, a new business or something \nthat does not go outside of town and bulldoze off 10 acres of green \nspace. It is just a fantastic opportunity, and President Bush came \nright out of the gate and mentioned it specifically last night in his \nspeech: Brownfields legislation. We are going to help clean up \nbrownfields. That is good news for certainly every large city in \nAmerica and thousands of small towns all across America.\n  It is a great opportunity we have not had in the past because we had \nthis debt. Now we are not only putting money back directly in the \npockets of the taxpayers, under this budget, but we are also putting \nmoney back into the community. So if you are a taxpayer in Bradford, \nNH, you are going to get a Federal tax cut if you pay taxes and, \nsecond, you are going to have your community improved with dollars that \nare going to come into that community because we have the opportunity \nto do it now because we are running these surpluses.\n  This is exciting news. It is not just brownfields. I could go on and \non with a number of environmental priorities where we could do this--\nwater infrastructure, sewerage pipes, clean water--all kinds of \nenvironmental initiatives now that we will be able to fund.\n  Another one is the Land and Water Conservation Fund where moneys can \nbe provided to help create parks and trails and so many other positive \nthings--habitats. It is just a great opportunity for us.\n  Another item is defense. The defense of the United States has been \nneglected over the past several years. Everybody knows it. The \nPresident has proposed a $5.7 billion increase in pay and benefits. I \njust came back from the Mediterranean, visiting the troops out there, \nworried about terrorist attacks and so forth, putting their lives on \nthe line every single day. And some of them are on food stamps? Come \non, America. We can do better.\n\n  The President of the United States, within days of the beginning of \nhis term, went directly to the military aboard ship and on bases and \ntold our sailors, our airmen, our marines, who are defending our \ninterests and values all over the world: We are going to increase your \npay and benefits. He lived up to that promise, and he put it in the \nbudget.\n  It should be there. It absolutely should be there. We take for \ngranted what these men and women do. Believe me, we take it for \ngranted. If you have a young son, or daughter, or husband, or wife, or \na dad, or a mom who is out there, you know we take that for granted. \nThey are the best in the world, and they deserve the best we can \nprovide them. Now, finally, with this budget we are able to do that. It \nwill give the military the vital funds to compete with the private \nsector in order to recruit the best people.\n  President Bush has correctly realized our increasingly high-tech \nmilitary requires that special steps be taken in order to attract and \nretain personnel with computer science and other disciplines. Right \nnow, there is a great opportunity out there in the private sector. A \nlot of people are pulled to that, but many people want to serve in the \nmilitary, and if they just have the opportunity to do it, with better \npay and better benefits, we can pull more people toward the military.\n  In addition to the military pay and benefits, the President has \npledged to increase pay incentives for highly trained military \npersonnel, and I know that is good news for the military.\n  Let me discuss a couple of other issues: Education. I am a former \nteacher. I taught school for 6 years. You are never a former teacher; \nyou are always a teacher. I also served on a school board. I have also \nbeen a father for 25-plus years. So I think I know a little bit about \neducation from four or five different perspectives, if you will.\n  I agree; decisions regarding education are best done at the local \nlevel, period. That is where the best decisions are made. You cannot \nsugar-coat that any other way. The best decisions are made at the local \nlevel. We don't need\n\n[[Page S1666]]\n\na national school board running our public schools.\n  We need the local school boards to run those schools with the \nparents, with the teachers, with the administrators, and with the \nstudents working together.\n  Some will say there is a lot of money in President Bush's education \nplan. There is an 11-percent increase in education funding at the \nFederal level. Look how it is applied. This plan provides the local \nschools, local districts, and States more freedom in administering the \nFederal dollars. They are going to have more choices. They are going to \ncombine dozens and dozens of Federal education programs into only five \nand allow the States and the local communities to spend the money as \nthey see fit in the categories that they see as best.\n  President Bush said last night: Leave no child behind. I think this \nis the best opportunity we have had in many years to make that come \ntrue. Passing year after year a child who can't read or write doesn't \ndo any good. It puts them at a tremendous disadvantage when they come \nout into society. It is not necessary. Our schools and teachers should \nbe about kids. If they can't compete, then parents ought to have the \nopportunity to say, well, I am going to go over here to this school or \nthis school. That is what rich folks do. They send their kids to some \nprivate school, if they want to. They borrow money to do it because \nthey don't like the public school.\n  I am a former public school teacher. I am a strong advocate of public \nschools. They ought to be competitive and good. And if they are not and \nwon't improve, then parents ought to have the right to choose another \nschool.\n  The Bush plan provides schools with more freedom in administering \nthese Federal dollars. But it also holds States accountable for \nimproving student achievement, which will be demonstrated through \nassessments in reading and math. The plan provides reading programs \nwhich will be available to States to provide research-based reading \nprograms in the early elementary grades and low-income preschools.\n  Some think we are going to put all of this taxpayer money on the \npublic debt and not do anything else and that we are going to cut these \nprograms. We are not. That is the beauty of the budget. It is one of \nthe best, if not the best, budgets I have seen since I have been in \nWashington. It preserves and protects Social Security. It locks away \nevery penny--$2.6 trillion goes right into the lockbox for Social \nSecurity. We cannot touch it for anything else. There will be no more \nGovernment greedy hands in there borrowing the money and using it for \nsomething else.\n  In addition, the President talks about making those dollars in Social \nSecurity go further.\n  With Medicare, it is the same thing. It spends every dime for \nMedicare. That is what it is gathered for and collected for, and that \nis what it should be spent for. It passes it on.\n  I have spent a year looking at the prescription drug issue. It can be \ndone without hurting the program's solvency. We can provide help for \nour senior citizens who need prescription drugs. They deserve it and \nare going to get that help under this budget.\n  Finally, faith-based initiatives are somewhat of a controversial \nmatter. It is not controversial to me. I think the President made it \nvery clear last night. Faith-based proposals can get the job done. \nThere are so many people out there working in various charitable \norganizations, whether they be religious or not. They are trying to do \na job. We are not picking sides. The President is simply saying why not \nhelp all of these good-hearted Americans who are working and doing a \nwonderful job to restore and heal the lives of men and women in need? \nThey can do it better than any Federal Government program. They can do \nit better than any bureaucrat in Washington, and they are doing it OK. \nGod bless them. If you have ever been out to see what they do, your \nheart goes out to them. In spite of everything, they are out there day \nin and day out begging for more money. We need a chance to provide the \ndollars to these folks who can get people back on track and be \nproductive again.\n\n  Billy Graham once said that our basic problems today are not social \nproblems; it is not a lack of education. The problems are the problems \nof the human heart, a heart that is not right to God. These \norganizations recognize that God has the power to change lives and heal \nwounds and instill an inner drive in people so they have tools to \nchange destructive behavior.\n  Faith-based organizations provide needed community services. This is \na nation under God. We are not supposed to take God out of our \nGovernment. We are just not supposed to have a state-sponsored church. \nSometimes we forget that. Why not help these people? President Bush \ndoes. He took it head on. He knew he was going to get hit for it. But \nhe is doing it anyway. That is leadership. Faith-based organizations \nare very effective, and they are going to get help. That is why I \nsupport President Bush's plan.\n  Let me close with this point: Under this budget, we pay back $2 \ntrillion of the national debt over the next 10 years. We provide $1.6 \ntrillion to go back into the pockets of the people from whom we took \nit. And we do all of these things that I mentioned. I haven't even \ngotten started with the things I could have added to the list. That is \na good budget.\n  I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that is leadership. When you step \nup to the plate and take on something such as that, that is leadership. \nPresident Bush deserves a lot of credit for coming up here last night \nand laying that out in a concise and clear way and not being afraid to \ntake on these tough challenges.\n  I sincerely hope my colleagues will act quickly to pass this budget \nso the country will be the beneficiary of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/28/senate-section/article/S1666-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1666-S1667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DALE EARNHARDT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an American \nlegend, a workingman who rose from his roots to the very top of his \nprofession, indeed, to the top of the world, the racing world, that is. \nAnd that is why we loved him.\n  As all legends, he was the best at what he did. He was the greatest \nrace car driver in the history of NASCAR and perhaps the greatest \ndriver who ever lived.\n  With an uncanny feel for his car in a take-no-prisoners attitude on \nthe track, he brought millions and millions of fans into the sport. \nThat is why we loved him.\n  He was the people's champ, the last cowboy, iron head, the \nintimidator, but most of all and most appealing about him was that he \nwas funny and warm. He was like us. He was human. He was accessible. \nAnd that is why we loved him.\n  But Dale Earnhardt was much, much more. When a young fan was dying of \ncancer, Dale spent 15 minutes on the phone with him and flatly rejected \nany attempt to publicize it. When a local pastor came around seeking \ndonations to pave the parking lot in his church, Dale wrote out a check \nfor the full amount on the condition that the pastor never reveal that \nall the money came from one person, and especially not who that person \nwas. He routinely aided high school bands and church groups and once \ngave John Andretti a motor so he could qualify.\n  When the wife of the doctor who tended drivers injured at the track \nhad to travel across the country, leaving his pregnant wife behind, \nDale called to make sure she was all right, and then sent two men with \na pickup to the mountain retreat where they lived just in case she \nneeded a fast trip to the hospital.\n  His favorite charity, one that is familiar to many of us, was the \nMake a Wish Foundation--perhaps because he knew what true magic was all \nabout.\n  Describing the tough racer with the tender heart, one NASCAR \npublicist said: He'd do nothing for you on the track but anything for \nyou off it. That is why we loved him.\n  As we all know, Dale Earnhardt died a week from last Sunday on the \nfinal lap of the Daytona 500 doing what he did best--racing for \nvictory. Victory alluded him but death did not.

Mr. President, I rise, just for a few minutes, to comment \non the President's address last night and the budget that he has sent \nto the Congress. It, indeed, represents a new beginning, a new start, a \ncause for hope, a cause for optimism that is reflected in the benefits \nand the advantages for every family in Tennessee, as well as across the \nUnited States of America.\n  The budget does set a roadmap, a blueprint, as we look to the future, \nas we look to next year, the next 5 years, and the next 10 years. Very \nclearly, the President's budget does three things: No. 1, it funds \nAmerica's priorities, as we have debated in campaigns over the last 6 \nto 8 months and debated on the floor of the Senate over the past couple \nyears. It funds the largest debt reduction in not just the history of \nthe United States but the history of the world. And it provides fair \nand responsible tax relief.\n  First and foremost, I believe it pays off historic amounts of debt. \nIt provides absolutely the fastest and largest debt reduction ever seen \nin history--$2 trillion over a 10-year period.\n  Secondly, it funds many programs that we are currently discussing and \ndebating, and programs that we are putting together, investing in \nindividual families, in children, in youth, in health care, and in \neducation. It strengthens education. It allows the opportunity to \nmodernize education. And as has been pointed out on the floor, it \noffers the largest spending increase of any Federal department--over 11 \npercent. It triples funding for children's reading programs.\n  In the field of health care--and the President mentioned it last \nnight in his address--he looks in the direction of the uninsured. There \nare about 42, 43 million people uninsured. He addresses the uninsured \nby, on the one hand, saying, yes, we need to further invest in the \nNational Institutes of Health, and continues that doubling, but he also \nmentioned 1,200 new community health centers that will be there \ntomorrow for people who are uninsured, who depend on those community \nhealth centers for their health care. That makes health care more \naccessible for all.\n  He talked about refundable tax credits, again, to lower that barrier \nwhich stands between many people, and having the appropriate access to \nan insurance policy that will be there for acute care and chronic care \nand preventive care.\n  Thirdly, the President spoke loudly and clearly when he said now is \nthe time we can take advantage of a surplus that has been generated by \nhard-working men and women and families out there, a surplus that \nreflects their dollars, their hard work.\n  Now is the time for responsible tax relief--using roughly one-fourth \nof the budget surplus--to provide the typical family of four paying \nincome taxes as much as $1,600 of tax relief, a 50-percent tax cut for \nthat typical family of four making $50,000.\n  I thought last night was a time when we had the opportunity to talk \nabout the hopes and dreams in an optimistic way, with a new beginning \nfor every family. I do want to underscore the privilege and opportunity \nI have of working on the Budget Committee of the Senate, where we will \ngo into further detail over the next several days as this budget is \nlaid out before us. It is a new beginning with the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for \ntalking about the President's budget plan. I, too, am very pleased that \nPresident Bush is keeping the promises he made to the American people \nwhen he was elected President of the United States. Congress is going \nto work with the President to make sure we have the balanced and \nresponsible approach he has requested of Congress to work with him.\n  Let's talk about the balance that is in this plan. We have a $5.6 \ntrillion surplus. The first and foremost responsibility we have with \nthis surplus is to protect Social Security. That is exactly what we do. \nWe will protect Social Security by keeping all of the Social Security \npart of the surplus in the Social Security fund.\n  Secondly, we are going to spend more money for high-priority items. \nThe President has outlined the high-priority items he considers are No. \n1 issues facing America today--No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3: Public \neducation, national defense, and prescription drug benefits for our \nsenior citizens.\n  There is no question that many people believe they cannot afford the \ndrugs they have to take to stay healthy. That is not a choice people \nshould have to make. We want to make sure they do have the fundamental \nprescription drugs they need at a price they can afford. So we will \nhave to spend more money in that area.\n  National security is the major responsibility of the U.S. Government. \nStates and individuals cannot protect themselves from wars or from an \nincoming ballistic missile. We must do that with all of the States \ncontributing to our country and our Federal Army, Navy, Air Force, and \nMarines.\n  So we have to make sure our men and women in the military have the \nhealth care, the educational benefits for themselves and their \nchildren, and the pay they deserve. These are the people on the front \nline. These are the people stepping up to the plate to protect our \nfreedom--our freedom to talk on the floor today, our freedom to go to a \nplayground and have safety on that playground. These are the people on \nthe front line doing it. We are going to treat them well.\n  Of course, we must have a public education system that allows every \nchild to reach his or her full potential with a public education. We \nwant no child in our country to be left behind. If we can get the \nresources to these children at the earliest levels, where they have \nbasic reading skills in the third grade, where they have the ability to \ndo simple basic math in the fourth grade, then we will give them the \ntools they need to be able to learn algebra and calculus and the more \ncomplicated math and science and reading opportunities they must be \nable to address. So we are going to fund those priorities at a higher \nlevel.\n  We are going to pay down the debt at the greatest rate we can. We \ncannot pay down the debt fully because people would not be able to \ninvest in Treasurys. We want that very safe investment for our people. \nAnd we want to invest for the United States. We want our Government \nmoney to earn interest. We don't want it to sit there. We will have \nsome debt, but all of the outside-owned debt is going to be paid down, \n$2 trillion over the next 10 years.\n\n  Last, but certainly not least, we are going to give tax relief to \nevery American. Every American who is working will get tax relief under \nthe plan put forward last night by President Bush. We are going to \nsimplify the tax system. We have a five-rate structure today: a 15-\npercent bracket, a 28-percent bracket, a 31-percent bracket, a 36-\npercent bracket, and a 39.6-percent bracket. We want to lower all of \nthose rates and only have four: a 10, 15, 25, and a 33.\n  I thought the President said it very well last night. He thinks \nanyone in the 15-percent bracket should pay no more than 10 percent of \nhis or her income to the Federal Government. As well, we don't think \nany American should pay more than one-third of what they make to the \nFederal Government, so the top bracket would be 33 percent.\n  What does that mean in real terms? It means that one in five \ntaxpaying families with children will no longer pay any income tax at \nall. It will completely remove 6 million American families from the tax \nrolls. A family of four making $35,000 would get a 100-percent Federal \nincome tax cut--off the rolls. A family of four that makes $50,000 \nwould receive a 50-percent tax cut, receiving approximately $1,600 in \nrelief. A family of four making $75,000 will receive a 25-percent tax \ncut. We are going to give real relief to every working American.\n\n[[Page S1668]]\n\n  We are also going to increase the earned-income tax credit to make \nsure people who are coming off welfare know that it is better to work \nand there is a reward for working rather than being on welfare. These \nare the effects that tax relief can make for every American.\n  We will also double the child tax credit to make sure every family \nwith children will have a $1,000-per-child tax credit rather than the \n$500-per-child tax credit they now have. We want to make sure that you \ncan deduct your charitable contributions, even if you don't itemize \ndeductions. We want to eliminate the death tax because we don't think \nsomeone in America should have to sell their family-owned business or \ntheir farm just to pay taxes to the Federal Government. This is not \nmoney that has never been taxed. It is money that was taxed when it was \nearned and taxed when it was invested. There is no need to tax it \nagain. We have a projected $5.6 trillion surplus, and we do not think \npeople should have to pay taxes and sell a small business and take away \nall the jobs in that small business just to pay taxes to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  We do want to lower the Federal tax burden on the families of our \ncountry at the same time that we are paying down the debt so it will be \nthe very minimum amount of debt required to have Government securities. \nWe do want to prioritize spending so we are covering the costs that we \nknow are a priority--public education, a strong national defense, \nprescription drug options under Medicare. These are the things where we \nwill increase money, and we will flat line expenses that we don't need \nto increase.\n  Some people say: You mean you are actually going to not spend more in \na Government program? Well, doesn't every family budget that way? Does \na family spend the same amount every year on the same items? No. Maybe \nyour children need more in clothes this year or maybe they don't need \nmore in clothes. Maybe they are OK on clothes, and so you can buy the \nnew computer. You make choices in a family. That is what we need to do \nin the Federal Government as well.\n\n  It is time we had a balanced approach. Every time I hear somebody \ncriticizing the tax cut plan, it is because they want to spend more \nmoney. We are making Social Security secure. We are going to give more \nbenefits under Medicare. My goodness, why would we want to spend more \nand more money when we have a surplus and when we are prioritizing the \nneeds of the Government and when the taxpayer dollars don't belong to \nGovernment.\n  That is the real difference. A lot of people around here think tax \ndollars belong to them. Tax dollars belong to the people who earn it, \nand they should have the choices to spend it the way they see fit for \ntheir families. This is not money I worked to earn, and I shouldn't \nmake the decisions on how to spend it except for the overall national \ngood. The overall national good should not take more than 33 percent of \nanyone's salary, and it should take the lowest amount that is \nabsolutely necessary because this is money people work very hard to \nbring home for their families.\n  I applaud the President for a balanced approach, for giving tax \nrelief to every American who is working, for paying down the debt at \nthe greatest rate that we have ever seen, for prioritizing our spending \nto increase national defense, public education, and Medicare \nprescription drug benefits, and to make sure all of our programs are \nsound and solid. We can do these things if we are responsible stewards \nof the taxpayer dollars and if we remember that the taxpayer dollars do \nnot belong to the Federal Government except to the extent absolutely \nnecessary. They belong to the people who earned them.\n  We are going to make sure we are responsible stewards of those \ndollars that people have worked so hard to support their family.\n  I will work with the President of the United States to be a \nresponsible leader with the very important duty we have to the people \nwho elected us to the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have a few minutes remaining on the \ntime allocated for us in morning business. I thank my friend from \nTexas. I certainly agree with her analysis of where these surplus \ndollars belong. That is the bottom line.\n  Obviously, we have a responsibility to fund the programs that are \nthere, programs that are important, the programs that genuinely belong \nas a responsibility of the Federal Government. We have a responsibility \nto ensure that Medicare and Social Security are there for people when \nthey need it. We have a responsibility to pay down the debt. Those of \nus in my generation have spent the money, and we are going to let the \nyounger generation pick up the bill. That is not what we want to do. We \nclearly have that responsibility.\n  Not everyone agrees, of course, on how to do that. That is the \npurpose of this body, to debate the various options. Generally, the \ndebate centers on the amount of expenditures in the Federal Government, \nthe size of the Federal Government.\n  There are those who believe the Federal Government has a \nresponsibility to do most everything for everybody, to be the \ngovernance of the whole country. Others believe there is a \nconstitutional limit on the kinds of things the Federal Government \nshould involve itself in, that in fact the real issue ought to be to \nsupport local and State governments, the governments closest to the \npeople, to do most of those things.\n  So that debate goes on and will, I suppose, go on for a very long \ntime. I was very impressed with the President's talk last night. \nApparently, most people in the country were, according to the kinds of \npolling and questions that were asked in terms of his command of the \nissues. I think everyone was impressed with that. I don't think there \nis any question but that the President has strengthened his \npresentations as opposed to when he was a candidate. Somebody wrote \nthat when he stepped into the Oval Office, he kind of transformed. That \nmay be so.\n  More important, of course, was the message that was sent, the things \nthe President put out as priorities. Again, I was impressed that he is \nnow seeking to implement those things he talked about and ran on in the \nelection. That is neat. That is what you are supposed to do--put out \nthe issues you are going to be for, and when you are elected, you do \nit. I think that is excellent.\n  I also believe one of the refreshing things about this speech last \nevening was that it was a little different direction from what we have \nbeen talking about over the last 8 years--a little different direction \nin putting some priorities on things and funding things even more than \nperhaps they have been funded. At the same time, we are seeking to \ncontrol the size of Government and put a 4-percent growth rate on \ndiscretionary spending. It was as high as 8 percent last year, and it \nwas 16 percent in some agencies. That is too high. Again, that depends \non your point of view.\n  I was very impressed with the President's presentation. Obviously, it \nwill be debated and discussed. We have already had a good deal of \ndiscussion about the size of it. That seems kind of interesting. We \nwill talk about it some more.\n  The size of the Bush tax cut is fairly modest, as a matter of fact, \nby historical standards. Going back to President Kennedy, he \nrecommended a tax reduction that was 2 percent of the gross national \nproduct. President Reagan had a tax reduction that chose 3.3 percent of \nthe gross national product. President Bush's proposal is 1.2 percent. \nThat is less than either of the others in terms of the gross national \nproduct. All this stuff we hear about it being so out of size--\napparently, comparatively it is not.\n  Also, I think it is kind of interesting to look at the next 10-year \nprojection of total income, which is about $28 trillion. The tax relief \nover that same 10-year period is about $1.6 trillion. I never thought I \nwould say $1.6 trillion isn't a lot because it is; but compared to the \ntotal, it is a small, or relatively small, percentage. I think that is \nsomething to keep in mind.\n  Also, as you look at what happened in terms of having surpluses, in \nrelation to spending here, there is a substantial difference. Average \ndiscretionary spending, during the time when\n\n[[Page S1669]]\n\nwe were without a surplus, was about 2 percent over the last couple \nyears. With the surplus, it has been 6 to 8 percent.\n  Now I don't argue the fact that some of the spending is the kind of \nspending we want to make. I am persuaded--and I have seen this in my \nown State legislature and here certainly--when there is a surplus, the \ngrowth of government goes up substantially. It goes up almost \nuncontrollably. So I think the idea of doing the three or four basic \nthings the President set out last night is substantially right. One is \nto provide the money for those things that are key priorities in our \nGovernment activities. Two is to pay off the national debt under the \nproposition that it would be paid off in 10 years--all that can be paid \noff under the economic circumstances. And then we will have a tax \nreturn to the people who have paid the dollars.\n\n  We are all interested, of course, in those issues, in those \nactivities that are out there, such as education. I was home this \nweekend, and we talked a little about how we see our State, our \ncommunities, our public lands, and our families in Wyoming in 10, 15 \nyears. Interestingly enough, the most common thing, actually, was \neducation and the economy--jobs. Of course, we all want our kids to \nhave the best education but there is quite a little interest in having \njob training and education. Everywhere you go, education is always \nthere.\n  This proposal has the Education Department at an 11.5-percent \nincrease--which is the most in a very long time--to go for young people \nin preschool and reading and those things.\n  Of course, Social Security is to be protected; $1.6 trillion out of \nthe surplus would be preserved there.\n  Medicare, of course, comes out of the 2.5 percent on top of the \nSocial Security. It would be there for a priority for doing some \nthings. Pharmaceuticals: That is going to be a difficult thing, but it \nis something we are all dedicated to doing.\n  Strengthening defense, of course. It is interesting. I have had a \ncouple opportunities to go on bases. One is in my home State. It is a \nmissile base, Warren Air Force Base. I asked: What are your highest \npriorities? First was housing, particularly enlisted and NCO housing. \nSome of it had been there 30, 40 years. I went down to Quantico, VA, \nwhere I served in the Marine Corps. The first priority was base \nhousing.\n  In this budget is a substantial amount of money for pay and housing \nfor the military and also for health care. Then we will properly take a \nlook at the military in general, the strategic aspects of it and \nweapons aspects of it. Times have changed, and the whole challenge of \nthe military has changed. We used to go in with five divisions and \ntanks and artillery. Now we are more likely to have to move about a \ngroup by air and ship, and they have to sustain themselves for weeks. \nIt is a totally different kind of thing.\n  I think we have a great opportunity here to meet our obligations as \nthe Federal Government, to meet our fairness obligations with the \ntaxpayers and return the surplus to them, and to meet our obligations \nto young people by paying off the debt we have incurred.\n  I am excited about the opportunities. If you want to look down the \nroad, what do you see? How do you see the Federal Government? How do \nyou see our country in 15 years? These are the kinds of things that \nwill be important to us--to strengthen the economy with an energy \npolicy and do these kinds of things.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to give my first speech on \nthe Senate floor, mindful of what a great privilege it is to stand here \nand also what a tremendous opportunity it is to be of service to \nothers.\n  I am also mindful that I was elected last fall for special reasons. I \nmade some very important promises to Minnesotans, promises that I \nintend to keep. Foremost among them was my promise to Minnesota senior \ncitizens to help design and pass prescription drug coverage that would \nbe available to everyone who is presently receiving Medicare.\n  Far too many times last year, I saw the suffering and the fear which \nour elderly were experiencing. I saw it in their weary faces, in their \neyes filled with tears, and in their trembling hands. For them, the \npromises of Social Security and Medicare were unraveling, promises of \nretirement years with reliable economic security, free at least from \nthe financial uncertainties and emergencies. But in their lives, higher \nand higher prescription drug prices destroyed their financial health \nand ravaged their emotional well-being.\n  So last spring I began my ``Rx Express'' bus trips to Canada. \nBorrowing this idea from others, I took busloads of Minnesota senior \ncitizens to Canada where they could buy the same prescription medicines \nat far lower prices--often for half the cost in the United States, or \nless, for the same medicine, produced by exactly the same manufacturer.\n  I rode the first bus myself, leaving St. Cloud, MN, at 7 a.m. with 42 \nsenior citizens and returning almost 18 hours later. This was no \npleasure cruise. In fact, we spent the entire time crowded together on \na compact bus, stopping only for customs, a Canadian doctor's office, a \npharmacist, and for dinner. As we traveled those long hours, I was \nstruck by the awful absurdity of our trip, because we in Minnesota \npride ourselves on having world-class medical care facilities. In fact, \npeople come from all over the world to Minnesota for the best possible \nhealth care --places such as the Mayo Clinic, the University of \nMinnesota Hospital, and Children's Hospital. Yet here we were, enduring \na miserable travel marathon so that our senior citizens--the most \nelderly, frail, and vulnerable among us--could save precious dollars on \nthe costs of their life-saving medicines.\n  Believe me, their cost savings were very substantial. We took a dozen \nof these bus trips to Canada last year, and the average savings per \nsenior was $350. One gentlemen saved over $1,400 on the cost of his \nU.S. drugs for the 6 months. Another woman said to me that her life had \nbeen saved twice--once when her medicine became available, and the \nsecond time when she could actually afford them.\n  I will continue the Rx Express buses by donating my Senate paychecks \nto the Minnesota Senior Federation or some other organization that will \nuse my contributions to continue them. However, the solution to \nprescription drug affordability is not to bus every Minnesotan to \nCanada. Rather, it is to provide prescription drug coverage to every \nsenior citizen across America.\n\n  When I was home last week, many elderly Minnesotans asked me, when \nwill this kind of program become a reality? For them, the need is \nimmediate and acute. So their need for us to act is immediate and \nacute. Unfortunately, today Congress shows little sign of reacting with \nurgency to this emergency. Last year, Members deadlocked over the form \nthis coverage should take. Some favored adding prescription drug\n\n[[Page S1670]]\n\ncoverage as a direct benefit under Medicare. Others wanted to assist \nseniors in purchasing private insurance policies to provide such \ncoverage. Other proposals were introduced, but none gained enough \nsupport to pass into law.\n  So here we are again, and here again are the elderly in Minnesota and \nin 49 other States waiting for us to do what almost all of us say we \nwant to do. As the President said last night, no senior in America \nshould have to choose between buying food and buying prescriptions. The \nPresident is absolutely right. Yet today, across our country, retired \nAmericans are being forced to make that same terrible choice: Don't \neat, turn off the heat, or stop taking life-enhancing or even life-\npreserving medicines.\n  The President also said last night that Medicare must be modernized \nand we must make sure every senior on Medicare can choose a health care \nplan that offers prescription drugs. Again, the President is right. His \nwords offer hope to millions of seniors who do not have and cannot \nafford such coverage. But as my mother used to say to me when I was \ngrowing up, actions speak louder than words. She usually said that when \nmy actions or inactions were contradicting my words. For this Congress, \nthat test begins today.\n  Were all the commitments I made just words? Were all the promises I \nmade and heard others make just words? Were the President's assurances \nlast night just words? I know I meant what I said, and I truly believe \nPresident Bush meant what he said last night. But now we must act. Now \nwe must act.\n  The same proposals that were made last year can be considered again. \nI strongly prefer providing direct coverage under Medicare. I believe \nit best meets the essential requirements for any good plan--that the \nprogram would provide an immediate benefit; the plan would have \nuniversal coverage, the benefit being available to all eligible \nbeneficiaries; the plan would negotiate discounts, allowing both \nseniors and the Government to get the lowest prices, negotiating price \nreductions just as every large business with self-insurers or every \nlarge HMO regularly does on behalf of its clients; the plan would \nprovide catastrophic coverage for beneficiaries who have the highest \ndrug costs.\n  However, I also know that these are some of the very reasons the \npharmaceutical industry and others will fiercely oppose this particular \nprogram. I don't want to participate in another deadlock that prevented \nCongress from acting last year, nor do I want to participate in \ncreating new excuses for why Congress has not passed universal drug \ncoverage which the President can sign this year. I prefer it to be this \nmonth, but certainly no less than this year.\n\n  That timetable surely means designing and enacting a prescription \ndrug program that is separate from and passes before so-called \ncomprehensive Medicare reform. If that lengthy review and reform points \nto modifications or improvements in our previously enacted prescription \ndrug coverage, then so be it. If we can design a better, less costly, \nmore efficient program, then terrific, but as Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nsaid to his Cabinet when he took office in 1933: Try something. If it \ndoesn't work, try something else, but for God's sake, try something.\n  We can adopt one of the programs that has already been proposed or, \nin the President's spirit of bipartisanship, we can merge two of last \nyear's competing proposals providing, for example, direct Medicare \ncoverage for seniors earning up to 175 percent of the poverty level and \nfor seniors earning over that amount, private insurance policies. Then \nwe can see which one works better. What is important is to get \nsomething working now.\n  President Dwight Eisenhower once said: I think the people want peace \nso much that one of these days governments better get out of their way \nand let them have it. In the same way, I believe America's senior \ncitizens want prescription drug coverage so much that our Government \nhad better let them have it. The sooner the better.

Mr. President, this is the last day of February. I believe \nit was Percy Bysshe Shelley who said, ``O Wind, if Winter comes, can \nSpring be far behind?''\n  Spring is just around the corner.\n  Mr. President, while the Senate was in recess, the senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts became a little bit more senior. On February 22, \nSenator Edward Kennedy celebrated his 69th birthday.\n  Oh, to be 69 again.\n  In recognition of that occasion, I wish to say today what an \nenjoyable privilege it has been to work in the Senate with Ted Kennedy. \nHistory will be fair to Senator Kennedy, and I have no doubt that \nhistory will judge him as one of the most effective Senators on that \nroll of 1,864 Senators as of now.\n  He is one of those rare workhorses. In the Senate we have show horses \nand we have workhorses. The show horses, you see them on TV quite often \nfor the most part. Of course, we expect our elected leaders to be on TV \noften, but the workhorses, you don't see them on TV quite as often.\n  Ted Kennedy is one of those rare workhorse Senators in the truest \nmeaning of that word. We will say it is one word, ``workhorse.''\n  Nearly every piece of progressive legislation since 1977 bears, if \nnot Ted Kennedy's name, at least his imprint. That may be a bit of an \nexaggeration, so let me put it this way. I was first elected majority \nleader in the Senate in 1977. I was majority leader through the years \nof the Carter administration, 1977 through 1980. During that time, I \nwas very familiar with the committee work, the legislation that I \ncalled up, the legislation that was amended, and the legislation that \nwas adopted here and went to conference, the legislation that \neventually became law. Many pieces of progressive legislation, \nbeginning at the time of my tenure as majority leader the first time, \ncarried Ted Kennedy's imprint.\n  He is a Senator who does his homework; he knows his subject. When he \ncalls up an amendment, when he manages a bill, when he is the ranking \nmember on a bill that has been called up, Ted Kennedy knows what he is \ntalking about. We may not always agree with him, but we listen because \nwe know he has mastered that subject matter.\n  Although blessed with wealth, he has always been a powerful and \neloquent voice for the poor and oppressed, not just in the United \nStates but also around the world. And he has also been a powerful and \neloquent voice for the Democratic Party, its traditions, its causes.\n  We will long remember his soaring voice, his speeches to Democratic \nconventions, as well as his passionate struggle for the rights of the \nworking people, for health care reform, for the strengthening of the \nSocial Security net for America's less fortunate.\n  In the Senate, he has shown that public service is the place where, \nto paraphrase his late brother, John F. Kennedy, Americans can stop \nasking what their country can do for them but what they can do for \ntheir country.\n  Though we were out of session on Ted Kennedy's birthday, I say \nbelatedly that I will always remember the support that Senator Kennedy \ngave me during the years it was my privilege to serve as the Senate \nDemocratic leader. When times got tough, as they occasionally do for a \nSenate leader, I knew I could always count on Senator Kennedy's \nassistance. It may have been needed for an additional vote; it may have \nbeen for his assistance in building approval for a legislative \nproposal, but whatever was needed, Senator Kennedy was there, and I was \nthankful.\n\n  Senator Kennedy is a true friend, not only to me but also to the \npeople of West Virginia, and when I make this personal reference the \nfollowing two happenings will illustrate what I mean.\n  When I reached my 80th birthday--the Psalmist doesn't promise 80 \nyears; the Psalmist promises only 70, but goes on to say:\n\n\n[[Page S1671]]\n\n\n       And if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet \n     is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, \n     and we fly away.\n\n  On my 80th birthday, I was in Charleston, WV, and the then-Governor \nof the State, Gov. Cecil Underwood, had invited me over to the \nGovernor's mansion. I was enjoying a luncheon there, given by Cecil \nUnderwood in my honor. During the luncheon, I was called to the \ntelephone. On the telephone was my chief of staff, Barbara Videnieks, \nwho said to me, ``Senator, we have a visitor in the office,'' meaning \nhere in Washington. She said, ``Senator Ted Kennedy is here, and he has \nwith him 80 roses.''\n  Ted Kennedy brought the roses to my office himself, 80 roses. I never \nhad that to happen to me before, and I am not sure that many Senators \nin this Chamber, if any other than I, can recount such a beautiful \nexperience as that was for me. There was Ted Kennedy in my office--I \nwas in Charleston, at the Governor's mansion--with 80 roses on my 80th \nbirthday. You can bet before he was able to get out of my office and \ndown to the subway car I was on the telephone calling him and thanking \nhim for being such a real friend.\n  You would think we vote together just like that all the time. We \ndon't. But we never argue about it; we never have any falling out about \nit, when we have little differences of viewpoints with respect to \nlegislation. There is this underlying bond of friendship between \nSenator Kennedy and me.\n\n  Last year, I was at the Greenbriar with my wife of 63 years on our \nanniversary. And, lo and behold, here came to our room at the \nGreenbriar 63 red roses. From whom? Ted Kennedy. I was surprised. That \nis Ted Kennedy. Our friendship will always be strong. He thought of me \non our wedding anniversary, and he thought of Erma. He is just like \nthat. But who else sent me 63 roses on our wedding anniversary? Nobody.\n  I think it is remarkable that there has grown up that kind of bond of \naffection and friendship between these two Senators.\n  Most people probably remember President John F. Kennedy introducing \nhimself to the people of France by saying he was the person who \naccompanied Jaqueline Kennedy to Paris. A year before that, President \nKennedy, upon a return visit to the Appalachian coal fields in West \nVirginia, introduced himself saying--here is President Kennedy saying--\n``I will introduce myself--Teddy Kennedy's brother.''\n  During the last election, I saw for myself a tremendous display of \nthis continued affection for Senator Kennedy among my people, the \npeople of West Virginia. When Senator Kennedy and I appeared at a \npolitical rally in the heart of the State's southern coal fields where \nI grew up, we were promptly swamped by swarms of people--swarms of West \nVirginians, mountain people--seeking Ted Kennedy's autograph and \nwanting to shake hands with him or simply to see him.\n  I will always be pleased to introduce myself as Senator Ted Kennedy's \nfriend, and I will always be glad that I have had the opportunity to \nserve with him in the Senate.\n  I say belatedly to Ted Kennedy, with his birthday of a few days ago, \nSenator Kennedy, because of you, many people in this country are much \nbetter off. Because of you, millions of our citizens have a voice that \nis heard in these Halls. So happy birthday, Senator Kennedy, and may \nGod bless you.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was at a conference dealing with \nhealth care policy when my colleague, Senator Dayton, spoke. I come to \nthe floor to congratulate Senator Dayton for his words.\n  When he campaigned for the U.S. Senate seat, he spoke on cost of \nprescription drugs, especially for the elderly. I think it applies to \nmany other families as well. Over and over again, he said this was his \nNo. 1 priority. He said our country could do better. He said this was a \nmatter of elementary justice. He talked about older people in \nMinnesota--senior citizens--two-thirds of whom have no prescription \ndrug coverage. He talked about, for example, seniors cutting pills in \nhalf because they could not afford them or people running out of food \nor their homes being cold.\n  I think it is very significant that when Senator Dayton came to the \nfloor of the Senate today to give his first speech, his maiden speech, \nhe talked about prescription drug costs and his commitment to \nintroducing responsible legislation that will make a real difference in \nthe lives of people.\n  The reason I think it is significant is not only because he spoke on \nan issue that is very important to people's lives, but it is all the \nmore important because he said something about Mark Dayton in very \npersonal terms. He campaigned on this issue. He listened to many people \nin Minnesota, and many elderly people talk about these costs.\n  He came to the Senate after winning the election, and he basically \nstayed true to the commitment he made to people in his State. Senator \nDayton has been my friend for many years. I think he will be a great \nSenator.\n\n  I always said--and I said to Senator Rod Grams after the election--\nthat no one can ever say to Senator Rod Grams that he did not vote for \nwhat he believed in; that he did not say what he believed. I think he \ndeserves an awful lot of credit for that.\n  I never like it when anyone loses. I don't like to see people lose. I \nlike to see people win. It is because of my Jewish roots.\n  I think Mark Dayton is going to be a great Senator for the State of \nMinnesota and for this country, and I am very honored to serve in the \nSenate with him. As the senior Senator, I hope he will consider my \nviews over and over again. I doubt that he will. And it will probably \nmake him an even better Senator if he doesn't.\n  He spoke powerful words. I am sorry I was not on the floor with him. \nBut I thank him for his commitment to the people. I thank him for his \npassion. I thank him for caring about public service, and I thank \nSenator Dayton for caring about senior citizens and other citizens in \nthe country. I thank him for his commitment to Minnesota.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have become increasingly concerned about \nsome of the recent actions of the U.S. Supreme Court. As a member of \nthe bar of the Court, as a U.S. Senator, as an American, I, of course, \nrespect the decisions of the Supreme Court as being the ultimate \ndecisions of law for our country. As an American, I accept any of its \ndecisions as the ultimate interpretation of our Constitution, whether I \nagree or disagree. I have probably supported the Supreme Court and our \njudicial system more than anybody else on this floor.\n  Having said that, I think we can at least still have in this country \na discussion of some of the things the Court has done. Recently, we \nhave seen another assault by the Court on the legislative powers of \nCongress.\n  My concern may be more in sadness than in anger over what has \nhappened. It is very easy to give talks about activist Supreme Courts, \nbut it is hard to think of a time, certainly in my lifetime, with a \nmore activist Supreme Court than the current one. Last week, the Court \nheld that State employees are not protected by the Federal law banning \ndiscrimination against the disabled. The case was decided by the same \n5-4 majority that brought us\n\n[[Page S1672]]\n\nBush v. Gore and other examples of judicial activism, the so-called \n``conservative'' wing of the Rehnquist Court.\n\n  I accept they are indeed ``conservative'' in the sense that they \ngreatly restrict the role of the Federal Government in protecting the \nindividual rights and liberties of ordinary Americans. They are very \nconservative in the sense they have decided that the unelected five-\nmember majority can go against the overwhelming bipartisan position of \nthe elected Members of the House and the Senate, Republican and \nDemocrat.\n  The case I speak of involved two Alabama State employees. Patricia \nGarrett sued the University of Alabama for demoting her when she \nreturned to work after undergoing treatment for breast cancer. Milton \nAsh sued the State Department of Youth Services for refusing to modify \nhis duties and work environment to accommodate his medical problems, \nwhich included chronic asthma.\n  These are precisely the sorts of grievances Congress set out to \nremedy when it passed a landmark civil rights law called the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, commonly known as the ADA. I was proud to be \npart of the overwhelming bipartisan consensus that passed the ADA--\nproud because of the principles the ADA stands for. It stands for the \nprinciple that America does not tolerate discrimination against those \nin our society who suffer misfortune and illness. It stands for the \nprinciple that every disabled person in America is entitled to be \ntreated fairly in the workplace. And it stands for the principle that \nall employers, whether government or private employers, should be held \naccountable in a court of law when they violate the rights of the \ndisabled.\n  Nondiscrimination, fairness in employment, and government \naccountability are each important core values in our society. They are \nprinciples that the American people know well and hold dear. They are \nthe values that the first President Bush upheld when he signed the ADA \ninto law. I remember it very well, that day at the White House when he \nsigned the law. He reminded the Supreme Court of these principles when \nhe took the unusual step of writing an eloquent brief to the Supreme \nCourt in support of the ADA and in support of Patricia Garrett and \nMilton Ash's right to their day in court. I applaud him for that.\n  Sadly, last week the activist wing of the Supreme Court paid little \nheed to the view of either democratic branch of our government--the \nCongress that enacted the ADA or former President Bush who signed it \ninto law. These five activist Justices gave short shrift to the core \nvalues of the American people that the ADA embodies.\n  Instead of protecting the disabled from discrimination, they denied \nthe disabled their day in court. Instead of requiring fair treatment \nfor all American workers, they created a special exception limiting the \nrights of government workers. Instead of promoting government \naccountability, they championed, above all else, the obscure doctrine \nof State sovereign immunity. That is legalese for saying the government \ngets a special exemption, preventing it from being held accountable in \na court of law.\n  We hear a lot of rhetoric, complaining about so-called ``activist'' \njudges. I have heard it used by my friends on the other side of the \naisle to describe Democratic judicial appointees who say they will \nuphold settled law, such as Roe v. Wade, or those who have been \nassociated with public interest organizations that have fought to \ndefend individual civil liberties. It is sometimes applied even to \nconservative Republican appointees such as Justices O'Connor and \nKennedy, when it is felt that they are not being conservative enough.\n\n  When he served on the Judiciary Committee in the Senate, our new \nAttorney General gave a speech on what he called ``judicial \ndespotism.'' He complained about ``the alarming increase in activism'' \non the Supreme Court. He referred to the majority of the Court, \nincluding Justice Kennedy, as ``ruffians in robes.''\n  I do not use such language. That kind of name calling does no good \nfor the mutually respectful relationship among the three branches of \ngovernment, the relationship that our Constitution and the American \npeople call for. I have refrained from using such language, even when I \nstrongly disagree with a decision, such as the 5-4 decision in Bush v. \nGore, when the Supreme Court, in effect, decided a Presidential \nelection.\n  But I mention the question of activism because the American people \nshould know that activism does not come in just one flavor. Some would \nsay judicial activism and liberal activism are one and the same. Of \ncourse they are not. Judicial activism can work both ways. It can work \nto expand protections for all our rights or it can be used to limit our \nrights.\n  As one of the Nation's leading constitutional scholars, Professor \nCass Sunstein, pointed out in an article last month, history teaches \nthat for most of the 20th century, judicial activism was predominantly \nconservative, and the unelected judicial branch was far to the right of \nthe democratic branches of our Government.\n  Actually, that is where we are today at the start of the 21st \ncentury. The reality today in courts such as the U.S. Supreme Court and \nFourth Circuit that are dominated by ideologically conservative \nRepublican appointees is that the dominant flavor of judicial activism \nis right wing. In fact, I do not think we have seen such right-wing \nactivism in the courts since the ultra conservative Supreme Court of \nthe 1920s and the 1930s.\n  There is also, as some commentators have pointed out, an almost \narrogant disregard of the Congress by the Supreme Court. There is a \nfeeling that the Congress is somehow unable, even in those cases where \nRepublicans and Democrats join hands in an overwhelming majority--that \nsomehow we are unable to express the will of the people or uphold the \nConstitution.\n  In statements that the Court has made, it acts as though the Congress \nis almost unnecessary; that we are not competent to do anything; that \nwe are irrelevant. Well, not totally irrelevant. I have heard from the \nJustices that they do want a pay raise. Last year, of course, they were \nasking for permission to give high-paying speeches to special interest \ngroups. I am glad the Court believes we are good for something.\n  Last week's ruling is really just the latest in a long and ever \ngrowing line of 5-4 decisions that second-guess congressional policy \njudgment to strike down Federal statutes and generally treat Congress \nas a least favored administrative agency rather than a coequal branch \nof the Federal Government.\n  Last year the Court took aim at the Age Discrimination in Employment \nAct and the Violence Against Women Act. Before that, it was our laws on \nintellectual property and workplace standards. Before that, it was our \ngun control laws.\n  Now the Court's ``federalism'' crusade adds workers with disabilities \nto its growing list of victims: older workers, children in gun-infested \nschools, intellectual property owners, and victims of violence \nmotivated by gender, to name just a few.\n\n  If you accept the common theme of this 5-4 majority in the U.S. \nSupreme Court, the Congress ought to just close up shop and leave town \nbecause they will do everything for the American people. The elected \nrepresentatives of the American people are unnecessary with, as I said, \nthe possible exception of voting for the pay raise that the courts have \nasked for.\n  Now it is up to another President Bush and another Congress to seek \nnew ways to protect the rights of disabled Americans and the rights of \nthe other groups sacrificed on the Court's altar of federalism. I \nbelieve Congress needs to reassert its Democratic prerogatives--\nrespectfully but firmly. Congress needs to reassert, in fact remind, \nthe Supreme Court of the Constitution, that we are a coequal branch of \ngovernment whose policy determinations deserve respect just as they ask \nrespect for their legal determinations. It is time for the people's \nelected representatives, Democratic and Republican, to reengage the \nbipartisan consensus of principle that produced the ADA, and to work \ntogether to restore the rights of ordinary Americans that have been \ntaken away by an increasingly activist U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Again, as I have said, I have stood on the floor of the Senate \ndefending the Supreme Court as much or more than\n\n[[Page S1673]]\n\nanybody I know in my 26 years here. I have defended the Supreme Court \non decisions even when I disagreed with the Court. I did that even with \nrespect to the 5-4 decision on the Florida election--actually the \nnational election. While I felt the Court was wrong, I stated that its \ndecision was the law and that we must all abide by it.\n  But I am disturbed by this increasingly dismissive tone of the Court, \nin which it acts as though the Congress, Republicans and Democrats \ntogether, do not have the ability to represent the American people. The \nfact that we were elected by people all over this great Nation is \nalmost irrelevant. In the ADA case, the fact that we had spent years on \nthis, and that a Republican President had strongly supported our \nposition, was irrelevant.\n  I think it is a dangerous path, just as it would be a dangerous path \nfor us to be dismissive of the U.S. Supreme Court. It is equally \ndangerous for the Court to be dismissive of the Congress because \nultimately the American people suffer. We as a Nation have maintained \nour democracy and fostered our wonderful growth because of our \nseparation of powers--because of the way we have sustained the three \nequal branches of Government. What a shame it would be if one branch, \nthe only unelected branch, continued to be so dismissive of the other \ntwo branches, both elected.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak for a few minutes as if \nin morning business. It is on a broad topic. It is about this day and \nwhat this is.\n  It seems kind of interesting when we start to celebrate things like \nSt. Patrick's Day or Valentine's Day. What is the basis? Why do we do \nthese things? There is always this kind of digging into it to find a \nvery interesting story.\n  For St. Valentine's Day, we celebrate it recognizing a priest who \nmarried people in Rome when it was forbidden. The Emperor at the time \nwas not given enough soldiers to sign up for the military because they \nwanted to get married, have families, and stay home with their \nfamilies. So the Emperor decreed that nobody could get married. The \npriest said: I don't agree with that. So he quietly and secretly \nmarried a number of people and was then later arrested, incarcerated, \nand beheaded for having done this nice, wonderful thing. It is a great \nreminder of what Valentine's Day is about when we send cards.\n  Today we celebrate Ash Wednesday. A number of people of different \nfaiths celebrate Ash Wednesday.\n  What is Ash Wednesday about? It comes from a number of references in \nthe Bible, particularly in Genesis where it says, ``Dust thou art, and \ninto dust thou shalt return''.\n  It is a recognition of the symbolism of what we physically are, and \nhow the physical body ends up.\n  This comes from the Web page of EWTN about Ash Wednesday: ``The \nliturgical use of ashes originated in the Old Testament times. Ashes \nsymbolized mourning, mortality, and penance. In the Book of Esther, \nMordecai put on sackcloth and ashes when he heard of the decree of the \nKing to kill all of the Jewish people in the Persian Empire. (Esther \n4:1). Job repented in sackcloth and ashes. (Job 42:6). Prophesying the \nBabylonian captivity of Jerusalem, Daniel wrote, ``I turned to the Lord \nGod, pleading in earnest prayer, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.'' \n(Daniel 9:3). Jesus made reference to ashes, ``If the miracles worked \nin you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would have reformed in \nsackcloth and ashes long ago.'' (Matthew 11:21).\n\n  In the Middle Ages, the priest would bless the dying person with holy \nwater, saying, ``Remember that thou art dust and to dust thou shalt \nreturn.'' The Church adapted the use of ashes to mark the beginning of \nthe penitential season of Lent, when we remember our mortality and \nmourn for our sins. In the present liturgy for Ash Wednesday, it \nremembers that as well.\n\n  I simply rise to remind us of what the symbolism is, if we go around \nthe hallways and see people with ashes on their foreheads. The \nsymbolism there is about the mortality of each of us, that from dust we \ncame and to dust we return. And it is a symbolism and a day of \nreflecting on our own sins and our own needs. I think maybe that is a \nuseful thing for us to do as a nation, to reflect on what we have done \nright, and what we have done wrong, and see what we can do better as we \nmove forward.\n  So this day of Ash Wednesday seems to be a good day for us to reflect \non our own mortality, our own sinfulness, and what we can do to be \nbetter both individually and as a nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last night President Bush spoke before a \njoint session of Congress and outlined his agenda in many areas--\ncertainly in education, in preserving and saving Social Security, and \nMedicare. He challenged Congress. He also made a very strong case for \nreducing our taxes. He said: We can pay down the debt, we can fund our \npriorities, pay down the debt to the maximum amount practical--in other \nwords, retire every bond that would mature between now and the year \n2010--pay down the debt as much as possible, and we can still give \nsignificant tax relief.\n  Some people said that is not enough. Some people said it is too much. \nThe President said it is about right. I happen to agree with him.\n  To my colleagues on the Democrat side who responded and said: We \nwould agree to a $900 billion tax cut but we can't go for the $1.6 \ntrillion tax cut--when we talk figures, I think it is important we talk \npolicy and not just figures.\n  The policy--and the bulk and the essence of what President Bush is \npushing for--is reductions in marginal rates, reducing tax rates for \ntaxpayers. Some have said: Wait a minute. This is a greater dollar \nbenefit for higher income people. But the fact is the Presidents \nproposal cuts the rates more for lower income people than it does for \nthose people with a higher income level.\n  Unfortunately, some people, when taxes are discussed, want to play \nclass warfare. They want to rob Peter to pay Paul. They want to use the \nTax Code as a method of income redistribution. I do not think we should \ndo that.\n\n  If we are going to have a tax cut, I think we should cut taxes for \nthe people who pay the taxes. We have programs where we spend money for \nthe general population, most of that focused on lower income \npopulations. But if you are going to have a tax cut, you should cut \ntaxes for taxpayers. President Bush's proposal does just that.\n  He has greater percentage tax reductions for those on the lower \nincome scale than he does for those on the higher income scale. Let me \njust talk about that a little bit.\n  He takes the 15-percent bracket and moves it to 10 percent for many \nindividuals. That is a 33-percent rate reduction. He reduces other \nrates. He moves the 28-percent rate to 25 percent. That is 3 percentage \npoints, but that is about a 10- or 11-percent rate reduction. Yes, he \nmoves the maximum rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, and that is an \n11-percent rate reduction.\n  Some have said that is too much for the upper income. I point out \nthat that rate, even if we enacted all of President Bush's income tax \nrate reduction, is still much higher than it was when President Clinton \nwas elected because he raised the maximum rates substantially.\n  Let me just give a little historical background on what has happened \nto the maximum rate since I have been in the Senate.\n  When I was elected to the Senate in 1980, the maximum personal income \ntax rate was 70 percent. Ronald Reagan and 8 years later, it was 28 \npercent--a\n\n[[Page S1674]]\n\nvery significant reduction. Some people said that caused enormous \ndeficits. That was not because the rates were cut because, frankly, \nrevenues to the Federal Government doubled in that period of time. So \nrevenues increased dramatically, though we reduced income tax rates \nfrom 70 percent to 28 percent.\n  President Bush, in 1990, agreed with the Democratic-controlled \nCongress--reluctantly, I believe--but raised the maximum rate from 28 \npercent to 31 percent, raised it 3 points, about 11 percent.\n  President Clinton, in 1993, raised the maximum rate from 31 percent \nto 39.6 percent--its current maximum rate--but he also did a couple of \nother things that a lot of people tend to forget about. He said: There \nwill be no cap on the amount of Medicare tax that you pay on your \nincome.\n  At one time, Medicare was taxed on the same basis as Social \nSecurity--about $75,000. Now there is no cap. So you pay 2.9 percent. \nActually, the employee pays 1.45 percent and the employer matches that. \nIt totals 2.9 percent on all income. If you have a salary like Tiger \nWoods or Michael Jordan, you pay a lot of Medicare tax--2.9 percent. So \nyou can actually add that 2.9 percent to the maximum tax rate, the 39.6 \npercent. So that increases to a total of about 42.3 percent.\n\n  Then President Clinton did something else. He phased out the \ndeductions and exemptions for people who have incomes above $100,000. \nWe can add another 1 or 2 percentage points on as a result. So \nPresident Clinton, in the tax act that passed in 1993 by one vote in \nboth the House and Senate--Vice President Gore broke the tie in the \nSenate--raised the maximum rate from 31 percent to about 44 percent.\n  President Bush today is saying, let's reduce the income tax rate down \nto 33 percent. He didn't take off the increase in the Medicare tax and \ndidn't change the deduction limitation, so actually the net max tax, \nunder the Bush proposal, is about 37.5 percent. Keep in mind, it was 31 \npercent when Bill Clinton was elected. So after all these reductions \nthat President Bush is talking about, the maximum rate is still about \n20 percent higher than it was when President Clinton was elected.\n  Yes, he has a tax reduction, but he is reducing taxes less than \nPresident Clinton increased them. That is the point. Certainly, for \nupper incomes that is the case. Let me repeat that. President Bush has \na tax cut. Some people say it is too much, his tax cut for upper income \npeople. I have heard so much demagoguery and class warfare concerning \npeople who make higher incomes. Their tax rates are much higher today. \nAssuming we pass all of President Bush's tax cut on income taxes, it is \nmuch higher than it was when President Clinton was elected, about 20 \npercent higher.\n  You might remember President Clinton, when he had a moment of \ntruthfulness in Texas, admitted that. He said: You might think I raised \ntaxes too much. I agree with you. I did raise taxes too much.\n  President Bush is saying we need some tax relief. We have enormous \nsurpluses, and we have to decide who is going to spend the surpluses. \nAre we going to come up with new ways within the Government to spend \nthem? We can. There are unlimited demands on spending public money, \nsomebody else's money, unlimited. That is not too hard for people to \nfigure out. If you ask your kids: Could you spend more money? You bet. \nYou ask your friends: Could you spend more money? You bet. You ask your \nspouse: Could you spend more money? You bet. If we leave a lot of money \non the table here, can we find more ways in Government to spend it? You \nbet. There are unlimited demands on spending somebody else's money.\n  We have to do what is fair, what is right. How much is reasonable? We \nactually have taxation, as a percentage of GNP, at an all-time high. We \nare taking in a lot more right now than we need to fund the Government. \nIf we leave it on the table, we will find ways to gobble it up. That is \nwhat we have done in the last couple years.\n  Last year nondefense discretionary spending budget authority grew at \n14 percent, far in excess of the budget. We didn't abide by the budget \nlast year. Congress was spending money. We will do it again, Heaven \nhelp us.\n  I don't think we will because I believe we are going to have \ndiscipline in the budget process this year. Unlike what we have had for \nthe last 8 years, a President who pushed us to spend more--we now have \na President who says: Let's show discipline. Instead of having somebody \nin the White House who is going to be threatening to veto a bill unless \nwe spend more money, we have a person in the White House saying he is \ngoing to veto a bill if we don't show some fiscal discipline.\n  President Bush, instead of saying let's rescind money that is a 14-\npercent increase, he said, we will even build upon it. We will increase \nspending with inflation, spending increases of about 4 percent, which \nis in excess of inflation. He is being pretty generous. He enumerated a \nlot of ways where he can spend money. He said: We can do all those \nthings. We can pay down the maximum amount of debt allowable, and then \nwe should give some tax relief.\n\n  The core of his tax relief is rate reduction. Rate reductions are \nnecessary. I mentioned this because a lot of people aren't aware of how \nmuch the Government is taking from them. They should be. If they are in \nthe process of doing their income tax returns, as millions of Americans \nare this month and next, they will find out. There is a big difference \nbetween the gross amount they are paid and the net they receive. The \ndifference, in many cases, is what goes to the Federal Government. It \ngoes to the Federal Government in the form of income taxes, in the form \nof Social Security taxes and Medicare taxes. The net in many cases is \nmuch smaller.\n  We can get some relief. We should get some relief. We must get some \nrelief. The President's proposal of across-the-board rate reductions is \nthe only fair and the best way to do it.\n  Some have said we need ``targeted'' tax cuts. Targeted means we are \ngoing to define who benefits and who does not. If you spend your money \nthe way we think you should spend it, you will get a tax cut. If you \ndon't, you don't get one. So if you do Government-approved, designed, \nadopted, favored behavior, we will give you a tax cut. If you don't, \nyou are out of luck. In other words, that is another way of saying we \nthink we can spend your money better than you can. You spend it the way \nwe want you to and we will give you some relief. But if you don't, we \nare going to spend it.\n  I happen to disagree with that wholeheartedly. If we are going to \ngive a tax cut, let's not have members of the Finance Committee and the \nWays and Means Committee and Members on the floor of the House and \nSenate saying: We are going to design and direct where the money should \ngo. We should allow individuals to make those decisions. That is what \nPresident Bush calls for.\n  Let me touch on one other issue that has been demagogued \nunmercifully, and that is the issue of the death tax. Last year we \npassed a bill to eliminate the death tax. It was slightly different \nthan what President Bush has called for. The President's proposal \ndoesn't cost as much, according to the bean counters in Joint Tax. It \ncosts about $100 billion, $104 billion over 10 years, according to \ntheir estimates. Let me talk about that.\n  A lot of people have said this only goes to the wealthiest people. I \ndisagree. People who make that comment don't understand what makes \nAmerica run. They don't know there are millions of businesses out there \ntoday that are trying to build and grow, and yet they are suffocated \nwith this overall idea that if they pass on, if they die, the \nGovernment is going to come in and take half of their business. So they \ndon't grow their business, or else they come up with all kinds of \nschemes to avoid this tax. There is a tax, a Federal tax called a death \ntax, an inheritance tax, an estate tax where the Government comes and \nif you have a taxable estate above $3 million, the Federal Government \nwants 55 percent, over half.\n  How in the world can it be fair in this day and age for the Federal \nGovernment to come in and say they want half of anybody's property that \nthey worked their entire life on and their kids want to keep the \nbusiness going and they say you have to sell that business because we \nwant half? That is present law. That needs to be changed. It will be \nchanged, in my opinion.\n\n  President Clinton vetoed the bill last year. We put it on his desk. \nWe had\n\n[[Page S1675]]\n\noverwhelming bipartisan support in the House, and we had a lot of \nDemocrats who supported it in the Senate. We passed it. President \nClinton vetoed it. I regret that decision. We have a new President, one \nwho will sign it.\n  I used to manage a business. We thought about growing it--and we grew \nit a lot, and we could have done a lot more--but this idea of working \nreally hard with the idea of building it up and making it successful, \nmaybe making it worth more and then having the Government come in and \ntake over half of it was a suffocating proposition. Did we suffer? No. \nWho really suffered? Our employees who could have had a new business. \nMaybe the kids who would work for those employees would have had a \nbetter income. They might have had more educational opportunities. \nThere would have been growth and opportunity for more people. This tax \nhurts in so many ways that people just can't even calculate.\n  Let me touch on what the proposal that we passed last year would do. \nWe replaced the taxable event of death and said: The taxable event \nshould be when the property is sold. Present law is, when somebody \ndies, they pass the property on to the kids. There is a taxable event. \nIf you have a taxable estate above the deductible amount--right now \n$675,000--you are at a taxable rate of 37 percent. Anything above that, \nUncle Sam wants over a third. At $3 million, the rate is 55 percent. If \nyou have a taxable estate of $10 million, it is 60 percent. Between $10 \nmillion and $17 million, it is 60 percent. How could we have a rate at \n60 percent? Why is the Government entitled to take 60 percent of \nsomething somebody has worked their entire life for? I can't imagine. \nThat is on the law books today. One of the reasons is because people \nsaid: Let's just increase the exemption and leave the rates high. We \nmade that mistake. We will not make it again. I hope we don't make it \nagain.\n  I have heard some people say that as an alternative let's just \nincrease the exemption another million or two. We will exempt people \nand put more in the zero bracket. If you are still a taxpayer, bingo, \nyou are going to have to pay 55 percent. I disagree. I think that is \nwrong, unconscionable. Why would you take half of somebody's property \nbecause they happen to pass on? Our proposal--what we passed last \nyear--replaced the taxable event of somebody's death and made it a \ntaxable event when the property is sold. So the person who dies doesn't \nbenefit because they are going to Heaven--I hope they are--and they \ncan't take the money with them. But their kids, the beneficiaries, \nright now have to pay a tax.\n\n  Under present law, they may have to sell the farm, the ranch, the \nbusiness, or the property and assets--they may have to sell half of it \njust to pay the tax. What we are saying is there is no taxable event \nwhen somebody dies. The taxable event would be when they sell the \nproperty. If they inherit an ongoing business, a farm, or a ranch, or \nproperty, if they keep it, there is no taxable event. When they sell \nit, guess what? They have the assets to pay the tax, and the tax will \nbe for capital gains. But the tax rate will be 20 percent, not 55 \npercent or 60 percent. That is fair. It is income that hasn't been \ntaxed before because it is capital gains.\n  To me, that makes the system work. You tax the property once. You tax \na gain that hasn't been taxed before, unlike a death tax. You might pay \nincome on these properties you are building up in a business year after \nyear, and you have paid income tax on it and you put money into it, it \nappreciates, and right now you get a little stepped-up basis, but, \nbingo, you have to pay a big tax. Why? Because you die. Sorry, second \ngeneration; if you want to keep the company going, if you want to keep \nthe employees, you may have to pay a tax of 55 percent because this \nbusiness is worth $3 million. That may sound like a lot, but it is not. \nIn some places in Colorado, and others, it might be a development. You \nmay have to sell it just to pay the tax so that Uncle Sam can take \nhalf. I think that is wrong. Our proposal is that you don't have a \ntaxable event when somebody dies; it is when the property is sold--when \nit is sold. That would be on a voluntary sale, when whoever inherited \nit wanted to sell it, and they would pay a capital gains tax of 20 \npercent.\n  We leave the step-up basis alone, or at a lower level. They pay 20 \npercent on the gain of the property. If the property has been in the \nfamily for decades, you may have a significant capital gain. That is \nonly fair because that property hasn't been taxed. I think this system \nmakes sense. I think it would save so much.\n  I can't imagine the money that has been spent in this country trying \nto create schemes and, in some cases, scams, and other ways of trying \nto avoid this unfair tax. So now we would say you would not have to \nhave foundations, you would not have to come up with irrevocable trusts \nand different games and try to give property around to avoid this tax. \nYou can say, wait a minute, there will be a taxable event when they \nsell the property. They will then have the liquid resources to be able \nto pay the tax, and it will be 20 percent. People won't have to go \nthrough tax avoidance, and planners, and lawyers, and so on, who are \nworking this system trying to help people avoid this unfair tax.\n  I mention that, Mr. President, because I think a lot of people have \ntried to demagog the issue. They have tried to unfairly characterize \nPresident Bush's proposal to eliminate this tax. I think what we passed \nlast year was eminently fair. We had the votes last year, and I believe \nwe have the votes this year. I think we will pass it and do a good \nthing for the economy, the American people, for free enterprise, and \nfor families by eliminating this so-called unfair death tax. We will \nreplace it with a capital gains tax when the property is voluntarily \nsold.\n\n  I am excited about President Bush's economic package. I am excited \nabout his tax proposal. I think at long last taxpayers have a friend in \nthe White House. They haven't had one for the last 8 years. We now have \na friend who will give them long overdue relief. I am excited about \nthat, and I expect we will be successful in passing substantial tax \nrelief this year. I look forward to that happening, and I compliment \nPresident Bush on his package and his presentation. I tell taxpayers \nthat help is on the way, and hopefully we can make it the law of the \nland.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as most Members know, the Senate has been \nwaiting for the Judiciary Committee to complete action on the very \nimportant bankruptcy bill for some time now. There is a long history \nbehind it. As you recall, we passed the bankruptcy bill last year by a \nvery wide margin, 70-28. The bill was eventually vetoed, even though, \nwhen I talked to the President personally about it, I had the \nimpression that he had some hesitancy in vetoing it, but he did. And in \nview of the lateness of the hour, it was not overridden--an effort was \nnot made to override it.\n  So at the beginning of this session, it seemed to me this was a bill \nthat had been worked through the meat grinder very aggressively and \nthat we should move it very quickly. So my thought was we should file \nit and, under rule XIV, bring it directly to the floor of the Senate. I \ndid not make any effort to do that in a surprising way. There seemed to \nbe pretty broad agreement that that would be a reasonable way to \napproach it.\n  However, there was some feeling by the ranking member on the \nJudiciary Committee that the committee should have a chance to have a \nlook at the legislation. I discussed it with the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Hatch. While he would have preferred that \nit go straight to the floor, he thought that was a reasonable request \nand that that would make the Members feel it was being done in a fairer \nway. So be it; that would be fine.\n  All along, of course, I was talking to Senator Daschle, and we were \ntalking about the best way to proceed, never wanting to surprise him at \nall. So it went to the Judiciary Committee. At that point then, there \nwas an objection which delayed it for another week. And I thought the \nnext week we would get it out. For a variety of reasons, without \npointing fingers at anybody, it did not come out the week before the \nPresident's Day work period. Then I thought that this week we would get \nto it.\n  I think the committee needs to be congratulated because the committee \nworked yesterday, it worked again today, and it completed its work. I \ndo not know how many amendments actually were considered, but they \ndealt in some way with as many as 30 amendments and I guess voted on a \nwhole lot of them. They reported out the bill today, so we are ready to \ngo. I hope we can get to the substance of the bill and have a full and \nfree debate--amendments will be offered, considered, and voted on--and \nthen we will bring this legislation to conclusion.\n  This is a part of my extraordinary, good-faith effort, I say to the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota, to make sure we go by regular \norder--let the committees do their job, be considerate of other \nSenators' wishes, be considerate of the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, be considerate of the ranking Democrat on the committee, and \nconfer with my colleague, Senator Daschle, the leader of the Democrats \nhere in the Senate, to make sure he is aware of what I am thinking, and \nask for his help. And he has given it.\n\n  So I really bent over backward. It is part of this atmosphere we are \ntrying to create--bipartisanship, working together. As we look toward \nbringing education to the floor, and campaign finance reform to the \nfloor, and the budget resolution, I am doing everything I can to set a \ntone where everybody can make their case. Everybody will have that \nopportunity. But I must say, I am really getting frustrated. However, I \nam ever hopeful that my gentle nature and my plaintive plea will appeal \nto the Senators who might have some reservations about us moving to \nconsider this bill.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate begin \nconsideration of the bankruptcy bill, reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee today, at 10 a.m. on Thursday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield to the distinguished assistant minority \nleader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader, we know the \nstrong feelings the Senator from Minnesota has, and we respect that \nwholeheartedly.\n  I had one problem with the bill that dealt with something that was \noffered on the floor by Senator Schumer and me dealing with clinic \nviolence. It went to conference. They stripped it, even though it \npassed here by an extremely wide margin.\n  The Judiciary Committee put that in yesterday. It is in the bill that \nwill come before the Senate. I am very grateful to Senator Leahy, who \nworked so hard on this matter, and the entire Judiciary Committee for \nallowing it to be part of this bill.\n  I believe it is a much better bill with this provision in it. It was \nnot in the bill when it came to the floor out of conference. I voted \nagainst it. I am appreciative of what the Judiciary Committee has done \nin this regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will be glad to yield to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will follow our minority leader. I \nwanted to respond to what the majority leader said, but I will follow \nthe leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would prefer to follow the senior Senator from the \nState of Minnesota.\n\n[[Page S1677]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. To help with all this, why don't I yield the floor. I will \nstay to participate because I have a feeling the Senator from Minnesota \nis going to be persuaded by the generous nature of his leader and my \npersuasive abilities to let us get to the substance of the bill. I know \nwith this Senator from Minnesota, I have heard him time and time again \nsay: I have a right as a Senator to make my case and offer my \namendments. I believe he will remember on occasion I have supported his \nright to be able to do that. He will have his right. But to delay this \nbill another week, what does it accomplish? We could begin to make \nprogress, and we could have a vote on amendments.\n  I wish he would reconsider. This is on the motion to proceed. I think \nthe American people look at us and say: Excuse me? You are going to \nhave a cloture vote to cut off a filibuster on the motion to proceed to \nthe bill; then you are on the bill and you have to do it again?\n  I hope the Senator will relent. I yield the floor to see what the \nSenator has to say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I won't be long. I thank the majority \nleader for his graciousness, even though we are in disagreement. I \nappreciate not only what he said but the way he said it.\n  It is extremely important that to the maximum extent possible we work \ntogether. This bill is going to come to the floor of the Senate; there \nis no question about it. There are going to be votes. As a Senator from \nMinnesota, I will use this occasion. Perhaps we will have discussion \ntomorrow and can reach some agreement about how to move forward. Let me \nsay that to the majority leader.\n  This is an opportunity for me to say to other Senators and, more \nimportantly, to the people of Minnesota, this bill is harsh and one \nsided. I cannot believe that we make it so difficult for people who \nfind themselves in such difficult circumstances. Fifty percent of the \npeople of the country who declare bankruptcy do it because of a major \nmedical expense. Almost all the rest of the cases are because of \nsomeone losing a job or because of a divorce.\n\n  I will not speak long, but I want the majority leader to know how \nheartfelt my objection is. It is not just a question of procedure or \ninside baseball in the Senate. I don't want to miss an opportunity to \ntalk about how harsh and mistaken this piece of legislation is.\n  We just had 1,300 LTV workers laid off work in northeast Minnesota. \nThe way this bill reads, in terms of what they can file for chapter 7, \nthey are supposed to look at the average of their income over the last \n5 months. That doesn't help them. Many of them just lost their jobs. I \ndon't want them to go under. I want them to be able to rebuild their \nlives.\n  In my not so humble opinion, this is a classic example of a financial \nservices industry with enormous clout putting on a full court press. I \nam proud, working with other Senators, to have held them off and held \nthem off. This bill may pass. It doesn't ask these credit card \ncompanies to be accountable at all. It does not deal with some of the \nworst circumstances that affect families that are going to go under. It \nhas an onerous means test. It is extremely one sided.\n  The first piece of legislation we are going to pass in the Senate, as \nthe economy begins to go down and people are worried about losing their \njobs and are feeling the economic squeeze, is a piece of legislation \nthat is going to make it practically impossible for many families that \nare going under, through no fault of their own, to file for chapter 7 \nand rebuild their lives. What a start.\n  I come to the floor to object because I believe this is an egregious \npiece of legislation. The majority leader has been gracious to me. He \nknows I have the right, as does the minority leader, to object.\n  I say to the majority leader: This is tonight. Because he has been \ngracious, we can talk tomorrow and maybe we can figure out a way that \nwe can proceed. However, I am not going to give up my opportunity to \ntalk about how harsh this legislation is, and I am not going to give up \nmy opportunity, in every way I can, to point out the weaknesses. There \nwill be plenty of opportunity next week as well.\n  I hope when we do move forward--and this is something I want to \ndiscuss with the leader--there will be the opportunity for amendments, \nand we will have a full-scale debate; we will operate as a Senate, \nwhich is what the majority leader and minority leader want us to do. \nFor tonight, I have to object, and I object for those reasons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, once again, we hear the eloquent passion \nof a Senator who cares deeply about an issue. I applaud him for that \npassion and his compassion for those who are now out of work as a \nresult of layoffs in Minnesota. I understand how deeply felt his views \nare.\n  He has expressed, in his own eloquent way, that it is within his \nright to object tonight. Each Senator has enormous power to stop \nthings. Each Senator has enormous power to change the legislative \nprocess.\n  The majority leader, on several occasions, could have thwarted this \nprocess, avoided regular order, prevented Senators from the opportunity \nthat I believe we will have next week to offer amendments. He could \nhave done a number of things using his rights, first as a Senator and, \nsecondly, as a leader, to undermine what we have delicately constructed \nhere in this new bipartisan environment. He could have done that. \nSenator Lott chose not to do that.\n\n  The majority leader said, in keeping with the spirit we are trying to \nmaintain, as much as I wanted to go to this bill 3 weeks ago, last \nweek, the week before, as many times as we have talked about this, \nevery time I have asked him, he has said: Look, I am going to try to \nmaintain the kind of spirit that we have been able to create so far \nwhere we can have a win-win; Senators who are passionately opposed to \nthis bill ought to have the right to express themselves, ought to have \nthe right to offer amendments, ought to have the right to have a good \ndebate; Senators who want to move this process along ought to be able \nto use the tools available to them to do that as well.\n  What we are trying to do is to strike a delicate balance because \nthere is passion on both sides. There is a depth of feeling on both \nsides. I, frankly, have been on both sides because I am so ambivalent \nabout the importance of the arguments raised by the Senator from \nMinnesota as well as the concern that I have for the abuse we find in \nthe system.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator from Minnesota expressing himself \nand at least giving us the possibility that we could revisit this issue \ntomorrow, and I recognize, once again, that if every Senator exercised \nall of their rights, we probably wouldn't get much done in this body.\n  But because everybody uses common sense, attempts to strike a balance \nbetween exercising those rights and moving along the legislative \nprocess, generally, we have worked out things in a way that has \naccommodated the needs of most people. It is in keeping with that \nspirit that I hope we can talk to the issue again tomorrow. I thank the \nSenator from Minnesota, and I thank the majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom South Dakota. He has been working with me in good faith. We \ncommunicate regularly. We have to keep trying to do that. That is why I \nsense that he feels the same frustration that I do, that we both try to \nbend over backward to accommodate everybody, and it is still very \ntough. We are facing further delays.\n  I am encouraged. The Senator from Minnesota has indicated we can talk \ntomorrow, and we will look for a way to move this legislation forward \nin a way that is acceptable hopefully to him and everybody else. I will \nlook for him tomorrow.\n  There are two points I want to make. The first bill we pass in the \nSenate this year is not going to be the bankruptcy bill. I think the \nfirst one we passed was pipeline safety. It is good legislation, \nbroadly supported. We passed one other bill that week. I think pipeline \nsafety was the first one.\n  The other thing is that I understand how the Senator feels, and you \nhave to have some emotions and compassion for people who get into \ndifficult straits. There needs to be a way for them to\n\n[[Page S1678]]\n\ncome out of them and get a job or have a job and get back into \nbusiness. Also, this is personal with me, too. My mother and father \ntried to be small business owners. My dad was a pipefitter in the \nshipyard. It was hot, tough work. He decided they could get into the \nfurniture business at one point. He would go pick up the furniture in \nhis pickup truck and bring it back to the store. It was Market Street \nFurniture Company. I will never forget it. He would do the selling and \ndelivering, and they sold a lot of items on credit. My mother was the \nbookkeeper in the back of the store. One of the reasons why they could \nnot make it was that many of those people to whom they sold the \nfurniture on credit just would not pay their bills.\n\n  So there is another side. There are small business men and women who \nwind up holding the bag, and when you are a small business man or \nwoman, that profit margin is pretty tiny. It is 5 percent, 10 percent \nmaybe. But I remember it was very small in that furniture store.\n  There were other factors involved, but eventually it ran them out of \nbusiness. My dad went back to the shipyard, and he got to work in the \npipe department. But that is the other side of the coin.\n  What about the small business men and women who are out there trying \nto create jobs to help their family and people say, ``We don't want to \npay\"? A lot of them hide behind bankruptcy.\n  I have supported bankruptcy laws and reform of bankruptcy laws. I \nsupported the bankruptcy judges system. But we have made it too easy \nnow for people to use bankruptcy as an excuse to hide and get out of \npaying what they owe. There is broad, bipartisan support on this. I \nthink we ought to get it done as soon as we can. I will work with the \nSenator to make sure he believes his voice was heard. I know how he \nfeels about it personally. I do, too. There is another side of that \ncoin. It is kind of a family thing with me. We will find a way to get \nit done.\n  I thank Senator Daschle and Senator Reid for staying on the floor and \nworking through this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I don't want to debate the majority \nleader tonight. I want him to know that one of the good things about \nthe very important debate we are going to have is that I will be able--\nthe Presiding Officer is involved in this debate as well--to cite \nindependent study after independent study showing that the abuse, when \nit comes to bankruptcy, is a very small percentage. I think the \nmajority leader will be pleased to hear that given the comment he made. \nWe will have the debate. I thank the majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/28/senate-section/article/S1678-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the celebration \nof Black History month. It began in the 1920's when Dr. Carter G. \nWoodson, a historian and educator, proposed the idea of creating \n``Negro History Week'' during the second week of February to \ncommemorate the history and achievements of the black community. He \nchose this week to honor the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick \nDouglass, both of whom had a great impact on the lives of African \nAmericans across the country. Since 1976, we have dedicated the entire \nmonth of February to celebrating the contributions of African Americans \nthroughout our Nation's history.\n  Today, African Americans represent about 13 percent of our total \npopulation, and they greatly contribute to the increasingly dynamic \ncultural tapestry of America. Over the years, they have actively shaped \nthe future of our country in the roles of teachers, parents, judges, \ndoctors, lawyers, religious leaders, and factory workers.\n  Although the African American population of my home State is smaller \nthan most, the cultural heritage of South Dakota has been enriched by \nour African American community.\n  I am proud to tell you about Oscar Micheaux, the first African \nAmerican to produce a feature-length film, as well as the first African \nAmerican to break the ``sound barrier'' with a ``talkie'' motion \npicture, the earliest form of film with sound. Born to freed slaves in \n1884, Micheaux grew up in Illinois as one of 11 children, before he \nmoved to South Dakota to become a farmer. It was on the South Dakota \nprairie that he began to write, publish, and sell his first novels.\n  At a time when blacks were not welcome in the film industry, Micheaux \nstarted his own company, where he wrote, directed, and produced at \nleast 43 movies during the course of his life. He dealt with such \ncontroversial subjects as white-on-black crime, intra-racial \ndiscrimination, and lynching. In 1919, he released ``The Homesteader,'' \na movie based on his autobiographical book that describes his \nexperiences on the South Dakota plains. This became the first feature \nlength film produced by an African American.\n  Because Hollywood discriminated against blacks, Micheaux was forced \nto do all of the work for his films independently. He was responsible \nfor not only producing, but distributing his films which were only \nviewed in segregated black theaters. Some of his films that addressed \nissues like real estate discrimination and inter-racial relationships \nwere censored and confiscated for being too ``controversial.'' Despite \nfacing discrimination, Micheaux paved the way for blacks in the film \nindustry.\n  Micheaux is revered by such entertainment industry figures as Spike \nLee, Robert Townsend, Tim Reid, and Carl Franklin. South Dakota holds \nan annual film festival in Micheaux's honor. A true pioneer in every \nsense, he is a hero to all Americans who have a dream.\n  I salute this accomplished, self-made man. His achievements serve as \na wonderful example of how barriers can be overcome and how dreams can \nbe attained. Micheaux and other figures in the African American \ncommunity remind us of the difference an individual can make to the \nNation, and that dreams can still be attained, even in the face of \nadversity. Micheaux's life encompasses Dr. King's vision when he said \nthat he had a dream that ``. . . children will one day live in a Nation \nwhere they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the \ncontent of their character.''\n  We are still working today to realize this dream. Black History Month \nnot only celebrates the individual achievements of the African American \ncommunity, but reminds us all that we need to come together as a \ngreater community to ensure that everyone has equal rights, freedoms, \nand the resources to achieve their dreams.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition, honor and \ncelebration of Black History Month. This year's theme is ``Creating and \nDefining the African-American Community: Family, Church, Politics and \nCulture.'' We should use the forum this month to educate all Americans \nthat African-American history is American history. African-Americans \nhave played a key role in shaping America by their known and untold \ncontributions to science, art, education, politics, commerce and \nculture.\n  Dr. Carter G. Woodson is the founder of Black History Week which has \nexpanded to Black History Month. Dr. Woodson, the son of slaves, \nrealized that the rich and detailed history of African-Americans was in \ndanger of fading to obscurity, so he became an impassioned teacher and \nadvocate of African-American history, and created some of the first \ncourses and textbooks devoted to this topic. He also founded what is \nnow known as the Association for the Study of African-American Life and \nHistory. A firm believer in the importance of education, he studied at \nHarvard, the Sorbonne in Paris and the University of Chicago. Dr. \nWoodson was also Dean at Howard University in Washington DC.\n  Black History Month gives Americans an opportunity not only to learn \nof great African-American leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., but \nalso to learn of lesser known African-Americans who have played key \nroles in molding our great country. For instance, most Americans do not \nknow that Jean Baptist Pointe DuSable\n\n[[Page S1679]]\n\nfounded the city of Chicago. Mr. DuSable was born in 1745 in Haiti to a \nwhite French sea captain and a black former slave. After his mother's \ndeath, Mr. DuSable went to France with his father to be educated and at \nthe age of 20 sailed to America. Eventually, Mr. DuSable settled in \nwhat would become the great State of Illinois and became a fur trader. \nIn 1779, Mr. DuSable built a trading post in a location that the \nIndians called Eschikcago or ``place of smelly waters.'' The trading \npost eventually developed into the settlement now know as Chicago.\n  Similarly, Lewis Howard Latimer made great contributions to society. \nMr. Latimer perfected Thomas Edison's invention of the electric light \nbulb by creating the carbon filament light bulb. Mr. Latimer was the \nsole African-American member of Edison's team of inventors. His 1881 \ncreation of the carbon filament light bulb alleviated the electric \nlight bulb's design flaws of a short life span and a tendency to \nshatter when becoming too hot.\n  In addition, African-Americans like Daniel Hale Williams have \naccomplished astounding breakthroughs in the medical field. One night a \ndeliveryman, who had been stabbed in the heart, was rushed into the \nemergency room at Chicago's Provident Hospital. Dr. Williams decided to \nopen the man's chest and operate. He successfully repaired the torn \ntissue in the man's heart and completed the operation. Dr. Williams \nmade history that night as the first doctor to perform open-heart \nsurgery. His patient went on to live for another 20 years.\n  Dr. Charles Richard Drew also made contributions that revolutionized \nthe medical field. Dr. Drew was a world-renowned surgeon, medical \nassistant and educator. He transformed the practice of medicine by \ncreating a way to preserve blood. Dr. Drew also created the first blood \nbank and developed a way to efficiently store blood plasma.\n  While most American know of the courageous story of Rosa Parks, not \nas many are aware of the bravery of her predecessor, Ida B. Wells-\nBarnett. Ms. Wells-Barnett was a school teacher who refused to give up \nher seat on a Memphis-bound train. After being physically forced out of \nher seat, Ms. Wells-Barnett brought a suit against the railroad for \ntheir actions, and won. Later, however, the State court overruled the \ndecision of the circuit court. Ida Wells went on to become an \ninfluential journalist. She moved to Chicago at the turn of the century \nand worked tirelessly to fight against the horrible scourge of \nlynching, and to fight for fair treatment of African-Americans. The \nChicago Housing Authority named one of its first housing developments \nthe Ida B. Wells Homes, and in 1990, the U.S. Postal Service honored \nher life's work by issuing the Ida B. Wells stamp.\n  I am pleased to be able to speak today about the accomplishments of \nthese great Americans. Black History Month can help us look back and \nrecognize the great obstacles African- Americans have overcome. It can \nalso help us look ahead and recognize the great obstacles that still \nhinder African-Americans today.\n  The disenfranchisement of thousands of African-American citizens in \nFlorida this past election year clearly illustrates this point. Instead \nof being proud that they participated in the democratic process, many \nAfrican-Americans were outraged because their voices were silenced. \nTheir votes did not count. A disproportionate number of the invalidated \nvotes cast for President in South Florida were from African-American \nand Caribbean communities. In all, an astounding one third, 22,807, of \nthe rejected ballots were cast in predominantly black areas.\n  Many African-Americans rightfully believe their disenfranchisement \nresulted from the use of antiquated voting equipment. Analysis of the \nFlorida election plainly shows that Americans who voted in areas that \nutilized punch card ballots had a much greater chance that their vote \nwould be invalidated than those who voted in areas that utilized more \nmodern equipment. In this great democracy, it is unacceptable that \nthousands of legally qualified voters were disenfranchised because of \nobsolete voting machinery.\n  Unfortunately, this problem was not limited to Florida. In Fulton \nCounty, GA, a community with a large African-American population, \npunch-card voting equipment was used which resulted in one out of every \n16 votes cast for President being invalidated. However, Fulton's \nneighbors, two largely white counties, utilized more modern equipment \nwhich resulted in only one in every 200 votes cast for President being \ninvalidated.\n  Even my home State of Illinois was plagued with problems stemming \nfrom outdated voting equipment, especially in largely African-American \ncommunities. For instance, in Chicago, one out of every six votes cast \nfor President was invalidated while almost none of the votes in some of \nthe city's outer suburbs were rejected. This indefensible disparity is \none of the reasons that I am proud to cosponsor the Federal Election \nModernization Act of 2001. This Act will supply funding to States to \nhelp replace obsolete voting equipment. I personally believe the price \nto equip every voting precinct in the country with user-friendly and \nreliable mechanism to cast and count ballots is well worth it. The \nmillions of dollars in estimated costs to ensure accuracy pale when \ncompared to the value of protecting each individual's right to vote and \nthe price paid by those who fought and gave their lives to secure this \nright.\n  As Americans, we must realize that even though discrimination is \nlegally eradicated from American society, vestiges of the decades of \ndiscrimination still remain today. We need only look at the voting \ndifficulties that plagued African-Americans in the 2000 election to \ndemonstrate this point. If America is ever to achieve its full \npotential, we must acknowledge, address and eliminate the obstacles \nthat African-Americans face not only during Black History Month, but \nevery day.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, every February, our Nation pauses to \nrecognize the tremendous contributions of African-Americans to the \nhistory of our Nation. In 1926, Dr. Carter G. Woodson established Negro \nHistory Week because he saw that most of the contributions African-\nAmericans had made to American culture and industry were being ignored \nby historians.\n  We have come a long way since 1926. More and more of our history \nbooks acknowledge the contributions of African-Americans. Our schools \nhave made it part of their curriculum, libraries and museums create \nexhibits, and our celebration of African-American history has been \nexpanded to an entire month.\n  But we still have a long way to go.\n  We need African-American History Month because many people don't know \nabout African-American heroes like Crispus Attucks, who led the Boston \nuprising in 1770 and became the first casualty of the American \nRevolution. Equally forgotten are African-American inventors like \nGarrett Morgan, who developed the traffic light and gas mask.\n  These Americans have added to the richness and greatness of our \ncountry. It is appropriate that as we stand in our Nation's Capitol, a \nstructure which was built by the back-breaking labor of both free and \nslave African-Americans, we talk about the contributions African-\nAmericans have made to this country's history and to its future.\n  I want to take a moment to focus on the contributions of Missourians.\n  Any Missourian can name George Washington Carver's most famous \ninvention, peanut butter, but few realize the role Carver played in the \nagricultural revolution that occurred in the South in the early 1900's. \nCarver's work to wean the South from its single-crop cultivation of \ncotton and his development of commercial uses for alternate crops like \npeanuts and sweet potatoes helped modernize Southern agriculture, \npaving the way for a better life for the entire South.\n  Scott Joplin led a revolution of a different kind. While living in \nSedalia, MO he created a blend of classical and folk music that took \nAmerica by storm. Ragtime, as his style came to be called, has become \nAmerica's unique contribution to classical music and is a driving force \nbehind jazz and blues.\n  In literature, Missourians are proud of the heritage of Langston \nHughes of Joplin, Missouri. One of the major American writers of the \n20th century, Hughes was a poet, novelist, editor, playwright, and \njournalist.\n\n[[Page S1680]]\n\n  Another African-American Missourian became famous not only as an \ninventor but also as the most outstanding jockey of his time. Tom Bass, \nof Mexico, MO trained some of the finest race and show horses of his \nday. At the peak of his career he rode in the Inauguration of President \nGrover Cleveland and gave a command performance before Queen Victoria. \nIn addition to being a famous jockey, he invented the ``Bass bit'' \nwhich is still used today.\n  Missouri has borne some notable civil rights leaders as well. Perhaps \nthe most prominent of them is Roy Wilkins. Wilkins served as executive \ndirector of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored \nPeople from 1955-1977. Appointed during the most turbulent era in the \ncivil rights movement, Wilkins kept the NAACP on the path of \nnonviolence and rejected racism in all forms. His leadership and \ndevotion to the principle of nonviolence earned him the reputation of a \nsenior statesman in the Civil Rights Movement.\n  All of these great Missourians, and others too numerous to mention, \nstruggled against bigotry and violence, but each showed, through their \nnatural talents, that racism was not just wrong, but un-American. So it \nis fitting that we take this month to learn more about the history of \nAfrican-Americans in this country, and recognize the contributions of \nAfrican-Americans to our great Nation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, February is Black History Month. For the \nlast several years I have worked with other Senators and the \nAdministration to help make history by breaking down the remaining \nvestiges of barriers to African-Americans and other minorities and \nwomen on the Federal courts around the country. We have had a number of \nsuccesses in that regard over the last few years. I recall, in \nparticular, the confirmations of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second \nCircuit, Judge Julio Fuentes to the Third Circuit, Judge Eric Clay to \nthe Sixth Circuit, Judge Ann Williams to the Seventh Circuit, Judges \nRichard Paez, Marsha Berzon, Johnnie Rawlinson, Kim Wardlaw and \nMargaret McKeown to the Ninth Circuit, Judge Charles Wilson to the \nEleventh Circuit and a number of others.\n  Many took too long. Many were delayed by anonymous holds. Many other \noutstanding nominees were never accorded a hearing, a Committee vote or \na vote by the United States Senate. One of my greatest regrets during \nmy service in the Senate was the Republican caucus vote against Judge \nRonnie White in 1999. I was glad to be able to provide him with the \nopportunity to testify and correct the record and clear his reputation \nand good name in the course of confirmation hearings on the Attorney \nGeneral nomination in January.\n  As important as it is to remember our history, it is also important \nto make progress and add to that history. We continue to have the \nopportunity to do that here in the United States Senate. On January 3, \n2001, President Clinton renominated Roger Gregory to serve on the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Even though the \nFourth Circuit, covering Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, \nVirginia, and West Virginia, contains the largest African-American \npopulation of any circuit in this country, it had never had an African-\nAmerican appellate judge.\n  Last December, during an extended congressional recess, the President \nexercised his constitutional power to make recess appointments and \nappointed Roger Gregory to the Fourth Circuit.\n  In early January, when the Senate convened to begin this new season, \nthe President resubmitted Judge Gregory's nomination to us.\n  In the ensuing weeks, the new President has seen fit to leave that \nnomination before the Senate for our consideration and action. Both \nSenator Warner and Senator Allen support this nomination. Last year \nSenator Robb also strongly supported it.\n  Senator Warner, Senator Allen, Senator Robb and Senator Edwards and \nothers have all spoken in the last several months in support of the \nconfirmation of Roger Gregory. Now it is time for the Senate to step up \nto the challenge and act on Judge Gregory's nomination to a full, \nlifetime appointment to that important judicial position.\n  Mr. Gregory was not the first African-American nominated to the \nFourth Circuit. President Clinton nominated four qualified African-\nAmericans to the Fourth Circuit: Judge James Beatty, of North Carolina \nwas nominated in December 1995, and re-nominated in January 1997; Judge \nJames Wynn, of North Carolina, was nominated in August 1999; Roger \nGregory was nominated in June 2000; and Judge Andre Davis was nominated \nin October 2000. None of these exceptional candidates ever received a \nJudiciary Committee hearing, let alone a vote on the Senate floor.\n  Senator Allen, in one of his first speeches on the Senate floor, came \nhere to talk about Roger Gregory's qualifications, and the importance \nof acting in a bipartisan way to confirm him. Here is what Senator \nAllen said:\n\n       [I]t is my belief that in Roger Gregory, the Fourth \n     Circuit--and, indeed, America--has a well-respected and \n     honorable jurist who will administer justice with integrity \n     and dignity. He will, in my judgment, decide cases based upon \n     and in adherence to duly adopted laws and the Constitution. I \n     respectfully urge my colleagues and the administration to \n     join me in supporting Judge Gregory.\n\n  Senator John Warner joined the discussion, rising to say that he \nagreed with what Senator Allen had said on the need to confirm Roger \nGregory. As reflected in letters that Senator Warner shared with the \nSenate, he and Senator Allen have written to Senator Hatch and to \nPresident Bush urging that Judge Gregory receive a hearing and be \nconfirmed. I commend them for their commitment to this nomination.\n  Roger Gregory was an outstanding lawyer, and he will be an \nexceptionally good judge on the Fourth Circuit. From Richmond, \nVirginia, Judge Gregory was the first in his family to finish high \nschool. After college and law school, he returned to be a professor at \na school where his mother had worked as a maid. He entered private \npractice, and later founded his own, highly-respected law firm in \nRichmond, where he handled a wide variety of complex litigation matters \nin State and Federal court for individual and corporate clients. Roger \nGregory built a reputation as a seasoned litigator and widely respected \nmember of his community.\n  Judge Gregory's recess appointment as the first African-American \njudge on the Fourth Circuit also places him firmly in a tradition of \nusing such appointments to bring diversity to the federal bench. Four \nof the five first African-American appellate judges were recess \nappointed to their first positions as Federal judges. That includes the \nappointment of William Henry Hastie as the first African-American on \nthe Federal bench by President Harry Truman in 1949. Not long after \nthat appointment, a little over 51 years ago, the Senate confirmed \nJudge Hastie, showing itself to be, as I have said many times, the \nconscience of the Nation.\n  The roster of trailblazing African-American recess-appointees also \nincludes President John Kennedy's 1961 appointment of Thurgood Marshall \nto the Second Circuit Court of Appeals; Spottswood Robinson to the D.C. \nCircuit; and President Lyndon Johnson's 1964 appointment of Leon \nHigginbotham to the Third Circuit. Other well-known and well-respected \njudges to be appointed during a recess are: Judge David Bazelon to the \nD.C. Circuit; Judge Augustus N. Hand to the Second Circuit; Judge \nGriffin Bell of the Fifth Circuit; and Supreme Court Justices William \nBrennan and Earl Warren.\n  Today, during the month of February, Black History Month, I come to \nthe Senate floor to call on my colleagues to once again shine as the \nconscience of the nation, and move quickly toward making Roger \nGregory's lifetime appointment to the Fourth Circuit. He is eminently \nqualified to sit on the court, he has received praise for his integrity \nand legal talent, and he has been strongly endorsed by both of his home \nstate Senators.\n  Roger Gregory should be given a hearing before the Judiciary \nCommittee without further delay. In deference to the position that \nPresident Bush took during the campaign, the Senate should act on this \nnomination in the next couple of weeks. The excuse from last year, that \nhis nomination in June came too late in the year for Senate action, is \ninapplicable now. Let his be the first judicial nomination to\n\n[[Page S1681]]\n\ncome before the Committee and the Senate this year. His papers have \nlong since been submitted to the Committee--we have had them in hand \nfor eight months now. There can be no reason not to commit today, \nduring this month when we honor the achievements and contributions of \nAfrican-Americans, to move Roger Gregory swiftly to a hearing, through \nthe Committee and then on to the Senate floor for a full Senate vote.\n  After all of the delays meted out to the previous African-American \nnominees to the Fourth Circuit, the Senate has another chance to make \nhistory. As history has been made in so many other occasions for \nAfrican-American judges, let us not squander this opportunity to make \nRoger Gregory the first African-American to be confirmed by the United \nStates Senate to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to commemorate African \nAmerican History Month. Each year, doing the month of February, we \nremember and reflect on the rich and extraordinary achievements of \nAfrican Americans. We also remember and reflect on the suffering, \ndegradation and brutality of slavery, which cannot be repaired, but the \nmemory can serve to ensure that no such inhumanity is ever perpetrated \nagain on American soil.\n  We remember and celebrate the brave and determined African American \nconductors of the Underground Railroad, like Harriet Tubman. In 1849, \nTubman escaped from the Eastern Shore of Maryland and became known as \n``Moses'' to her people when she made 19 trips to the South and helped \ndeliver at least 300 fellow captives to liberation. We remember and \ncelebrate John Parker of Ripley, Ohio who frequently ventured to \nKentucky and Virginia to help transport by boat hundreds of runaway \nslaves across the Ohio River; and William Still, Robert Purvis and \nDavid Ruggles who in the 1830s organized and stationed vigilance \ncommittees throughout the North to help guide slaves to freedom \ndestinations. And we remember and celebrate James Fairfield, who went \ninto the deep South and rescued enslaved African Americans by posing as \na slave trader, risking his life and property. We remember and \ncelebrate the City of Detroit in my home state of Michigan where the \nUnderground Railroad assisted over 40,000 slaves in reaching freedom in \nCanada.\n  Let us not forget, that we celebrate African American History Month \nbecause in 1926, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, son of former slaves, proposed \nsuch a recognition as a way of preserving the history of the Negro and \nrecognizing the enormous contributions of a people of great strength, \ndignity, faith and conviction, a people who rendered their achievements \nfor the betterment and advancement of a Nation once lacking in humanity \ntowards them. Throughout the Nation, we celebrate the many important \ncontributions African Americans have made in all facets of American \nlife.\n  Lerone Bennett, editor, writer and lecturer recently reflected on the \nlife and times of Dr. Woodson. In an article he wrote for Johnson's \nPublications, Bennett tells us that one of the most inspiring and \ninstructive stories in African American history is the story of \nWoodson's struggle and rise from the coal mines of West Virginia to the \nsummit of academic achievement:\n\n       At 17, the young man who was called by history to reveal \n     Black history was an untutored coal miner. At 19, after \n     teaching himself the fundamentals of English and arithmetic, \n     he entered high school and mastered the four-year curriculum \n     in less than two years. At 22, after two-thirds of a year at \n     Berea College, in Kentucky, he returned to the coal mines and \n     studied Latin and Greek between trips to the mine shafts. He \n     then went on to the University of Chicago, where he received \n     bachelor's and master's degrees, and Harvard University, \n     where he became the second Black to receive a doctorate in \n     history. The rest is history--Black history.\n\n  In keeping with the spirit and the vision of Dr. Carter G. Woodson, I \nwould like to pay tribute to two courageous women, claimed by my home \nstate of Michigan, who played significant roles in addressing American \ninjustice and inequality. These are two women of different times who \nwould change the course of history.\n  Sojourner Truth, who helped lead our country out of the dark days of \nslavery, and Rosa Parks, whose dignified leadership sparked the \nMontgomery Bus Boycott and the start of the Civil Rights movement are \nindelibly etched in the chronicle of not only the history of this \nNation, but are viewed with distinction and admiration throughout the \nworld.\n\n  Sojourner Truth, though unable to read or write, was considered one \nof the most eloquent and noted spokespersons of her day on the \ninhumanity and immorality of slavery. She was a leader in the \nabolitionist movement, and a ground breaking speaker on behalf of \nequality for women. Michigan recently honored her with the dedication \nof the Sojourner Truth Memorial Monument, which was unveiled in Battle \nCreek, Michigan on September 25, 1999. I commend Dr. Velma Laws-Clay \nwho headed the Monument Steering Committee and Sculptor Tina Allen for \nmaking their dream, a true monument to Sojourner Truth, a reality.\n  Sojourner Truth had an extraordinary life. She was born Isabella \nBaumfree in 1797, served as a slave under several different masters, \nand was eventually freed in 1828 when New York state outlawed slavery. \nTruth continued to live in New York and became strongly involved in \nreligion. In 1843, in an act of religious faith, she changed her name \nto Sojourner Truth and dedicated her life to traveling and lecturing. \nShe began her migration West in 1850, where she shared the stage with \nother abolitionist leaders such as Frederick Douglass.\n  In 1851, Sojourner Truth delivered her famous ``Ain't I a Woman?'' \nspeech at the Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio. In the speech, Truth \nattacked both racism and sexism. Truth made her case for equality in \nplain-spoken English when she said, ``Then that little man in black \nthere, he says women can't have as much rights as men, cause Christ \nwasn't a woman? Where did your Christ come from? Where did your Christ \ncome from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him.''\n  By the mid-1850s, Truth had settled in Battle Creek, MI. She \ncontinued to travel and speak out for equality. During the Civil War, \nTruth traveled throughout Michigan, gathering food and clothing for \nNegro volunteer regiments. Truth's travels during the war eventually \nled her to a meeting with President Abraham Lincoln in 1864, at which \nshe presented her ideas on assisting freed slaves. Truth remained in \nWashington, D.C. for several years, helping slaves who had fled from \nthe South and appearing at women's suffrage gatherings. Due to bad \nhealth, Sojourner Truth returned to Battle Creek in 1875, and remained \nthere until her death in 1883. Sojourner Truth spoke from her heart \nabout the most troubling issues of her time. A testament to Truth's \nconvictions is that her words continue to speak to us today.\n  On May 4, 1999 legislation was enacted which authorized the President \nof the United States to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa \nParks. The Congressional Gold Medal was presented to Rosa Parks on June \n15, 1999 during an elaborate ceremony in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. I \nwas pleased to cosponsor this fitting tribute to Rosa Parks, the gentle \nwarrior who decided that she would no longer tolerate the humiliation \nand demoralization of racial segregation on a bus. Her personal bravery \nand self-sacrifice are remembered with reverence and respect by us all.\n  Forty five years ago in Montgomery, AL the modern civil rights \nmovement began when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat and move to \nthe back of the bus. The strength and spirit of this courageous woman \ncaptured the consciousness of not only the American people but the \nentire world.\n  My home state of Michigan proudly claims Rosa Parks as one of our \nown. Prompted by unceasing threats on their lives and persistent \nharassment, Rosa Parks' and her husband moved to Detroit in 1957 where \nParks' brother resided.\n  Rosa Parks' arrest in Alabama for violating the city's segregation \nlaws was the catalyst for the Montgomery bus boycott. Her stand on that \nDecember day in 1955 was not an isolated incident but part of a \nlifetime of struggle for equality and justice. For instance, twelve \nyears earlier, in 1943, Rosa Parks had been arrested for violating \nanother one of the city's bus related segregation laws, which required \nAfrican Americans to pay their fares at the front of the bus then get \noff of the bus and re-board from the rear of the bus.\n\n[[Page S1682]]\n\nThe driver of that bus was the same driver with whom Rosa Parks would \nhave her confrontation 12 years later.\n  The rest is history, the boycott which Rosa Parks began was the \nbeginning of an American revolution that elevated the status of African \nAmericans nationwide and introduced to the world a young leader who \nwould one day have a national holiday declared in his honor, the \nReverend Martin Luther King Jr.\n  We have come a long way toward achieving justice and equality for \nall. But we still have work to do. In the names of Rosa Parks, \nSojourner Truth, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, and \nmany others, let us rededicate ourselves to continuing the struggle on \nCivil Rights and to human rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/28/senate-section/article/S1682-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ALAN CRANSTON\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on the morning of the last day of the \n20th century, as he was preparing his breakfast, Alan Cranston died at \nhis home in Los Altos. After 86 years, his great huge heart just \nstopped.\n  There can never be a good time to lose someone like Alan Cranston. \nSuch leaders are too rare. Still, there is something fitting about Alan \nCranston leaving us just as the century came to a close. It was almost \nas if, having spent his life working to protecting us the darker \npossibilities of the 20th century, he held on until the last day in \norder to see us safely to the new century.\n  I first came to know Senator Cranston from a distance. He was four \nyears into his second Senate term, and had just been elected Democratic \nWhip, when I was first elected to the House. That was back in 1978.\n  Studying Senator Cranston from the other chamber, I realized early on \nthat he possessed a rare balance. He was a standard bearer for great \npublic causes--and he was as good a behind-the-scenes organizer and \nvote counter as I have ever seen. He was a pragmatic idealist.\n  I also noticed something else about Alan Cranston back then. I \nnoticed that he listened respectfully to all kinds of people and very \noften, just by listening, was able to bring people together. In this \npractice, and in many others, I have tried since then to follow his \nexample.\n  Another thing I admired about Alan Cranston was his tremendous \nrunning ability. From the time he was in high school, he was a champion \nsprinter. In college, he was a member of the nation's fastest one-mile \nsprint relay team in America, and he remained a competitive runner most \nof his life. At one point, I understand, he held the world record for \nthe 100-yard dash among 55-year-olds. As a 53-year-old runner who is \nnot likely to break any speed records soon, I find that amazing. I also \nfind it a little ironic--because in politics, Alan Cranston was no \nsprinter. He was a marathon runner.\n  When Alan Cranston signed on to a cause, it was for life. As a \nreporter in Europe in 1936, he was among the first to recognize the \nevil of fascism for what it was. He chronicled the rise of Hitler and \nMussolini. When he discovered that Hitler had authorized the export of \na sanitized copy of Mein Kampf to America, he acquired a copy of the \nGerman text and had it translated accurately, with all its hideous lies \nrestored. He sold copies for 10 cents--thus giving America some of its \ntrue glimpses into the real Hitler.\n  A copyright infringement lawsuit brought by Hitler himself eventually \nforced Alan Cranston to stop selling copies of Mein Kampf in America. \nBut nothing could ever stop him from speaking out against oppressors of \nfreedom and human dignity.\n  In 1946, Alan Cranston met Albert Einstein, who persuaded him that \nnuclear weapons must be banned or they will destroy the human race. \nFrom that day until he died, Alan Cranston was a tireless champion in \nthe effort to monitor nuclear arms and reduce their use.\n  During his years here in the Senate, he also championed an array of \nother noble causes--from the environment, to civil rights, to the men \nand women who serve in our nation's military.\n  Literally and figuratively, Alan Cranston was a towering figure in \nthis Senate for nearly a quarter of a century. He was an example to \nmany of us and to me personally. I am proud to say he was also a \nfriend.\n  With some sadness, and with gratitude for his lifetime of service to \nour nation, I join my colleagues in honoring the memory of Alan \nCranston and conveying our deep regrets to his family--especially his \nsister Ruth, his son Kim, and his granddaughter--as well as his many \nfriends across this country and around the world. Alan Cranston was \nloved in this Senate, and he will be deeply missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/28/senate-section/article/S1682-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CHERYL FLETCHER\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the efforts of \nCheryl Fletcher for her outstanding service. Today, Cheryl is retiring \nafter more than 21 years of service to me, the U.S. Senate and the \npeople of Oklahoma.\n  Cheryl has been with me since the beginning of my U.S. Senate career.\n  She joined my first U.S. Senate campaign in 1980. After winning, I \nasked her to establish an office in my hometown--Ponca City. Before \njoining my staff, she worked as director of the Ponca City United Way.\n  During the last 21 years, Cheryl has served as the Sate Director, \ncoordinating my schedule in Oklahoma and working as my liaison for \nnorthern Oklahoma. She has worked diligently for the people of Alfalfa, \nGrant, Kay, Washington, Osage, Pawnee, Payne, Noble, Major and Garfield \ncounties. She's been Ponca City's Outstanding Citizen of the Year and \nan active member of the Chamber of Commerce.\n  My colleagues can appreciate the tight time schedules we keep, and \nCheryl is one of the best when it comes to keeping me on time. I \nremember late one night, we were gong back to Ponca from a meeting in \nWoodward. Cheryl was driving and flew right past a stop sign. Needless \nto say, my heart skipped a beat. Rain storms, snow storms, even perfect \nweather, Cheryl was determined to get us there on time.\n  Her service, dedication and hard work have always been an asset to me \nand all Oklahomans. I and the entire State of Oklahoma will miss her \nknowledge and experience. It has been my privilege and pleasure to work \nwith her these years.\n  Few believed a young businessman from Ponca City could be a U.S. \nSenator. Cheryl believed and worked tirelessly to convince them, and \noccasionally me, that they were wrong.\n  Today, in Ponca City, Pioneer Bank, Home National Bank, Conoco, and \nEvans and Associates is hosting a reception in her honor. I know the \nplace will be packed and I'm sorry I can't be there to personally \nrecognize her on this special day.\n  I want to congratulate Cheryl, who is a loyal friend and employee, \nand thank her for 21 years of hard work. I wish her all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/28/senate-section/article/S1682-3", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1682-S1684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRESIDENT BUSH'S BUDGET\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last night I listened with great interest \nas President Bush outlined his budget proposal. It was a strong speech, \nand I commend the President for his encouraging comments on education, \nas well as his kind words for our good friend Congressman Joe Moakley. \nBut our challenge now is to produce a realistic budget. As the \nPresident describes it, the surplus is so big that the American people \ncan now have it all--huge tax cuts for everyone, increased spending on \nnational priorities, and elimination of the national debt.\n  I fully agree with President Bush that budgets are fundamentally \nabout our values and priorities, but I strongly disagree with him on \nwhat those priorities should be. While President Bush made the benefits \nof his plan appear real and the costs painless, I think the American \npeople correctly suspect that his words sound too good to be true. Just \nas there's no such thing as a free lunch, there's no such thing as a \nfree $2 trillion tax cut.\n  I support a substantial tax cut, but not one that is so large that it \ncrowds out continued debt reduction and investment in national \npriorities like education, health care, and worker training and \nprotection efforts. Not one that is so large that it jeopardizes \nMedicare and Social Security.\n\n[[Page S1683]]\n\n  This budget claims to provide massive tax cuts and maximize reduction \nof the national debt and keep our commitments under Social Security and \nMedicare and make the investments needed to keep the nation strong. It \nmakes five claims that are arithmetically impossible. The numbers \nsimply do not add up.\n  First, this budget argues that the nation can afford a $2 trillion \ntax cut right now. The White House claims that its proposed $1.6 \ntrillion tax cut ``uses only one fourth of the budget surplus.'' This \nis highly misleading. Make no mistake about it--President Bush's tax \ncut really consumes about 90% of the available budget surplus.\n  The tax cut now sought by the Administration would consume well over \n$2 trillion of the budget surplus. When President Bush cites the $1.6 \ntrillion figure, he neglects the increased cost of interest on the \nlarger national debt caused by the tax cut, and he ignores the added \ncost of his plan to make the tax cut retroactive.\n  We must be clear about the real size of the surplus. While the \nCongressional Budget Office projects that the federal government will \ncollect $5.6 trillion more than it spends over the next ten years, only \n$2.7 trillion of this amount can properly be called a ``surplus.'' The \nother $2.9 trillion is money that workers deposit with the government \nso they'll be protected by Social Security and Medicare when they \nretire. Workers pay this $2.9 trillion in payroll taxes for specific \nretirement and medical benefits. It is wrong to include money from \nworkers' Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes in the same pot \nused to finance the Administration's income tax and estate tax cuts.\n  Thus, at most $2.7 trillion in available surplus is projected over \nthe next ten years. Even the Congressional Budget Office acknowledges \nthe great uncertainty of its own surplus estimate. CBO itself \nrecognizes that a small reduction in economy's growth would reduce its \nsurplus estimates by trillions of dollars. Any responsible budget would \nreserve a significant share of the projected surplus in case the \nprojections prove too optimistic. Without such a reserve, any shortfall \ncould return the nation to large deficits and raids on the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund. Yet the Administration's budget commits every last \ndollar of the projected on-budget surplus and more, sacrificing the \nfiscal caution that uncertainty in the surplus projection demands.\n  President Bush's tax cuts would consume well over $2 trillion of the \n$2.7 trillion available surplus, leaving precious little over the next \nten years--to strengthen Social Security and Medicare before the baby \nboomers retire, to begin the quality prescription drug benefit that \nseniors desperately need, to provide the education increases that the \nnation's children deserve, to train and protect the American workers \nwhose increased productivity has proved essential to our strong \neconomy, to advance scientific research, to improve the nation's \nmilitary readiness, to improve the security of family farmers, and to \navoid burdening our children with the debt that we have accumulated.\n  After the Bush tax cut, we will simply not have the resources to meet \nthese urgent challenges.\n  All American workers deserve a tax cut, but its total size must be \nreduced far below the $2 trillion Bush proposal so that we can address \nour legitimate national needs.\n  Second, this budget pretends to protect Social Security and Medicare. \nMore than half of what President Bush terms the ``surplus'' is actually \nmoney that workers deposit with the government through the payroll tax \nto pay for their future Social Security and Medicare benefits. Just \nbecause the government does not pay those dollars out this year does \nnot make us free to spend them. Over the next ten years, Social \nSecurity will take in $2.5 trillion more dollars than it will pay out \nand Medicare will take in $400 billion more dollars than it will pay \nout. But every penny of this will be needed to provide Social Security \nand Medicare benefits when the baby boomers retire.\n  If we use that money for other purposes now, we would be increasing \nthe long term deficits in the Social Security and Medicare programs, \naccelerating the date on which each of those programs will not have \nsufficient revenue to pay the full cost of the benefits provided under \ncurrent law. The only fiscally responsible use for the so-called Social \nSecurity and Medicare ``surpluses'' is to set those funds aside to pay \nfuture retirement and medical benefits owed under current law.\n  The Administration's budget fails to set the entire $2.9 trillion \naside to cover the cost of future Social Security and Medicare \nbenefits. It only protects $2 trillion of that amount. The remaining \n$900 billion is used for other purposes. This seriously threatens the \nretirement benefits of current workers. While the Bush budget is vague \non just how this money will be used, it appears that more than $500 \nbillion of it will be used to finance the Administration's scheme to \ncreate private retirement accounts. Money is diverted from the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund to finance those accounts. I believe it would be \nterribly wrong to take money out of Social Security to finance private \naccounts. Without the guarantee of Social Security's monthly benefit \ncheck, one half the nation's elderly would be living in poverty. Taking \nmoney out of the Social Security Trust Fund will weaken the program's \nability to meet its legal obligations to the senior citizens it serves.\n  The President also plans to use current payroll taxes to finance \nprescription drug assistance for some seniors. But these dollars \nalready belong to Social Security and Medicare, and they are needed to \npay current benefits. The Bush plan really just tells Medicare to offer \na prescription drug benefit without providing one new dollar to fund \nthat benefit. His plan spends the same dollars twice. It is a cruel \nhoax.\n  The Bush budget also allows part of this $900 billion in payroll tax \nrevenue to be used for purposes ranging from military preparedness to \nfarm aid, flagrantly violating what I have taken to be broad bipartisan \nagreement to protect payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare.\n  The threat posed by the Bush budget to Social Security and Medicare \nis very real. Not only does it fail to reserve any of the on-budget \nsurplus to financially strengthen Social Security and Medicare by \npaying down the debt; it invades the Social Security and Medicare Trust \nFunds by removing $900 billion that already belong to these essential \nprograms.\n  Democrats are committed to keeping Social Security and Medicare \nstrong. We do this by reserving all payroll taxes to pay for the \nretirement and medical benefits that are now promised to seniors under \ncurrent law. No qualifications, no exceptions. This commitment means \nthat workers' payroll taxes are not available to fund income tax and \nestate tax cuts, private retirement accounts, or new spending.\n  Third, this budget alleges that it meets the nation's core health \nneeds. America's seniors desperately need access to prescription drugs, \nbut this budget provides only a placebo. President Bush said the right \nthings about how high a priority prescription drugs are for America's \nseniors, but the numbers in his budget show that his words can't pass \nthe truth in advertising test.\n  While the Administration's budget lavishes new tax breaks on the \nwealthy, it leaves little for the elderly whose lives often depend on \nprescription drugs. The budget gives five times more money to the \nwealthiest one percent of taxpayers than it allows for the Medicare \ndrug benefits that 39 million senior and disabled citizens need.\n  There can be no question about the urgent need for a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. A third of senior citizens--12 million \npeople--have no prescription drug coverage at all. Only half of all \nsenior citizens have prescription drug coverage throughout the year. \nMeanwhile, last year alone prescription drug costs increased an average \n17 percent.\n  President Bush's budget responds with baby steps toward prescription \ndrug coverage. After adjusting for inflation, President Bush's budget \nactually proposes one-third less than the inadequate amount he proposed \nin his campaign. His ``immediate helping hand'' program for the lowest \nincome senior citizens virtually exhausts the resources that he \nallocates, leaving the majority of seniors with nothing. This plan is \neven less generous than the Republican bill passed by the House last \nyear. And the Congressional Budget Office said that the House \nRepublican\n\n[[Page S1684]]\n\nplan was so underfunded that over half of all senior citizens with no \ncoverage today would not be able to participate under it. Yet this \nbudget allocates less money than the House Republican plan.\n  Medicare is a solemn promise to senior citizens.. It says, ``Work \nhard, pay into the trust fund during your working years, and you will \nhave health security in your retirement years.'' But this promise is \nbeing broken each and every day, because Medicare does not cover \nprescription drugs. The sad reality is that the Bush budget does not \nmend that broken promise--and it is now the responsibility of the \nCongress to keep faith with senior citizens.\n  The Administration's budget also fails to address the needs of the \nnation's uninsured. An uninsured family is exposed to financial \ndisaster in the event of serious illness. Unpaid medical bills account \nfor 200,000 bankruptcies annually. Over 9 million families spend more \nthan one fifth of their total income on medical costs.\n  The health consequences of being uninsured are even more devastating. \nIn any given year, one-third of the uninsured go without needed medical \ncare. Eight million uninsured Americans fail to take medication their \ndoctors prescribe because they cannot afford to fill the prescription. \nFour hundred thousand children suffering from asthma never see a \ndoctor. Five hundred thousand children with recurrent earaches never \nsee a doctor. Thirty-two thousand Americans with heart disease go \nwithout life-saving and life-enhancing bypass surgery or angioplasty--\nbecause they are uninsured. Twenty-seven thousand uninsured women are \ndiagnosed with breast cancer each year. They are twice as likely as \ninsured women not to receive medical treatment until their cancer has \nalready spread in their bodies.\n  The chilling bottom line is that eighty-three thousand Americans die \nevery year because they have no insurance. Being uninsured is the \nseventh leading cause of death in America. Our failure to provide \nhealth insurance for every citizen kills more people than kidney \ndisease, liver disease, and AIDS combined.\n  The Administration's budget provides only a small amount for \nrefundable tax credits to purchase health insurance policies--an amount \ntoo small to help the vast majority of the uninsured. In this time of \nunprecedented budget surpluses, isn't it more important to assure that \nchildren and their parents can see a doctor when they fall ill than it \nis to provide new tax breaks for millionaires?\n  Fourth, this budget does not meet the education needs of school \nchildren. The claim that this budget increases education funding by \n$4.6 billion or 11.5 percent is just plain wrong. This budget contains \nlittle more than a cost of living increase for our nation's schools, \nand few new investments to improve them.\n  The Administration's budget counts $2.1 billion that President \nClinton and Congress approved last year as part of this year's \nincrease. If President Bush did nothing on education, almost half of \nhis ``increase'' would happen anyway. The real increase that he \nproposes is $2.4 billion only 5.7 percent above current levels. The \nreality is that President Bush proposes only $1.8 billion in new money \nfor education next year, a mere 4 percent above inflation.\n  We need strong new investments to turn around our failing schools. \nBut this budget does not even keep up with the average 13 percent \nannual increase Congress has provided for education over the last 5 \nyears, and it will not enable communities and families across the \ncountry to meet their education needs.\n  I applaud President Bush for trying to make education a top priority. \nI applaud him for challenging the nation to ``leave no child behind.'' \nBut I am disappointed that this budget fails to provide the resources \nneeded to produce the action that we all agree is necessary.\n  President Bush says that he will increase funding for ESEA programs \nby $1.6 billion, including $600 million more for the Reading First \nprogram. I support the Reading First increase, but it leaves only $1 \nbillion for new investments in all other elementary and secondary \neducation priorities.\n  This year, schools confront record enrollments of 53 million \nelementary and secondary school students, and that number will continue \nto rise steadily, reaching an average six percent increase in student \nenrollment each year. The Administration's budget fails to keep pace \nwith population growth in schools, and it is possible that under the \nbudget he proposes, federal education support per student will decrease \nover the next ten years.\n  Schools and communities will have to educate millions more children \nand help them meet higher standards of learning while addressing \novercrowded classrooms, a shortage of qualified teachers, increased \nsafety concerns, and a lack of adequate after-school programs. Schools \nsimply cannot face these challenges alone. They need the help of their \ncommunities, their states, and the federal government to provide the \nbest opportunities for all children.\n  I am prepared to work with the President to enact his proposal for \nannual testing. But communities will need resources to develop and \nimplement the tests, and ensure that they are of the highest quality. \nIf overall education funding per student does not increase \nsignificantly, the nation cannot expect to achieve the right balance \nbetween investing in strategies that work and increasing accountability \nfor results.\n  Parents across the country will give President Bush and Congress a \ntest at the end of the year. If our education investments do not help \ncommunities turn around every failing school, help all qualified \nstudents afford to go to college, and ensure that workers have the \ntraining they need, this Republican Congress and this Republican White \nHouse will deserve a failing grade on education.\n  I hope we will work together to make the improvements in President \nBush's budget that will be needed to earn an A+ from the nation's \nparents.\n  Finally, this budget claims that its tax cut is fair to working \nfamilies. In reality, the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers, who pay 20 \npercent of all federal taxes, would receive 43 percent of the tax \nbenefits from Bush's plan. Their average annual tax cut would be more \nthan $46,000, more than a majority of American workers earn in a year.\n  The contrast is stark. Eighty percent of American families have \nannual incomes below $65,000. They would receive less than 30 percent \nof the tax benefits under Bush's plan. The average tax cut those \nfamilies would receive each year is less than $400. Twelve million low-\nincome families who work and pay taxes would get no tax cut at all \nunder Bush's plan. If we are going to return a share of the surplus to \nthe people, that certainly is not a fair way to do it.\n  Because the Bush tax cut is slanted so heavily to the wealthy, it is \npossible to enact a tax cut that costs less than half of President \nBush's proposal, yet actually provides more tax relief for working \nfamilies. That is what Congress should accomplish this year.\n  A close look at the Administration's budget only confirms that indeed \nwe cannot have it all. There is no way to eliminate the national debt, \nprovide massive tax cuts, and meet all of the nation's legitimate \nneeds.\n  President Bush's budget asks working families to sacrifice while the \nwealthiest families in America collect far more than their fair share. \nOverall, this budget threatens our prosperity and ignores the most \nfundamental national needs.\n  Governing is all about choices. And I believe that this budget makes \nthe wrong choices for working families in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/28/senate-section/article/S1684-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1684-S1685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING MRS. MATILDA TSCHETTER OF HURON, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, South Dakota, and the \ncountry, lost a friend. Mrs. Matilda Tschetter of Huron, South Dakota \nwas laid to rest on February 3rd in Freeman, SD.\n  This chamber is no stranger to great men and women, and the Record is \nreplete with recognition of their accomplishments. From Presidents to \ncivil rights leaders, we often come to the floor to recognize Americans \nwho have made a difference in our country. Matilda Tschetter may not \nhave been featured on the front page of the newspaper, but she was \ncertainly a great South Dakotan, and a great American.\n\n[[Page S1685]]\n\nAnd she, too, made a difference in this world.\n  Matilda Tschetter represents all that is great about our people. \nStrong, smart, and committed to her family, she spent much of her life \nserving others. Matilda and her late husband Henry were both educators. \nThey raised a family, and Matilda remained active in Democratic \npolitics throughout her life. I got to know Matilda when she served as \na Senior Intern in my office. I was impressed by both her kindness and \nher informed thoughts on the issues confronting our country and the \nworld. I understand that in the last election, Matilda voted absentee \nand made a point to remind everyone in her family to vote on election \nday. Matilda certainly understood the responsibility that comes with \nthe privilege of living in a democracy.\n  In South Dakota, and throughout the country, people like Matilda \nTschetter quietly make our country a better place. They are committed \nto their families, to their communities and to their country. They \npersevered through the Great Depression and are the reason our country \nis as strong as it is. Matilda Tschetter will certainly be missed.\n  Today the Senate joins me in paying tribute to an admirable woman. My \nsincere condolences go out to Matilda Tschetter's surviving family: her \ndaughter, Dianne Sandvick, and her son-in-law, Dr. Roger Sandvick. In \nthis difficult time, my thoughts and prayers are with them, and with \nMatilda's many friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/28/senate-section/article/S1685-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1685-S1686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Any witness shall be afforded, \n     upon request, the right to review that portion of such \n     record, and for this purpose, a copy of a witness's testimony \n     in public or closed session shall be provided to the witness. \n     Upon inspecting his transcript, within a time limit set by \n     the committee clerk, a witness may request changes in \n     testimony to correct errors of transcription, grammatical \n     errors, and obvious errors of fact, the Chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him shall rule on such request.\n       6. Impugned Persons. Any person who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a Member or staff, at a public \n     hearing or at a closed hearing concerning which there have \n     been public reports, tends to impugn his character or \n     adversely affect his reputation may:\n       (a) file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which shall be placed in the hearing \n     record;\n       (b) request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his own behalf; and\n       (c) submit questions in writing which he requests be used \n     for the cross-examination of other-witnesses called by the \n     Committee. The chairman shall inform the Committee of such \n     requests for appearance or cross-examination. If the \n     committee so decides; the requested questions, or paraphrased \n     versions or portions of them, shall be put to the other \n     witness by a Member or by staff.\n       7. Minority Witnesses. Whenever any hearing is conducted by \n     the Committee, the minority on the Committee shall be \n     entitled, upon request made by a majority of the minority \n     Members to the Chairman, to call witnesses selected by the \n     minority to testify or produce documents with respect to the \n     measure or matter under consideration during at least one day \n     of the hearing. Such request must be made before the \n     completion of the hearing or, if subpoenas are required to \n     call the minority witnesses, no later than three days before \n     the completion of the hearing.\n       8. Conduct of Witnesses, Counsel and Members of the \n     Audience. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, \n     his counsel, or any spectator conducts himself in such a \n     manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere \n     with the orderly administration of such hearing the Chairman \n     or presiding Member of the Committee present during such \n     hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, his \n     representative or any law enforcement official to eject said \n     person from the hearing room.\n\n[[Page S1690]]\n\n                    VI. Depositions and Commissions\n\n       1. Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the committee shall be authorized \n     and issued by the Chairman or by a staff officer designated \n     by him. Such notices shall specify a time and place for \n     examination, and the name of the staff officer or officers \n     who will take the deposition. Unless otherwise specified, \n     the deposition shall be in private. The Committee shall \n     not initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil \n     enforcement proceedings for a witness's failure to appear \n     unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a \n     Committee subpoena.\n       2. Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by \n     counsel to advise them of their rights, subject to the \n     provisions of rule V.4.\n       3. Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     Committee staff. Objections by the witnesses as to the form \n     of questions shall be noted by the record. If a witness \n     objects to a question and refuses to testify on the basis of \n     relevance or privilege, the Committee staff may proceed with \n     the deposition, or may at that time or at a subsequent time, \n     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from \n     a Member of the Committee. If the Member overrules the \n     objection, he may refer the matter to the Committee or he may \n     order and direct the witness to answer the question, but the \n     Committee shall not initiate the procedures leading to civil \n     or criminal enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify \n     after he has been ordered and directed to answer by a Member \n     of the Committee.\n       4. Filing. The Committee staff shall see that the testimony \n     is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is \n     transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for \n     review. No later than five days thereafter, the witness shall \n     return a signed copy, and the staff shall enter the changes \n     if any, requested by the witness in accordance with Rule V.6. \n     If the witness fails to return a signed copy, the staff shall \n     note on the transcript the date a copy was provided and the \n     failure to return it. The individual administering the oath \n     shall certify on the transcript that the witness was duly \n     sworn in his presence, the transcriber shall certify that the \n     transcript is a true record to the testimony, and the \n     transcript shall then be filed with the Committee clerk. \n     Committee staff may stipulate with the witness to changes in \n     this procedure; deviations from the procedure which do not \n     substantially impair the reliability of the record shall not \n     relieve the witness from his obligation to testify \n     truthfully.\n       5. Commissions. The Committee may authorize the staff, by \n     issuance of commissions, to fill in prepared subpoenas, \n     conduct field hearings, inspect locations, facilities, or \n     systems of records, or otherwise act on behalf of the \n     Committee. Commissions shall be accompanied by instructions \n     from the Committee regulating their use.\n\n\n                           vii. subcommittees\n\n       1. Establishment.

Mr. Robert C. McWilliams passed away \nrecently, and the State will mourn his loss.\n  Robert McWilliams, was commissioned into the Army in 1964 as a second \nlieutenant of armor.

Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \ncentennial of the founding of one of this country's technology \ntreasures, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST.\n  For 100 years, the National Institute of Standards and Technology has \nhelped to keep U.S. technology on the cutting edge. It has been a \nreliable and critical source of assistance to industry, science, and \ngovernment. NIST's research, measurement tools, and technical services \nare integrated deeply into the many systems and operations that drive \nour national economy.\n  There are few aspects of our everyday lives and no corner of this \ncountry that is not touched by the work of NIST. In my State of \nConnecticut and in every State across this country, factories, \ncommunication and transportation networks, laboratories, hospitals, \neducational institutions, gas stations, coffee shops, and the extended \nenterprises of both the traditional and new economies are dependent on \nthe work of NIST, its talented staff, and its ahead-of-the-curve \nresearch.\n  In order to understand the role that NIST has played in helping to \nmake this country the economic powerhouse it is, we should take a \nlittle trip back in time, say about 100 years, to the beginning of the \nlast century. It was a time before air conditioning, before plastics, \nbefore airplanes. Teddy Roosevelt had just become President and a \nmiddle-class income was no more than $5,000. We were at the dawn of the \nage of technology and we were excited about the opportunities for the \nrapidly evolving advances in science and technology.\n  We were also very confused. There were no authoritative national \nstandards for any quantities or products. For example, there were eight \nseparate values for the gallon. It was difficult, sometimes impossible, \nfor Americans to conduct fair transactions or to get parts to fit \ntogether properly. Construction materials were of an uneven quality. \nHousehold products were unreliable. This commercial chaos hindered \neconomic growth.\n  As the 1800s rolled into the 1900s, this country was in a precarious \nposition. We were dependent on the research and scientific work of \nother countries. Few Americans were working as scientists, because most \nscientific work was performed overseas. American instruments were \nshipped abroad to be calibrated, and American scientists and engineers \nhad to wait for their ships to come in, literally, before they could \nmove ahead. The confusion and reliance on other nations was \nhandicapping the United States in competition with trade rivals, such \nas Germany and England, countries which already had their own national \nmeasurement laboratories.\n  I am pleased to say that as they entered the 20th century, our \npredecessors in Congress acted wisely to remedy this commercial chaos \nand scientific competitive disadvantage. In 1901, in the final hours of \nits final session, the 56th Congress voted overwhelmingly to tackle a \npervasive national need by creating the National Bureau of Standards, \nnow known as NIST. Working closely with the leading scientists and \nindustrialists of the time, this body, with great foresight, endorsed \nthe concept of a national standards laboratory just as the century was \nbeginning.\n  A century later, NIST has become an organization of 3,200 employees, \nplus 2,000 field agents who partner with NIST in all 50 states and \nPuerto Rico, 1,600 guest researchers and another 1,500 industrial \nresearch partners. A lot has happened to science and technology over \nthe past century and NIST has helped to lay the foundations for our \nnation's progress.\n  I would like to spend just a few minutes reviewing some key \ncontributions the Institute has made to industry, science, technology, \nnational security and consumers. In the early years of the century, \nthousands of train derailments were caused by broken rails, wheel \nflanges and axles. NIST ran tests, and reported that the steel industry \nhad not established uniform practices in manufacturing rails and \nwheels. By 1930, as better steel went into rails and trains, with \nNIST's help in standardizing materials and processing, the rate of \naccidents from these causes fell by two-thirds.\n  At the end of the century, industry had become increasingly dependent \non information and knowledge and NIST continued to be relevant in that \narea. For example, financial services, telecommunications companies, \nand hardware and software products relied heavily on the data \nencryption standard issued by NIST in 1977, the first publicly \navailable standard of this type and the first cryptographic algorithm \nendorsed by the Federal Government. Today, NIST is coordinating a \nsuccessor standard, having run an Olympics-type worldwide competition.\n  The Global Positioning System and other communications and navigation \ntechnologies are more accurate, thanks to improved timekeeping, a trend \npromoted by NIST's operation of the first atomic clock, which was based \non the ammonia molecule, in 1949. Progress in cooling atoms to within \nthe tiniest fraction of ``absolute zero'' enabled NIST to build one of \nthe world's most accurate atomic clocks, NIST F-1, which is used to \nmaintain the nation's time standard.\n  NIST's critical role for industry has not been limited to research. \nIts Manufacturing Extension Partnership program has been boosting the \ncompetitiveness of this country's 361,000 smaller manufacturers since \n1989. In 1999, more than 23,000 firms took advantage of its services, \nincreasing or retaining billions of dollars in sales, saving hundreds \nof millions of dollars in costs, and creating or retaining tens of \nthousands of jobs.\n\n[[Page S1695]]\n\n  Another relatively recent and important addition to NIST's work has \nbeen its Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award program that has \nhelped thousands of organizations to improve their overall performance. \nThe Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence have been used by tens \nof thousands of organizations and they have been called the ``single \nmost influential document in the modern history of American business.''\n\n  The once-troubled $7 billion U.S. printed wiring board industry, with \nits 200,000 jobs, was turned around by a research project co-funded by \nNIST's Advanced Technology Program. The joint venture led to dramatic \nefficiencies in research and development, accelerated research, and \nproduced significant technological advances. ATP has played a key role \nin pushing ahead emerging critical technologies.\n  NIST's work extends to national security. During military conflicts, \nNIST was called on to perform numerous tasks, ranging from development \nof a synthetic substitute for rubber to improving submarine \ncommunications to helping design the ``Bat,'' the first fully automated \nguided missile to be used successfully in combat. Important initial \nresearch on the atomic bomb was carried out by NIST, which served as a \ncentral control lab for determination of the properties of uranium.\n  Like industry and our security forces, consumers also count heavily \non NIST. For example, withdrawals from automated teller machines are \namong the billions of dollars worth of electronic data transaction that \nhave been secured for many years with the first publicly available data \nencryption standard, issued by NIST in 1977. Today, NIST is \ncoordinating the development of an even more powerful successor \nstandard.\n  Today, patients receive accurate radiation doses in disease diagnosis \nand treatment today thanks to NIST radiation measurement and standards \nactivities under way since the 1970s. NIST's contributions to the safe \nmedical use of radiation began many years ago. It included efforts to \nhelp bring about the 1931 X-ray safety code, which set guidelines for \nprotective devices for patients and operators.\n  The U.S. death rate from fires declined by 50 percent between the \nearly 1970's and late 1990's, in large part because smoke detectors are \nnow installed in 95 percent of homes. NIST made this improvement \npossible by developing, with Underwriters Laboratories' participation, \nthe first fire performance standard for smoke detectors and \nrecommendations on number, type and placement of the extinguishers.\n  It is clear that over its first 100 years, NIST has become part of \nthe fabric of the U.S. economy and society. Our homes, factories, \nlaboratories, hospitals, schools, police and fire departments, and \nmilitary all have benefitted from NIST's technical handiwork. NIST's \nimportance to this country is as true today as at any time in the \nagency's 100 year history.\n  Now we must look to the future as we celebrate this highly valued \ninstitution. Science, technology and society obviously have been \ntransformed over the century and NIST's challenges are changing, too.\n  What's next for NIST? As science and technology advance, the need for \nnew and more accurate measurements also grows. To meet the exacting \nneeds of electronic manufacturers, for example, NIST researchers have \ndeveloped methods for counting electrons, one by one. And to open the \nfrontier of nanotechnology, where feature sizes are hundreds and even \nthousands of times smaller than the diameter of a human hair, they are \ndevising molecular rulers, derived from interatomic spacings in \nperfectly ordered crystals.\n  Standards have become crucial for efficient business entry into \nemerging technologies. Standards have also become a tool of other \nnations for creating mercantile trade barriers. NIST's role in setting \nsound global technology standards is becoming critical to U.S. \nperformance in the global economy.\n  Information Technology security is fundamental to our electronic \ninfrastructure, and NIST is addressing those challenges with special \nattention to helping other government agencies to improve the security \nof their systems.\n  With tough global competition and a growing productivity gap compared \nwith larger manufacturers, small firms will sorely need even greater \nthe access to a nationwide system of technical and business assistance \noffered by NIST's Manufacturing Extension Partnership.\n  The Baldrige criteria for organizational improvement are just taking \nhold in the education and healthcare sectors, and manufacturers and \nservice firms continue to find these evolving criteria to be effective \nguideposts to help them meet increasing customer demands for \nexcellence.\n  The new technologies fostered over the past decade by NIST's cost-\nsharing of high-risk research through the Advanced Technology Program, \nwill be emerging at a quickening pace over the next several years as \ncompanies turn these enabling technologies into marketplace offerings.\n  As NIST moves into its second century, it is clearly committed to \nworking with industry, building the science, technology and business \ninfrastructure needed to ensure future economic prosperity and a higher \nquality of life for all Americans. We are building a new economy in \nthis century that is based on innovation. NIST is playing an important \nrole in support of the private sector, in building that new economy.\n  As with our predecessors a century ago, it is the responsibility of \nthis body to support NIST in meeting those challenges. As NIST \ncelebrates its centennial and looks forward to even greater \naccomplishments, let us in this body reaffirm our commitment to \ncreating new generations of science, technology, economic growth and \nsecurity. Congress has played an important role in NIST's first century \nof success. Now as NIST begins its second century of service to U.S. \nindustry and all Americans, it is Congress' responsibility to keep this \ntreasure a strong resource that will help prepare us for the century \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/28/senate-section/article/S1695-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING THE FAMILY OF KAYLA ROLLAND\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

The family of Kayla \nRolland, the little girl who was shot by her first-grade classmate, has \nbeen a source of inspiration to all families who have lost loved ones \nin gun tragedies.\n  Despite her own suffering, Kayla's mother, Veronica McQueen, found \nthe strength to speak out to all Americans about her family's tragedy \nat the Million Mom March. The memory of Kayla and Mrs. McQueen's words \nof courage helped lead thousands of families from our State to march in \nWashington for sensible and safe gun laws.\n  Mrs. McQueen continues to speak out with hope that she can prevent \nanother family from suffering what her family has suffered. Last \nweekend, as family and friends gathered together to memorialize the one \nyear shooting death of young Kayla, Mrs. McQueen, said:\n\n       I pray to God that by being here and sharing with you our \n     sorrow and grief in some way we have made people more aware \n     of gun and school safety and common sense gun laws and to \n     protect our children from guns and, hopefully, save children \n     from what happened to my special little angel, Kayla. This is \n     so important to us.\n       It has been a very horrible year for all of us. The pain \n     will not go away. I miss her more as time goes on, but \n     Kayla's behind me. Her spirit is driving me on to help save \n     other children from gun violence, and I hope and pray you all \n     will--help save our children.\n       In a few days, it will be one year since I lost a piece of \n     my heart with Kayla's death.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nexceptional men and women of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, a \npremiere Federal law enforcement agency and protector of the U.S. mail. \nFounded by Benjamin Franklin, the Nation's first postmaster general, it \nis one of the oldest Federal law enforcement agencies. The Postal\n\n[[Page S1696]]\n\nInspection Service has a long, proud, and successful history of \nenforcing laws against those who would use the Nation's postal system \nto defraud, endanger, or otherwise harm the American people.\n  America has long entrusted her secrets and commerce to the Postal \nService. Dedicated postal workers have delivered untold love letters \nfrom sweethearts, care packages from home, financial instruments from \nbankers, and mail-order parcels from merchants. Preserving this trust \nis the Postal Inspection Service. In days past, Postal Inspectors \nprotected colonial America's post offices from theft and embezzlement \nand protected the American people from mail fraud swindles following \nthe Civil War. Postal Inspectors solved the last known stagecoach \nrobbery in the United States in 1916 and protected the transfer of the \nNation's $15.5 billion gold reserve from New York to Fort Knox in 1934. \nPostal Inspectors organized the massive military mail system during \nWorld War II and protected the priceless Hope Diamond when it was \ntransferred to the Smithsonian Institution in 1958. In recent years, \nPostal Inspectors have conducted major investigations from Wall Street \ninsider trading to child pornography to international art fraud. The \nPostal Inspection Service was one of three Federal law enforcement \nagencies assigned to the Unabomber task force.\n  As a testament to their reputation and professionalism, postal \ninspectors were selected by former Senator John Danforth to serve as \nthe primary investigators looking into the confrontation at Waco, TX. \nIn 1996, Postal Inspectors served on the Federal task force \ninvestigating the shootout at Ruby Ridge, ID.\n  In addition to its expertise as a Federal law enforcement agency, the \nPostal Inspection Service serves as the security arm of the U.S. Postal \nService. When natural disasters or civil disorders occur, postal \ninspectors and postal police officers are among the first to respond, \nprotecting the U.S. mail, postal workers, and property. Immediately \nfollowing these emergencies, the Postal Inspection Service works with \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency to re-establish basic \nGovernment mail service, and safeguards delivery of the tons of private \nrelief and aid that is often sent through the U.S. mail.\n  The Service continues to work to preserve America's confidence in the \nU.S. mail, even as the Internet assumes a prominent role in our \nsociety. Just as it has adapted from stagecoach robberies to Wall \nStreet insider trading schemes, the Postal Inspection Service has now \nset its sights on Internet fraudsters and cyber-criminals who use the \nU.S. mail as part of their schemes. It is appropriate that the Service \nis currently giving significant prevention and investigative attention \nto the issue of identity theft where thieves steal other's identifying \ninformation--name, address, date of birth, Social Security number and \nmother's maiden name--to take over the victim's financial accounts.\n  Today, there are approximately 2,000 postal inspectors stationed \nthroughout the United States responsible for enforcing more than 200 \nFederal criminal statutes.\n  As the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on International \nSecurity, Proliferation, and Federal Services, I have the privilege of \nproviding legislative support and oversight of this distinguished \ndepartment.

Too often the result has been \ntoo few needs met at too high a cost. This budget offers a new \napproach--a different approach for an era that expects a Federal \nGovernment that is both active to promote opportunity and limited to \npreserve freedom.\n  Our new approach is compassionate:\n  It will revitalize our public schools by testing for achievement, \nrewarding schools that succeed, and giving more flexibility to parents \nof children in schools that persistently fail.\n  It will reinvigorate our civil society by putting Government on the \nside of faith-based and other local initiatives that work--that \nactually help Americans escape drugs, lives of crime, poverty, and \ndespair.\n  It will meet our Nation's commitments to seniors. We will strengthen \nSocial Security, modernize Medicare, and provide prescription drugs to \nlow-income seniors.\n  This new approach is also responsible:\n  It will retire nearly $1 trillion in debt over the next four years. \nThis will be the largest debt reduction ever achieved by any nation at \nany time. It achieves the maximum amount of debt reduction possible \nwithout payment of wasteful premiums. It will reduce the indebtedness \nof the United States, relative to our national income, to the lowest \nlevel since early in the 20th Century and to the lowest level of any of \nthe largest industrial economies.\n  It will provide reasonable spending increases to meet needs while \nslowing the recent explosive growth that could threaten future \nprosperity. It moderates the growth of discretionary spending from the \nrecent trend of more than six percent to four percent, while allowing \nMedicare and Social Security to grow to meet the Nation's commitments \nto its retirees.\n  It will deliver tax relief to everyone who pays income taxes, giving \nthe most dramatic reductions to the least affluent taxpayers. It will \nalso give our economy a timely second wind and reduce the tax burden--\nnow at the highest level as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product \nsince World War II.\n  Finally, this new approach begins to confront great challenges from \nwhich Government has too long flinched. Social Security as it now \nexists will provide future beneficiaries with the equivalent of a \ndismal two percent real rate of return on their investment, yet the \nsystem is headed for insolvency. Our new approach honors our commitment \nto Social Security by reserving every dollar of the Social Security \npayroll tax for Social Security, strengthening the system by making \nfurther necessary reform feasible.\n  Medicare as it exists does not adequately care for our seniors in \nmany ways, including the lack of prescription drug coverage. Yet \nMedicare spending already exceeds Medicare taxes and premiums by $66 \nbillion this year, and Medicare will spend $900 billion more than it \ntakes in over the next 10 years. Reform is urgently needed. Our new \napproach will safeguard Medicare by ensuring that the resources for \nreform will be available.\n\n[[Page S1697]]\n\n  New threats to our national security are proliferating. They demand a \nrethinking of our defense priorities, our force structure, and our \nmilitary technology. This new approach begins the work of restoring our \nmilitary, putting investments in our people first to recognize their \nimportance to the military of the future.\n  It is not hard to see the difficulties that may lie ahead if we fail \nto act promptly. The economic outlook is uncertain. Unemployment is \nrising, and consumer confidence is falling. Excessive taxation is \ncorroding our prosperity. Government spending has risen too quickly, \nwhile essential reforms, especially for our schools, have been \nneglected. And we have little time before the demographic challenge of \nSocial Security and Medicare becomes a crisis.\n  We cannot afford to delay action to meet these challenges. And we \nwill not. It will demand political courage to face these problems now, \nbut I am convinced that we are prepared to work together to begin a new \nera of shared purposes and common principles. This budget begins the \nwork of refining those purposes and those principles into policy--a \ncompassionate, responsible, and courageous policy worthy of a \ncompassionate, responsible, and courageous Nation.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to clarify the \nstandards for compensation of Persian Gulf veterans suffering from \ncertain undiagnosed illnesses, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nDurbin of Illinois to offer legislation on a very important issue for \nthose men and women who served during the Persian Gulf War. A companion \nbill was introduced in the House by Congressman Manzullo from Illinois. \nThis bill will amend the Persian Gulf War Veterans' Benefits Act, title \nI of Public Law 103-446. That law provides for the payment of \ncompensation to Persian Gulf veterans suffering from a chronic \ndisability resulting from an undiagnosed illness or a combination of \nundiagnosed illnesses. This bill will extend the presumptive period \nfrom December 31, 2001 to ``from December 31, 2011 or such a later date \nas the Secretary may prescribe by regulation.'' Additionally, the bill \nfurther expands the definition of an undiagnosed illness and gives a \ncomprehensive list of signs or symptoms that may be manifestation of an \nundiagnosed illness such as fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, \ngastrointestinal signs and symptoms to name a few. Today, 10 years \nafter the end of the Persian Gulf War many of our veterans are \nsuffering from undiagnosed illnesses.\n  President Bush in a speech titled ``Our Debt of Honor'' on November \n10, 1999, Veterans Day, said of our Persian Gulf War Veterans, ``They \nshould not have to go to elaborate lengths to prove that they are ill, \njust because their malady has yet to be fully explained. A 1994 law was \npassed to grant them the presumption of disability. Yet even now they \nare met with skeptical looks and paper-shuffling excuses for \nwithholding coverage. If I have anything to say about it, all that is \ngoing to end. In the military, when you are called to account for a \nmistake, you are expected to give one simple answer: ``No excuse, \nsir.'' And that should be the attitude of any government official who \nfails to make good on our public responsibilities to veterans. There \nare no excuses for it.\n  Of the nearly 700,000 U.S. military personnel who served in the \nPersian Gulf in 1990 and 1991, more than 100,000 have complained of an \narray of symptoms that have become known as the Gulf War Syndrome. \nThese symptoms include chronic fatigue, muscle and joint pain, memory \nloss, sleep disorders, depression and concentration problems among \nothers. Approximately 9,000 of those were denied claims under the 1994 \nlaw.\n  There are some who question whether or not such a syndrome actually \nexists and many continue to theorize that these symptoms are largely \npsychological and brought about by post-traumatic stress. I believe the \nevidence is increasingly clear that this is not stress related. We have \nan obligation to ensure Gulf War veterans are properly diagnosed and \ntreated effectively and compensated for any service connected \ndisabilities.\n  What we do know is that our veterans were exposed to a host of \npharmaceuticals, chemicals and environmental toxins. Indeed those who \nserved were apparently exposed to some veritable witch's brew of known \nand potential hazards to health including blowing dust and sand \nparticles, smoke from oil well fires, petroleum fuels and their \ncombustion products, possible exposure to chemical warfare nerve agents \nand biological warfare agents, pyridostigmine bromide pills to protect \nagainst organophosphate nerve agents, insecticides, vaccinations, \ninfectious diseases, depleted uranium, and psychological and \nphysiological stress.\n  This bill will be a step in the right direction and is the way to \nhelp repay our debt to these veterans. Not only is it the right thing \nand fair thing to do, but during these times of increased deployments \nand personnel shortages, it is in our national interest to continue to \nshow our dedicated service members that we appreciate their sacrifice \nand commitment.\n  I commend the Senator from Illinois for his support on this issue and \nurge other Senators to join us in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO:\n  S. 410. A bill to amend the Violence Against Women Act of 2000 by \nexpanding legal assistance for victims of violence grant program to \ninclude assistance for victims of dating violence; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nis an important step in continuing to recognize the victims of dating \nviolence. The bill I am introducing today would allow victims of dating \nviolence to qualify for federal legal assistance grants authorized \nunder the Violence Against Women Act.\n  Dating violence is a predominately little-known and misunderstood \naspect of domestic violence. Historically, domestic violence laws have \nonly been applied in cases where the victims have been married or \ncohabitating with the abuser, or where the couple shares a child \ntogether. Unfortunately, this criteria ignores the equally dangerous \nviolence that can occur in dating relationships. Victims of domestic \nviolence are victims regardless of their relationship to the abuser. \nThese victims face the same trauma and the same manipulation as every \nother domestic violence victim. As Congress focuses its attention on \nproviding necessary assistance to the states for prevention and \ntreatment of domestic violence, we must not allow victims of dating \nviolence to be left behind.\n  The lack of recourse for victims of dating violence was brought to my \nattention through a tragic incident in my home State of Idaho. In \nDecember 1999, Cassie Dehl, a seventeen-year-old girl from Soda \nSprings, Idaho, was killed in an accident involving her abusive \nboyfriend. Despite documentation of years of vicious and life-\nthreatening abuse, Cassie's parents were unable to obtain legal \nprotection for their daughter because neither Federal or Idaho domestic \nviolence law applied to teenage dating relationships. Although the \nabuse was evident and the need for assistance was clear, no one was \nable to offer Cassie the help that was needed to prevent this senseless \nact.\n\n[[Page S1702]]\n\n  Last year, Congress overwhelmingly reauthorized a number of important \ndomestic violence programs under the Violence Against Women Act. In \naddition to continuing the existing programs, the VAWA reauthorization \nincluded two new provisions of particular importance. First, a legal \ndefinition of dating violence was created, the first such definition \nunder federal law. Secondly, a new grant program to provide civil legal \nassistance to victims of domestic violence was authorized. \nUnfortunately, while many of the existing VAWA programs were expanded \nto include dating violence, the new legal assistance grant was not. My \nlegislation will correct this discrepancy.\n  The victims of dating violence require and deserve the same legal \nassistance given to other victims of domestic violence. The ability to \nobtain a legal protection order or pursue other legal remedies can be \nthe difference in a victim being able to break the cycle of oppressive \nabuse and regain control of their life. Under my legislation, victims \nof dating violence will have the same legal standing as all other \nvictims of domestic violence when seeking civil legal assistance.\n  I applaud Congress for coming together last year to bring attention \nto the continuing problem of domestic violence. In order to build upon \nthe advances we made last year, I urge my colleagues to support my \nlegislation that takes another step toward achieving an equal status \nfor victims of dating violence.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 410\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate a portion of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge as wilderness; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce, along \nwith 23 of my colleagues, legislation to protect forever the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge from oil exploration and other potentially \nharmful development. Our legislation will bequeath, undisturbed, the \nvital heart of America's greatest, most pristine wilderness ecosystem \nand wildlife sanctuary to future generations.\n  Advocates of drilling offer the Refuge as a quick fix for our \ncountry's energy woes and a long-term solution to our debilitating \ndependence on foreign oil. It is neither.\n  Proponents of drilling argue that there is a princely sum of black \ngold lying beneath the Refuge. But not according to the scientific \nexperts of the U.S. Geological Survey, who in a 1998 study determined \nthat a six to eight-month supply of oil would likely be recovered from \nthe Refuge over its 50-year lifespan because most of the oil there is \nsimply too expensive to extract. This is not the low end estimate; it \nis the most likely one. And not a drop of oil would emerge from ANWR \nfor about 10 years. This is hardly the answer to our energy needs, now \nor in the future.\n  In fact, the only thing we know for certain about drilling in the \nRefuge, as a result of years of analysis and experience, is that it \nwould immeasurably and irreversibly damage one of the last preserves of \nits kind in the world. To drill for oil in the Arctic Refuge is like \nchopping down the California Redwoods for firewood, or capping Old \nFaithful for geothermal power, or damming the Grand Canyon for \nhydroelectric power, unthinkable acts because the cost in lost natural \ntreasures is obviously too high.\n  To judge the environmental threat, listen to the ecologists and \nbiologists who have extensively studied the impact of drilling, not to \nthe politicians. Scientific analyses by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife \nService have concluded that drilling would severely harm the refuge's \nabundant populations of caribou, polar bears, musk oxen, and snow \ngeese.\n  Advocates of drilling claim that these concerns are grossly \nexaggerated because drilling would only impact an area the size of an \nairport. But what they don't tell you is that this ``airport'' has \nterminals outside that spread all over the Refuge. A spider web of \ninfrastructure, including hundreds of miles of roads and pipelines, \nproduction facilities, ports, and housing and services for thousands of \npeople would be required. As was recently said on ``60 Minutes,'' it \nwould be ``urban sprawl on the tundra.''\n  The probable environmental consequences of drilling also go well \nbeyond the animals of the North Slope. The Trans-Alaska and Prudhoe Bay \noil fields have averaged more than 400 spills a year of everything from \ncrude oil to acid, including an oil spill of approximately 9,000 \nbarrels just last week. Current oil operations on Alaska's North Slope \nemit tons of harmful pollutants every year which cause smog and acid \nrain and contribute to global warming.\n  And that gets to the larger point. We have a long-term energy problem \nin America, but drilling in the Arctic Refuge will not help solve it. \nIn fact, drilling in the Arctic deludes us into thinking we can oil-\nproduce our way out of our energy problem. We can't because nature has \nleft us with too little oil within our control to meet our needs. We \nmust draw what we can from our own resources in an environmentally-\nprotective way.\n  But, in the end, that will not be enough. To become more energy \nindependent and environmentally-protective, we must also conserve, we \nmust be more efficient, use alternative energy sources and rapidly \ndevelop new technologies like fuel cells.\n  That is why we want to protect the Arctic Refuge, and why we will \nfight all attempts to drill there for oil with any legislative weapon \nwe possess, including a filibuster in the Senate.\n  In short, for the sake of America's energy and environmental future, \nwe are once again today drawing a line in the Arctic tundra. We will do \neverything necessary to protect it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1703]]\n\n                                 S. 411\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF PORTION OF ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE \n                   REFUGE AS WILDERNESS.\n\n       Section 4 of the National Wildlife Refuge System \n     Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(p) Designation of Certain Land as Wilderness.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a portion of \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska comprising \n     approximately 1,559,538 acres, as generally depicted on a map \n     entitled `Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--1002 Area. \n     Alternative E--Wilderness Designation, October 28, 1991' and \n     available for inspection in the offices of the Secretary, is \n     designated as a component of the National Wilderness \n     Preservation System under the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 \n     et seq.).''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have joined with the Senior Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, as a co-sponsor of legislation he has \nintroduced today to designate the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge as \na wilderness area. I have been a co-sponsor of this bill since I became \na member of this body. I am concerned that Congress will be forced to \nconsider whether or not to drill on the coastal plain of the Refuge \nbefore we take substantive action about whether or not the area should \nbe designated as wilderness. Establishment of drilling on the coastal \nplain would be allowing a use on the coastal plain that is generally \nconsidered to be incompatible with areas designated as wilderness under \nthe Wilderness Act. I want my colleagues to be aware that this is the \nsituation, and that we are not going to increase the supply of oil in \nthe near term, or reduce today's high gasoline or other high energy \nprices by drilling in the Refuge. I fear that drilling in the Refuge is \nbeing promoted not to help us address our current energy situation. As \na member of Budget Committee I fear that this idea is again being \nproposed so that we can reaping the revenue from the leasing of the \ncoastal plain so that we can entertain large tax cuts.\n  Second, I oppose drilling in the Refuge because it does not advance \nour domestic energy security. I cannot believe that the American people \nwant energy security at the expense of the protection of a substantial \nasset such as the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain. I stand ready to work \nto find other sources of energy, to use existing sources more \nefficiently, to address consumption and to promote sustainable sources.\n  Third, I oppose drilling in the Refuge because of its potential \nimpact upon existing wilderness, that's right existing wilderness which \nhas already been designated in the Arctic Refuge. East of the coastal \nplain are 8 million acres that have already been designated as \nwilderness. We have had very little discussion about the impact of \ndrilling in the Refuge on areas we have already designated and I want \ncolleagues to be aware that the drilling question threatens not only \nour ability to make future wilderness designations in the Refuge but \nalso could endanger areas that we believed had already protected in the \npublic trust.\n  I want to speak today specifically to colleagues who may be \nconsidering the potential of possible oil discoveries in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge in light of current high oil prices. \nColleagues should keep in mind that the Senate's consideration of the \ncoastal plain as a source of oil is not triggered by any new \ndevelopments or changes in the geology or economics that affect \npotential development of Arctic resources. The United States Geological \nSurvey has already re-considered those factors in its 1998 re-\nassessment of the Arctic Refuge coastal plain's oil potential. Rather, \nthe current discussion, in my view, is prompted by the rhetoric and \nopportunistic efforts of those interests that have long advocated \ndrilling in the Arctic Refuge, to exploit public concern about the \ncurrent high prices of domestic heating oil, aviation gas and motor \nfuels.\n  First, I want to address the issue, at the forefront of many of my \ncolleagues' minds, of whether drilling in the Arctic Refuge constitutes \na meaningful or appropriate response to the fact that the U.S. oil \nproduction is declining and exports are increasing. To answer that \nquestion, I want to review some import, export and consumption data \ncompiled by two federal agencies, the Energy Information Agency and the \nMaritime Administration.\n\n  I'm sure it will not surprise my colleagues that the last two decades \nhave been marked by a steady decline in total domestic crude oil \nproduction, which includes crude oil plus natural gas liquids. \nMoreover, after a decline in petroleum consumption during the 1980s, \noil use is again on the rise. In addition during the 1989-99 period, \nNorth Slope production declined from 1.885 million barrels per day to \napproximately 1.06 million barrels per day; the North Slope thus \naccounted for three quarters of the total domestic production decline \nwhich was a 1.105 million barrels per day decline in production during \nthis period.\n  At the same time that imports are increasing, U.S. export of oil \nproducts and crude oil totals nearly 1.0 million barrels per day. Of \nthat total, most, approximately seven barrels out of eight, is refined \nproduct. As far as crude exports are concerned, Maritime Agency data \nindicate that export of Alaska North Slope crude in 1999 averaged about \napproximately 7.1 percent of total Alaska North Slope production.\n  These data point to the complicated, transnational nature of the \nworld petroleum market, a market in which the U.S. continues to export \nnearly a million barrels of petroleum products per day, nearly 5 \npercent of total consumption. In light of the fact that we exist in a \nglobal economy, the United States is not likely to be able to produce \nits way out of the current petroleum shortages. When one looks at the \nfact that the Middle East possesses the preponderance of world oil \nreserves, it becomes clear that concerns about increasing use of \nimported oil might be better addressed by decreasing consumption \nthrough conservation and the switch to alternative energy sources.\n  In addition, we have heard, over the course of several debates here \non the floor, that the Arctic Refuge has the ``potential'' of yielding \n16 billion barrels of oil. I also wanted to address the issue of the \nlikelihood that 16 billion barrels of oil will be discovered beneath \nthe coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge. First of all, that figure \nrepresents the outside limit of probabilities for an assessment area \nthat includes the area of the Arctic Refuge coastal plain currently \nbarred from drilling, plus adjacent areas where exploration has taken \nplace. When one just examines the area within the Arctic Refuge that is \nunder consideration, the correct low-probability estimate of oil is \n11.8 billion barrels of undiscovered oil , 25 percent less than the 16 \nbillion barrel figure we have heard to date. A field capable of that \nproduction has been discovered only once on this continent, at Prudhoe \nBay. Moreover, despite recent advances in exploration technology, the \nU.S. Geological Survey has abandoned the notion of finding a super-\ngiant field and looks instead to the possibility of discovering several \nmuch smaller fields beneath the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge. \nRather, the USGS assigns a probability of 5 percent or one chance in \ntwenty, to the possibility that a field of that magnitude will be \ndiscovered. The mean estimate for technically recoverable oil is \nconsiderably lower and the figure for oil that is economically \nrecoverable is lower still. In fact, the USGS concluded that it would \nexpect to find four fields scattered across the refuge capable of \nproducing, altogether, approximately 3.2 billion barrels of oil, one \nfifth the amount of oil that we have heard might be available.\n  However, even if one accepts a higher number for the coastal plain's \npetroleum potential, members of this body need seriously to consider \nwhether there is any connection between oil that might be found in the \nArctic Refuge and the current high prices of petroleum products. I \nfeel, simply, that the Arctic Refuge is not a solution to the current \nsituation.\n  For starters, it might take a decade to bring to market any oil that \nmight be discovered in the Arctic Refuge. Exploration, discovery and \nassessment, field design and installation and pipeline design and \nconstruction are all time-consuming endeavors. The people of Wisconsin \nwant lower gas prices now, not ten years from now.\n  Moreover, the price of oil is determined by global supply and demand \nfactors, not by the presence or absence of an individual oil field. \nConsider the\n\n[[Page S1704]]\n\ncase of Prudhoe Bay. In 1976, the year before the nation's largest oil \nfield, the largest ever discovered in North America entered production, \na barrel of West Texas intermediate crude oil sold for $12.65 and \nstandard gasoline averaged $0.59 per gallon. Two years later, with \nPrudhoe Bay adding more than a million barrels per day to domestic \nsupply in 1978, West Texas crude had increased by more than 15 percent, \nto $14.85 per barrel, and gasoline averaged nearly $0.63 per gallon. \nDuring the next two years, as Prudhoe production increased, oil prices \nskyrocketed to $37.37 per barrel, while gasoline nearly doubled, to \n$1.19 per gallon. In 1985, with Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk both operating \nat full throttle, a barrel of West Texas crude sold for more than \n$28.00 per barrel and gasoline averaged $1.12 per gallon.\n  So Mr. President, if drilling may impair our ability to make a \ndecision about the wilderness-qualities of the Refuge in the future, if \nthe Refuge does not contain as much oil as we thought, and if opening \nthe coastal plain to drilling may do little to impact our current \ndomestic prices, why are we considering doing so? The facts don't point \ntoward drilling in the Refuge: the Refuge may not contain as much oil \nas we think, and opening the coastal plain to drilling may have only a \nminor impact on our current domestic prices.\n  Finally, I have concerns about the arguments that I have heard in \nrecent days that oil drilling and environmental protection are \ncompatible. Only days ago I was traveling through the Niger Delta \nregion of Nigeria by boat, where I observed firsthand the environmental \ndevastation caused by the oil industry. The terrible stillness of an \nenvironment that should be teeming with life made a very powerful \nimpression on me. These are the same multinational companies that have \naccess to the same kinds of technologies, and though they are operating \nin a vastly different regulatory regime, I was profoundly struck by the \nenvironmental legacy of oil development in another ecologically rich \ncoastal area.\n  For these reasons, I support my colleague from Connecticut. I \nappreciate the fundamental concern that we need to develop a new energy \nstrategy for this country. However, I disagree strongly when drilling \nwould occur in this particular location which I feel is deserving of \nwilderness designation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAYH (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 412. A bill to provide for a temporary Federal district judgeship \nfor the southern district of Indiana; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Richard Lugar to \nintroduce the Southern District of Indiana Temporary Judgeship Act. \nThis legislation creates an additional temporary judgeship for the \nSouthern District of Indiana to help ease the strain that has resulted \nfrom an extremely heavy caseload of civil and criminal litigation.\n  The Southern District is in dire need of an additional judge. Last \nyear, the District's caseload was much higher than the national average \nand greater than any other court in the Seventh Circuit. In fact, there \nwere 599 filings per judge, a number almost twenty percent greater than \nthe national average of 474.\n  In addition to an increase in the number of criminal cases filed in \nrecent years, the Federal Bureau of Prisons death row, located at the \nUnited States Penitentiary in Terre Haute, IN, is in the Southern \nDistrict and houses approximately twenty-one inmates currently under a \nfederal sentence of death. Hence, the Southern District also must be \nable to manage the habeas corpus petitions that are typically filed by \ndeath row inmates.\n  Further, our State capital of Indianapolis is located in this \ndistrict, and as a growing urban center, is significantly contributing \nto the number and complexity of the cases before the Southern District. \nFederal and local law enforcement are aggressively prosecuting drug \ncrimes, but if we expect them to succeed in making our communities \nsafer, we must give them the tools they need. An additional judgeship \nfor the Southern District would be one such tool.\n  There is wide support for an additional judgeship in this district. \nAs early as 1996, the Judicial Conference recommended to Congress that \nthe Southern District of Indiana receive a new temporary judgeship. In \n1999, the Judicial Conference again urged Congress to create a \ntemporary judgeship for this district. The legislation Senator Lugar \nand I introduce today follows this recommendation and aims to aid the \nSouthern District in the timely and efficient adjudication of its \ncases. I urge my colleagues to give this legislation their serious \nconsideration and support.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Evan Bayh to \nintroduce the Southern District of Indiana Temporary Judgeship Act. \nThis legislation will help remedy the strain experienced by the Federal \nCourt for the Southern District of Indiana from its extremely heavy \ncaseload.\n  The Southern District's caseload far exceeds the national average and \nis more than any other district court in the 7th Circuit. Indeed, the \nmost recent report of the Judicial Business of the United States Courts \nindicates that the Southern District had 599 filings per judge, \ncompared to a national average of 474. Over the last 10 years, the area \nof Indiana comprising the Southern District has seen explosive \npopulation growth, the designation of the penitentiary at Terre Haute, \nIN, as the place of confinement for those sentenced to death under \nfederal law, and a large increase in the amount of multi-district \nlitigation. Yet, despite these changes, Indiana has not had a new \njudgeship added since 1990. I am pleased, therefore, to join with \nSenator Bayh to help ensure that the delivery of justice is unimpeded.\n  There is wide agreement about the need for this additional judgeship, \nand the Judicial Conference of the United States has called upon \nCongress since 1996 to add a temporary judge to the Southern District. \nI urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 413. A bill to amend part F of title X of the Elementary Education \nAct of 1965 to improve and refocus civic education, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Education for \nDemocracy Act. I am pleased that the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd, has joined me as a cosponsor to reauthorize and \nimprove existing federally supported civic education programs.\n  ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution,'' has proven \nto be a successful program for teaching the principles of the \nConstitution.\n  Since 1985, the Center for Civic Education has administered the \nprogram. It is a rigorous course designed for high school civics \nclasses that provides teacher training using a national network of \nprofessionals as well as community and business leaders.\n  The most visible component of We the People, is the simulated \nCongressional hearings which are competitions at local, state and \nnational levels. The final round of this annual competition is held in \nan actual United States Senate or House of Representatives hearing \nroom, here in the Nation's Capital. I am proud that Ocean Springs High \nSchool will be representing Mississippi at this year's competition in \nApril.\n  The 32nd Annual Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup Poll of 2000 indicated that \npreparing students to become responsible citizens was one of the most \nimportant purposes of public schools. The popularity of We the People \nis demonstrated by the 82,000 teachers and the 26.5 million students \nwho have participated since its beginning.\n  Studies by the Education Testing Service have repeatedly indicated \nthat We the People participants outperform other students in every area \ntested. In one, We the People high school students outscored university \nsophomore and junior political science students in every topic.\n  A Stanford University study showed that these students develop a \nstronger attachment to political beliefs, attitudes and values \nessential to a functioning democracy than most adults and other \nstudents. Other studies reveal that We the People students are more \nlikely to register to vote and more likely to assume roles of \nleadership, responsibility and demonstrate civic virtue.\n\n[[Page S1705]]\n\n  In addition to We the People, this bill reauthorizes the Civitas \nInternational Civic Education Exchange Program, which links American \ncivic educators with counterparts in Eastern Europe and the states of \nthe former Soviet Union. This program is highly effective in building a \ncommunity with a common understanding of teaching and improving the \nstate of democracy education, worldwide.\n  Last year, Mississippi became the latest state to participate in this \nimportant international exchange program. Ms. Susie Burroughs, \nMississippi's Civic Education program director, joined the exchange \nprogram to Hungary and helped train Hungarian teachers in lessons of \ndemocracy. Under Ms. Burroughs direction, more Mississippi teachers \nthan ever began participation in the We the People program.\n  We the People and Civitas are preparing America's students and \nteachers to live and lead in the world by the standards and ideals set \nby our Founding Fathers.\n  I invite other Senators to cosponsor and support the Education for \nDemocracy Act.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to join my friend and colleague from \nMississippi, Senator Cochran, in introducing the Education for \nDemocracy Act.\n  The Education for Democracy Act re-authorizes grants to The Center \nfor Civic Education to provide a course of instruction on \nConstitutional principles and history and on the roles of State and \nlocal governments in the Federal system, and, in coordination with the \nNational Council on Economic Education, curriculum and teacher training \nprograms in civics, government, and economics for teachers from many \nforeign countries.\n  The strength of our democracy comes from the informed participation \nof citizens, whether voting in an election, spending time on jury duty, \nvolunteering for community service, or simply keeping aware of current \naffairs. The purpose of this bill is to improve the quality of civics \nand government education, and to educate students about the history and \nprinciples of the Constitution of the United States, including the Bill \nof Rights.\n  Thomas Jefferson said: ``I know of no safe depository of the ultimate \npowers of society but the people themselves, and if we think them not \nenlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome \ndiscretion, the remedy is not to take it from them but to inform their \ndiscretion.'' In addition to offering instruction in the core subject \nareas, it is essential that our schools prepare our children to be \ninformed, effective, and responsible citizens.\n  Comprehension of and commitment to democratic values is of particular \nconsequence for every American. The values, principles, and beliefs \nthat we share not only have provided a foundation for the stability of \nour government, they have spurred efforts by individuals and groups \nwhich have brought us closer to realizing our goal of liberty and \njustice for all.\n  College freshmen in 1999 demonstrated the lowest levels of political \ninterest in the 22-year history of surveys conducted by the Higher \nEducation Research Institute at the University of California at Los \nAngeles. That finding should serve as a warning to protect our \ndemocracy by ensuring that our children receive instruction in civic \neducation.\n  Our founding documents, the Declaration of Independence and the \nConstitution, proclaim that ultimate political authority rests with the \npeople, who have the power to create, alter, or abolish government. As \nwielders of such awesome power, it is imperative that the people, all \nthe people, be educated to exercise their power judiciously.\n  The programs for teachers from other countries also are of great \nimportance. America's greatness and power flow from our democratic \nprinciples. Exporting those principles will promote human rights and \nensure international stability.\n  Senator Domenici and I recently introduced the Strong Character for \nStrong Schools Act to help expand States' and schools' ability to make \ncharacter education, including civics education, a central part of \nevery child's education. I think that good citizenship is an essential \npart of good character, and I ask my colleagues to join Senator Cochran \nand me in support of the Education for Democracy Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \n        Inouye, and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 414. A bill to amend the National Telecommunications and \nInformation Administration Organization Act to establish a digital \nnetwork technology program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, last October the U.S. Department of \nCommerce published its latest report on Internet access in the United \nStates. According to the Department's Falling Through the Net: Toward \nDigital Inclusion, more Americans than ever are connected to the \nInternet and groups that have traditionally been digital ``have nots'' \nare making significant gains. Although a record number of Americans \nhave Internet access, the report concludes that a ``digital divide'' \nstill exists ``between those with different levels of income and \neducation, different racial and ethnic groups, old and young, single \nand dual-parent families, and those with and without disabilities.''\n  Increasing numbers of Americans are using the Internet to vote, shop, \npay bills, take education courses, and acquire new skills. Now more \nthan ever it is critical that all Americans have the tools necessary \nfor full participation in the Information Age economy. However, the \nCommerce report finds that in some cases, the digital divide has \nexpanded over the last 20 months. For example, the gap in Internet \naccess rates between African American households and the nation as a \nwhole is now 18 percent, 3 percent more than in December 1998. And the \ngap in Internet access between Hispanic households and the national \naverage is 17.9 percent, 4.3 percent more than it was 20 months ago.\n  America's higher education institutions are demonstrating similar \ntrends, persistent inequities in a generally improving picture. Last \nyear the Department of Commerce teamed up with the National Association \nfor Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, NAFEO, to undertake, for the \nfirst time ever, an in-depth study of Internet access at Historically \nBlack Colleges and Universities, HBCUs, across America. The result was \nthe landmark Historically Black Colleges and Universities: An \nAssessment of Networking and Connectivity. The report found that 98 \npercent of the 80 HBCUs surveyed had basic access to the Internet, \nWorld Wide Web, and campus networks. At the same time, however, the \nreport also found ``serious areas of digital divide in student access, \nhigh-speed connectivity and insufficient infrastructure.''\n  In particular, the Commerce study reported that fewer than 25 percent \nof HBCU students, or only 1 out of every 4, personally own computers, \ncompared to 49 percent of students in institutions of higher education \nas a whole. Further, only two HBCUs, or 3 percent, indicated that \nfinancial aid was available to help their students close the ``computer \nownership gap.'' In addition, half of the HBCU campuses surveyed did \nnot provide student access to computing resources at a critical \nlocation--the campus dormitory. And most of the campuses lacked high-\nspeed connectivity to the Internet and World Wide Web, a key area and \none that the report speculated may ``restrict HBCUs from making the \ndigital leap into the 21st Century.'' In regard to rural, private \nHBCUs, the Commerce report found ``a significant technology gap.''\n  There have been to date no published studies of Internet-connectivity \nat either Hispanic-Serving Institutions, HSIs, or Tribal Colleges and \nUniversities which are comparable to the October 2000 U.S. Department \nof Commerce report. Nevertheless, we have hard data which point to this \nalarming conclusion: Serious digital divide issues exist which affect \nthe ability of Minority-Serving Institutions, MSIs, to be competitive \nwith other institutions of higher learning in the Information Age. With \ntheir high level of poverty, and with only 8 percent of all American \nIndian households having Internet access, Jose C. de Baca, executive \ndirector of the American Indian Science and Technology Education \nConsortium, says that ``American Indians are the ethnic group most \nlikely to\n\n[[Page S1706]]\n\nbe caught on the wrong side of the digital divide.'' Tribal Colleges \noffer an important technology opportunity for these isolated American \nIndian reservation communities. However, studies show that while most \nU.S. universities need access to T-3 lines for necessary research and \ndata flow, only one Tribal College currently has access to that \nbandwidth. Moreover, less than half of the Tribal Colleges can access \nsmaller T-1 lines and this access is sporadic. In fact, many Tribal \nColleges are not even networked to provide intra-campus e-mail service \n(``Circle of Prosperity: A Vision for the Technological Future of \nTribal Colleges and American Indians'').\n  Similarly, Hispanic-Serving Institutions can have a powerful impact \non the Digital Divide in the Hispanic community, but in testimony to \nthe Congressional Web-based Education Commission, Dr. Antonio Perez, \nrepresenting the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, \nHACU, stated that there is an acute shortage of Hispanic faculty in the \nareas of information technology. According to the Computing Research \nAssociation Taulbee Survey of institutions granting doctoral degrees in \ncomputer science and computer engineering, only two percent of the \nComputer Science and one percent of the Computer Engineering Ph.D. \nrecipients were Hispanics for 1998-1999. Dr. Perez stated that this \nproportion ``typifies Hispanic and minority professional participation \nin Information Technology in general,'' and in his testimony he \nunderscored the need for federal assistance if Hispanic-Serving \nInstitutions are to become ``equal partners'' in this new Information \nAge.\n  In an effort to address the technology gap that exists at Minority-\nServing Institutions across the country, today I am joined by my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator Hollings, Senator Stevens, and \nSenator Inouye, in introducing the National Technology Instrumentation \nChallenge Act. This legislation would create a new grant program within \nthe Department of Commerce, the center of technological expertise and \ninnovation in the federal government. Our bill would provide up to $250 \nmillion to help Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-\nServing Institutions, and Tribal Colleges and Universities bridge the \nDigital Divide. The grant money could be used for such activities as \ncampus wiring, equipment upgrade, technology training, and hardware and \nsoftware acquisition. A Minority-Serving Institution, for example, \ncould use funds provided under this legislation to offer its students \nuniversal access to campus networks and computing resources. Or they \nmight choose to use their grant money to dramatically increase their \nconnectivity speed rates beyond the T-1 level. In sum, this legislation \noffers a significant opportunity for those institutions serving the \nlargest concentrations of the nation's minority students to keep pace \nwith the advancing technologies of the 21st Century.\n  In the ever expanding and always exciting world of the Information \nHighway, it should be our mandate to work to ensure that no one in this \ncountry is left behind, least of all our leaders of tomorrow. The \nNational Technology Instrumentation Challenge Act is a positive step in \ncreating digital opportunity for all students in America, in whose \nhands the future of this great nation rests. The legislation is \nendorsed by the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher \nEducation, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored \nPeople, the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, the \nAmerican Indian Higher Education Consortium, the Alliance for Equity in \nHigher Education, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the \nNational Indian Education Association, the Native Hawaiian Education \nAssociation, the National Indian School Board Association, the United \nNational Indian Tribal Youth, and the Atlanta University Center.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nthe letters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 414\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Max Cleland,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cleland: On behalf of the Alliance for Equity \n     in Higher Education--a national coalition of higher education \n     associations that serves over 320 member institutions and \n     educates more than one-third of all students of color in the \n     United States--we would like to extend our joint support and \n     appreciation for the ``National Technology Instrumentation \n     Challenge Act'' legislation.\n       The Alliance for Equity in Higher Education, which was \n     established in July 1999 by the American Indian Higher \n     Education Consortium (AIHEC), the Hispanic Association of \n     Colleges and Universities (HACU), and the National \n     Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education \n     (NAFEO), has identified the technology gap facing Tribal \n     Colleges and Universities (TCUs), Hispanic-Serving \n     Institutions (HSIs), and Historically and Predominantly Black \n     Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) as one of its primary \n     policy focuses. In fact, the Alliance is hosting an \n     interactive planning meeting at the end of this month to \n     explore the application of information technology at \n     minority-serving colleges and universities. Your legislation \n     will provide our students, faculty, and staff with the \n     essential skills and training in the use of technology, a \n     significant need on all our campuses.\n       As you know, among minority groups, the need to increase \n     the capacities of students and faculty as active participants \n     in the world of technology is paramount. For example, \n     approximately 75 percent of students attending 80 NAFEO-\n     member HBCUs indicated that they do not own their own \n     computers, and 85 percent of surveyed HBCUs do not offer \n     academic degrees through distance learning. Many TCUs cannot \n     even provide intra-campus email to students and faculty, and \n     only one TCU has access to a high speed bandwidth. In \n     addition, only 24 percent of Hispanic households had Internet \n     access in 2000, and HSIs serve a majority of Hispanic \n     students entering postsecondary education.\n       The Alliance for Equity in Higher Education appreciates you \n     spearheading this effort and encouraging our students and \n     institutions to be competitive players in the higher \n     education community as well as the 21st Century workforce. We \n     welcome the opportunity of offer our assistance in \n     championing this important initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n     Antonio Flores,\n       President, HACU.\n     Gerald Gipp,\n       Executive Director, AIHEC.\n     Henry Ponder,\n       President, NAFEO.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher \n           Education,\n                             Silver Spring, MD, February 14, 2001.\n     Hon. Max Cleland,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Dirksen Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cleland: On behalf of the National Association \n     for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO), we want to \n     thank you for introducing legislation which will help address \n     one of the greatest challenges facing the American \n     educational system today--the emerging digital divide between \n     students who have access to the information highway and those \n     who do not. We strongly support your legislation, the \n     National Technology Instrumentation Challenge Act, which \n     would provide an essential tool in bridging the growing high-\n     tech gap which exists for certain of this nation's \n     institutions of higher learning.\n       As revealed in a recent survey of 80 Historically Black \n     Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) by the U.S. Department of \n     Commerce and NAFEO, fifty percent of these institutions do \n     not have computers available in the location most accessible \n     to students, their dormitories. Additionally, most HBCUs do \n     not have high-speed connectivity to the Internet and World \n     Wide Web, and only three percent of these colleges and \n     universities indicated that financial aid was available to \n     help their students close the ``computer ownership gap.''\n       Making high tech grant money available to HBCUs, Hispanic-\n     serving institutions and tribal colleges and universities \n     would help these institutions acquire computers, wire their \n     campuses and provide technology training. In doing so, your \n     bill would provide these institutions with the opportunity to \n     become competitive with other colleges and universities in \n     the Information Age. The National Technology Instrumentation \n     Challenge Act would make a significant contribution by \n     helping to place the tools of tomorrow's technology into the \n     hands of tomorrow's leaders. Once again, we commend you on \n     the introduction of this important piece of legislation.\n       Thanks for all you do in ``keeping the doors of opportunity \n     open.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Henry Ponder,\n     CEO/President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            American Indian Higher\n\n\n                                         Education Consortium,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, February 2001.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the nation's 32 Tribal Colleges \n     and Universities that comprise the American Indian Higher \n     Education Consortium (AIHEC), we respectfully request your \n     support for legislation to be introduced by Senator Cleland \n     in the very near future. This legislation to be titled the \n     ``National Technology Instrumentation Challenge Act, will \n     establish a program within the Department of Commerce, \n     National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) to \n     fund Tribal Colleges and Universities, as well as \n     Historically Black College and Universities, Hispanic Serving \n     Institutions of Higher Education and Alaska Native and Native \n     Hawaiian educational organizations in an effort to teach \n     technology skills to both teachers and students.\n       Tribal Colleges serve remote, isolated American Indian \n     reservation communities, many of which are located on federal \n     trust lands, and therefore do not have the resources or tax \n     base to fully support a college. State governments provide \n     little or no funding, while the Federal government funds the \n     colleges at only slightly over half of the authorized level. \n     For many Tribal College students the next nearest college is \n     more than 100 miles away. With other priorities, such as \n     fixing leaky roofs and upgrading substandard wiring and \n     inadequate heating systems, it is nearly impossible to keep \n     pace with advancing technologies.\n       Among American Indian households, only 9 percent have \n     computers compared to 23.2 percent of African American \n     households, 25.5 percent of Hispanic and about 47 percent of \n     White Americans. For necessary research and information flow, \n     most US universities need access to T-3 lines. Currently, \n     only one Tribal College has access to that bandwidth. Many \n     Tribal Colleges are not even networked to provide intra-\n     campus e-mail service. Without financial help to secure the \n     proper facilities equipment and training, we will rapidly \n     fall behind in our ability to prepare our teachers and \n     students in uses of current and emerging technology systems.\n       AIHEC's 32 member colleges, 26,000 students and the 250 \n     tribal nations we serve are extremely grateful to Senator \n     Cleland for championing this effort and for your support. The \n     success of this legislation will be a tremendous step in \n     bringing the Tribal Colleges and other MSIs much needed \n     resources to prepare our students to compete in the workforce \n     of the 21st Century.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                Dr. James Shanley,\n     President, Fort Peck Community College.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   National Indian\n\n\n                                        Education Association,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA February 13, 2001.\n     Hon. Max Cleland,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Senator Cleland: The National Indian Education Association \n     (NIEA) is pleased to\n\n[[Page S1708]]\n\n     offer its support for the proposed ``National Technology \n     Instrumentation Challenge Act'' you intend to introduce \n     before Congress today. As a national advocate on behalf of \n     the education concerns of American Indians, Alaska Natives, \n     and Native Hawaiians, the National Indian Education \n     Association is pleased to see a legislative proposal that \n     targets one of the most pressing needs in Indian and Native \n     Hawaiian communities.\n       As administered by the Secretary of Commerce, the program \n     would empower minority institutions, including tribal \n     colleges and Alaska Native organizations, to carry out \n     national technology instrumentation programs. These programs \n     will teach technology skills to teachers and students in \n     uniquely rural and urban settings. Indian communities will \n     stand to benefit greatly from this initiative as they \n     struggle to meet the ever-increasing needs of their tribal \n     members. Experience has shown that reservation communities \n     often are the last segment of the population to benefit from \n     the power that technology can offer. These dollars will allow \n     for an equal playing field as our Indian institutions prepare \n     students for the challenges of the new millennium.\n       This legislation will also equip tribal and minority-\n     serving institutions with the tools, services and \n     infrastructure needed to teach the latest advancements in \n     technology as they relate to the student in the classroom. \n     Students have the uncanny ability to grasp the meaning of \n     technology faster than many adults and this endeavor captures \n     that youthful ability to learn.\n       We look forward to working with your office and the \n     Secretary of Commerce when this legislation becomes law. We \n     are also pleased to inform the Senator that we have gained \n     additional support for this legislation from three of our \n     national American Indian/Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian \n     partners. These include: The National Indian School Board \n     Association (NISBA); United National Indian Tribal Youth \n     (UNITY); and the Native Hawaiian Education Association \n     (NHEA).\n       Again, on behalf of the three thousand members of NIEA and \n     our educational partners, we look forward to a fruitful and \n     productive 107th Congress. Thank you for your support.\n           With Best Regards,\n                                                    John W. Cheek,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. \n        Grassley):\n  S. 415. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to require that \nair carriers meet public convenience and necessity requirements by \nensuring competitive access by commercial air carriers to major cities, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the time has come for the Congress to \nreally understand what is going on in the airline industry. It is an \nindustry that no longer competes. Passengers no longer matter. We are \nlike cattle in a stockade.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to restore the public's interest \nin our aviation system, to reclaim it from the carriers. Senator McCain \njoins me in sponsoring this bill.\n  We have spent countless hearings listening to various airline \nexecutives, government officials and expert witness talk about the \nproblems confronting the traveling public. it is time we put all of \nthat information and knowledge together to benefit the traveling \npublic.\n  Let's start with the hubs. There are twenty major airports, essential \nfacilities, where 1 carrier has more than fifty percent of the total \nenplaned passengers. Study after study has told us, warned us, that \nconcentrated hubs lead to higher fares, particularly for markets to \nthose hubs with no competition. Average fares are higher by 41 percent \naccording to DOT, and even higher for smaller, shorter haul markets, by \nas much as 54 percent. DOT estimates that for only 10 of the hubs, 24.7 \nmillion people are overcharged, and another 25 to 50 million choose not \nto fly because of high fares.\n  We have got to take a can opener and pry open the lids to the hubs, \nfor without competition, whatever benefits deregulation has brought, \nwill quickly fade away. Our legislation will ensure that other air \ncarriers have the ability to compete, the ability to provide people \nwith options, and the ability to threaten to serve every market out of \nthe dominated hubs. Gates, facilities and other assets will need to be \nprovided where they are unavailable, or where competition dictates a \nneed for such facilities. Dominant air carriers have relied upon \nFederal dollars to expand these facilities, and they have taken \nadvantage of those monies by establishing unregulated local monopolies. \nIt is time to use the power and leverage of the Federal government to \nrestore a balance to the marketplace.\n\n  Right now, the air carriers are attempting to dictate what the \nindustry will look like. If they are successful, all of the concerns \nraised by countless studies, will not only be realized, but they will \nbe exacerbated. The public's needs, the public's convenience, are \nsomething that must be first and foremost as we watch this industry \nevolve.\n  Airline deregulation forced the carriers to compete on price for a \nwhile, but not on service. Congress had to threaten legislation in 1999 \nbefore the airlines even began to even understand the depth of consumer \nanger towards the airlines. Today though, they no longer compete on \nprice. Instead, they seek to acquire one another to create massive \nsystems, perhaps only three will survive, leaving us all far worse \ntomorrow than we are today. And clearly today, we are not getting what \nis needed.\n  What are the facts: United wants to buy US Airways, and create DC \nAir. American want to buy TWA, a failing company with a hub in St. \nLouis, and then American wants to buy a part of US Airways. Continental \nand Delta have a 25 year marketing relations, and Delta, Continental \nand Northwest are all eying other deals.\n  Right now there are 20 major cities where one carrier effectively \ncontrols airline service. Department of Transportation, General \nAccounting Office, National Research Council and others have all \ndocumented abuses, high fares, market dominance, hoarding of facilities \nat airports so other carriers can not enter, and let's not forget poor \nservice. It must stop. It is not enough for the antitrust laws to look \nat each transaction in a vacuum. The public's interest, its needs, and \nits convenience must be reasserted.\n  DOT, in its January 2001 study, made three key observations:\n\n       The facts are clear. Without the presence of effective \n     price competition, network carriers charge much higher prices \n     and curtail capacity available to price sensitive passengers \n     at the hubs. . . . With effective price competition, \n     consumers benefit from both better service and lower fares, \n     citing Atlanta and Salt Lake City as examples where a low \n     cost carrier is able to provide competition to a dominant hub \n     carrier.\n       The key to eliminating market power and fare premiums is to \n     encourage entry into as many uncontested markets as possible.\n       . . . barriers to entry at dominated hubs are most \n     difficult to surmount considering the operational and \n     marketing leverage a network carrier has in it hub markets.\n\n  In its 1999 study, the Department stated most clearly what we are \ntrying to achieve:\n\n       Moreover, unless there is reasonable likelihood that a new \n     entrant's short term and long term needs for gates and other \n     facilities will be met, it may simply decide not to serve a \n     community.--FAA/OST Task Force Study, October 1999, at page \n     iii.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 415\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of American in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Aviation Competition \n     Restoration Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The airline industry continues to evolve into a system \n     dominated by a few large air carriers and a handful of \n     smaller, niche air carriers. Absent Congressional action, \n     access to critical markets is likely to be foreclosed.\n       (2) In testimony before the Commerce Committee in 1978, the \n     then-President of Eastern Airlines testified that the top 5 \n     air carriers had 68.6 percent of the domestic market. If the \n     mergers and acquisitions proposed in 2000 and 2001 are \n     consummated, the 5 largest network airlines in the United \n     States will account for approximately 83 percent of the air \n     transportation business (based on revenue passenger miles \n     flown in 1999).\n       (3) According to Department of Transportation statistics, \n     taking into account the proposed mergers of United Airlines \n     and US Airways, and of American Airlines and TWA, there will \n     be at least 20 large hub airports in the United States where \n     a single airline and its affiliate air carriers would carry \n     more than 50 percent of the passenger traffic.\n       (4) The continued consolidation of the airline industry may \n     inure to the detriment of public convenience and need, and \n     the further concentration of market power in the\n\n[[Page S1709]]\n\n     hands of even fewer large competitors may lead to unfair \n     methods of competition.\n       (5) A more concentrated airline industry would be likely to \n     result in less competition and higher fares, giving consumers \n     fewer choices and decreased customer service.\n       (6) The Department of Transportation has documented that \n     air fares are relatively higher at those main hub airports \n     where a single airline carries more than 50 percent of the \n     passenger traffic, and studies indicate that unfair methods \n     of competition are more likely to occur at such airports, \n     thus inhibiting competitive responses from other carriers \n     when fares are raised or capacity reduced.\n       (7) The General Accounting Office has conducted a number of \n     studies that document the presence of both high fares and \n     problems with competition in the airline industry at \n     dominated hub airports.\n       (8) The National Research Council of the Transportation \n     Research Board has recognized that higher fares exist in \n     short haul markets connected to concentrated hub airports.\n       (9) A Department of Transportation study indicates that the \n     entry and existence of low fare airline competitors in the \n     marketplace has resulted in a reported $6.3 billion in annual \n     savings to airline passengers.\n       (10) While the antitrust rules generally govern mergers and \n     acquisitions in the air carrier industry, and will continue \n     to do so, the public concern about the importance of air \n     transportation, the impact of over scheduling, increasing \n     flight delays and cancellations, poor service, and continued \n     hub domination requires the Department of Transportation to \n     assert its authority in analyzing proposed transactions among \n     air carriers that affect consumers.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Competition enhancement program''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I join my colleague, Senator \nHollings, in introducing the Aviation Competition Restoration Act. This \nlegislation would give the Department of Transportation additional \nauthority to review airline industry mergers and to enhance competition \nand access at dominated hub airports. If Congress does not act quickly \nto address the problems of industry consolidation and the reduction in \nmeaningful competition, consumers will suffer as air fares inevitably \nincrease and choices decline.\n  Not since deregulation of the airline industry have we faced such a \ncritical point in the history of air transportation in this country. We \nare closer than ever to seeing an industry totally dominated by three \nmega-airlines. Last year, United proposed purchasing US Airways. \nEarlier this year, American Airlines announced that it would purchase a \nfaltering TWA and join with United to carve up US Airways. Since then, \nDelta and Continental have talked about some type of combination if the \nother mergers occur. These developments do not bode well for consumers.\n  I recognize that there may be some benefits to these mergers. But the \nharm that will be inflicted on consumers far outweighs any gains. As \nthe number of competitors dwindles, air travelers are almost certain to \nget squeezed. The Commerce Committee has held numerous hearings since \nthe first deal was announced. I continue to believe that these \nproposals are not good for the consumer.\n  Last year, the Commerce Committee approved a Senate Resolution \nexpressing deep concern about the proposed United-US Airways deal. \nExpressions of\n\n[[Page S1711]]\n\nconcern are no longer enough. We must act to ensure that the Executive \nBranch has the tools to thoroughly evaluate these proposals and their \neffect on competition. We must also give them the tools to effectuate a \nmore competitive environment. The Airline Competition Restoration Act \nwould give the Department the authority to ensure that carriers have \ncompetitive access to critical airport markets by reallocating gates, \nfacilities and other assets used or controlled by an air carrier prior \nto approving a merger or in other non-competitive circumstances.\n  This bill is just one piece of a potential solution to the tremendous \nproblems that air travelers face on a daily basis. More people are \nflying now than ever before. That means that more people are affected \nby the lack of capacity, antiquated air traffic control, and over \nscheduling that continue to plague aviation travel. We had 674 million \npeople fly last year. That number is expected to reach one billion \nwithin 10 years. One billion air travelers in a system that has \nbasically reached gridlock today should be of great concern to all of \nus.\n  This is not a partisan issue. This is not a rural or urban issue. \nThis is an issue that affects the business traveler and the leisure \ntraveler. We must act to enhance competition and prevent further \ngridlock and delay in our aviation system. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to try and address these issues in the coming \nmonths.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 416. A bill to amend the Consumer Product Safety Act to confirm \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission's jurisdiction over child safety \ndevices for handguns, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, along \nwith Senator DeWine, Senator Boxer, and Senator Kohl, that will set \nminimum standards for gun safety locks. Discussion is swirling around \nthe U.S. Congress, in state legislatures throughout the country, and in \nour cities and towns about the use of handgun safety locks to prevent \nchildren from gaining access to dangerous weapons. To date, eighteen \nstates have Child Access Protection, or CAP laws in place, which permit \nprosecution of adults if their firearm is left unsecured and a child \nuses that firearm to harm themselves or others.\n  An important element that is largely missing from the debate over the \nvoluntary or required use of gun safety locks is the quality and \nperformance of these locks. Mr. President, a gun lock will only keep a \ngun out of a child's hands if the lock works. There are many cheap, \nflimsy locks on the market that are easily overcome by a child. There \nare 12 safety standards for every toy, but there is not even a single \nsafety standard for a gun lock.\n  Earlier this month the Consumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC, and \nthe National Sport Shooting Foundation announced a voluntary recall of \n400,000 gun safety locks that were distributed by Project HomeSafe, a \nnationwide program whose purpose is to promote safe firearms handling \nand storage practices through distribution of gun locks and safety \neducation messages. And last July the CPSC and MasterLock joined \ntogether in another voluntary recall of 752,000 gun locks. Both of the \ngun locks recalled could be easily opened with paper clips, tweezers, \nor by banging it on a table. When testing gun locks to replace the \nrecalled locks, the CPSC found that all but two of the 32 locks tested \ncould be opened without a key. I find this astonishing. Millions of \nAmericans have come to depend on gun locks as a way to prevent their \nchildren from gaining access to a handgun, and it is extremely \ndisturbing to learn that so many locks could be overcome.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today requires the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission to set minimum regulations for safety locks \nand to remove unsafe locks from the market. Our legislation empowers \nconsumers by ensuring that they will only purchase high-quality lock \nboxes and trigger locks. The legislation does not require the use of \ngun safety locks. It only requires that gun safety locks meet minimum \nstandards. The legislation does not regulate handguns. It applies only \nto after-market, external gun locks.\n  Storing firearms safely is an effective and inexpensive way to \nprevent the needless tragedies associated with unintentional firearm-\nrelated death and injury. And I am pleased that several states, \nincluding my home state of Massachusetts, have required the use of gun \nsafety locks. During the 106th Congress, the Senate passed an amendment \nthat would require the use of gun safety locks by a vote of 78-20.\n  While I am encouraged by this trend of increasing the use of gun \nsafety locks, I am genuinely concerned that with the hundreds of \ndifferent types of gun locks on the market today it is difficult, \nprobably impossible, for consumers to be assured that the lock they \npurchase will be effective. In early February President Bush announced \nthe Administration's support for a five-year, $75 million-a-year \nfederal program to distribute free gun locks to every gun owner. I \ncommend the President's proposal to distribute free gun locks, but \nbelieve that it is critically important that the locks function as \nintended.\n  The latest data released by the Centers for Disease Control in 1999 \nrevealed that accidental shootings accounted for 7 percent of child \ndeaths and that more than 300 children died in gun accidents, almost \none child every day. A study in the Archives of Pediatric and \nAdolescent Medicine found that 25 percent of 3- to 4- year olds and 70 \npercent of 5- to 6- year olds had sufficient finger strength to fire \n59, or 92 percent, of the 64 commonly available handguns examined in \nthe study. Accidental shootings can be prevented by simple safety \nmeasures, one of which is the use of an effective gun safety lock.\n  The Senate has been gridlocked over the issue of gun control. And you \ncan be sure that young lives have been needlessly lost due to our \ninaction. This legislation, which I truly believe every Senator can \nsupport, would make storing a gun in the home safer by ensuring safety \ndevices are effective. It would empower consumers. And most importantly \nit would protect children and decrease the numbers of accidental \nshootings in this country.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nthe Gun Lock Consumer Protection Act being introduced by my friend from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry. I support this bill because I believe it \nwill save lives.\n  Recently, we have all borne witness to a disturbing trend. \nIncreasingly, we are hearing shocking news reports that another child \nhas died because of his or her access to a loaded, unlocked firearm. In \n1999 alone, this was an almost daily occurrence. Last year, more than \n300 children died in gun accidents. Most of these accidents occurred in \na child's own home, or the home of a close friend or relative. Places \nwhere these children should feel the safest.\n  The mixture of children and loaded firearms is certainly extremely \ncombustible. An estimated 3.3 million children in the United States \nlive in homes with firearms that are always or sometimes kept loaded \nand unlocked. Now, I believe that the majority of parents with firearms \nbelieve they are being responsible about gun storage and other safety \nmeasures dealing with firearms. But, the fact is that, some parents \nhave a fundamental misunderstanding of a child's ability to gain access \nto and fire a gun, distinguish between real and toy guns, make good \njudgements about handling a gun, and consistently following rules about \ngun safety. In fact, nearly two-thirds of parents with school-age \nchildren who keep a gun in the home believe that the firearm is safe \nfrom their children. However, one study found that when a gun was in \nthe home, 75 to 80 percent of first and second graders knew where the \ngun was kept.\n  Many gun owners, State and local governments, as well as this Senate, \nhave begun to recognize the combustible relationship between children \nand loaded, accessible firearms. This recognition has led many gun \nowners to purchase gun safety locks to ensure safe storage of their \nhandguns and to prevent children from gaining access to weapons. In \nsome States, gun locks are required at the time handguns are purchased. \nAt least seventeen States have laws that require or encourage the use \nof gun locks that deter child access to handguns. And, finally, the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S1712]]\n\npassed an amendment to the juvenile justice bill last Congress that \nwould require the use of gun safety locks.\n  Despite the facts that gun owners are buying more firearm safety \ndevices and governments are rushing to mandate their use, there are no \nminimal safety standards for these devices. There are many different \ntypes of trigger locks, safety locks, lock boxes, and other devices \navailable. There is a wide range in the quality and effectiveness of \nthese devices. Some are inadequate to prevent the accidental discharge \nof the firearm or to prevent a child access to the firearm.\n  As governments move toward mandated safety devices, I believe it is \nimportant that consumers know that the device they are buying is \nactually adequate to serve its intended purpose. If States are going to \nprosecute adults when a child uses a firearm, these gun owners should \nhave at least some peace of mind that their gun storage or safety lock \ndevice is adequate.\n  Many of the safety lock devices currently on the market will not \nprovide that peace of mind. Over the past year, the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission has tested thirty-two different lock devices. Thirty \ndid not work as they were intended to work. In other words, 90 percent \nof the lock devices tested by the CPSC do not work! To date, CPSC has \nworked with two organizations to recall faulty locks. Because of the \norganizations' willingness to work with the CPSC, over 1.1 million \nsafety locks have been recalled and replaced.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with Senator Kerry would help \nresponsible gun owners and parents know that the safety device they are \nbuying is at least minimally adequate. This legislation is just common \nsense. It simply requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC, \nto formulate minimum safety standards for gun safety locks and to \nensure that only adequate locks meeting that standard are available for \npurchase by consumers. The standard to be used by the Commission \nrequires that gun safety locks are sufficiently difficult for children \nto deactivate or remove and that the safety locks prevent the discharge \nof the handgun unless the lock has been deactivated or removed.\n  It is important to note what this bill does not do. First of all, it \ndoes not give CPSC any say in standards of firearms or ammunition. In \nother words, it is not intended to regulate firearms themselves in any \nway whatsoever. Second, it will not have the effect of mandating what \ngun lock device is used. As I said earlier, there are many different \ntypes of gun locks currently available. Some of these allow for easy \naccess and use of firearms for adults should they decide that is \nimportant to them. Other devices are more cumbersome and do not provide \nquick and easy access. Gun owners would be free to decide what device \nis best for them. This legislation would have no effect on that issue. \nFinally, this legislation does not require the use of gun safety locks. \nWhile the Senate has already passed legislation to do this, if that \nlanguage is removed in conference, this legislation will not affect \nthat.\n  As I said earlier, I support this legislation because I believe it \nwill save lives. But, more than that, this legislation will empower \nparents who decide that they want to have a gun safety lock but are \nawash in a sea of different devices, to purchase only gun safety locks \nthat provide adequate protection for their children. I urge my \ncolleagues to join Senator Kerry and I in support of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 418. A bill to repeal the reduction in the deductible portion of \nexpenses for business meals and entertainment, to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to repeal \nthe current 50 percent tax deduction for business meals and \nentertainment expenses, and to restore the tax deduction to 80 percent \ngradually over a five-year period. Restoration of this deduction is \nessential to the livelihood of small and independent businesses as well \nas the food service, travel, tourism, and entertainment industries \nthroughout the United States. These industries are being economically \nharmed as a result of the 50 percent tax deduction.\n  The business meals and entertainment expenses deduction was reduced \nfrom 80 percent to 50 percent, in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act \nof 1993, and went into effect on January 1, 1994. Its results have been \ndetrimental to small businesses, the self-employed, and independent and \ntraveling sales representatives. These groups rely on one-on-one \nmeetings, usually during meals, for their marketing strategy, and the \nreduction of the business meals and entertainment deduction has \nimpacted their marketing efforts.\n  Many small business organizations have shown their support for an \nincrease in this deduction. The National Restaurant Association, \nNational Federation of Independent Business, National Employees and \nRestaurant Employees International Union, National Association of the \nSelf-Employed, and the American Hotel and Motel Association, have all \nspoken of the need for the reestablishment of the 80 percent deduction \nfor business meal and entertainment expenses.\n  For example, traveling and independent sales representatives incur \nsubstantial travel and entertainment expenses from spending, annually, \nan average of 150 nights on the road. Home-based businesses also rely \nheavily on meeting with clients outside of the home and over meals. \nSuch businesses have been harmed by the reduction of this deduction to \n50 percent.\n  Currently, there are approximately 23.2 million persons who spend \nmoney on business meals in the U.S., down from 25.3 million in 1989. \nThe total economic impact on small businesses of restoring the business \nmeal deduction from 50 percent to 80 percent ranges from $5 to $690 \nmillion, depending on the state.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to study \nthe suitability and feasibility of designating the Abel and Mary \nNicholson House, Elsinboro Township, Salem County, New Jersey, as a \nunit of the National Park System, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto recognize the historical significance of the Abel and Mary Nicholson \nHouse, located in Salem County New Jersey. I am pleased to have Senator \nCorzine join me in this important effort, and would like to announce \nthat Congressman LoBiondo will introduce companion legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  The Nicholson House was built in 1722 and is a rate surviving example \nof an early 18th century patterned brick building. It is a classic \nexample of architecture of this period. The original portion of the \nhouse has survived for over 280 years with only routine maintenance. It \nis a unique resource which\n\n[[Page S1713]]\n\ncan provide significant opportunities for studying our nation's history \nand culture. As one of the most significant ``first period'' houses \nsurviving in the Delaware Valley, the Nicholson House represents a \npiece of history from both Southern New Jersey and early American life.\n  In addition, it is situated in an area known for its early American \neconomy. Delaware Bay schooners patrolled the waters of the Delaware \nRiver throughout the 18th and 19th centuries harvesting clams and \noysters. This industry was an integral part of the region's economy, \nand contribute to the culture and history of New Jersey.\n  The site is listed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places, as \nwell as the National Register of Historic Places. In addition, the \nNational Park Service recognized the importance and historical value of \nthe this site by designating the Nicholson House and a National \nHistoric Landmark.\n  The Salem County Historical society and the Salem County Department \nof Economic Development both endorse the establishment of a national \npark at this site. A national park would encourage ecotourism in the \narea and spur economic growth. In addition, the site is located at the \nsouthern end of the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail. This theme trail \nruns along the New Jersey coastline and introduces visitors to the \nregion and encourages them to take full advantage of the many natural \nand cultural attractions. The Nicholson House National Park would be \nthe southern anchor of this interpretive trail and would enhance \ntourism and understanding of the culture and history of the region.\n  This area is truly a valuable asset to the State of New Jersey, and I \nfeel it is only proper to share this wonderful resource with the entire \nnation by establishing the Nicholson House as a unit of the National \nPark Service, (NPS).\n  The Federal Government has already acknowledge the significance of \nthe Nicholson House, by designating the area a national historic \nlandmark. Establishing it as a unit of the NPS would increase the \npresence the site, and the NPS would provide staff and tours, and allow \nfor a better, more educational interpretation.\n  My legislation would take the first step towards this important \ndesignation by directing the NPS to study the feasibility of \nestablishing a national park at the Nicholson House. I ask that my \ncolleagues join me in support of this worthy effort, so that an \nimportant element of our culture may be preserved for future \ngenerations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/28/senate-section/article/S1713-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 31--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                  AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION AND FORESTRY\n\n  Mr. LUGAR submitted the following resolution; from the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, which was referred to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Commerce \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. 29, and \nthe Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Res. 29) honoring Dale Earnhardt and \n     expressing condolences of the U.S. Senate to his family on \n     his death.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, last October, Dale Earnhardt drove his \nfamiliar black Goodwrench Chevrolet, with the silver No. 3 painted on \neach side, past a waving checkered flag to win the Winston 500 at \nTalladega Superspeedway. The victory was Earnhardt's tenth first place \nNASCAR Winston Cup race at Talladega, a feat no other driver has \naccomplished. It was the 76th win of his career; sadly, it was his \nlast.\n  A week ago Sunday, Dale Earnhardt died in a tragic accident on the \nlast turn of the last lap of one of the last\n\n[[Page S1720]]\n\ngreat American traditions, the Daytona 500. NASCAR lost one of its \ngreatest drivers who was in large part responsible for the tremendous \ngrowth of the sport from a regional pastime to an international \nsuccess. Winston Cup drivers lost a fierce competitor whose aggressive \nstyle set the standard for a generation. Millions of fans lost the \n``Intimidator,'' a hero admired as much for his charismatic demeanor as \nhis talent as a driver and tenacity during a race. Whether you cheered \nfor him or against him, you couldn't help but admire the passion with \nwhich he pursued the checkered flag.\n  There is a bittersweet irony in that Dale Earnhardt finished his \ncareer at Daytona. The track at Daytona defined Earnhardt as a racer. \nHe won 34 races there, more than any other driver. This earned him the \nreputation as the best superspeedway racer of all time. The \nIntimidator, however, did not win the Daytona 500 until the 1998 \nseason. It took 20 years, but he finally took the greatest of all \nsuperspeedway races.\n  No other measure of success was as elusive to Dale Earnhardt. In \n1979, he beat Harry Gant, Terry Labonte, and Joe Milliken for the \nRookie of the Year in one of the most competitive rookie battles ever. \nHe joined Richard Petty as the only other driver to win the NASCAR \nWinston Cup Championship seven times. He was voted National Motorsports \nPress Association Driver of the Year five times. Dale Earnhardt was the \nonly driver to win the Winston Cup title the year after winning the \nrookie title.\n  Although he did his best to live up to his nickname the \n``Intimidator'' during a race, Dale Earnhardt was the first to extend a \nhand and offer congratulations after it was over. This is the mark of a \ntrue champion.\n  Dale Earnhardt often expressed frustration at the practice of NASCAR \nto require artificial devices to reduce speeds on some tracks and the \ntype of racing it produced. Nevertheless, he excelled at these so-\ncalled restrictor-plate races. In fact, Dale Earnhardt mastered the \ndraft so well at these races that the fellow racers he passed remarked, \n``it was like he can see air.''\n  In Alabama, we look forward to seeing the black No. 3 car on the high \nbanks at Talladega twice a year. No matter where he started at the \nbeginning of the race, you could count on Dale Earnhardt to be near the \nfront by the end. His victories at the world's biggest and fastest \ntrack include, as I mentioned earlier, ten NASCAR Winston Cup races, as \nwell as one NASCAR Busch Grand national race and three IROC races where \nhe bested the greatest drivers of his time.\n  Dale Earnhardt was intensely loyal to his family. He was a father \nwhose pride in his children was greater than his desire in winning \nraces. Our thoughts are with his wife Teresa, and his children: Kerry, \nKelly, Dale, Jr. and Taylor Nicole. May God bless all of them and watch \nover them in this time of need.\n  Former driver and now television analyst Darrell Waltrip perhaps best \ncaptured the sentiment of drivers and fans alike when he said, ``The \nscariest thing on the track used to be seeing Dale Earnhardt in your \nrear view mirror. Now the scariest thing is not seeing him there at \nall.''\n  The world will miss Dale Earnhardt and his competitive spirit. We \npray that his family and friends find some comfort in the way his fans \nadmired this truly unique American sports icon.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today we stand and honor the life and \naccomplishments of ``The Man'' Dale Earnhardt.\n  Millions of Americans will remember him as a NASCAR legend, perhaps \nthe best that ever raced. But the people I've spoken with and read \nabout who knew him well remember better a kind father, a loving \nhusband, and a trusted friend.\n  For over 21 years, Dale Earnhardt delighted hundreds of thousands of \npeople at the Dover Downs, International Speedway in my state of \nDelaware. Like most of the places Dale raced, at Dover Downs he won, \nand won big.\n  But the people of my State honor him for more than his wins at our \nNASCAR track, three first-place finishes, or the money he earned there, \nthe most of any Winston Cup driver in history.\n  The reverence and respect from NASCAR fans stems from his constant \npursuit of excellence and his refusal to give less than his all every \ntime he took to the track.\n  They called him ``The Intimidator,'' and on the track, that was true, \nbut to the fans in Dover that he spent time with signing autographs, \nshaking hands, and in some cases sharing dinner at their kitcken table, \nDale Earnhardt was known as ``The Man.''\n  Last Friday, Dover Downs opened up to those who needed a chance to \nsay ``good bye.'' Even though a blizzard had blown through our State \nthe night before, over 5,000 people turned out to pay their respects. \nIn a moving display of affection, families created in the winner's \ncircle a shrine of flowers, posters, hats, pictures, and poems honoring \ntheir hero.\n  I was told once that the greatest measures of a man's life are the \npeople he has touched, the difference he has made and the standards he \nhas set for others to follow.\n  Despite his passing, Dale Earnhardt's legacy of excellence will \nforever influence his sport and its millions of fans. We honor him \ntoday for the lives he touched and the Children he inspired.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
