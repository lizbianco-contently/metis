I think it is fair to say if this is not \noffered by Senator Murkowski or someone of his choosing, either I or \nsomeone else will offer it. ANWR must come before the Senate and we \nmust debate this issue; I hope everyone understands. Whoever wants to \noffer it wants it just right, and I think the just right time has \narrived. We need to have this amendment before the Senate. As was \nindicated yesterday, it may become necessary to offer the same language \nin the House bill so we can get this debate underway and this \nlegislation completed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/11/senate-section/article/S2507-8", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2507-S2516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATIONAL LABORATORIES PARTNERSHIP IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to open the debate on the \nso-called renewable fuels or ethanol mandate in the Senate energy bill. \nI strongly believe the fuel provisions in this legislation are \negregious public policy, that they amount to a wish list for the \nethanol industry, and the Senate has to consider the impact of these \nprovisions on the rest of the Nation.\n  Frankly, I believe it is terrible public policy. Frankly, I believe \nthis amounts to a wealth transfer of literally billions of dollars from \nevery State in the Nation to a handful of ethanol producers. Frankly, I \nbelieve this mandate amounts to a new gas tax in the Nation.\n  Here are my objections to the renewable fuels requirement in the \nSenate energy bill: First, despite limited clean air benefits, the \nmandate will almost triple the amount of ethanol in our Nation's fuel.\n  Second, even if States do not use this ethanol, they are required--\nforced--to pay for it anyway.\n  Third, forcing more ethanol into gasoline will only drive prices up \nat the pump.\n  Fourth, since over 98 percent of the production capacity of ethanol \nis based in the Midwest, it is extremely difficult to transport large \namounts of ethanol to States where it is not produced.\n  Fifth, I am very concerned the limited number of ethanol suppliers in \nthe United States will be able to exercise their market power and drive \nup price. This is exactly what happened last year in the West when \nelectricity and natural gas prices soared due to supply manipulation by \nout-of-State energy companies.\n  Sixth, there may not be enough ethanol produced in the United States \nto meet future demand.\n  Seventh, almost tripling the amount of ethanol we produce raises \nserious health and environmental questions. Tripling it is a big step \ninto the unknown, environmentally and health-wise. I hope to show this \nin my remarks.\n  Finally, because ethanol is subsidized, mandating more of it will \ndivert money from the highway trust fund. What I mean by this is there \nis a 5.4-cent-per-gallon tax credit for ethanol that will continue to \ndivert more and more resources to ethanol instead of the highway trust \nfund where every State gets its essential resources to reduce traffic \ncongestion and improve the safety of roads and bridges.\n  Let me explain each objection, one at a time. Let me begin by talking \nabout my concerns with mandating more ethanol than is needed. This bill \nforces California, my State, to use 2.68 billion gallons of ethanol \nover the 9 years it does not need to meet clean air standards.\n  Look at this chart. The red is the amount of ethanol California will \nbe forced to use from 2004 to 2012 under the mandate in the Senate \nenergy bill. The blue is the amount of ethanol we would use without the \nmandate, largely in the winter months in the southern California \nmarket.\n  Here you see, to meet clean air standards, by 2004, we will be forced \nto use 126 million gallons. This bill forces us to use 276 million \ngallons in 2004 and it forces us to use 312 million gallons in 2005 and \nit ratchets up every year until we are forced to use, by the end of \nthis mandate, 600 million gallons of ethanol in 2012 when we only need \nto use 143 million gallons to meet clean air standards.\n\n  What kind of public policy would do that? What kind of public policy \nwould require a State to use a dramatic amount more of ethanol, an \nuntested health and environmental additive to gasoline, that it doesn't \nreally need? Is that good public policy? I do not think it is.\n  What makes it even more egregious--and the reason I use the word \n``egregious'' is if we do not use it, if we trade it, we are forced to \npay for it anyway. That is the massive transfer of wealth that takes \nplace under this amount. No one knows how much more consumers will be \nforced to pay, but a recent study by the Department of Energy indicates \nthat prices will increase 4 to 10 cents a gallon across the United \nStates if this ethanol mandate becomes law.\n  A study sponsored by the California Energy Commission indicates that \nin a State such as California, where ethanol is not produced, gas \nprices could double and even reach $4 per gallon. This chart shows the \nreal hazard this mandate is on both coasts. In California, where it is \nestimated the price increase is .096 cents per gallon. Then in other \nstates: Connecticut, it will increase the price of gasoline 9 cents a \ngallon; Delaware, 9 cents a gallon; New Hampshire, 8 cents a gallon; \nNew Jersey, 9 cents a gallon; New York, 7 cents a gallon; Pennsylvania, \n5 cents a gallon; Rhode Island, 9 cents a gallon; Virginia, 7 cents a \ngallon; Massachusetts, 9 cents a gallon; Missouri, 5 cents a gallon--\nand on and on and on. This is bad public policy.\n  California does not have the infrastructure in place to be able to \ntransport large amounts of ethanol into the State, therefore any \nshortfall of supply--either because of manipulation or raw market \nforces--will be exacerbated because the State will be reliant on \nethanol from another area of the United States.\n  According to a recent report issued by the GAO, over 98 percent of \nthe U.S. ethanol production capacity is located in the Midwest. Here it \nis: In the West, 10 million gallons--that is all we produce; in the \nRocky Mountain region, 12 million gallons; the South, here, 15 million \ngallons; and the east coast, 4 million gallons.\n  In the Midwest, which is the big beneficiary of this ethanol \nmandate--nobody should doubt that--they produce 2.27 billion gallons of \nethanol. So the ethanol is all produced in the Midwest.\n  There is only one ethanol plant in California today, so it is going \nto be impossible for California to respond to any ethanol shortage. As \nthe GAO reports:\n\n       Ethanol imports from other regions are vital. However, any \n     potential price spike could be exacerbated if it takes too \n     long for supplies from out-of-State (primarily the Midwest \n     where virtually all the production capacity is located) to \n     make their way to California.\n\n  Since there is no quick or effective way to send ethanol to \nCalifornia as of yet, more time is needed to develop the proper ethanol \ndelivery infrastructure. One of the amendments I will be sending to the \ndesk essentially delays the beginning of this by an additional year to \ngive us the time to get the infrastructure.\n  This is why it is important. Because moisture causes ethanol to \nseparate from gasoline, this fuel additive cannot be shipped through \ntraditional gasoline pipelines. So it needs a whole new infrastructure. \nEthanol needs to be transported separately by truck, by boat, and by \nrail, and blended into gasoline after arrival. Unfortunately, this \nmakes the 1- to 3-week delivery time from the Midwest to either coast--\neither to California and the west coast, or to the east coast--\ndependent upon good weather conditions as well as\n\n[[Page S2509]]\n\navailable ship, truck, and train equipped to handle large amounts of \nethanol. Again, this is a tripling of the ethanol use in America over \nthe next 9 years.\n  I believe everyone outside of the Midwest will have to grapple with \nhow to bring ethanol to their States. According to the California \nEnergy Commission:\n\n       The adequacy of logistics to deliver large volumes of \n     ethanol to California on a consistent basis--\n\n  This is the key. Gasoline is sold every day. You can't just import it \nonce and then forget it for 3 weeks. Every single day on a consistent \nbasis is uncertain.\n  A recent report sponsored by the same energy commission predicts that \nthere will be future logistical problems since the gasoline supply is \ncurrently constrained with demand exceeding the existing infrastructure \ncapacity.\n  This means that California is already at its refining capacity. It is \nactually at about 98 percent of refining capacity. If there is \ninsufficient transportation infrastructure to ship large amounts, this \njust makes the problem worse.\n  I don't see any way for California to avoid experiencing a new energy \ncrisis. This one would be a direct result of an unnecessary Federal \nrequirement that increases our mandatory use of ethanol far beyond what \nwe need to use to meet the clean air standard.\n  The fact that there are limited numbers of suppliers in the ethanol \nmarket reminds me of the situation with electricity a year ago when \nprices soared in the West because of a few out-of-State generating \nfirms dominating the market. What do I mean by that?\n  According to the GAO, the largest ethanol producer is Archer Daniels \nMidland. That is this company. They have a 41-percent share of the \nethanol market. The entire ethanol market really consists of these \ncompanies: Minnesota Corn Producers, 6 percent; Williams Bio-Energy, 6 \npercent; Cargill, 5 percent; High Plains Corporation, 4 percent; New \nEnergy Corporation, 4 percent; Midwest Grain, 3 percent; and, Chief \nEthanol, 3 percent.\n  These eight companies corner the market on ethanol. There is a market \nconcentration of ethanol. That is a danger signal for all of us--a \nconcentrated market, and a huge mandate that triples.\n  ADM has a 41-percent market share. The top eight firms have a 71-\npercent market share. The GAO finds their market share to be ``highly \nconcentrated.''\n  How can those in the West who suffered last year believe these firms \nwill not abuse their market power to drive prices up? If we learned \nanything from the energy crisis last year, it is that when there is not \nan ample supply or adequate competition in the marketplace, prices will \nsoar, and consumers will pay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan op-ed by Peter Schrag that appeared in the Sacramento Bee on January \n30.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Sacramento Bee, Jan. 30, 2002]\n\n               Can California Avoid the Next Energy Mess?\n\n                           (By Peter Schrag)\n\n       The two sets of terms aren't corollaries, but close enough. \n     The Bush administration has ruled that without an \n     ``oxygenate'' additive such as ethanol or MTBE, now being \n     phased out because of water pollution problems, California \n     gasoline won't burn cleanly enough to meet air-quality \n     standards. It thus won't give the state a waiver from the \n     federal requirement. But as a leading environmentalist says, \n     the decision is based a lot more on political science than \n     science. And it could cost California motorists close to a \n     half-billion a year.\n       And that's where ADM comes in. The monster agribusiness \n     company, which calls itself supermarket to the world, markets \n     about half the ethanol produced in this country. ADM's \n     contributions to politicians of both parties--some $4.5 \n     million in the 1990s, plus some $930,000 in soft money in the \n     2000 election cycle alone, including $100,000 for the Bush \n     inauguration last year--put it ahead of Enron on many lists \n     of political-influence peddlers.\n       The investment, bolstered by intensive lobbying from \n     Midwest farmers, is paying off handsomely. The president says \n     that ethanol, a ``renewable'' fuel that comes mostly from \n     corn, not only reduces emissions but also fosters energy \n     independence.\n       The claim is dubious. Many studies indicate that ethanol, \n     while reducing carbon monoxide emissions, increases the \n     emission of smog-producing and other toxic compounds. A 1999 \n     report commissioned by the U.S. Environmental Protection \n     Agency itself called for an end to the requirement. That, the \n     panel said, ``will result in greater flexibility to maintain \n     and enhance emission reductions, particularly as California \n     pursues new formulation requirements for gasoline.\n       The Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the \n     Clean Air Trust and other environmental groups echo the \n     findings. But Washington hasn't paid much attention. Despite \n     evidence that ethanol has contributed nothing to energy \n     independence, every gallon of gas with ethanol gets a 5.4-\n     cent federal subsidy (without costs $600 million a year in \n     federal highway funds). And as MTBE is being phased out--in \n     California, Gov. Gray Davis has set Jan. 1, 2003, as the \n     deadline--ADM and other ethanol producers stand to gain \n     handsomely.\n       Davis has lobbied vigorously for a waiver of the ethanol \n     requirement, arguing, with considerable evidence, that \n     California's auto and fuel standards will achieve the same or \n     even better results without ethanol. He's also suing the \n     federal EPA.\n       According to a North American Free Trade Agreement claim by \n     Methanex Corp., a Canadian producer of MTBE, Davis himself \n     got $200,000 from ADM during the 1998 gubernatorial campaign \n     and allegedly was flown to ADM headquarters in Decatur, \n     Ill., to meet with company officials. MTBE didn't have to \n     be phased out, Methanex says; the problem is not the \n     compound but the flawed underground tanks from which it \n     leaks. Davis' phaseout order, says the claim, suggests \n     still more influence peddling.\n       But in this case, ADM's investment hasn't paid off. There's \n     been overwhelming pressure in California, as elsewhere, to \n     get MTBE out of gasoline as quickly as possible. Davis is not \n     doing ADM's bidding; he's trying to straddle a line between \n     cleaner water and higher gas prices. Chances are he'll extend \n     the MTBE phaseout and try to negotiate with Congress for (at \n     least) more flexibility on ethanol.\n       Unlike Enron, ADM is not likely to implode; there's no sign \n     of accounting shenanigans, no ``partners'' where red ink can \n     be hidden. But six years ago, ADM was forced to pay $100 \n     million in what was then the largest price-fixing fine ever \n     imposed. In 1998, three of its senior executives, including \n     Chief Operating Officer Michael Andreas, son of former board \n     chairman Wayne Andreas, were sentenced to prison.\n       The case, said a federal appeals court, reflects ``an \n     inexplicable lack of business ethics and an atmosphere of \n     general lawlessness. . . . Top executives at ADM and its \n     Asian co-conspirators . . . spied on each other, fabricated \n     aliases and front organizations to hide their activities, \n     hired prostitutes to gather information from competitors, \n     lied, cheated, embezzled, extorted and obstructed justice.'' \n     These are not the kind of guys you want to depend on when you \n     fill your tank.\n       California's gasoline situation will probably never become \n     the crisis that electricity was last year--and in this case, \n     no one can blame the state or its politicians. But if \n     something doesn't give before the end of the year, the state \n     will not only be paying for ethanol it doesn't need, but also \n     be subject to sudden supply shortages.\n       California may be able to produce some of its own ethanol, \n     but most will have to come from the Midwest, either by ship \n     (down the Mississippi, which sometimes freezes) or by train. \n     Without a federal waiver, every gallon of ethanol not \n     available at the refinery means a shortage of 14 gallons of \n     gas. If ever there was a price-spike formula, this one is it.\n       Last week, California's Republican gubernatorial candidates \n     once again rehashed last year's energy crisis. Somebody ought \n     to start asking what they'd do about the next one.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in this article, Schrag mentions:\n\n       Now that ``energy crisis'' and Enron have become household \n     words, Californians had better get familiar with ethanol and \n     Archer Daniels Midland.\n\n  ADM is already an admitted price-fixing firm. Three of its executives \nhave served prison time for colluding with competitors.\n  In 1996, ADM pled guilty and paid a $100 million fine for conspiring \nto set the price of an animal feed additive. That is the company that \nhas a 41-percent share of ethanol.\n  The ethanol industry tells us they will be able to produce enough \nethanol to meet future demands under this mandate. But what if some of \nthe planned ethanol plants fail to be built? This is a key point. \nPlants could be delayed, or not coming online at all. We are finding \nthis with the electricity-generation facilities right now in \nCalifornia. Plants that said they were going to come in, because of the \neconomy, or because of their own financial conditions, or one thing or \nanother, have decided no--they are not really going to go ahead with \nit. What is to preclude that same thing from happening with respect to \nethanol? The answer to the question is nothing precludes it.\n\n[[Page S2510]]\n\n  The GAO reports:\n\n       Projected capacity may be lower if some plants cease \n     production, plants under construction don't come online in \n     time, or some new plants' plans do not materialize.\n\n  The ethanol industry is asking this Nation to make a blind leap of \nfaith that there will be a sufficient amount of ethanol in the future. \nIn fact, projections of the future domestic ethanol supply are based \nupon numbers supplied by ethanol producers themselves. We are taking a \nvery big risk here. We should know it.\n  I am also particularly concerned about the long-term effect of nearly \ntripling the amount of ethanol in our gasoline supply. What effect will \nthis have on our environment? What are the health risks of ethanol?\n  The answers are truthfully largely unknown. That is the rub, too. I \nbelieve it is bad public policy to mandate an amount of ethanol that is \nway above what is required to meet clean air standards before \nscientific and health experts can fully investigate the impact of \nethanol on the air we breathe and the water we drink.\n  There was a 2-percent oxygenate requirement put in some time ago. One \nof the oxygenates that was chosen was MTBE. Now we find that MTBE has \ncontaminated 10,000 wells in California, the water supply for Santa \nMonica, the Santa Clara Valley reservoirs, Lake Tahoe, and a number of \nother places in California. We now find that MTBE may well be a human \ncarcinogen. We learned all of this, the horse is out, and the barn door \nis shut. Now we are going to do the same thing with respect to ethanol.\n  Just what are the environmental ramifications of more ethanol in our \nfuel supply?\n  Although the scientific opinion is not unanimous, evidence suggests \nthat, one, reformulated gasoline with ethanol produces more smog \npollution than reformulated gas without it. We have reformulated \ngasoline. That is why we don't need to use it. The finding is that \nthere is more smog pollution with ethanol than if States simply went to \nreformulated gasoline.\n  Second, ethanol enables the toxic chemicals in gasoline to seep \nfurther into ground water and even faster than conventional gasoline.\n  Ethanol is also made out to be an ideal renewable fuel, giving off \nfewer emissions. Yet on balance, ethanol can be a cause of more air \npollution because it produces smog in the summer months. Smog is a \npowerful respiratory irritant. It affects a large amount of the \npopulation. It has an especially pernicious effect on the elderly, on \nchildren, and individuals with existing respiratory problems such as \nasthma. And asthma is going up in America. It is time we begin to ask \nwhy.\n  A 1999 report from the National Academy of Sciences found:\n\n       [T]he use of commonly available oxygenates [like ethanol] \n     in [Reformulated Gasoline] has little impact on improving \n     ozone air quality and has some disadvantages. Moreover, some \n     data suggests that oxygenates can lead to higher Nitrogen \n     Oxide (NOX) emissions.\n\n  Nitrogen oxides are known to cause smog.\n  The National Academy report also found that ethanol-blended gasoline \nwill ``lead to increased emissions of acetaldehyde''--a toxic \npollutant.\n  Thus, ethanol is both good and bad for air quality. And we triple it. \nThat is the unknown. That is the big step into the unknown we are \ntaking. To me, it would make sense to maximize the advantages of \nethanol and minimize the disadvantages. This bill, this mandate does \nnot do that. This is exactly why States should have flexibility to \ndecide what goes into their gasoline in order to meet clean air \nstandards. Ethanol should not be mandated, certainly not at this level.\n  Why are some forcing smog pollution into our air during the summer?\n  Evidence also suggests that ethanol accelerates the ability of toxins \nfound in gasoline to seep into our ground water supplies. The EPA Blue \nRibbon Panel on Oxygenates found that ethanol ``may retard \nbiodegradation and increase movement of benzene and other hydrocarbons \naround leaking tanks.''\n  Now, benzene is a carcinogen. Just know what we are doing.\n  Let me quote the EPA Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates. Ethanol ``may \nretard biodegradation and increase movement of benzene and other \nhydrocarbons around leaking tanks.''\n  According to a report by the State of California entitled, ``Health \nand Environmental Assessment of the Use of Ethanol as a Fuel \nOxygenate,'' there are valid questions about the use of ethanol and its \nimpact on ground and surface water. An analysis in the report found \nthat there will be a 20-percent increase in public drinking water wells \ncontaminated with benzene if a significant amount of ethanol is used--a \n20-percent increase in public drinking water wells contaminated with \nbenzene, a known carcinogen.\n  We are tripling the amount of ethanol, and we are tripling it when it \nisn't needed to meet clean air standards. What kind of public policy is \nthis? It is egregious public policy. It is wrong public policy. If you \nthink I am passionate about it, you are right.\n  So what is the rush to force more ethanol on the American motorists \nif it will only drive up the price of gasoline and produce mixed \nenvironmental results?\n  On top of that, how can the Senate favor protecting the ethanol \nindustry from liability? And this is the clincher in this bill: They \nare protected from liability. So if you get sick from it, if it \npollutes our wells, if benzene increases, you cannot sue. What kind of \npublic policy is this?\n  I urge my colleagues to look at pages 204 and 205 of the energy \nlegislation where a so-called safe harbor provision gives the ethanol \nindustry unprecedented protection against consumers and communities \nthat may seek legal redress against the harm ethanol may cause. I am \nvery pleased to say that my colleague, Senator Boxer from California, \nwill have an amendment which will eliminate this safe harbor provision.\n\n  More ethanol will force the Government to collect less gasoline tax \nrevenue for the highway trust fund. This is a very big consideration. \nIt is huge.\n  Let me argue this point. Ethanol is exempted from 5.3 cents of the \nFederal motor fuels tax. The Congressional Research Service has \nindicated that the ethanol mandate in this bill will divert $7 billion \nover the 9 years away from the highway trust fund, which States use to \npay for essential transportation projects. And that is on top of the \ncut that is in the Bush budget.\n  So per gallon of gasoline today, 18.4 cents goes into the trust fund. \nWith the tripled amount of ethanol, CRS estimates there will be a $7 \nbillion loss in the highway trust fund over the next 9 years--a $7 \nbillion loss. That is enough in itself to vote against this \nlegislation.\n  California is able to produce special gasoline that is the cleanest \nburning gasoline in the country today. We meet clean air standards with \nreformulated gasoline. The State only needs to use ethanol in the \nwinter months to meet clean air requirements. That is why the State has \ncontinually asked the Federal Government for a waiver of the 2-percent \noxygenate requirement.\n  Yet time and time again, the ethanol industry has flexed its \npolitical muscle in the White House, in the Senate, and in the House to \nforce California to use fuel additives the State does not need. This \ntime is no different. And it is clear to me that all of this is merely \nserving to prop up an industry that would fall apart without \noverwhelming Government subsidy and action.\n  I am very concerned about the repercussions this mandate may have on \nthe price and supply of gasoline. I cannot vote for this bill with this \nmandate in it. It is bad public policy. It is egregious public policy.\n  The California Energy Commission again points out:\n\n       The combination of limited local capacity, restrained \n     imports, limited storage, and a strong demand, has caused the \n     California gasoline market to become increasingly unstable, \n     with wild price swings.\n\n  The bottom line is that my State's gasoline market is extraordinarily \nvolatile and vulnerable. And this is the fifth largest economic engine \nin the world. People have to get to work, and gasoline fuels the \neconomy as well as automobiles. And we are going to do this to it?\n  In 1999, fires at Tosco and Chevron refineries during the summer \nforced the price of gasoline to double in California.\n  This bill will strain California's gasoline supply even further with \na Federal\n\n[[Page S2511]]\n\nethanol mandate that risks plunging California and other States into \nthe next energy crisis. Every indicator I have seen points to this \nethanol requirement as having unanticipated side effects, such as \nsupply problems and resulting in higher gasoline prices for the \nconsumer.\n  So by passing this legislation, the Senate will be making \nCalifornia's and the Nation's gasoline more expensive by mandating a \nfuel additive with a negative value as an energy source and a mixed \nvalue for the environment.\n  On balance, it makes no public policy sense. I want to make clear, \nonce again, my strong opposition to this greedy and misguided renewable \nfuels requirement. The mandate is a dangerous step that could force \ngasoline prices to soar, cause shortages of fuel, create more smog, and \nusher in the next energy crisis.\n  Plain and simple, it is bad policy to charge all consumers more to \nbenefit a collection of very few ethanol producers. I hope this \ncommentary will begin an honest debate in the Senate about the ethanol \nprovisions of the Senate energy bill and what they will really do.\n  I know Senator Schumer is going to follow up on this. However, I take \nthis opportunity to indicate that there will be a number of amendments \nfrom those of us on the west coast and those of us on the east coast. \nWe intend to press this debate. We do not intend to let this bill go \nforward if we can prevent it.\n  I begin with one of my first amendments. Another diabolical thing in \nthis bill is essentially to state that if a waiver is provided, if a \nState asks to waive--this is on page 195 of the bill--the \nAdministrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, may waive \nthe renewable fuels requirement in whole or in part on petition by one \nor more States by reducing the national quantity of renewable fuel \nrequired under this section based on a determination by EPA, after \npublic notice and opportunity for comment, that implementation of the \nrequirement would severely harm the economy or the environment of a \nState or a region or the United States; and that based on a \ndetermination by the EPA Administrator, after public notice and \nopportunity, there is an inadequate domestic supply or distribution \ncapacity to meet the requirement.\n  In simple English, this means that if there is an emergency, the \nethanol mandate can be temporarily suspended.\n  This is the rub: The bill, as currently drafted, gives EPA 240 days \nin an emergency to make a decision. That is a good part of a year to \ndecide whether or not to grant a waiver. This is unconscionable. In \nother words, if you can't obtain enough ethanol and you have an \nemergency and you petition to waive it, it takes 240 days. What do you \ndo for 240 days?\n  This, in my view, is ridiculous. Can you imagine if in a few years \nthere is an ethanol shortage, there are problems getting enough ethanol \nto New York or to California and our two Governors ask for a waiver and \nwe have to wait 240 days to get it? Our economy would take a \ndevastating blow if such a situation were to occur.\n  To make this waiver more reasonable, I am offering this amendment to \nrequire the EPA to respond in a reasonable time to an emergency request \nby a State for a waiver. This amendment will give the EPA 30 days to \nrule on a waiver so consumers will not unduly suffer. By reducing the \ntime period, the Administrator will have not 240 days but 30 days to \ndecide whether or not an emergency waiver should be approved. We can \nensure that any price spikes or supply shortage will be as temporary as \npossible.\n  I believe that 240 days is in there for a reason: Because if your \ngasoline spikes in price, as we think it is, you can't stop it. It goes \non for the 240 days.\n  I will end my remarks. I reserve the right to come back for \nadditional remarks. One of the things I would like to go into is how \nenergy inefficient this ethanol proposal really is because ethanol \nincreases the need for gasoline, it does not reduce it. MTBE reduces \nthe amount of gasoline you need. So if you are short refinery capacity, \nMTBE works to your advantage. Ethanol does exactly the opposite. If you \ndon't have that refinery capacity, you are stuck. It is a big problem.\n\n  I would like to do more on that, but at the present time I send an \namendment to the desk and yield the floor. I notice the distinguished \nsenior Senator from New York is here and will continue our opposition \nto this ethanol mandate.\n  I yield the floor, if I might, to the Senator from New York.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the pending \namendments are set aside and the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3114.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from California \nfor her fine remarks on this issue, which I share. We have a serious \nproblem in this bill, a problem that most Members don't know about. \nThere is a hidden gas tax in this bill. It is not going to be hidden \nafter today.\n  This bill will raise the cost of gasoline on average in America more \nthan the nickel gas tax did back in 1993, when I was not a Member of \nthis distinguished body but which caused so much controversy.\n  I urge my colleagues to pay careful attention over the next few days \nas many of us bring up this issue. It is complicated. It is anti-free \nmarket, I say to my friend from Oklahoma who I know has been a strong \ndefender of free market principles, when I agree with him and when I \ndisagree with him. It is something that should not be in this bill. I \nthink it could be the death knell of this bill, as the Senator from \nCalifornia said. I myself--and I know many others--cannot vote for this \nfinal bill with this provision included.\n  Let me express my concerns about this unprecedented new ethanol \nmandate provision which was quietly inserted into the Senate energy \nbill a few weeks ago without any debate. The provision accomplishes two \ngoals not being disputed by my amendment. One\n\n[[Page S2512]]\n\nis banning the use of MTBEs which has resulted in groundwater pollution \nall over the country. The second is scrapping the oxygenate mandate \nthat led so many States to make such heavy use of MTBEs in the first \nplace.\n  The proposal in the bill provides an anti-backsliding provision to \nrequire continued efforts on clean air. Though those provisions could \nbe stronger, we are not opposing any of those parts of the bill. But \nbeyond those provisions, this new amendment adds an astonishing new \nanti-consumer, anti-premarket requirement that every refiner in the \ncountry, regardless of where they are located, regardless of whether \nthe State mandates it or not, regardless of whether the State chooses a \ndifferent path to get to clean air, must use an ever-increasing volume \nof ethanol. If they don't use the ethanol--and this is the most amazing \npart of the bill--they still have to pay for ethanol credits.\n  Now, our amendment--the amendment I have introduced--would simply \nstrike that provision, plain, simple, and clean. As to the provision we \nare striking, simply put, what it does is it requires all gasoline \nusers, our consumers, to pay for ethanol whether or not they use it. It \nis nothing less than an ethanol gas tax levied on every driver--the mom \nwho is driving the kids to school, a truck driver who earns a living. \nEvery gasoline user in this country will pay.\n  Under this ethanol gas tax, gas prices will rise significantly, even \nunder the best of circumstances. I am first going to bring this part \nout because I think this part will get the most attention in terms of \npeople understanding how bad this provision is. Using Department of \nEnergy numbers, impartial Hart/IRI Fuels Information Services estimates \nthat gasoline prices will increase by a staggering 4 cents to 9.7 cents \nper gallon, depending on the region. Should there be market \ndisruptions, which my friend from California brought up, the price \nwould go much higher because without the gasoline they need, the \nethanol they need, boom, it goes way up. It also favors some regions \nover others, so that California would pay the most--about 9.7 cents a \ngallon. So would New England. My State of New York would pay about 7 \ncents. But every part of the country would pay more--every single part. \nEven in the Midwest, where there is lots of ethanol production, the \naverage price of gasoline would go up 4 or 5 cents a gallon.\n  Listen to this, my colleagues. In the heart of farm country--and I \nwant to help farmers, as I think I have shown in my few years here--\nboth Iowa and Nebraska had a referendum on the ballot to require this \nkind of provision and rejected it. Well, if the voters in the heart of \nfarm country, in the heart of ethanol country, were against this \nprovision, how are we in the Senate imposing this on every part of the \ncountry? I don't know what their philosophy is, but let me read from \nthe Des Moines Sun Register:\n\n       An ethanol mandate would deny Iowans a choice of fuels and \n     short circuit the process of establishing its own worth in \n     the marketplace. The justification is to marginally boost the \n     price of corn. If that were the goal, other measures would be \n     far more effective.\n\n  How about the Quad City Times editorial entitled ``Ethanol Only \nProposal Doesn't Help Consumers.''\n  How about the Grand Island (Nebraska) Independent: ``Ethanol use \nshould not be a forced buy.''\n  How about the Omaha World Herald: ``More Alcohol, Less Choice.''\n  These are all editorials. I don't know about these newspapers. I \ndoubt they are philosophically like the New York Times; yet they are \nthinking this is a bad proposal. I want to read for you about your \nStates. This is a low estimate, but this is how much the price of \ngasoline will go up if this provision is kept in the bill, if our \namendment is defeated. I will read every State. I think you ought to \nknow it. This is important. The minimum is 4 cents, and in many it is 4 \ncents. In many it is higher. Keep your ears perked. Alabama would go up \n4 cents a gallon; Alaska, 4 cents; Arizona, 7.6 cents; Arkansas, 4 \ncents; California--the senior Senator from California is here--9.6 \ncents a gallon; Colorado, 4 cents; Connecticut, 9.7 cents a gallon; \nDelaware, 9.7 cents; District of Columbia, 9.7 cents; Florida, 4 cents \na gallon; Georgia, 4 cents a gallon; Hawaii, 4 cents a gallon; Idaho, 4 \ncents; Illinois--I just read in today's newspaper how the price of \ngasoline is going through the roof in Illinois. That would be an \nadditional 7.3 cents a gallon. We are going to tell the drivers in \nChicago and Springfield and East St. Louis, where the price is through \nthe roof already, we are going to impose a mandate that will raise \ntheir price 7.3 cents a gallon. How can we?\n\n  Indiana, 4.9 cents; Iowa, 4 cents; Kansas, 4 cents; Kentucky, 5.4 \ncents; Louisiana, 4.2 cents a gallon; Maine, 4 cents; Maryland, 9.1 \ncents; Massachusetts, 9.7 cents a gallon; Michigan, 4 cents a gallon; \nMinnesota, 4 cents a gallon; Missouri, 5.6 cents a gallon; Mississippi, \n4 cents; Montana, 4 cents; Nebraska, 4 cents a gallon for a product we \ndon't make in New York, that we might not even use?\n  I have spoken to some of the refiners in our area. They think we can \nmeet the clean air mandate in a lot cheaper and better way. If we \nchoose to, we still have to buy the ethanol credit. My goodness.\n  Nevada, 4 cents; North Carolina, 4 cents; North Dakota, 4 cents; \nOhio, 4 cents; Oklahoma, 4 cents; Oregon, 4 cents; Pennsylvania, 5.5 \ncents a gallon; Rhode Island, 9.7 cents; Tennessee, 4 cents a gallon; \nTexas, 5.7 cents a gallon; Utah, 4 cents a gallon; Vermont, 4 cents a \ngallon; Virginia, 7.2 cents a gallon; Washington, 4 cents a gallon; \nWest Virginia, 4 cents; Wisconsin, 5.5 cents a gallon; Wyoming, 4 cents \na gallon.\n  The reason it varies, of course, is the availability of ethanol. It \nis very hard to ship. You can't create a pipeline--even though that \ncould be expensive to do--the way you can for oil. So the ethanol has \nto be reduced, and you can see it is mainly in a few States in the \nheartland, where nice, hard-working people live, in the middle of the \ncountry.\n  If you are far away from these ethanol plants, it is hard to get to; \nit is hard for you to get the ethanol. It usually has to be produced, \nput on a truck, a barge, sent down to Mississippi, and then, by boat, \nsent all around the country and then loaded back, put on a truck, and \nput into the gasoline. You can see why it is so expensive.\n  Now, that is in normal times. Should there be market disruptions, of \nwhich you can be sure-as-shooting, if we are going to impose this huge \nmandate requiring more ethanol to be added to gasoline than we produce \nin the United States right now, there are going to be disruptions and \nthe price of gasoline could double.\n  This is one of these quiet little amendments that could come back to \nhaunt every one of us. I have been here in the Congress--only 4 years \nin the Senate but 18 in the House. Every so often, there is an \namendment and people vote for it and don't pay much attention, and a \nyear later the public gets wind and says: What the heck have those guys \ndone? Everybody here says: I didn't know or, oh, we didn't realize it. \nThe Senator from California, I, and the others joining us in this \ndebate are putting you on notice: This is one of those amendments. \nBeware. If there was ever an amendment quietly put in a bill that \nshould have a skull and crossbones on it, be careful, this is it. So \npay attention.\n  Now, my State has already banned the use of MTBEs. We don't take that \nout in this bill. So have 12 other States, including Arizona, \nCalifornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, \nMinnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, South Dakota, and Washington. All \nhave banned MTBEs. A number of other States are in the process of \ntaking action as well because MTBEs pollute the ground water.\n\n  Every one of those States that has banned MTBEs is going to be in an \nimpossible dilemma. Their citizens are demanding they ban MTBE, but \nwith the oxygenate requirement in place, they cannot successfully do \nso.\n  Last year President Bush's administration denied California's \npetition to waive the oxygenate requirement, despite the State's \nability to comply with air quality standards without it. In New York, \nwe are in the same position. This denial forced the State to defer its \ncritical ban on MTBE and suffer ground water contamination. New York \nState is now considering requesting a waiver, and I expect their \nrequest will be met with the same denial.\n  We are between a rock and a hard place. Our citizens' health and the \nenvironment are being held hostage to the desire of the ethanol lobby \nto make\n\n[[Page S2513]]\n\never larger profits. We all know one company is way ahead of everybody \nelse in producing ethanol. That was brought out by my colleague from \nCalifornia. I am not going to bring it out--maybe I will since we are \nat the beginning of the debate.\n  This chart, which was prepared by my colleague from California, shows \nthat 41 percent of the ethanol comes from one company. This is what we \nare doing in this great free market, capitalistic economy: We are \nrequiring everybody to buy this stuff, and one company has 41 percent \nof the market--one company.\n  We are setting ourselves up for a huge fall, the kind of price spikes \nwe have seen occasionally in California, in Illinois, and in other \nplaces. We are going to see them everywhere. They are going to pop up \nlike weeds if we increase the demand for ethanol when only one company \nis making it and there is a natural bottleneck. It is not quite like \nelectricity, but it is not that far away, electricity being an actual \nmonopoly.\n  The bottom line is for many States that are outside the Corn Belt and \nlack the infrastructure to transport and refine ethanol, the most \nefficient method of achieving clean air goals will be to reformulate \ngasoline without using large amounts of ethanol.\n  Again, I have talked to leaders in the refining industry in my area, \nand they believe they can do it and do it rather easily. States outside \nthe Corn Belt that do not currently use much ethanol will have to pay \nto have the ethanol, as I say, trucked across the country or floated on \nbarges to the Gulf of Mexico and loaded on to tankers.\n  Those States will also have to pay to retrofit their refineries. \nEvery refinery that does not now use ethanol will have to be refitted \nto add ethanol to the gasoline. Both of these would represent \nsignificant increases in costs for refineries supplying my State. \nRetrofitting would cost millions of dollars, and under this bill New \nYork would incur millions more in ethanol transportation costs.\n  What is the public policy for mandating the use of ethanol? I have \nnot heard one. If you believe ethanol works, as the Iowa, Nebraska, and \nIllinois newspapers said, let the market determine it. This is a \nmandate that sort of assumes we know ethanol is best for everybody, and \nmost people do not believe it is.\n  We all know what is going on here. The Senator from California \nmentioned it. It is the ethanol lobby, their power. But we also have \none other thing. They made their deal with the petroleum industry, and \nso we have this provision that does not allow one to sue. I am \nsurprised that so many people on both sides of the aisle who have \nmaintained the right to sue in every other area now say: Never mind. \nThe provision is renewable fuels safe harbor.\n\n  There is another reason, too, and this is probably the most \nlegitimate reason. I know many of my colleagues from the Midwest want \nto help their farmers who are suffering. We know that. I want to help \nthose farmers. I have voted for large amounts of agricultural subsidies \nto help the farmers in the West and the South with their row crops. I \ndid not used to do that when I was in the House, but as I traveled \naround my State, I learned the burdens that farmers face.\n  It is a heck of a lot different if the Government makes a collective \ndecision to help support the price of a crop to keep farmers in \nexistence than an inefficient, jerry-built contraption that does not \njust make this what the Government does but, rather, forces every \nconsumer to pay. When we have done agricultural subsidies, the \nrationale has been cheap food. This is not cheap gasoline. This is more \nexpensive gasoline, and it absolutely makes no sense to help our \nfarmers in this way. If it did, I suspect this amendment would have \nbeen debated in the open, but instead, as I said, there has been no \ndebate.\n  I, frankly, wrestled with my conscience whether to go forward. I do \nwant to help my colleagues in the farm areas, but this one was so far \noff the charts and so deleterious to my constituents, in terms of \nraising the price of gasoline, that I just could not come to do that.\n  I say to my colleagues from the Midwest, figure out better ways we \ncan help the farmers, and I say that as somebody who has been \nsupportive of doing that before.\n  Let me show my colleagues how crazy this proposal is. Currently, \nrefiners across the Nation use 1.7 billion gallons of ethanol. That is \nwhat refiners use right now. Starting in 2004, a mere 2 years away, \nthey would be required to use 2.3 billion gallons of ethanol.\n  Right away we are asking them to use a lot more ethanol. If the \nproduction does not happen, we know what is going to happen: a price \nspike.\n  We ratchet up that number to 5 billion gallons of ethanol in 2012 and \nincrease it every year by a percentage equivalent to the proportion of \nethanol in the entire U.S. gas supply after 2012 in perpetuity. That \nmeans that from 2012 on, the Nation's ethanol producers will have a \nguaranteed annual market of over 5 billion gallons, which every \ngasoline consumer in this country will pay at the pump.\n  It will stifle any development and new ways of finding cleaner \ngasoline and cleaner burning fuels. It means if someone comes up with a \nbetter way, it does not matter. It means a huge investment in \ninfrastructure. I would rather have that money go to build our \nhighways, for God's sake, than to build new ethanol refineries.\n  In my State, our highways are hurting, and we are going to be \ndebating in the appropriations bill whether to cut Federal highway \nfunding.\n  The ethanol mandate will reduce the amount of money that goes into \nthe highway trust fund. In addition, it will cost our consumers more as \nwell. If we want to build a big infrastructure, do not create a whole \nnew ethanol infrastructure which the market is not demanding, build \nmore highways. It makes no sense.\n  One other point I have made already, this safe harbor provision is \nsort of the cherry on top of the icing on top of the cake, the evil \ncake it is. The safe harbor provision gives unprecedented product \nliability protection against consumers and communities that seek legal \nredress from the manufacturers and oil companies that produce and \nutilize defective additives in their gasoline. Not just ethanol; all of \nthem. That was the sort of deal, I guess, that was made.\n  So for those who believe in their consumers, God forbid, and a \nrefinery makes a huge mistake and puts something terrible in the \ngasoline that either pollutes the air or is defective, you cannot sue. \nWe have held that insurance reform be over the right to sue. Much \nlegislation ends up shipwrecked on the shoals of the battle of tort \nreform, and yet in this bill we say not only never mind, we put in a \nsafe harbor provision that makes one's jaw drop.\n  The Presiding Officer was out of the room, but as I stated, it will \nraise the cost of gasoline in his great State of Delaware some 9.7 \ncents a gallon by the time this is implemented, something I think the \ndrivers in Dover, Wilmington, Rehoboth, and all the other beautiful \ncities of Delaware would dare not want to pay.\n  For consumers throughout this country, this ethanol gas tax is a one-\ntwo punch. First, consumers will be forced to pay more at the pump to \nmeet arbitrary goals that boost the sale of ethanol but are not \nnecessary to achieve the bill's air quality goals.\n  Second, consumers will face restrictions from suing manufacturers and \noil companies, and they will have less incentive to ensure the \nadditives they manufacture and use are safe. The provision denies \nconsumers and communities appropriate redress, eliminates an important \ndisincentive to pollute, and creates a dangerous precedent for future \nenvironmental policy.\n  In conclusion, I support the anti-backsliding air quality provisions. \nI want to see our air cleaner without dirtying our ground water. I do \nnot want to be put between that rock and hard place, but I strongly \noppose creating a mandatory ethanol market, whether it is used or not, \nand providing the producers of that ethanol with extraordinary legal \nprotections to boot. The ethanol industry already benefits from \nbillions of dollars in direct farm subsidies and a 54-cent-per-gallon \nsubsidy. If my colleagues want to subsidize that more, let us debate \nthat in the Senate. Who knows? I might support it. But do not make our \ndrivers pay for it and do not mandate it.\n  Ethanol, which is twice as expensive as gasoline, right now would not \nbe\n\n[[Page S2514]]\n\neconomically viable but for the massive Federal subsidies it already \nreceives. On top of that, with the phaseout of MTBEs, regardless, the \ndemand for ethanol by free market processes is going to go up. States \nnear the Corn Belt will probably use more ethanol. So ethanol is in \ngood shape.\n  All that is not enough to satisfy the ethanol lobby. As I said, do \nnot take the word of a New Yorker or a Californian. Look at the voters \nin Iowa and Nebraska, the heartland--where if anyplace on the face of \nthis continent or in this country would benefit from this mandate, they \nwould--they both recently defeated efforts in those States to create a \nstatewide ethanol mandate.\n  They knew, as I hope we will learn in this body, that mandated \nethanol is an indefensible public policy and will unnecessarily hurt \nconsumers all across the country. To my colleagues, defeat the ethanol \ngas tax.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for \nhis comments. I thought they were excellent. I appreciate him naming \nevery State that will have an effective gas tax, and stating that this \nmethanol mandate is a tax hike anyway one looks at it. I do not think \nthere is any doubt there is going to be an increase in gas prices. I do \nnot doubt them at all.\n  I also appreciate his concern for farmers. I come from a State that \nis the largest farming State in the Union. I have spent time in the \ncentral valley of California. I know what farmers go through, and I \nappreciate it.\n  I am also faced with the problem in my State of forcing a tax hike \nfor something that we do not need to meet clean air standards, which \nhas questions about its environmental value as well as its real \nquestions about what it might do to the public health, that prevents \nanybody's right to sue if there is a real hazard that comes about. \nThis, to me, is unbelievable.\n  I will take a couple of moments on the subject of what ethanol does \nin gasoline. I mentioned in my remarks that ethanol is also \nfundamentally different from MTBE because the two oxygenated additives \nreact differently when mixed with gasoline. I think this is an \nimportant point because this is not going to help the energy shortage. \nIt is going to exacerbate it.\n  The same amount of ethanol, as opposed to MTBE, actually contracts \nfuel so it takes more to produce the same amount of gasoline.\n  The report, sponsored by the California Energy Commission, predicts \nreplacement of MTBE by ethanol will result in a supply shortfall of 5 \nto 10 percent for the California gasoline pool as a whole. Thus, \nCalifornia's gasoline supply is not going to go as far as it did.\n  That is critical because we are at 98 percent of refining capacity. \nSo I do not know how we meet the need without a huge price spike that \nwill result from a shortage of gasoline, and that is why I think for my \nState this mandate actually produces a very egregious gas spike. It \nalso can impact refineries very critically.\n  So what I have tried to point out today is that essentially this \nmandate triples the amount of ethanol from 1.7 billion gallons used \nnationally today to 5 billion gallons nationally by 2012.\n  Secondly, because of the way the credit situation is set up, one pays \nwhether they use it or not.\n  Thirdly, what it does to gas prices.\n  Fourthly, the market concentration of ethanol: 41 percent from one \ncompany, 71 percent from eight companies. That in itself creates a \nproblem that if there is a shortfall the price can be manipulated.\n  I have mentioned the environmental problems, that we can anticipate \nthe smell in the summer months will get worse, not better, because of \nthe use of ethanol. I also indicated that essentially over the 9 years \neverybody should know that this is a $7 billion cut in the highway \ntrust fund.\n  There is another point I would like to make. The ethanol mandate \nessentially helps the producer. Only 30 percent goes to the farmers, \nand about 70 percent goes to producers. This is a windfall for those \ncompanies, any way you look at it. The New York Times ran an editorial \npointing this out, mentioning that an energy economist estimated 30 \npercent of the cost will end up in the pockets of farmers, while about \n70 percent will go to the processors, such as ADM. This mandate is a \nridiculously expensive way to subsidize farmers.\n  Additionally, it cuts imports by about only 9,000 barrels, of about 8 \nmillion barrels. So no one can say this saves a great deal of our \nenergy requirements related to fuel.\n  I ask unanimous consent this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 8, 1994]\n\n                       This Clean Air Looks Dirty\n\n       The Environmental Protection Agency has effectively ordered \n     refiners to add corn-based ethanol to make gasoline \n     environmentally friendly. But the added ethanol will not \n     clean the air beyond what the 1990 Clean Air Act would \n     already require; nor will it, as advocates claim, raise farm \n     income very much or significantly cut oil imports.\n       What the E.P.A.'s rule will do is take money from consumers \n     and taxpayers and hand it over to Archer Daniels Midland, \n     which produces about 60 percent of the nation's supply of \n     ethanol. It is certainly no coincidence that A.D.M.'s chief \n     executive, Dwayne Andreas, is a major political contributor; \n     he donated $100,000 to a recent Democratic fund-raising \n     dinner. The Clean Air Act requires high-smog areas to phase \n     in use of ``reformulated'' gasoline whose weight is at least \n     2 percent oxygen; the goal was to reduce pollution by \n     replacing gasoline with oxygenates. The E.P.A. order would \n     now add another requirement: 30 percent of the oxygenates \n     would have to come from ``renewable'' resources--which in \n     reality means corn-based ethanol.\n       Because the oxygen content of reformulated gasoline remains \n     unchanged, the order will not reduce smog-creating emissions. \n     But by forcing refiners to use ethanol rather than less \n     expensive oxygenates like methanol, the rule will drive up \n     the cost of gasoline. Indeed, ethanol remains a high-cost \n     additive even though it benefits from substantial tax breaks. \n     And some experts argue that ethanol may be environmentally \n     damaging because coal used in producing it contributes to \n     carbon dioxide emissions, adding to global warming.\n       David Montgomery, an energy economist for Charles River \n     Associates, estimates that only 30 percent of the cost of \n     ethanol will wind up in the pockets of farmers while about 70 \n     percent will go to processors like A.D.M. So the rule is a \n     ridiculously expensive way to subsidize farmers. And the \n     addition of ethanol will cut imports by only 9,000 barrels \n     out of about eight million barrels a day.\n       Carol Browner, head of the E.P.A., asserts that the policy \n     will spur development of renewable energy sources. But the \n     impact looms small when stacked against the obvious defects. \n     President Clinton is twisting high-minded environmental \n     promises into low-minded favors for special interests.\n\n\n additional gasoline costs from proposed renewable fuels standard for \n              years 2003-2007 (average increase in $/gal)\n\n       Hart Downstream Energy Services (Hart) compiled the \n     following information based on the recent analysis from the \n     Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration \n     (EIA). According to EIA's analysis, the impact of the fuels \n     provisions contained in S517 will cause conventional gasoline \n     prices to rise by 4 cents per gallon, and Reformulated \n     Gasoline (RFG) prices to rise by approximately 9.75 cents per \n     gallon.\n       Assuming annual growth in U.S. gasoline demand of 2 \n     percent, Hart measured the impact on each individual state by \n     calculating the total gasoline cost increase and the total \n     gallons of conventional gasoline and/or RFG sold in each \n     state.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Gasoline\n                            State                                price\n                                                               increase\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama.....................................................       0.04\nAlaska......................................................       0.04\nArizona.....................................................       0.076\nArkansas....................................................       0.04\nCalifornia..................................................       0.096\nColorado....................................................       0.04\nConnecticut.................................................       0.097\nDelaware....................................................       0.097\nDistrict of Columbia........................................       0.097\nFlorida.....................................................       0.04\nGeorgia.....................................................       0.04\nHawaii......................................................       0.04\nIdaho.......................................................       0.04\nIllinois....................................................       0.073\nIndiana.....................................................       0.049\nIowa........................................................       0.04\nKansas......................................................       0.04\nKentucky....................................................       0.054\nLouisiana...................................................       0.042\nMaine.......................................................       0.04\nMaryland....................................................       0.091\nMassachusetts...............................................       0.097\nMichigan....................................................       0.04\nMinnesota...................................................       0.04\nMissouri....................................................       0.056\nMississippi.................................................       0.04\nMontana.....................................................       0.04\nNebraska....................................................       0.04\nNew Hampshire...............................................       0.084\nNew Jersey..................................................       0.091\nNew Mexico..................................................       0.04\nNew York....................................................       0.071\nNevada......................................................       0.04\nNorth Carolina..............................................       0.04\nNorth Dakota................................................       0.04\nOhio........................................................       0.04\nOklahoma....................................................       0.04\nOregon......................................................       0.04\nPennsylvania................................................       0.055\nRhode Island................................................       0.097\nSouth Carolina..............................................       0.04\nSouth Dakota................................................       0.04\nTennessee...................................................       0.04\n\n[[Page S2515]]\n\n \nTexas.......................................................       0.057\nUtah........................................................       0.04\nVermont.....................................................       0.04\nVirginia....................................................       0.072\nWashington..................................................       0.04\nWest Virginia...............................................       0.04\nWisconsin...................................................       0.055\nWyoming.....................................................       0.04\n \n    Aggregate Annual Cost Impact of All 50 States: $8,389\n                           Billion\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Energy Information Administration (EIA), ``Impact of Renewable\n  Fuels Provisions of S1766,'' March 12, 2002. Compiled by Hart\n  Downstream Energy Services.\n\n                Amendment No. 3115 to Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I send another amendment to the desk which delays the \nbeginning date from 2004 to 2005. It is sent to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Boxer and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself \n     and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 3115.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To modify the provision relating to the renewable content of \n motor vehicle fuel to eliminate the required volume of renewable fuel \n                        for calendar year 2004)\n\n       On page 189, line 3, strike ``2004'' and insert ``2005''.\n       On page 189, line 5, strike ``2004'' and insert ``2005''.\n       On page 189, line 8, strike ``2004'' and insert ``2005''.\n       On page 189, in the table between lines 10 and 11, strike \n     the item relating to calendar year 2004.\n       On page 193, line 10, strike ``2004'' and insert ``2005''.\n       On page 194, line 21, strike ``2004'' and insert ``2005''.\n       On page 196, line 17, strike ``2004'' and insert ``2005''.\n       On page 197, line 4, strike ``2004'' and insert ``2005''.\n       On page 199, line 4, strike ``2004'' and insert ``2005''.\n       On page 199, line 17, strike ``2004'' and insert ``2005''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This is modest and delays the implementation of the \nethanol mandate by a year, eliminating a requirement to use 2.3 million \ngallons of ethanol in 2004 and will give States more time to make \nessential infrastructure, refinery, and storage improvements.\n  This is an essential modification since virtually all ethanol, as has \nbeen explained, comes by tank--not pipeline--from the Midwest.\n  Although the ethanol industry says they can meet the future demand, \nvirtually every single expert we have talked with has said delivery \ninterruptions and shortfalls are likely, if not inevitable.\n  I ask I be included as a cosponsor of the amendment of Senator \nSchumer to strike the renewable fuels section of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send to the desk to be printed in \nthe Record an editorial from the Sacramento Bee entitled ``Highway \nRobbery,'' which essentially characterizes what this does to the \nhighway trust fund, how it hurts the country, how energy experts show \nthat producing ethanol from corn requires more energy than the fuel \nproduces, and that the ethanol mandate would make the country more \nfossil fuel dependent, not less.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Sacramento Bee, Apr. 8, 2002]\n\n          Highway Robbery--Corn Is for Eating, Not for Driving\n\n       Here's another piece of the ethanol idiocy in Washington: \n     Not only will Californians soon have to pay more for gasoline \n     laced with corn liquor, but as a result, we'll have less \n     money to alleviate congestion on our roads.\n       Blame this nonsense on Senator Majority Leader Tom Daschle, \n     D-S.D., and President Bush. They are pushing a provision for \n     the Senate energy bill that would require gasoline producers \n     to use rising amounts of ethanol. Ethanol is mostly made from \n     corn in states that Bush would dearly like to win in the next \n     election.\n       The measure would eliminate the current requirement in the \n     Clear Air Act that smoggy areas use gasoline containing an \n     oxygen additive--either ethanol or MTBE. But then it goes \n     ahead to require that refineries triple their purchases of \n     ethanol for gasoline by 2012.\n       The mandate hurts consumers in obvious ways: It will drive \n     up the cost of driving, taking dollars out of the pockets of \n     motorists and putting them into the coffers of Archer Daniels \n     Midland, the Enron of the Corn Belt, which dominates the \n     ethanol market. (Why is it that the politicians who are eager \n     to give back their Enron donations seem to have no trouble \n     taking money from--and giving billions in benefits to--a \n     company that was convicted of price fixing a few years ago?)\n       The mandate will also hurt the country. Although ethanol is \n     touted as a renewable fuel, a recent study by Cornell \n     University scientist David Pimentel shows that producing \n     ethanol from corn actually requires more energy than the fuel \n     produces. The ethanol mandate would thus make the country \n     more fossil-fuel dependent, not less.\n       But the mandate will also hit in a less obvious way: It \n     will take dollars away from transportation investment. That's \n     because ethanol already gets another federal subsidy--the \n     federal fuel tax at the pump is a nickel less on fuel \n     containing ethanol. If the Daschle-Bush ethanol mandate is \n     passed, federal revenues for transportation repair, operation \n     and construction will plummet by nearly $3 billion a year, \n     transportation experts estimate.\n       So this is what Californians get from the proposed Daschle-\n     Bush ethanol bailout--higher prices at the pump and more \n     crowded roads. It gives the term ``highway robbery'' a whole \n     new dimension.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have listened to portions of the \ndebate this morning. Obviously, on the issue of ethanol we will have \nextended discussion, but I am sympathetic to the concerns expressed by \nthe Senator from California and the Senator from New York. It addresses \nan underlying situation in this country of which we should all be \naware. The mandate on ethanol in the energy bill is quite clear, and \nthe realization that the ethanol industry is not prepared, does not \nhave current capacity.\n  As a consequence, more gasoline will have to be used. That brings \ninto focus the reality of where our gasoline comes from; it comes from \ncrude oil. Where does crude oil come from? Most of it comes from \noverseas. We are seeing a price increase for a couple of reasons. The \neffectiveness of the OPEC cartel, which some time ago set a floor of \n$22 and a ceiling of $28, is shown with the price of oil up to $27. We \nare seeing a situation escalate in the Middle East. Saddam Hussein, who \nis supplying this Nation with roughly a million barrels a day, has \nindicated he is going to cease production for 30 days. Venezuela, our \nneighbor, that we depend on from the standpoint of proximity, is on \nstrike. It is estimated the United States, in the last few days, has \nlost 30 percent of its available imports. These are the underlying \nissues associated with the debate in the sense of price.\n  Where does gasoline come from? It comes from crude oil. Where does \ncrude oil come from? From overseas, because we have increased our \ndependence on those sources. It gets more complex when considering the \nmotivation occurring as a consequence of the policies of Saddam Hussein \nand Iraq. He is paying the families of those who sacrificed their lives \nto kill people in Israel. It used to be $10,000 per family; now it is \n$25,000 per family. This whole thing is escalating. It is escalating as \na consequence of the costs of oil increasing because that is where the \ncashflow emanates.\n  Procedurally, may I make an inquiry as to where we are on the timing \nand so forth?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an order to proceed to another \nmeasure at 11:30.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent for 4 more minutes, until such \ntime as I see Members are ready to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will note the presence of the \nmanager for the majority. Is there objection to the request to proceed \nfor 4 minutes?\n  Mr. DODD. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me summarize the dilemma. By our \nown inaction, we are seeing, if you will, greater vulnerability as this \ncountry increases its dependence on imported\n\n[[Page S2516]]\n\noil. As I have indicated, Venezuela is on strike. Iraq has terminated \nits production. We are told there is a grave threat in Colombia by \nrevolutionists who are threatening to blow up the pipeline. There are \ncomplications now that the Saudis have been accused of funding, if you \nwill, terrorist activities associated with the deaths of Israelis and \nthe bombings, human bombings that have taken place.\n  As we address this vulnerability, we have to recognize the reality. \nIt focuses in on the current debate on ethanol. As we look at where we \nare, we are going to have to have more gasoline in California; we are \ngoing to have to have more gasoline in New York. The price is going to \ngo up.\n  Our alternatives, it seems to me, are quite obvious. We should reduce \nour dependence on imported sources. That brings us to the ANWR debate \nwhich will be taking place very soon.\n  Finally, the Schumer amendment would strike the renewable fuels \nstandards, as we know, contained in section 819 of the bill. That \nportion called for mandated use of renewable motor fuels such as \nethanol and biodiesel. This mandate is part of a larger package of \nprovisions on MTBE and boutique fuels, and I am certainly supportive of \nreducing the boutique fuels.\n  I am not usually a big fan of mandates, but the renewable fuel \nstandards will reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  I will have more to say later, but I encourage my colleagues to \nparticipate in this discussion and recognize the significance of our \nincreased vulnerability and why we are going to be using the gasoline \nwhen in reality we will be paying for it.\n  I find it ironic that California is dependent on Alaska, and as \nAlaskan oil declines, that dependence is going to shift over to the \nimportation of oil to California from Iran, Iraq, wherever--Saudi \nArabia. Of course, New York is dependent on Venezuelan oil as well. If \nwe do not do something domestically, we are going to pay the piper.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/11/senate-section/article/S2516-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2516-S2527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             EQUAL PROTECTION OF VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The modification to the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert page 13, line \n     12 through page 14, line 7 of the amendment.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is a big day for the Senate. After \na year and a half of discussions, negotiations, introduction, and \nreintroduction of legislation, we are finally prepared to pass a \ncomprehensive, truly bipartisan election reform bill.\n  I say ``finally,'' but the truth is, a year and a half is lightning \nfast in the Senate. Senator Torricelli and I proposed a comprehensive \nelection reform bill before the dust had settled in Florida. Shortly \nafter, Senator Torricelli and I joined with Senator Schumer to put \ntogether yet another bill which garnered the support of 71 Senators--\nfairly evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. Senator Dodd, \nmeanwhile, introduced legislation that was supported by all Democratic \nSenators.\n  Four months ago, Senators Dodd, Bond, Schumer, Torricelli, and I \nreached a bipartisan compromise. That was brought before this body in \nFebruary. Through the passage of thoughtful amendments offered by my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, we have substantially improved \nthe underlying bill. The final product is legislation which ensures \nthat all Americans who are eligible to vote, and who have the right to \nvote, are able to do so, and to do so only once. This bill strengthens \nthe integrity of the process so that voters know that their right to \nvote is not diluted through fraud committed by others. This legislation \nwill make American election systems more accurate, more accessible, and \nmore honest while respecting the primacy of States and localities in \nthe administration of elections.\n\n  I look forward to a House-Senate conference so that soon we may move \neven closer toward enactment of a law that will improve America's \nelection systems.\n  I thank Senator Dodd for his steadfast and persistent leadership on \nthis issue. He truly has been the champion of promoting accessibility \nin elections. My thanks to Senator Bond who gave us our rallying cry \nbehind this bill, ``making it easier to vote, and harder to cheat.'' \nThis bill does just that and Senator Bond deserves the lion's share of \nthe credit for that accomplishment. I also thank Senator Schumer, who \njoined with me nearly 1 year ago to advance a new approach to this \nissue. Any my thanks to Senator Torricelli, who has been there from the \nbeginning with me in this exercise. I thank you all for your hard work \nand perseverance which has brought us to this triumphant moment.\n  Before I yield the floor, I would like to reiterate my strong \nopposition to the Clinton amendment which we will vote on shortly. The \namendment creates a federally mandated acceptable error rate that is a \none size fits all number. This approach is completely contrary to every \nother provision of this legislation.\n  If adopted, this amendment would do three things:\n  No. 1, Deliver the Department of Justice into our home States to \nprosecute our State and local election officials for choices made by or \nerrors committed by voters;\n  No. 2, Undermine the sanctity of the secret ballot and\n  No. 3, Force the elimination of many voting systems used across this \ncountry.\n  On that last point, I urge my colleagues who hail from States which \nuse paper ballots, mail-in voting or absentee voting to take a close \nlook at this amendment. Your States will have a choice: change their \nsystems or recruit top notch legal talent to defend themselves in \ncourt.\n  This choice will also be faced by States using lever machines, punch \ncared systems, optical scans, and DRE machines.\n  If this amendment is agreed to, perhaps we should move to increase \nthe Justice Department appropriation so that it can ready a team of \nlawyers for each State.\n  Finally, I thank my staff on the Rules Committee: Brian Lewis, Leon \nSequeira, Chris Moore, Hugh Farrish, and our staff director, Tam \nSomerville--all of whom have been deeply involved in this issue from \nthe beginning--and, from Senator Dodd's staff, Shawn Maher, Kenny Gill, \nRonnie Gillespie, we have enjoyed working with them.\n  Also, on Senator Bond's staff, Julile Dammann and Jack Bartling have \nbeen truly outstanding. It has been a pleasure to work with them.\n  On Senator Schumer's staff, Sharon Levin; and, on Senator \nTorricelli's staff, Sarah Wills--we appreciate the opportunity to work \nwith all of these folks in developing this legislation.\n  I see my colleague from Missouri is here. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S2517]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, how much time is available on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. I will not require that much time, but \nplease advise me if I go over 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I come back again to congratulate and thank the \nchairman and ranking member of this committee, Senator Dodd and Senator \nMcConnell, for their great work.\n  It has been 10 long, arduous months to do something that is vitally \nimportant to the health and the vitality of our system of legislative \ngovernment. The 2000 election opened the eyes of many Americans to the \nflaws and failures of our election machinery, our voting systems, and \neven how we determine what a vote is. We learned of hanging chads, \ninactive lists, and we discovered our military votes were mishandled \nand lost. We learned that legal voters were turned away while dead \nvoters cast ballots. We discovered that many people voted twice while \ntoo many were not even counted once.\n  That is why we are here today. The final compromise bill--and it is a \ncompromise in the true essence of the word--tries to address each of \nthese fundamental problems we have discovered and to meet the basic \ntest. That test, I trust all of my colleagues now understand, is that \nwe must make it easier to vote but tough to cheat.\n  In the 2000 elections, fraud was prevalent. Fraud was too frequently \nfound. Among the most bizarre and fraudulent efforts that occurred in \nSt. Louis was the filing of a lawsuit by a dead man to keep the polls \nopen beyond closing time because he feared the long lines would prevent \nhim from voting. That probably wasn't the only problem he had. His \nidentification was later switched to that of a partisan political \noperative for a congressional candidate even though evidence showed \nthat man had already voted that day. Unfortunately, the practice of the \ndeceased voting was not limited to the lawsuit to keep the polls open. \nWe have had a number of ballot registrations made in the name of people \nwho have departed this earthly veil.\n\n  Albert ``Red'' Villa registered to vote on the 10th anniversary of \nhis death--truly a significant theological effort. The deceased mother \nof a prosecuting attorney in St. Louis City was also registered to \nvote.\n  This was the mayoral primary of 2001 which got people excited in St. \nLouis because it wasn't a minor election where we just voted for the \nPresident, the Governor, the Senators, and Congress. We were talking \nabout relevant votes there. We were talking about the race for the \nmayor's office which controls votes and which controls jobs in the City \nof St. Louis.\n  We also had our own outrageous system of provisional voting underway \nin St. Louis City. People went to judges and said they didn't show up \non the registration list so they asked for court orders to be permitted \nto vote. Some of the reasons given, which were accepted by our \njudiciary, were that they should be allowed to vote because they were \nlegally registered. One of them said: I am him a Democrat. The other \nsaid: I wanted to vote for Gore. The other said: I was suffering from a \nmental illness. My favorite was: I am a convicted felon and didn't \nrealize I had to reregister. That person, and 1,300 others, were \nallowed to vote even though it is against the law for a felon to vote \nin Missouri.\n  Subsequent investigation by the secretary of state in Missouri found \nthat 97 percent of those who were ordered to vote by judges voted \nillegally. They were not entitled to vote.\n  That is why the whole structure of this bill is so important. \nProvisional voting will be permitted, but actually putting the ballot \nin the ballot box will be delayed until there has been an opportunity \nto ascertain that the person is a registered voter.\n  We have seen fraud. I think perhaps it was best described by the \nMissouri Court of Appeals in shutting down the fraudulent effort to \nkeep the polls open. The argument in St. Louis City was that the \nDemocratically controlled City Election Board in the Democratic City of \nSt. Louis was conspiring to keep the Democratic voters in St. Louis \nCity from voting for Democratic candidates. That was the suit filed by \nthe dead man who said that the long lines kept him from voting. The \nMissouri Court of Appeals said it best in its order shutting down the \npolls when it said:\n\n       Commendable zeal to protect voting rights must be tempered \n     by the corresponding duty to protect the integrity of the \n     voting process. Equal vigilance is required to ensure that \n     only those entitled to vote are allowed to cast a ballot. \n     Otherwise, the rights of those lawfully entitled to vote are \n     inevitably diluted.\n\n  We have seen not only people who have rightfully been denied the \nopportunity to vote. Unfortunately, the votes of those who have the \nright to vote have been diluted and have been canceled because fraud \nhas been prevalent in St. Louis, and I believe in other areas of the \ncountry.\n  This bill goes a long way towards achieving the goal of making it \neasier to vote and harder to cheat.\n\n  I urge the support of my colleagues for this very important \nbipartisan measure. I extend my thanks to the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the Rules Committee.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, and 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New York, Mr. Schumer.\n  For the information of Members, at the conclusion of that, depending \non the time left of my friend from Kentucky, we will close debate, and \nthere will be a vote on the Roberts amendment, then a vote on the \nClinton amendment, and then a vote on final passage. That is how this \nwill play out over the next 45 minutes or an hour.\n\n  So with that, let me turn to my colleague from Oregon and thank him \nand the Senator from New York for their tremendous support and tireless \neffort on behalf of this piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I begin by expressing my thanks to Senator \nDodd and Senator McConnell. Both of them worked tirelessly with me and \nSenator Cantwell and others.\n  This legislation we will vote on will now protect an innovation, a \npioneering step forward that I think is going to make a huge difference \nfor the American people; that is, voting by mail.\n  What we saw earlier, as the debate went forward, was various \nproposals that would have put new hurdles, new obstacles in front of \nthis legislation that has empowered thousands and thousands of \nAmericans. I am very proud that my State has led the way in this \ninnovative approach, but I think it is the wave of the future.\n  There is a reason why millions of older people and disabled people \nand others enjoy and prefer voting by mail. They like the convenience, \nand they understand that it meets the test that Senator Bond and others \nhave talked about, which would be a winning combination for the \nAmerican people.\n  Let's make it easier to vote but not easier to cheat. Voting by mail \nhas proven it is up to that challenge. We have shown in our State that \nwe will come down with a every aggressive effort against those who try \nto abuse the system, try to exploit it. We have not seen any \nsignificant problem with it.\n  It is a bipartisan effort. Senator Smith has joined with me in it. \nSenator Cantwell has made the case for the State of Washington.\n  I close by saying that over many months Senator Dodd and Senator \nMcConnell, knowing that we were camped out with their staffs, could \nhave said, look, this is an issue that only a couple States care about, \nbut they did not. I think they have showed their commitment not just to \nprotecting people in Oregon or Washington who feel so passionately \nabout this subject, but I think they understand this truly is a \npioneering step forward. It is part of the wave of future. It is the \nnext step before we see people voting online.\n  From the beginning of this debate, I have said that this legislation \nshould be about deferring voter fraud and promoting voter \nparticipation. Many weeks of negotiations finally have produced an \nagreement that I believe will do both.\n  If first-time Oregon voter Mabel Barnes had mailed in her ballot \nunder the election reform bill that was on the Senate floor 6 weeks \nago, her vote probably would not have counted--even\n\n[[Page S2518]]\n\nif she were legally registered to vote. Her vote would have been tossed \naway simply because she failed to include with it a photo ID or other \nproof of identification.\n  Mabel Barnes would not have been alone. Under the bill that was on \nthe Senate floor then, millions of first-time voters would have been \ndisenfranchised just because they failed to bring a copy of their photo \nID to the polls.\n  But Mabel Barnes and millions of other first-time voters won't have \nto worry about their votes counting now, and they won't have to worry \nabout stopping by a copy center before they vote. That's because over \nthe course of the last few weeks Senators Cantwell, Bond, McConnell, \nMurray, and I have worked out an agreement that protects Oregon's vote-\nby-mail system and the right to have every mail-in-vote by a legally \nregistered first-time voter count.\n  The agreement Senators Cantwell, Bond, McConnell, Murray, and I \nworked out gives voters who register by mail more options to verify \ntheir identity. Instead of a photo ID or proof of residence, first-time \nvoters in a state may put their driver's license number or the last \nfour digits of their social security card on their registration card. \nThis means they won't have to stop by a copy center before they \nregister or before they vote. This will mean business as usual for the \npetition drives and campus registration efforts in Oregon, where \nthousands of first-time voters register by mail.\n  The agreement also guarantees that voters who cast their ballots by \nmail have the same provisional or replacement ballot rights as voters \nwho go to the polls. Under the agreement if a first-time voter in a \nstate fails to supply a driver's license number or the last four digits \nof their social security number when they register, their vote will \nstill count if state election officials determine they are eligible \nunder state law. In Oregon, this means that the vote of every legally \nregistered Oregonian will count if an election official verifies that \nthe signature on the ballot matches the signature on file with the \nregistration.\n  Under the agreement, Oregon's pioneering vote-by-mail system will \ncontinue, unchanged.\n  I understand where the photo ID requirement sprang from: a concern \nthat mail-in voter registration and balloting engender fraud. But in \nOregon--the only all vote-by-mail state and the state that pioneered \nmotor voter--there is very little fraud. No one has come forward with \nproof of widespread fraud in Oregon. In fact, I was elected to the \nUnited States Senate in the first all vote-by-mail special election. \nSenator Gordon Smith, my opponent in that race, never raised any \nquestions about fraud. Oregon's penalties for fraud are much tougher \nthan federal law--up to $100,000 in fines and or 5 years in jail.\n  Since Oregonians voted overwhelmingly to use a vote-by-mail system, \nparticipation has gone up and fraud has gone down. In fact, in the last \nfederal election, 80 percent of the registered voters cast a ballot. \nSince the May 1996 primary, 13 cases of fraud have been prosecuted; \nconvictions were won in five and eight are still pending. In the last \nfederal election, only 192 ballots were not counted because they failed \nthe signature verification test. This is a pretty good record.\n  This legislation should be about deterring voter fraud and not voter \nparticipation. The agreement Senators Cantwell, Bond, McConnell, \nMurray, and I have reached does this. The time to fight fraud is at the \nbeginning of the process--at the time of registration. That is what our \nagreement does. At the same time, I have also said that legislation \nshould not make it harder for legally registered voters to cast a \nballot, or discourage people from voting. The agreement will do this as \nwell.\n  This has not been an easy task. I want to commend Senators Bond, \nCantwell, McConnell, and Murray for sticking with the negotiations, and \nI especially want to thank Chairman Dodd for the support he and his \nstaff have given us in reaching the agreement and in including it in \nthe managers' package.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I reiterate what I said last night. \nSenator Dodd was indefatigable on this bill. It would not have happened \nwithout him. Senator McConnell was steadfast in terms of principle, \nsticking to what he believed but making sure we had a bill done. I \nthank them both for their leadership as well as my other colleagues who \nworked so hard on this bill.\n  Mr. President, democracy works slowly--sometimes too slowly--but \ninexorably. We had the great scandal in Florida where people could not \nvote, where people's votes were not counted, where people voted for the \nwrong person despite their intention.\n  Now, almost 2 years later, we are doing something very real about it. \nI wish it had come sooner, but this bill has been worth waiting for.\n  And the problem is not just in Florida, as we learned. In my State of \nNew York, I voted, first, in 1969. I used the same exact type of \nmachine when I voted in 2001, despite all of our technological changes. \nAnd the lines to vote in New York are legion. Just because we are the \nworld's oldest democracy does not mean we have to use the world's \noldest technology.\n  At the core of this bill is a view that that changes, that we will \nhelp the States update.\n  Despite the strength of our democracy, if we do not do a good job \nmaintaining the actual mechanism that drives it--our voting systems--we \nfail the voters and undermine the values for which our Founding Fathers \nfought and died.\n  Voting should be accessible, accurate, and speedy in all places, all \nof the time. This is not a someplace, some-of-the-time proposition. The \nright to vote is too sacred. This bill provides both the funds and the \nstandards to make sure that exactly happens.\n  So I urge all my colleagues to have a rousing vote of support for \nthis bill. We often have an opportunity to support legislation that \nmakes our lives better. That is why we are here. But today we have an \nopportunity to make a little history. And it is something we will never \nforget.\n\n\n                     provisional voting and vermont\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would first like to thank Senator Dodd \nfor all his hard work on this very important bill. This legislation \nwill help ensure that the problems that occurred during the 2000 \nelections will not happen again, and hopefully increase the number of \nAmericans that participate in the most sacred right of a democracy, \nvoting. I would like to take this opportunity though to discuss the \nprovisional voting section of the bill and its effect on the affidavit \nvoting system we have in Vermont.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Jeffords for his early \nsupport of reform of the election system. I also appreciate his hard \nwork to ensure that the good qualities of Vermont's election system are \nprotected and replicated around the United States. I would be pleased \nto take the time to answer any question he may have on the provisional \nvoting section of the bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. In Vermont when a person arrives at the polling place \nto vote and their name does not appear on the voter checklist, even \nthough they believe they have properly registered, we have a system \nthat would allow them to cast a ballot. The voter completes an \naffidavit form swearing that they had properly applied but were not \nadded to the voter checklist. The form is reviewed by the Board of \nCivil Authority at the polling place and unless the information appears \nfalse the person is allowed to cast a ballot. If the information \nappears to be false, the Board of Civil Authority will not allow the \nperson to cast a ballot and refers them to a local judge to get added \nto the voter checklist for the election that day.\n  The ballots cast this way are counted exactly like the other ballots \nand included in the final totals. The information from the approved \naffidavits is immediately used to update the voter checklist. My \nquestion to you Senator Dodd is that while this system is not called a \nprovisional balloting system it appears to me that the affidavit voting \nsystem conforms to all the requirements in this legislation, and \ntherefore the State of Vermont would already have satisfied the \nprovisional balloting requirements of the bill?\n  Mr. DODD. I would agree with the Senator from Vermont. In mine and\n\n[[Page S2519]]\n\nmy staff's review of different States' election procedures, Vermont's \nsystem of affidavit voting would satisfy the provisional balloting \nrequirements of this legislation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I appreciate Senator Dodd's clarification of this \nissue, and look forward with working with him to ensure enactment of \nthis important legislation.\n\n\n                     Maine's Same Day Registration\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Maine has same day registration so a voter can register \nat the polls or at a public office nearby and vote on the same day. If \nsomeone challenges the voter's right on that day, the ballot is marked \nas a challenged ballot. If a voter goes to the polls to vote and does \nnot have identification or does not appear on the voting rolls, the \npresiding election official will challenge the voter, and his or her \nballot will be treated as a challenged vote. The presiding election \nofficial keeps a list of voters challenged and the reason why they were \nchallenged. After the time for voting expires, the presiding election \nofficial seals the list. The challenged votes are counted on election \nday. In the event of a recount, and if the challenged ballots could \nmake a difference in the outcome of the election, the ballots and list \nare examined by the appropriate authority. The distinguished chairman \nof the Senate Committee on Rules has done excellent work crafting the \nimportant bill before us. I would ask him whether, then, Maine's system \ncomply with this Election Reform Act?\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator from Maine for her excellent question \nand for her steadfast support for election reform efforts. Let me \nassure her that Maine's system does comply with the Election Reform \nAct.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would like to thank the senior Senator from \nConnecticut for his assistance and congratulate him on the impending \npassage of this bill.\n\n\n               election day as national holiday colloquy\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my good friend from Connecticut and commend him \nfor his hard work on this bill; I agree with him when he refers to this \nas ``landmark legislation.'' The Dodd-McConnell compromise makes many \nnecessary improvements in our current elections system and moves us \ntoward the ultimate goal that we all share of ensuring that our \nelections are fair, accurate and accessible to all.\n  In addition to securing the fairness of elections, however, I believe \nthat it is in the best interest of our Nation, as with any \nrepresentative democracy, to see that as many people as possible \nparticipate in the process. Would my friend from Connecticut agree with \nme that ensuring high turnout at the voting booth is also an important \ngoal in terms of improving our electoral process?\n  Mr. DODD. I certainly agree with my good friend from California, and \nhope that this bill will help achieve that goal by improving \naccessibility, offering ballot materials in alternative languages and \nby addressing some of the things that can make the voting process \nintimidating or confusing.\n  Mrs. BOXER. One idea that has come up time and again in conversation \nwith my constituents and various organizations in my State of \nCalifornia, is the possibility of creating a Federal holiday on \nelection day. I think that this would be one of the most effective ways \nto ensure that as many people as possible have an opportunity to cast \ntheir vote and exercise that most fundamental democratic right. Many of \nthe hard-working people in this country--people for whom election day \nrepresents a unique opportunity to make their voices heard--find it \ndifficult to get to the polls. Many work long hours, or have children \nthat they have to get to school. Would the Senator from Connecticut \nagree that we should make it easier for these people to cast their vote \nas well?\n  Mr. DODD. I agree with the Senator from California, and I would tell \nher that is the idea behind the entire legislation. We want to make \nsure that all eligible voters have an opportunity to cast their ballot \nand have it counted fairly and accurately.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I had considered offering an amendment to this bill that \nwould in fact create a federal holiday on election day to help give as \nmany people as possible the opportunity to vote. I would ask my friend \nfrom Connecticut if such a proposal was ever considered when this bill \nwas being drafted?\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my friend from California that I did consider \nincluding a provision to that effect in the bill. We looked into the \nramifications such a provision would have and, with time running short, \nultimately concluded that there were too many variables and that we \nsimply did not have enough information to include it as a requirement \nin the bill. We did, however, instruct the Election Administration \nCommittee--the new election oversight body created by the bill--to \nconduct a study on conducting elections on different days, at different \nplaces, and during different hours, including the possibility of \ncreating an election day holiday.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I hope that such a study would be thorough in \ninvestigating each of those possibilities and that it would be \nconducted as soon as reasonably possible. If such a study were to \nconclude that the creation of an election day holiday was possible and \nwould indeed further the goals of this bill, we would want to begin the \nprocess of making it happen as soon as possible. Could my friend from \nConnecticut assure me that this study will be thorough and will be \nundertaken promptly upon enactment of this legislation?\n  Mr. DODD. I share the Senator from California's interest in moving \nforward with such a study as soon as is possible.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I look forward to working with my good friend from \nConnecticut in pushing the Commission to complete the study. In the \nmeantime, I am introducing legislation to establish election day in \nPresidential election years as a legal public holiday.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator from California.\n\n\n                           electronic voting\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to commend \nSenators Dodd, McConnell, Schumer, and Bond for their dedication and \ndiligence in addressing what I believe to be an issue of critical \nimportance to our country--protecting voting rights and ensuring the \nintegrity of the electoral system in our Nation. Especially given the \nevents in the world today, making certain that each citizen's vote is \ncounted and promoting public trust and confidence in our election \nprocess is crucial.\n  The State of Washington has a long and trusted history as a leader in \nelection administration. Through great efforts and cooperation, the \nstate has pioneered such programs as Motor Voter, provisional \nballoting, vote by mail, and absentee voting.\n  I would like to thank Senator Dodd, the chairman of the Rules \ncommittee for his support for an amendment that I offered with Senator \nMurray's support that has been adopted. The amendment guarantees that \nstates are able to continue using mail-in voting, while also providing \nnew safeguards to make mail-in voters aware of how to properly fill out \ntheir ballots, and how, if needed to obtain a replacement.\n  Voters in my State are proud of our system that offers voters the \noption of voting by mail or in the polling place, and they are \nextremely committed to seeing it continue. The mail-in ballot, in my \nopinion, offers voters several advantages. First, it allows voters to \ncast their ballots on their own time and at their own convenience. It \nalso allows voters to make more informed choices, as they are able to \nconsult literature sent by the State and by the campaigns in making \ntheir decisions. Because these votes are cast without the pressure of \nother voters waiting in line, or without the time crunch of being late \nto work or to pickup the kids, voters are also less likely to make \nmistakes that will disqualify their ballots.\n  In addition, the mail-in system is very secure. Each ballot that is \ncast by mail requires, that the voter sign the outer envelope. This \nsignature is then checked against the voters signature that is kept on \nfile and only when there is agreement that the signatures match is the \nballot counted. Washington State has consistently increased the number \nof voters choosing to vote by mail and through provisional voting \nwithout any allegations that these types of voting have involved fraud \nor other misconduct. In fact, the procedures in place have consistently \nensured the integrity and security of our elections and led to public \nconfidence in our system that is unparalleled anywhere in the country.\n\n[[Page S2520]]\n\n  It has not always been this way. In the early 1990s, we had several \nclose elections that pointed out the vulnerabilities in our system. \nThese close elections led Washington to become one of the first States \nto adopt statewide guidelines that ensured that each jurisdiction \nfollowed the same rules in determining how ballots are verified and \ncounted. In addition, my State also adopted other requirements for \ntesting and procedural consistency. It is my hope that this legislation \nwill lead other states to follow our example and institute similar \nguidelines and procedures that will result in more people voting and \nmaking sure that all votes are properly cast and counted.\n  Our challenge, at the Federal level, is to ensure that in passing \nlegislation that reduces hurdles to civic participation across the \ncountry, we respect the role of the States in selecting types of voting \nthat work well for their citizens and lead to maximum participation. I \nbelieve that this bill as amended does that, and I would like to thank \nthe chairman of the Rules Committee for his commitment to this bill and \nto ensuring that states have the flexibility to keep their systems in \nplace.\n  I would like to address one additional point. In drafting \nlegislation, it is often very difficult to look to the future and \nanticipate the impact that legislation will have on new technologies. \nTo truly reform the Federal election process, this legislation must \nremedy the infirmities of the present system. However, it also must be \nforward-looking in its approach. It should welcome the implementation \nof new election technologies. The flexibility of this legislation to \naccommodate innovation will be the ultimate strength of federal \nelection reform.\n  I firmly believe that voting by computer, whether by internet or some \nother remote electronic system, is likely to happen in many states in \nthe near future. In fact, Arizona has already held a party caucus in \nwhich voters were permitted to vote over the internet. At the same \ntime, I believe that the security concerns are such that most States, \nmine included, are not yet ready to provide this option to voters.\n  However, in the interests of looking to the future, I would like to \nseek clarification from the chairman of the Rules Committee about how \nthis legislation would affect internet or other forms of remote \nelectronic voting.\n  Is it the Chairman's understanding that the bill as it is currently \nwritten would not prevent States from offering voters the option of \nvoting on the internet, so long as the State could show that the \ninternet voting system complied with the security protocol standards \nwritten by the new Election Administration Commission, and that the \nvoting system also complied with the requirements of the legislation on \naccessibility for the disabled, providing an audit trail of ballots, \nand by providing voters a means to make certain they had not made a \nmistake?\n  Mr. DODD. I agree with Senator Cantwell that very serious concerns \nremain about voting by internet. As she knows, this legislation \nspecifically requests that the new organization, the Election \nAdministration Commission, study internet voting. I am looking forward \nto seeing what it learns. However, I hope very much that States will \nthink very carefully before moving to internet voting, and will make \nsure that the security concerns are fully addressed.\n  That said, the Senator is correct that nothing in this bill prohibits \nstates from implementing voting on a remote electronic system like the \ninternet, as long as the system is certified by the new Election \nAdministration Commission, and complies with the other standards in the \nlegislation.\n  I agree with the Senator that it is important to welcome the \ndevelopment of new election technologies and it was my intent, and my \ncosponsors' intent to provide the states as much flexibility as \npossible to accommodate innovation while still implementing necessary \nminimum standards that will ensure that all our citizens' right to vote \nis protected.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate all your efforts \non this legislation, and I agree that this bill is drafted in a manner \nthat will not limit the development and implementation of new election \ntechnologies so long as the new technologies satisfy security protocols \nand meet the requirements of the minimum standards. I also hope that \nthis legislation will in fact spur the development of new election \ntechnologies that are more voter friendly and more cost efficient.\n\n\n          Interactive Voter Registration and Funding Mechanism\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to commend the sponsors of the \nelection reform bill that is before the Senate today. I especially want \nto recognize Senators Dodd  and McConnell who have worked tirelessly to \novercome many obstacles in an effort to strengthen the fundamental \nright of all citizens to participate in the democratic process. I \nwholeheartedly support their overarching goal to make it easier for \nevery eligible American to vote and to have their voted counted and I \nappreciate their willingness to work with me to address some specific \nconcerns about how the bill may impact my home State of Arkansas.\n  I wish to engage in a brief colloquy with Chairman Dodd to clarify \nfor the record his understanding of how two specific provisions in the \nlegislation will work in practice. The first point I want to raise \ninvolves the requirement in the Senate bill that all States implement a \nstatewide interactive voter registration list. Is it the Senator's \nunderstanding that States can meet this requirement by having an \ninteractive computer containing voter registration information at each \ncounty clerk's office but not at each individual polling location?\n  Mr. DODD. As the lead sponsor of the Senate bill, I am pleased to \nreassure the Senator from Arkansas that State and local election \nofficials would not have to place an interactive computer containing \nvoter registration information at each polling place to meet the \nrequirements of this legislation. As my colleague from Arkansas \nindicated, States could met this particular requirement if they had an \ninteractive computer containing the States' voter registration list at \neach county clerk's office. I and others who crafted this language were \naware that polling places in Arkansas and in many other States lack \nphone service and therefore it would be impractical to set up a \ncomputer network or the like at each polling location during every \nFederal election.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank my colleague for his comments. Another concern \nthat has been brought to my attention is the funding mechanism in the \nSenate bill. I know my colleague from Connecticut is aware that the \nmethod through which Federal funds are distributed to State and local \ngovernments to meet the requirements in this bill is very different \nthan the House bill. The House bill distributes Federal funding based \non the proportion of eligible voters in each State. This is commonly \nreferred to as a formula.\n  Conversely, the Senate bill establishes three separate discretionary \ngrant programs to help States improve their voting systems and meet the \nrequirements that are in this bill. I certainly support the goal of \nhelping all States improve their voting systems. However, I also \nsupport helping all states get their fair share of federal funding. \nBased on my knowledge of competitive grants in other Federal programs, \nI am concerned about this program turning into a competition among \nprofessional grant writers. I do not think such a system helps my State \nnor do I believe it is good public policy when you are applying new \nmandates on thousands of jurisdictions in all 50 States. So I would \nappreciate knowing my colleague's view on how he and others who drafted \nthis legislation envision the discretionary grant process working in \npractice. What if Congress only appropriates half of the funding that \nis authorized in this bill? Will there still be enough for all states \nto meet their needs, or is it first come first served?\n   Mr. DODD. I am certainly aware of the concerns raised by my \ncolleague from Arkansas. I can assure my good friend and other Senators \nwho have raised similar concerns that we have not designed a funding \ndistribution system where only the best applications will be funded. In \nfact, we have carefully calculated the amount of funding we feel will \nbe needed for all states and local jurisdictions to meet the minimum \nstandards we have included in this legislation. Therefore, I appreciate \nthe opportunity today to clear up any confusion surrounding\n\n[[Page S2521]]\n\nthis issue by saying that I and others who crafted this bill fully \nintend for the Justice Department to distribute funding to all states \nand local governments based on the need for improvement they identify \nin their application.\n  Our intent certainly is not to enact a jobs program for professional \ngrant writers no do we expect states or local governments to hire grant \nwriters in order to receive Federal funding under this bill. As \nchairman of the Senate Rules Committee, I certainly intend to closely \nmonitor the implementation of this legislation to ensure it is applied \nin practice as Congress intended. You have my word that I will be the \nfirst to object if I think the federal agency charged with distributing \nfunding is not distributing resources to eligible recipients in a fair \nand equitable manner.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank my friend from Connecticut for his \nclarification on these two issues. Based on his assurance I look \nforward to supporting this bill.\n\n\n                 full-time recreational vehicle owners\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to engage the chairman of the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration, Senator Dodd, in a colloquy \nconcerning the voting rights of thousands of American citizens, many of \nwhom are members of the Good Sam Club, which is based in California.\n  The citizens to whom I am referring own recreation vehicles, RVs, and \nlive in them year round. The number of full-time ``RVers'' grows larger \neach year. These individuals, most of whom are retirees, have sold \ntheir conventional homes and travel around the country year round in \ntheir RVs and mobile homes. Ostensibly, they do not have a permanent \naddress.\n  While nobody can question these individuals' right to travel, the \nfact is that this lifestyle does create a series of logistical \nproblems, particularly as it relates to their ability to establish a \ndomicile. While they may not remain at any one location, full-time \nRVers must still register their vehicles, maintain a current driver's \nlicense, obtain insurance, have some kind of legal address, and pay \ntaxes. They also have, or should have, the right to register to vote if \nthey so choose.\n  Two years ago, the voting rights of over 9,000 full-time RVers who \nwere registered to vote in Polk County, TX, was challenged in court. \nThe plaintiffs in this case argued that since these individuals did not \nreside in Polk County on a permanent basis, they constituted a \nsignificant voting block of ``nonresidents'' that was likely to have an \neffect on the outcome of the election, and that their votes should be \ndisallowed. Ultimately, the full-time RVers' constitutional right to \nvote was upheld in court, but future challenges are likely.\n  The legislation that we are considering today would establish an \nElection Administration Commission, EAC. Among other responsibilities, \nthis Commission is mandated to conduct a number of studies on various \nelection issues, and report its findings to the President and Congress. \nDoes the Senator from Connecticut agree that, at the very least, the \nissue of full-time RVers voting rights would be a suitable topic for \nthe Commission to study?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, I certainly agree with the Senator from California. We \ndo not want to disenfranchise anyone, accidentally or otherwise, who is \neligible to vote, and we need to address the unique set of \ncircumstances surrounding our fellow citizens who have chosen not to \nlive in one particular location, but rather to travel year round across \nour great nation. The right to vote of all full-time RVers needs to be \nsafeguarded. Certainly this is an issue the Commission could study.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator for his remarks and for his \nleadership on this bill. I am pleased that he shares my strongly-held \nview that we need to ensure that the voting rights of all American \ncitizens, regardless of where they reside, needs to be safeguarded.\n\n\n                             path of travel\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to inquire of the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd, on the intent of the grants to be awarded to \nstates for the purpose of constructing ``polling places, including the \npath of travel.'' Is ``path of travel'' intended to cover the \nconstruction of paved, asphalted, or similarly surfaced disabled or \nhandicapped parking spaces, as well as sidewalks, ramps, and similar \ndisabled access ways to the buildings which house the voting system?\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his question. The \ngrants to be awarded to states under this act would include \nconstruction of these types of infrastructure improvements, and are \nintended to include things like disabled parking spaces, sidewalks, \nramps, and similar access ways.\n  Mr. ENZI. As the chairman is aware, these grants are very important \nto small, rural states like Wyoming, which have polling places in some \nvery remote or rural locations. In Wyoming, we actually have some \npolling places in trailers on gravel roads. Because the Act requires a \nspecial voting system for the disabled to be installed in each polling \nplace, Wyoming needs to be sure it can accommodate the disabled by \nmaking certain the state can pay for these special systems and ensure \nthe disabled can get into the building to vote. These types of grants \nwill ensure that the buildings which house the special voting equipment \nfor the disabled are ADA accessible.\n  I am also aware the chairman has included the Collins amendment in \nthe manager's amendment to the act. I understand this amendment is \nintended to assure a minimum amount of grant money is available to each \nstate to improve their voting systems and infrastructure. This is \nimportant to the State of Wyoming so it can afford to install these \nspecial systems and construct the infrastructure necessary to give the \ndisabled the same opportunity to enter a voting booth and exercise \ntheir right to vote.\n  Mr. DODD. As the Senator has indicated, the managers' amendment \nincludes a provision to ensure that each state will be guaranteed a \nminimum of one half of one percent of the grant money available under \nthe act, which is approximately $17.5 million dollars over five years. \nI am glad this act will help address the concerns of small, rural \nStates like Wyoming, and I look forward to working with the Senator \nform Wyoming to address any further concerns or questions he may have \non to how this act will impact rural states.\n\n\n        Deterring Voter Fraud and Promoting Voter Participation\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleague Senator \nBond for his hard work in making sure that the identification \nrequirements for first time voters in this bill did not have the \nunintended consequences for people who vote by mail. I think that we \nall agree that any election reform passed by the U.S. Senate should be \nabout two things: deterring voter fraud and promoting voter \nparticipation. Many weeks of negotiations finally have produced an \nagreement that I believe will do both. Thanks to hard work by Senator \nWyden and Senator Bond, together with the managers of the bill, Senator \nDodd and Senator McConnell, and Senator Murray and Senator Smith, we \nhave come up with a solution. The compromise addresses Senator Bond's \nconcerns about making certain first time voters are who they say they \nare, but that doesn't have an unfair and burdensome impact on \nprogressive states like Washington and Oregon where many--and in the \ncase of Oregon all--voters vote by mail. This compromise will not \nsimply benefit voters who vote by mail in Washington in Oregon, but \nwill benefit all States that allow voters to vote by mail.\n  This compromise does two things. First, it creates a mechanism for \nelection officials to verify the identity of first time voters who \nregister by mail before they get to the polls. And second, it makes \nclear that voters who vote by mail, just like voters who go to the \npolls, can still cast a provisional or replacement ballot even if they \nfail to provide identification in their ballot when they cast their \nvote by mail. The provisional or replacement ballot will be counted as \nlong as elections officials determine the voter's eligibility under the \nlaws of their State.\n  With regard to the first part of the compromise, election officials \nin States like Oregon and Washington will be able to satisfy themselves \nabout the identity of a first time voter before they arrive at the \npools or cast their ballot by mail for the first time. If the election \nofficial is able to compare the information that the voter provides on \nhis or her voter registration card with\n\n[[Page S2522]]\n\ninformation contained in an existing state database such as the \nDepartment of Motor Vehicles, and the information matches, the voter \nwill not be asked to produce independent identification when they vote. \nIn fact, even if a voter fails to provide the identification \ninformation at the time they vote, the vote may still be cast as a \nprovisional or replacement ballot and will be counted as long as State \nelections officials verify the voter's eligibility under the laws of \nthe voter's State. Is that the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator is correct. Under the agreement you and I have \nworked out with Senators Bond, McConnell, Dodd, and Murray, voters who \nregister by mail are given more options to verify their identity. Our \nagreement protects Oregon's vote-by-mail system, as well as the \nmajority of voters who vote by mail in Washington, and provides \nprotections to make sure that every mail-in vote by a legally \nregistered first-time voter can be counted.\n  Instead of a identification or proof to resident, first-time voters \nin a state may put their driver's license number or the last four \ndigits of their Social Security card on their registration card.\n  If that number, along with the name and date of birth of the voter \nmatches another State record, like the Department of Motor Vehicle's, \nthe voter won't be required to provide any further identification. This \nmeans they won't have to stop by a copy center before they register or \nbefore they vote. This will mean business as usual for the petition \ndrives, the campus registrations and every get-out-the-vote effort in \nOregon, where thousands of first-time voters register by mail. Without \nthis compromise, every one of these initiatives to get more citizens \nvoting would have been stymied.\n  The agreement also guarantees that voters who cast their ballots by \nmail have the same provisional or replacement ballot rights as voters \nwho go to the polls. Under the agreement if a first-time voter in a \nstate fails to supply a driver's license number or the last four digits \nof their Social Security number when they register, their vote can \nstill be counted even if their ballot is received without a photocopy \nof identification, if the state election officials determines that the \nvoter is in fact legally registered under state law. These provisions \nwill also not take effect until January of 2003 ensuring that this \nyear's election will not be disrupted by new requirements.\n  Under the agreement, Oregon's pioneering and successful vote-by-mail \nsystem will continue, unchanged.\n  I understand the concerns that sparked the identification \nrequirement: a concern that mail-in voter registration and balloting \nengender fraud. But in Oregon--the only all vote-by-mail state and the \nstate that pioneered Motor Voter--there is very little fraud. No one \nhas come forward with proof of widespread fraud in Oregon. In fact, I \nwas elected to the Senate in the first all vote-by-mail special \nelection. Senator Gordon Smith, my opponent in that race, never raised \nany questions about fraud. Oregon's penalties for fraud are much \ntougher than federal law--up to $100,000 in fines and/or 5 years in \njail.\n  Since Oregonians voted overwhelmingly in 1998 to use a vote-by-mail \nsystem, participation has gone up and fraud has gone down. In fact, in \nthe last Federal election, 80 percent of the registered voters cast a \nballot. Since the May 1996 primary, 13 cases of fraud have been \nprosecuted; convictions were won in five and eight are still pending. \nIn the last federal election, only 192 ballots were not counted because \nthey failed the signature verification test. This is a pretty good \nrecord. Has the Senator had similar results in her State?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I agree completely with my colleague from Oregon. The \nmail in voting system in my State has allowed voters to have \nflexibility in deciding whether to go to the polls or vote from home. \nIn our last election, over 65 percent opted to vote by mail.\n  Our system has increased participation, and has resulted in no \nserious allegation of fraud. Like the mail in system in Oregon, I was \nelected in a very close election where the majority of ballots were \ncast by mail, but no allegations of fraud were raised.\n  In addition, voting by mail allows voters to be significantly more \ninformed. By sitting at home with their ballot and their sample voting \nmaterials, voters are able to make more informed choices without the \npressures of a busy schedule or a line at the booth.\n  I am very pleased that this agreement provides protections that will \nmake sure that all legally registered first time voters who vote by \nmail, will still have their votes counted. Their votes will be counted \nif State election officials determine the voter is properly registered \naccording to Washington State law. In Washington, if a first-time voter \nforgets to include a photocopy in their ballot, the election official \nwill verify whether or not the voter is in fact legally registered by \nfollowing the Washington state law, and performing a careful \nverification of the signature on the ballot.\n  This compromise makes sense because it allows each state to best \ndetermine how to count provisional ballots, and because it provides the \nsame protection to mail in voters that are already provided to voters \nwho vote at the polls in the original election reform bill.\n  I ask the Senator if he agrees that this is how the compromise will \nwork?\n  Mr. BOND. I agree with my colleagues Senator Wyden and Senator \nCantwell, as to how the compromise works, and I would like to thank \nthem for working diligently on this compromise. I am pleased we were \nable to make a change to the identification provision that all states \ncan comply with.\n  I have said repeatedly that requiring first time voters to verify \ntheir identity is a reasonable means of preventing fraud, and in fact \nmany States already have this requirement.\n  But I agree completely with the Senators from Washington and Oregon \nthat voters who vote by mail, but fail to include a copy of their photo \nidentification, should be able to cast a provisional ballot, just like \nvoters who go to the polls without their identification.\n  By ensuring that it is a state or local election official that is \nmaking the determination about whether a provisional vote is valid, I \nbelieve we have built in significant safeguards that will prevent \nfraud.\n  I also agree that allowing election officials to verify the identity \nof a first time voter by matching specific information about the voter \non the registration card to an existing state record with information \non the voter, is a reasonable means to prevent fraud.\n  I am happy to support this compromise and look forward to passing the \nfinal legislation later today.\n  Mr. WYDEN. This agreement follows the right priorities by fighting \nfraud at the beginning of the process--at the time of registration. \nThat is what our agreement does. At the same time, I have also said \nthat legislation should not make it harder for legally registered \nvoters to cast a ballot, or discourage people from voting. The \nagreement will do this as well.\n  This has not been an easy task. I want to commend Senators Bond, \nCantwell, McConnell, and Murray for sticking with the negotiations, and \nI especially want to thank Chairman Dodd for the support he and his \nstaff have given us in reaching the agreement and in including it in \nthe managers' package.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, amendment No. 2926 will ensure that the \nElection Administration Commission studies State recount and contest \nprocedures, so that we lessen the chance that what happened in Florida \nduring the November 2000 election will occur elsewhere.\n  That election revealed many problems in our Nation's voting \nprocedures, the bulk of which are being addressed in this historic \nlegislation. When states fully implement the provisions of S. 565, I am \nconfident that Americans will have good reason to have greater \nconfidence that their Federal elections are fair, efficient, and \naccurate down to the last vote.\n  But, we also have to be concerned about what occurs after those \nballots have been cast, especially in cases when an election is \nexcruciatingly close. In November 2000, we all found out what can \nhappen in our electoral democracy when recounts are required or when \nelections are contested to determine who won and who lost. In broad \nterms, the system that was designed by our Founders and has evolved\n\n[[Page S2523]]\n\nover the years is a brilliant one. But given the sheer size of this \ncountry, the complexity of many State regulations, and the various ways \nand means of voting, we must ensure that the system we cherish is \nbrought fully up to speed with the times in which we live.\n  Even after we say good riddance to chads and butterflies, we will \ncertainly continue to have close Federal elections, and elections in \nwhich the first count has to be verified for one reason or another. \nTherefore I believe we will not have completed the job of election \nreform until we make sure that we--governments at all levels, as well \nas the public--better understand how States determine when votes should \nbe recounted, how votes should be recounted, and who should do the \nrecounting. We must not allow this window of reform to close without \nfirst enduring that we know whether or not State recount and contest \nprocedures are adequate, so that in the future it is voters, without \nthe intervention of the courts, who determine the winners of our \nelections.\n\n  In 2000, of course, it was Florida--surrounded on three sides by \nwater and on all sides by media scrutiny--that became the poster state \nfor recount procedures gone awry. But in frames, we must acknowledge \nthat if other States had been placed under the same microscope as \nFlorida, the same problems would have been revealed. Florida was not \nthe only state that was totally unprepared to deal with a neck-and-neck \nelection.\n  The National Commission on Federal Election Reform, chaired so ably \nby Presidents Carter and Ford, made several observations about this \nissue that were evident to the whole world watching events in Florida, \nbut which could apply to many other States as well. The commission \nfound that recount and contest laws are not designed for statewide \nchallenges. They noted that state deadlines did not mesh well with the \nfederal schedule. Each county in Florida made its own decisions about \nwhat, when, or whether to recount. And, perhaps most surprising to all \nof us involved, in performing recounts, the definition of a vote varied \nfrom county to county, and from official to official within the \ncounties.\n  I do not want to recount, relieve, or rehash all of the painful \ndebates from that election. There is no point to be served now re-\nenacting the legal battle that transfixed our country and the world.\n  But in our ongoing quest to form a more perfect union, we have to ask \nourselves whether we can improve the procedures for future recounts, \nand how we can put in place procedures that are clear to voters, and I \nmight add candidates, well before the election. If on the first Monday \nin November we are all on the same page as to what constitutes a vote \non each type of voting equipment and for every kind of voting method, \nwhat recount and contest procedures are, and other critical questions, \nthings will be much less confusion and frustrating to all Americans \ncome the first Tuesday in November. In perfect hindsight, I think we \nwould all agree that it is not one's benefit for us to rely on the \ncourts or others to tell us the rules as we go along.\n  The amendment would simply require the new Election Administration \nCommission being created by this legislation to systematically examine \nthe State laws and procedures governing recounts and contests in \nFederal elections, determine the best practices, and, report to the \nPresident and Congress whether or not state procedures are adequate. \nThe commission would also study whether or not states have adopted \nuniform definitions for what constitutes a vote on each kind of voting \nmachinery they use, and whether or not there is a need for more \nconsistency in State recount and contest procedures.\n  This amendment recognizes that, as is appropriate under our system of \ngovernment, administration of Federal elections will still remain \nprimarily the purview of the States. However, be directing the Election \nAdministration Commission to study State recount and contest laws and \nprocedures and promote best practices, I hope we can help to ensure \nthat the events in Florida following the November 2000 election are \nnever repeated.\n  I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for working with us \nand accepting this amendment, and I urge its adoption by the Senate.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, stand on the threshold of passing \nperhaps the most important bill of the 107th Congress. S. 565 makes a \nlong-overdue Federal investment in the most vital infrastructure our \nnation has: the infrastructure of democracy.\n  We have neglected this infrastructure for too long, and at our peril. \nProblems in Florida and elsewhere during the November 2000 Presidential \nelection underscored the effects of our years of neglect.\n  I was pleased to see that President Bush's fiscal year 2003 budget \nrequest included $400 million for a revolving fund for States for \nelection improvements, and additional funds projected through fiscal \nyear 2005, for a total of $1.2 billion over 3 years. This is \ncommendable, but I think it falls short of what we need.\n  S. 565 authorizes $3.5 billion through fiscal year 2006 to help \nStates and localities:\n  Meet new Federal standards for voting systems;\n  Replace or upgrade voting technology;\n  Educate and train voters, election officials, and poll workers; and\n  Make polling places and equipment physically accessible to the \ndisabled.\n  As Senator Bond and others have said, the new standards contained in \nS. 565 are meant to ``make it easier to vote, and harder to vote \nfraudulently.'' What a laudable goal.\n  Under the bill, voting systems must notify voters if they ``over \nvote''--that is, if they vote for too many candidates for a particular \noffice or position. Voters must be given the opportunity to change \ntheir ballot, and verify that it comports with their wishes before \ncasting it.\n  Voting systems must provide nonvisual accessibility for the blind and \nvisually impaired. They must provide ballots in other languages for \nvoters with limited proficiency in English.\n  The bill requires that voters be informed of their right--and be \nallowed--to cast provisional ballots if their eligibility is challenged \nat the polling place, and to find out if their votes are counted.\n  The bill also requires the States to develop statewide computerized \nand interactive voter registration lists both to make it easier to vote \nand to deter fraud.\n  To meet these requirements, S. 565 provides a 100 percent Federal \nmatch. There is no unfunded mandate here foisted on State and local \ngovernments. We give them the money they need to do what we ask them to \ndo.\n\n  The bill comes at an absolutely crucial time for California. Last \nSeptember, California Secretary of State Bill Jones ``de-certified'' \nthe punch-card voting systems in nine counties, which collectively have \n8.6 million registered voters. That's more people than the total \npopulations of 39 States. The counties include:\n  Los Angeles (4 million registered voters);\n  San Diego (1 million registered voters);\n  San Bernardino (700,000 registered voters);\n  Alameda (700,000 registered voters); and\n  Sacramento (600,000 registered voters).\n  The other affected counties are Mendocino, Santa Clara, Shasta, and \nSolano.\n  Secretary of State Jones gave these jurisdictions until the November \n2006 elections to upgrade their systems, presumably to ``touch screen'' \nmachines, also known as ``Direct Record Electronic''--DRE--devices.\n  You can imagine what a challenge it will be to get new systems in \nplace for so many voters. In Los Angeles alone, the cost is expected to \nbe between $90 million and $100 million. In Sacramento, it will cost \n$20 million to $30 million.\n  But there is more: civil rights groups and other plaintiffs sued to \nmove the date up from 2006 to 2004. Just 2 months ago, U.S. District \nJudge Stephen V. Wilson ruled in favor of the plaintiffs.\n  So these counties have about 2 years--less really--to get new \nsystems. It is absolutely imperative that we pass this bill, work out a \ncompromise with the House, and get Federal funds to these--and other--\njurisdictions as soon as possible.\n  Last month, California voters approved Proposition 41, a $200 million\n\n[[Page S2524]]\n\nbond measure that will provide 3-to-1 matching grants to county \ngovernments for the purchase of new election equipment. So the State is \ndoing what it can to fix this problem. But it can-not do it by itself.\n  With regard to the bill before us, I want to commend Senators Dodd \nand McConnell for their hard work in negotiating the compromise we will \nbe voting on shortly. Fixing our election systems--fixing the \ninfrastructure of our democracy--is not a partisan issue. The chairman \nand ranking member of the Rules Committee have done an admirable job. I \nam confident that the Senate will approve the compromise amendment \noverwhelmingly.\n  I am also grateful that the Senate saw fit to approve 2 of my \namendments. I offered these amendments to address concerns my staff and \nI heard from California election officials, notably Bradley J. Clark, \nthe Alameda County Registrar who serves as President of the California \nAssociation of Clerks and Election Officials, and Connie B. McCormack \nand Mischelle Townsend, the Los Angeles County and Riverside County \nRegistrars, respectively.\n\n  My first amendment would task the Election Administration \nCommission--EAC--created under the bill with studying the technical \nfeasibility of providing ballots and other election materials in eight \nor more languages. Section 101(a)(4) of S. 565 as amended significantly \nexpands the Voting Rights Act--VRA--of 1965 requirement regarding the \navailability of voter registration and election materials in foreign \nlanguages.\n  The VRA currently requires the availability of voter registration and \nelection materials in native languages for specified ``language \nminority groups'' if a certain threshold is reached: No. 1, more than 5 \npercent of the voting-age citizens within the jurisdiction are members \nof a ``single language minority'' and have limited English-proficiency; \nor No. 2, there are at least 10,000 such voters.\n  The VRA restricts the term ``language minority groups/single language \nminority'' to people who are American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan \nNatives, or of Spanish heritage.\n  S. 565, as amended, goes beyond the four categories above, and the \nregistrars are concerned that it could require a larger jurisdiction \nlike Los Angeles, San Francisco, or San Diego to prepare ballots and \nother election materials in languages not covered by the VRA without \nfirst assessing the need for such ballots.\n  We have school districts in these cities where 48 different languages \nare spoken.\n  In the November 2000 elections, Los Angeles County spent $2.2 million \nout of a total budget of $21 million to prepare registration materials \nand ballots in six languages: Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, \nVietnamese, and Tagalog--the native language of Filipinos.\n  According to the Los Angeles County Registrar, Ms. McCormack, each \nlanguage costs about $250,000 per election, and she anticipates adding \nCambodian for the November 2002 election.\n  She certainly does not want to disenfranchise any voter, nor would I \ncountenance such an effort. But I think it is important for the EAC to \nstudy the technical challenges the multi-lingual ballot provision \nplaces on a jurisdiction like Los Angeles.\n  For instance, Ms. McCormack told my staff that while the technology \nis improving, it is still very difficult to devise ballots in \n``character'' languages such as Chinese, even on the newer machines.\n  Prior to the November 2000 elections, she invited companies to bid on \na contract to provide a limited number of machines with multi-lingual \nballot capabilities. She drew just two bids.\n  Another chief concern I heard about is the requirement in Section \n102(a) of the substitute amendment that appropriate election officials \nmust notify a provisional voter in writing within 30 days if his or her \nprovisional ballot is rejected, and the reason for it being rejected.\n  The goal--getting voters properly registered--is certainly \nworthwhile, but the requirement is administratively cumbersome for some \njurisdictions. Los Angeles County, for instance, received over 100,000 \nprovisional ballots in the November 2000 elections, and rejected close \nto 40,000.\n  In addition to notifying, in writing, those voters whose provisional \nballots have not been counted, the amended bill reburies election \nofficials in each jurisdiction to establish a ``free access system'' \nsuch as a toll-free number or an official Website that voters can \ncontact to determine if their provisional ballots have been counted.\n  It strikes me that establishing the free access system, informing \nvoters about it, and allowing them to find this information out for \nthemselves is more manageable than requiring the written notification.\n  In either instance, I am concerned about protecting the privacy of \nthe data that such a free access system would contain.\n  S. 565, as amended--Section 102(a)(6)(BN)--is silent on that point.\n  Identify theft is one of the Nation's fastest growing crimes. I felt \ncompelled to offer an amendment to the bill--which has been adopted--to \ndirect the appropriate State or local election officials to protect the \nsecurity of the personal information contained in the free access \nsystems that will be created.\n  I am pleased that the Senate also adopted the amendment senators \nChafee and Reed of Rhode Island offered to ensure that State and local \ngovernments making multi-year payments for new voting equipment \npurchased prior to January 1, 2001 are eligible to apply for grants \nunder this bill.\n  This amendment, as I understand it, ``grandfathers'' Riverside and \nMarin Counties so that they can tap into Section 203 grant monies to \nhelp them defray the cost of equipment they purchased prior to the \nNovember 2000 elections.\n  According to Ms. Townsend, the Riverside County Registrar, prior to \nthe 2000 elections, Riverside County using Pitney Bowes for financing--\npurchased 4,250 touch screen machines from Sequoia, an Oakland \nmanufacturer, at a cost of $14 million amortized over 15 years (for a \ntotal cost, including interest, of roughly $20 million).\n\n  The new DRE system was so successful that Riverside had one of the \nten lowest voter error rates of all counties nationwide--less than one \npercent.\n  Ms. Townsend told my staff that much of the error rate was \nattributable to paper absentee ballots. ``Over-voting'' is impossible \non touch screens, and ``under-voting'' is the prerogative of individual \nvoters and, consequently, may not represent an error.\n  Riverside was the first county nationwide to rely exclusively on \ntouch screens and is serving as a model for other jurisdictions. The \ncounty was commended in the report issued by the Election Reform \nCommission former Presidents Ford and Carter co-chaired.\n  Clearly, we do not want to punish Riverside County--or Marin County, \nwhich purchased DRE touch screen machines and precinct-based optical \nscanners in time for the November 2000 elections--for acting \nresponsibly.\n  As I said a moment ago, I want to thank Senators Dodd and McConnell \nfor accommodating my concerns. I think the amendments I offered and the \nChafee-Reed amendment make an already outstanding bill even better.\n  While much of our discussion concerning specific provisions in the \nbill may sound arcane or parochial, there is also something much larger \nat stake here.\n  One hundred years ago, democracy was still very much a tenuous \nexperiment around the world. Even in the United States, African-\nAmerican men were largely disenfranchised and women still had to wait \nfor 2 more decades before they could vote.\n  According to a 1999 report issued by Freedom House, in 1900, only 5 \npercent of the world's population had the right to elect their \nleader(s). Now, 58 percent of the world has this right.\n  In 1900, no nation elected its leader by universal adult suffrage; \nnow, 119 nations do. That is 62 percent of all of the countries in the \nworld.\n  According to the report, entitled Democracy's Century:\n\n       Like economic progress, political progress has been uneven. \n     But the general trends are hard to ignore. They reinforce the \n     conclusion that humankind, in fits and starts, is rejecting \n     oppression and opting for greater openness and freedom.\n\n  This report was published before the terrorist attacks on September \n11. We have been reminded in a visceral way that enemies of freedom \nstill exist. We have met those enemies on the battlefields of \nAfghanistan. The battle we\n\n[[Page S2525]]\n\nnow wage is every bit as serious as the cold war. I fervently believe \nthat freedom will win out. Democracy will continue its march. Respect \nfor human rights will grow.\n  The newly established or emerging democracies of the world look to us \nfor inspiration and for guidance. That is why it is so crucial that we \npass S. 565 and set about mending our democracy.\n  I traveled abroad after the 2000 elections, and I heard an earful \nfrom foreigners. ``Don't lecture us,'' they said, and rightfully so.\n  While we were able to settle on the results peacefully, in our \ncourts, the events surrounding that election shame us, diminish us in \nthe eyes of those who aspire to be like us, and embolden our enemies, \nfreedom's enemies.\n  On April 27, 1994, 43 million black South Africans--86 percent of the \neligible voters--cast their first ballots. Can any of us forget the \npoignant images we saw on television back then of people waiting 8 \nhours or more to vote, of lines of voters seemingly stretching to the \nhorizon?\n  Yes, democracy is on the march. But it is fragile. We have to protect \nand nourish it. Even here in America--especially here in America. We \nare a beacon to the rest of the world, especially to oppressed people \neverywhere.\n  We Americans have been complacent and neglectful with regard to our \ndemocracy. We have allowed the infrastructure that sustains it to fray \naround the edges. Our democracy has lost some of its marvelous luster. \nIt is time to restore that luster.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of this \nhistoric election reform legislation, which of course comes before the \nSenate at a time when our Nation is responding to new challenges at \nhome and abroad.\n  I want to thank Senators Dodd and McConnell and other Senators for \ntheir hard work to create this bipartisan bill, and I thank the \nmajority leader and the minority leader for working together and \nensuring that this legislation is being considered at this time. Our \nefforts to address this issue together demonstrate to the American \npeople that a matter as critical as election reform can and should be \ndriven by the national interest, not by partisan, parochial or \npolitical interests.\n  After all, the integrity of self-governed democracies starts with the \nright of citizens to vote, and when that right is not shared equally, \nthe strength of our democracy is diminished.\n  We must recognize and celebrate the fact that American history has \nbeen a story of continual progress in this regard. Generation after \ngeneration, voting booths have been opened and voting rights extended \nto groups of citizens once disenfranchised. That wonderful process of \ngrowth has, over the generations, built a broader and better America \nthat has become a brighter beacon of equality and opportunity to people \naround the world.\n  But we can never stop forming, in the words of our Constitution, a \nmore perfect union, and to that end we must realize that haphazard or \nbureaucratic disenfranchisement still occurs in America today as a \nresult of arcane or confusing voting systems. We must realize that \nmillions of Americans who are eligible to vote still encounter \nunnecessary barriers to casting their vote, and to having their votes \ncounted. That disenfranchisement, whenever and however it occurs, is a \nblemish on the sanctity of our system, and it is a blemish that only \nwe--the democratic representatives of the people--can help to heal.\n  The provisions in this legislation will help guarantee access and \naccuracy in the voting booth and ballot box by making sure that the \nfundamental right to vote of all citizens is protected, that the \nballots of all registered voters are counted, and that only those \npersons who are eligible to vote can do so.\n  We can all agree that the November 2000 election--which I seem to \nrecall reading a thing or two about in the newspapers--exposed serious \nflaws in our federal election process, and I am happy to say that this \nlegislation has an answer for most of the flaws exposed.\n  Experts estimate that in November 2000, some 2.5 million Americans \nhad their ballots for President discarded for any number of reasons. In \nsome cases, the cause was faulty voting equipment, in others confusing \nballots. This legislation will wisely require States to adopt voting \nsystems which permit voters to verify their ballot choices and correct \nerrors before their vote is cast. It requires states to adopt systems \nthat address the needs of disabled voters, and of voters with limited \nEnglish proficiency. And to make sure that these provisions have teeth, \nthe bill sets Federal standards for voter error rates and requires \nstates to meet or beat those benchmarks.\n\n  In the 2000 election, many citizens who believed they were eligible \nto vote were simply turned away from the polls. This legislation will \nmake sure that all citizens who show up to vote have the right to cast \nprovisional ballots, so that their votes can be tabulated if and when \ntheir eligibility is verified.\n  According to reports, in the 2000 election, other citizens were \ndenied the right to vote because registration lists were simply not \naccurate. This legislation will require each State to create \ncomputerized, statewide voter registration lists and to coordinate \nthose lists with other databases to ensure that the lists are as up-to-\ndate and as error-free as possible.\n  The November 2000 election also made it painfully clear that states \nwere being forced to bear the total financial burden for federal \nelections, and many states lacked the funding necessary to implement \nmore efficient voting systems. This legislation authorizes $3.5 billion \nto help states and localities meet the requirements for upgrading \nvoting systems, to improve accessibility for disabled and special needs \nvoters, and to implement new procedures to increase voter turnout, \neducate voters, and identify, deter, and investigate voter fraud.\n  Mr. President, the revolutionary idea at the core of American \ndemocracy is that our government's power is derived from the consent of \nthe governed. In other words, small-r republican government depends \nupon the small-d democratic right to vote. Two hundred years ago. \nThomas Jefferson wrote, ``The will of the people . . . is the only \nlegitimate foundation of any government, and to protect is free \nexpression should be our first object.''\n  Today, the best way for us to protect the free expression of the will \nof the people is to build an election system that all Americans can \ncount on, by ensuring that all their votes and only their votes are \ncounted. This legislation furthers our progress toward that noble goal. \nIt deserves our strong support.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have before us a bill that seeks to \ntake unprecedented steps to improve the methods by which Americans vote \nfor our elected officials. To a large extent, Congress is charting new \nterritory in an area where States have traditionally been left to their \nown devices. Congress has in the past stepped in to guarantee the right \nto vote for American military personnel and U.S. citizens who live \nabroad as well as to protect the voting rights of Americans against \ndiscrimination. Most recently, Congress has involved itself in the area \nof voter registration with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. \nHowever, the Federal Government to date has had little or no role with \nrespect to the administration of elections, which is traditionally a \nState and local responsibility.\n  Since this is new territory for Congress, we must start by asking \nourselves what we are trying to accomplish. The closeness of the 2000 \npresidential election highlighted some of the shortcomings in the \nvoting systems and processes that are used throughout the country. Many \nsuggestions have been tossed around for ways we can improve elections \nin the United States ranging from radical constitutional reforms to \nminor adjustments on the local level. It is clear to me that the most \nimportant role Congress can play is to provide the resources, both \nfinancial and technical, that are necessary for states and communities \nto administer fair and accurate elections.\n  The Dodd-McConnell compromise legislation being considered by the \nSenate takes steps to help State and local governments achieve high \nstandards of fairness and accuracy in elections. Still, the bill is not \nperfect. Because of the nature of compromise legislation, every Senator \ncan find things they like and things they do not.\n\n[[Page S2526]]\n\n  Nevertheless, this bill does accomplish one of the key objectives of \nFederal election reform. Central to any attempt to help States and \nlocalities improve their election systems is providing funds to do so. \nIt's usually not lack of will but lack of funds that hinders local \nreform efforts. I'm pleased that this bill provides a total of $3.5 \nbillion to States and localities to help improve the administration of \nelections. Funds will become available through a newly created Election \nAdministration Commission for items like upgrading or replacing voting \nmachines, improving accessibility for disabled voters, and simplifying \nvoting and voter registration procedures.\n  On the other hand, one problem with this bill is the degree of \nFederal control that will be exerted on elections. It's difficult to \nstrike the right balance between helping States and localities improve \nthe administration of elections while still allowing for local \nflexibility. This bill contains a number of well intentioned but \nspecific mandates on States and localities along with potentially heavy \nhanded enforcement procedures if they are deemed to be out of \ncompliance with Federal mandates. Still, the bill does provide for 100 \npercent funding for all Federal mandates thus lessening the impact on \nthe State and local governments that must implement these mandates.\n  Finally, I'm pleased that measures were included in this bill, \nlargely through the work of Senator Bond, to combat the problem of \nvoter fraud. The Dodd-McConnell compromise strengthens language in \ncurrent law providing penalties for giving false information with \nrespect to voting or voter registration, or for conspiring to do so. It \nalso clarifies that these penalties apply for giving false information \nwith respect to naturalization, citizenship, or alien registration.\n  The compromise also contains carefully balanced language designed to \nprotect against the kinds of fraud that can occur with mail-in voter \nregistration and mail-in voting. While efforts to strip out these anti-\nfraud protections threatened to unravel the compromise, I am pleased \nthat this matter was resolved and a compromise was found that protects \nthe ability to vote by mail without weakening the bill's anti-fraud \nprotections.\n  In addition, other measures have been added to the bill through \namendments on the Senate floor to give States more tools to ensure the \nintegrity of their voter lists and prevent fraud, including my \namendment to allow for coordination of statewide voter lists with \nsocial security records to check for deaths and individuals registered \nunder false identities. Voter fraud is a direct threat to the electoral \nprocess and these measures represent progress toward eliminating that \nthreat.\n  At the end of the day, we have a bipartisan bill that takes concrete \nsteps to help state and local governments improve the administration of \nelections. While it isn't perfect, the Dodd-McConnell legislation \nrepresents a positive move that should give Americans greater \nconfidence in their elections and our system of government.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about Election \nReform. Today is a good day for this country and the manner in which we \nhold federal elections.\n  For several weeks after the last vote was cast in the 2000 elections, \nAmericans were inundated with image after image of ballots being \ncounted and recounted. As the election was further scrutinized, \nnumerous stories of voter fraud were brought to the nation's attention.\n  While the list of problems encountered during the last election is \nseemingly unending, the point is that there are improvements to the \nsystem that must be made. Today, we have taken a very big, very \nimportant step in making sure that this system works better. After all, \nwe have no more important right as American citizens than the right to \nvote.\n  In this bill, we set forth some very important standards and \nprocedures to protect this right. We will require systems to permit a \nvoter to verify his ballot choices and correct errors before the ballot \nis cast so that the voter can be certain that his vote will be for the \ncandidate of his choice.\n  In the case where an individual claims to be a registered voter who \nis eligible to vote but isn't on the official registration list, that \nindividual will be allowed to cast a provisional vote. The appropriate \nelection official must then verify the claim of eligibility. If the \nclaim is verified, that vote will be counted. There will then be a free \naccess system that the voter can use to check to see whether that vote \nwas counted, and if not, the system will give the reason for that \ndecision.\n  These measures, and others in the bill, are intended to make certain \nthat the people who are eligible to vote are given that right. The \nother side of the coin is to make certain that people who are not \neligible to vote are prevented from voting. One of the things that this \nbill does is require each state to implement an interactive, \ncomputerized, statewide, voter registration list. This will also help \nto make certain that noone is able to vote more than once.\n  One of the concerns that many states would have had with this piece \nof legislation is the cost involved in implementing these reforms. \nRecognizing these concerns, we have authorized $3.5 billion to make \ncertain that the states do not bear the burden of these reforms.\n  This legislation represents the hard work of many members from both \nsides of the aisle. It is truly a testament to the good that can come \nfrom bi-partisanship and I commend all of the Senators who worked so \nhard to make this happen.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Dodd and Ranking \nMember McConnell for working closely with me to reach agreement on an \namendment to help ensure that the millions of Americans living overseas \ncan vote in Federal elections.\n  Millions of Americans live abroad. Some are business people, some are \nmilitary personnel, others are students, and some are Peace Corp \nvolunteers. Their votes should count, too.\n  This amendment is simple and reasonable, but important. It directs \nthe Commission created in the Election Reform package to consider the \nneeds and concerns of millions of overseas voters, both civilian and \nmilitary personnel. The amendment directs the commission to study the \nissue of long-term registration for overseas voters and make \nrecommendations. It would create a single office in every state that \noverseas voters could contact for information about voter registration \nand absentee ballots. The Commission is asked to determine if this \noffice could, and should do more. It states that when election \nofficials reject an absentee ballot, the overseas voter should be \nnotified and given an explanation on why their application was \nrejected. Finally, this amendment also ask states to report on the \nnumber of absentee ballots, within a reasonable time frame.\n  Early in my political career, I served as the Secretary of State for \nWest Virginia, so I understand the importance of voting issues and the \nneed to be sensitive to the concerns of states. But we also have an \nobligation to overseas Americans who deserve the chance to vote.\n  I deeply appreciate the interest and support of Chairman Dodd, \nSenator McConnell and their staffs. I know that the bipartisan House \nElection Reform legislation includes important provisions for overseas \nvoters, both civilian and military, recognizing that they, too, deserve \nto vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this afternoon I would like to commend my \ncolleagues for passing S. 565, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Equal \nProtection of Voting Rights Act of 2001. I believe that this historic \npiece of legislation will resolve many of the problems that the country \nexperienced in the Year 2000 election.\n  This bill includes a number of important elements that are designed \nto improve and safeguard the voting process across the country. The \nbill establishes uniform and nondiscriminatory Federal standards, \nincluding voter notification procedures and a uniform error rate for \nvoting systems, that will reassure voters that their votes will be \ncorrectly registered. The bill also includes mandatory procedures for \nprovisional voting that will ensure that all legitimate voters have the \nright to vote. Additionally, the bill establishes an interactive, \ncomputerized, statewide voter registration system that will prevent \nfuture incidents of election fraud. The\n\n[[Page S2527]]\n\nbill also includes Federal grant programs that will help the States pay \nfor these new mandatory requirements, and provide incentives for States \nto replace voting machines, educate voters, and train poll workers. The \nbill also establishes an Election Administration Commission to improve \nthe administration of elections across the country by using grant \nprograms, studies, and recommendations.\n  Most importantly, this bill will play a role in improving the \nsituation for disabled voters. The obstacles facing millions of \ndisabled voters have concerned me long before the 2000 elections. I \nfind it particularly distressing that many of our nation's disabled \nveterans, who sacrificed so much for our country, are confronted with \ntoo many obstacles, including inaccessible polling places and machines \nthat cannot be used by blind and visually impaired voters. According to \na 2001 GAO report, requested by Senator Harkin and me, 84 percent of \nall polling places in the U.S. are not accessible to disabled voters. \nAdditionally, no polling place visited by the GAO had a ballot or \nvoting system available for blind or visually-impaired voters to mark a \nballot without requiring assistance from a poll worker or companion.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues in the Senate for supporting my \namendment to ensure that the Federal Access Board will be consulted on \nthe new voting systems standards. The Access Board has a good deal of \ninsight and experience in solving the accessibility issues facing \nvoters with disabilities. I am also grateful to my colleagues for \naccepting Senator Harkin's amendment, which I cosponsored, to make it \nthe Sense of the Senate that ``curbside voting'' should be allowed by \nstates only as a last resort. For many disabled voters, ``curbside \nvoting'' strips away their sacred right to cast a private ballot. It is \nmy hope that these amendments, combined with the $100 million grant \nprogram to improve the accessibility of polling places and the new \nvoting systems standards, will ensure that the disabled community and \nour Nation's veterans will become more involved in our Nation's \nelection process.\n  One major issue for the Senate was how to strike a balance between \npreventing voter fraud and ensuring greater participation by legitimate \nvoters. The compromise substitute amendment included provisions that \nwould both include mandatory Federal standards to make the election \nprocess easier for legitimate voters and prevent voter fraud. I \ncosponsored this amendment, because it struck the necessary bipartisan \ncompromise that was required to ensure the passage of election reform \nlegislation.\n  I voted against the Schumer-Wyden amendment and against two cloture \nmotions regarding this amendment, because I believed that it would \ndestroy this bipartisan compromise. The issue of election reform is so \nimportant that it requires broad bipartisan support, as was achieved in \nthe House of Representatives with the Ney-Hoyer bill. While I \nunderstand the intentions of the proponents of the Schumer-Wyden \namendment, I was concerned that this amendment would strip out the \nanti-fraud provisions of the compromise, and endanger passage of this \nbill. My hope was that this impasse would force the parties to work \ntogether to achieve meaningful election reform legislation. I am glad \nthat Senators Wyden and Bond were able to work together to resolve this \nobstacle, and that we are now voting on final passage of this bill.\n  Again, I would like to congratulate my colleagues on passing this \nlegislation. It is my hope that the House-Senate Conference on this \nbill can be resolved soon. We owe it to the American people to ensure \nthat they have fair, open, and accurate elections.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/11/senate-section/article/S2527-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2527-S2556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman and \nranking member of the Rules Committee, Senators Dodd and McConnell, for \ntheir incredible leadership, perseverence and hard work in getting us a \nstrong bipartisan election reform bill.\n  I also thank Senators Schumer, Bond, Torricelli, McCain and Durbin \nfor their tireless efforts in crafting this bipartisan substitute \namendment. Without their collaboration and compromise, we would not \neven be considering, let alone passing, this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  It has been several months since we first began floor consideration \nof this bill, and I appreciate the tireless efforts, and diligence that \nSenator Dodd has maintained. Without his leadership we would not be \nhere today.\n  By working together, our colleagues have produced legislation that \nwill protect the most basic of all American rights: the right to vote, \nand to have that vote counted.\n  This bill represents a fair, balanced, and responsible approach.\n  It will ensure that nondiscriminatory voting procedures exist in \nevery polling place, while strengthening the integrity of the Federal \nelection process.\n  We all know why this bill is necessary.\n  We remember the stories from the 2000 elections about: inadequate \nvoter education; confusing ballots; outdated and unreliable voting \nmachines; poll workers who were unable to assist voters who needed \nassistance because they were overwhelmed or undertrained, or both; and \nregistered voters who were wrongly denied the right to vote, because \ntheir English was less than perfect, their name was mistakenly purged \nfrom a registration list, or some other equally unacceptable reason.\n  We heard reports of police roadblocks and other barriers that \nprevented some voters from even reaching the polls, not in the 1920s or \n30s, or even the 1960s, but in 2000.\n  Today, we are celebrating the 34th anniversary of the 1968 Civil \nRights Act, which prohibited discrimination in the sale, rental, or \nfinancing of housing.\n  In every generation, we have tried to tear down barriers to full \nparticipation in the life of this Nation.\n  But there is one means of participation that forms the foundation of \nevery other: the right to vote.\n  And that is why we cannot allow those barriers to voting, physical or \notherwise, which so tainted our democracy in the last century, to \nstretch into this one.\n  In all, it is estimated that between 4 million and 6 million \nAmericans were unable to cast a vote, or did not have their vote \ncounted, in the 2000 elections.\n  Between 4 and 6 million Americans, disenfranchised. In this day and \nage, that is simply unacceptable.\n  It is not enough for Congress to document or decry the problems we \nsaw in the last election. We need to fix the problems before the next \nelection.\n  It should not matter where you live, what color your skin is, or who \nyou vote for. In America, the right to vote must never be compromised. \nToo many people have given too much to defend that right.\n  Our system leaves it to States to decide the mechanics of election \nprocedures.\n  But the right to vote is not a State right. It is a constitutional \nguarantee. And it is up to us to see that it is protected.\n  Not all States experienced problems with voting in the last election. \nAnd some States that did have problems have taken steps to rectify \nthem, and they are to be commended for that.\n  But there are still States, nearly 17 months after the 2000 \nelections, where equal access to the voting booth is not guaranteed. It \nis time for this Congress to step in and enact basic standards, to \nensure that every American who is eligible to vote can vote.\n  That is what this bill does.\n  It requires States to ensure that their voting equipment meets \nminimum Federal standards for accuracy.\n  It says that voters who cast ``over-votes'' must be notified, and \ngiven a chance to correct their ballot.\n  It ensures that voting machines are accessible to individuals with \ndisabilities, as well as those with limited English proficiency.\n  It establishes statewide computerized voter registration lists.\n  And it allows individuals whose names don't appear on voting lists to \ncast ``provisional'' ballots.\n  If it is determined that the person's name was left off the \nregistration list mistakenly, the vote will then be counted. This will \nprevent voters from having to wait hours at the polls, or not vote at \nall, simply because of someone else's clerical mistake.\n  These are not onerous requirements, and they are not unfunded \nmandates. This bill includes $3.5 billion for States, to help them \nupgrade their voting systems. And it establishes a new,\n\n[[Page S2528]]\n\nbipartisan commission to oversee the grant program and administer \nvoting system standards.\n  I commend my colleagues, particularly the sponsors of this bill, for \nbringing us such a fair and balanced proposal. And for committing their \ntime and energy to seeing this through.\n  I am hopeful that this bill will move through conference quickly so \nwe can implement these reforms as soon as possible.\n  If people are denied their right to vote on issues that affect them \ndirectly, or if they fear their votes are not counted, democracy itself \nis threatened. If that happens, both parties, and all Americans, lose. \nThis bill will go a long way in restoring the integrity of our system \nand ensuring that all Americans will be truly able to exercise their \nright to vote.\n  Voting is the most basic right in our democracy, the one that \nguarantees the preservation of all other rights against governmental \ntyranny.\n  Let us now pass this bill and protect that most basic right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Almost 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, why don't I yield myself 5 minutes, and then the \nSenator from Kentucky may want to speak for 1 minute, and then we will \njust move on to the amendments.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I explained the order of the votes that \nwill occur.\n  I express my thanks to Senator Daschle and his staff and to Senator \nLott and his staff. I know I probably tried the patience of all the \nstaffs of both sides over the last number of weeks as we moved this \nproduct forward to get to the point where we are today. I would not \nwant to leave this debate without expressing publicly my sincere \ngratitude to both the Democratic and Republican floor staffs and the \ncloakroom staffs for their expression of patience--I say that \ndiplomatically--over the last number of weeks.\n  Secondly, I express my gratitude to my colleagues in the other body \nwho have worked very hard on this as well. John Conyers from Michigan \nis my principal co-author, if you will, of this proposal on the House \nside, along with my colleagues here, although Congressman Ney and \nCongressman Hoyer also have a very important bill they passed in the \nHouse, and we will be working with them.\n  Eddie Bernice Johnson, Silvestre Reyes, the respective heads of the \nBlack Caucus and Hispanic Caucus, as well as friends from the AFL-CIO, \nworked hard on this.\n  The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights--I will have printed in the \nRecord the respective members of the Leadership Conference; it is a \nlengthy list--but I express my gratitude to them as well for their \nefforts.\n  I join my colleague, Senator Mitch McConnell, in expressing our \ngratitude to the members of our committee, Senator Schumer and Senator \nTorricelli, who worked diligently to bring us to this point. I also \nwant to join the Ranking Member in thanking our colleagues who are not \npart of the committee. I say to Senator Bond, I really meant what I \nsaid last evening. I think--I say to my colleague through the Chair--\nbut for the provisions you added, which are the antifraud provisions, I \nthink this bill would be a far weaker bill, and I am not sure we would \neven have gotten a bill. So while not a member of the Rules Committee, \nI know Senator McConnell and I are deeply appreciative of your \ncontribution to this effort.\n  Senator Wyden and Senator Cantwell worked through the Oregon and \nWashington issue with their respective colleagues. Gordon Smith was \nvery concerned about this; Patty Murray as well. We thank them for \ntheir efforts.\n  The staffs of our respective offices--Shawn Maher, Kennie Gill and \nRonnie Gilliespie, and Carole Blessington, Sue Wright, and Jennifer \nCusick who supported them as well--I thank them for their work. I also \nthank Tam Somerville, Brian Lewis, and Leon Sequeira of Senator \nMcConnell's staff; Julie Dammann and Jack Bartling of Senator Bond's \nstaff; Sharon Levin and Polly Trottenberg of Senator Schumer's staff; \nSara Wills of Senator Torricelli's staff; Carol Grunberg of Senator \nWyden's staff; and Beth Stein of Senator Cantwell's staff. I thank them \nfor their terrific work. If I have left anyone out, I will add their \nnames before the Record is closed today.\n  I said this before, but Senator McConnell and I are of different \npolitical parties. We share the distinction of having gone to the same \nlaw school. We represent the alumni association of the University of \nLouisville. We share that point in common.\n\n  I wish to tell him how much I appreciate his efforts. I know he has a \nlot of things going on. He has had a huge battle on campaign finance \nreform that occurred in the middle of all of this. The fact that he and \nhis staff would find time to help us work through this election reform \nbill is something for which I will always be grateful to him. I know I \nwas hounding him. I know I bothered Brian and Jack and others to get \nthis done. And they showed patience, as well, to me and my staff. I am \nreally grateful to them for their help on that.\n  Lastly--it has been said by others--I know we have a lot of important \nbills we deal with. We have the energy bill we are considering. We have \nappropriations bills. And we are dealing with homeland security and \nterrorism issues.\n  I do not minimize at all the importance of that. But this bill goes \nbeyond any specific current issue--it goes to the heart of who and what \nwe are as Americans. Aside from the obvious results of the 2000 \nelections which provoked, I suppose, this discussion and this bill--\nthis effort is not about addressing a single issue or event. We are \ndealing with the underlying structure of our very Government.\n  Patrick Henry once said that: The right to vote is the right upon \nwhich all other rights depend. The idea that by this legislation we \nmake it easier to vote in this country and more difficult to scam the \nsystem is not an insignificant contribution. It may not get the \nnotoriety of other provisions, but the fact that we are proposing to \nspend $3.5 billion of taxpayer money on our elections system to allow \nStates to improve equipment, to allow people who are disabled, blind to \nbe able to cast a ballot in private and independently--the idea that we \nare going to have statewide voter registration lists, provisional \nballoting, these are major, major changes in the law. In addition this \nbill provides for the establishment of the independent commission on \nelections, as well as, of course, the antifraud provisions.\n  I have been proud of a lot of things with which I have been involved \nin my 22 years. Nothing exceeds the sense of pride I have this morning, \nas we close out the debate, on this bill and this Senate \naccomplishment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today is an historic day in the Senate \nmarked by passage of S. 565, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Equal \nProtection of Voting Rights Act. It has been my great honor and \nprivilege to have served as Chairman of the Rules and Administration \nCommittee during the pendency of this legislative effort and to have \nserved as floor manager during the Senate consideration.\n  This is landmark legislation. By enacting this bipartisan bill, the \nSenate will have established the authority, and responsibility, of \nCongress to regulate the administration of Federal elections, both in \nterms of assuring that voting systems and procedures are uniform and \nnondiscriminatory for all Americans and in ensuring the integrity of \nfederal election results. The House has already passed similar \nlegislation and I am confident that a House-Senate conference can act \nexpeditiously to send this measure to the White House.\n  While we should not underestimate the significance of this action, we \nhave been careful not to overstate the federal role in the \nadministration of Federal elections. This legislation does not replace \nthe historic role of state and local election officials, nor does it \ncreate a one-size-fits-all approach to balloting.\n  It does establish minimum Federal requirements for the conduct of \nFederal elections to ensure that the most fundamental of rights in a \ndemocracy--\n\n[[Page S2529]]\n\nthe right to vote and have that vote counted--is secure.\n  In Bush v. Gore, the Supreme Court condemned a recount process that \nwas `` . . . inconsistent with the minimum procedures necessary to \nprotect the fundamental right of each voter . . . ''\n  The basic equal protection doctrine underlying the majority opinion \nin Bush v. Gore is consistent with the principle of equal weight \naccorded to each vote and equal dignity owed to each voter. The Court \nstated in pertinent part:\n\n  The right to vote is protected in more than the initial allocation of \nthe franchise. Equal protection applies as well to the manner of its \nexercise. Having once granted the right to vote on equal terms, the \nstate may not, by later arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one \nperson's vote over that of another.\n\n  This legislation ensures that every eligible American voter is \nassured of such minimum procedures. Only then can we be sure that every \neligible American citizen has an equal opportunity to cast a vote and \nhave that vote counted, so that the integrity of the results of our \nFederal elections remains unchallenged. That is the minimum that a \nFederal legislature should do to ensure the vitality of its democracy.\n  This journey to secure our democratic system of government began when \nthe presidential November 2000 general election exposed to the citizens \nof this Nation, and the people of the entire world, the inadequacies of \nour Federal elections system. Throughout the last fifteen months of \nCongressional review, hearings, and legislative consideration, the \nefforts of this Senator have been guided by the words of Thomas Paine \nwho described the right to vote as the ``primary right by which other \nrights are protected.'' I would suggest that those are the words that \nshould guide the consideration and review of this legislative effort.\n  The bipartisan compromise being adopted by the Senate today is the \nculmination of several months of work by a dedicated group of our \ncolleagues with strongly held and diverse views on how best to improve \nour system of Federal elections. The compromise is just that--it is not \neverything that all of us wanted, but it is something that everyone \nwanted. And the more than 40 amendments adopted during the debate have \nfurther improved the measure. Clearly, in the case of this legislation, \nthe ability of the Senate to freely work its will through amendment and \ndebate has produced a superior product.\n  This bill is the culmination of efforts begun by the distinguished \nranking member, Senator McConnell, in the fall of 2000, as then-\nChairman of the Senate Rules Committee.\n  Shortly after the November 2000 general election, then-Chairman \nMcConnell announced a series of hearings on election reform. Under his \nleadership, the Committee held an initial hearing on March 14, 2001.\n  After the leadership of the Senate changed on June 6, 2001, I \nannounced that election reform would continue to be the primary \nlegislative priority of the Committee. As a result, the Rules Committee \nheld an additional three days of hearings last year on election reform, \nincluding an unprecedented, and enlightening, field hearing in Atlanta, \nGeorgia on July 23.\n  The Committee received testimony and written statements from a \nconglomeration of civil rights organizations, Congressional House \nmembers and caucuses, State and local election officials, study \ncommissions, election associations, task forces, academics, and average \nvoters.\n  But it was the field hearing in Atlanta that underscored this \nSenator's belief that this issue is not about what happened in one \nState or in one election. Election reform is about the systemic flaws \nin our Federal election system that we have long neglected--flaws which \nthe problems in Florida in November 2000 simply brought to our nation's \nattention.\n  Prior to the Atlanta hearing, the chief election official of the \nState of Georgia, Cathy Cox, testified to her experience. In her words:\n\n       As the presidential election drama unfolded in Florida last \n     November, one thought was foremost in my mind: there but for \n     the grace of God go I. Because the thought is, if the \n     presidential margin had been razor thin in Georgia and if our \n     election systems had undergone the same microscopic scrutiny \n     that Florida endured, we would have fared no better. In many \n     respects, we might have fared even worse.\n\n  Ms. Cox testified before the Rules Committee at its field hearing in \nAtlanta, hosted by my good friend, the Senator from Georgia, Senator \nMax Cleland. Ms. Cox reflected what many of our state and local \nelection officials believe--it could have been any State in the media \nspotlight that year--any state where the election was close.\n  In fact, according to the Caltech-MIT report, other States, including \nGeorgia, Idaho, Illinois, South Carolina, and Wyoming, and other \ncities, such as Chicago and New York, had higher rates of spoiled and \nuncounted ballots than Florida. Nor were these problems limited to just \nthe November presidential election.\n  The shortcomings in our election process have existed in many \nelections in States across this Nation. The Caltech-MIT report found \nthat there have been approximately 2 million uncounted, unmarked or \nspoiled ballots in each of the last four presidential elections. During \nhearings before the Senate Rules Committee last year, Carolyn \nJefferson-Jenkins, President of the League of Women Voters, testified \nthat:\n\n     . . . [t]he kinds of problems that we saw in 2000 are not \n     unusual. They represent the harvest from years of \n     indifference that has been shown toward one of the most \n     fundamental and important elements in our democratic system.\n\n  This concern was confirmed by the General Accounting Office, GAO, \nwhich conducted several comprehensive studies on the administration of \nelections. GAO found that 57 percent of voting jurisdictions nationwide \nexperienced major problems conducting the November 2000 elections.\n  Following the Rules Committee hearings, the Committee met on August 2 \nand voted to order reported S. 565, the Equal Protection of Voting \nRights Act. Shortly thereafter, I approached Senator Bond and Senator \nMcConnell and suggested that we attempt to find a bipartisan way to \napproach election reform. We were joined by Senator Schumer and Senator \nTorricelli and began meeting to craft a bipartisan compromise that \ncould be enacted prior to the completion of this Congress.\n  Each of my colleagues brought a unique perspective to the table. \nSenator McConnell has been steadfast in his pursuit of a new, \nbipartisan agency to ensure the continuing partnership between the \nFederal, State and local governments in Federal elections.\n  Senator Bond's long-standing interest in ensuring the integrity of \nFederal elections is reflected in the anti-fraud provisions contained \nin this compromise. Senator Schumer and Senator Torricelli were among \nthe first members of the Rules Committee to introduce bipartisan reform \nmeasures, and their commitment to the bipartisan process is evident \nthroughout this compromise.\n  I am grateful to all of them, and to their very talented staff, for \nthe time and dedication that each one committed to ensuring that a \nbipartisan solution could be presented to the Senate.\n  Throughout this process, all of us were committed to seeing \nmeaningful reform enacted. All of us were convinced that real reform \nhad to make it easier to vote but harder to defraud the system.\n  These twin goals--making it easier to vote and harder to corrupt our \nFederal elections system--underpin every provision of this compromise. \nThese goals are fundamental to ensuring that not only does every \neligible American have an equal opportunity to vote and have that vote \ncounted, but that the integrity of the results is unquestioned.\n  Nothing in this legislation, and no words spoken by this Senator in \nthis debate, should be construed to call into question the results of \nthe November 2000 elections. This effort is not about assessing whether \na particular candidate was legitimately elected. The fact that Congress \nmay ultimately enact minimum Federal requirements for the conduct of \nFederal elections should not imply that prior elections conducted \ninconsistently with such requirements are somehow less legitimate.\n  But what we cannot fail to recognize is that the mere closeness of \nthe presidential election in November 2000 tested our system of Federal \nelections to its limits and exposed both its strengths and its \nfailures.\n\n[[Page S2530]]\n\n  To underscore the uniqueness of the November 2000 general election, \nthe Carter-Ford National Commission on Federal Election Reform \nobserved, and I quote in pertinent part:\n\n       In 2000 the American electoral system was tested by a \n     political ordeal unlike any in living memory. From November 7 \n     until December 12 the outcome of the presidential election \n     was fought out in bitter political and legal struggles that \n     ranged throughout the state of Florida and ultimately \n     extended to the Supreme Court of the United States. Not since \n     1876-77 has the outcome of a national election remained so \n     unsettled, for so long. The nineteenth century political \n     crisis brought the United States close to a renewal of civil \n     war. Fortunately, no danger of armed conflict shadowed the \n     country in this more recent crisis. The American political \n     system proved its resilience. Nonetheless, the . . . election \n     shook American faith in the legitimacy of the democratic \n     process. . . . [I]n the electoral crisis of 2000 . . . the \n     ordinary institutions of election administration in the \n     United States, and specifically in Florida, just could not \n     readily cope with an extremely close election.\n\n  The legitimacy of our democratic process was called into question by \na close election because some Americans--be they people of color, or \nlanguage minority, or disability, or lesser economic condition--\nbelieved that the voting system they used, or the administrative \nprocesses they encountered, did not provide them an equal opportunity \nto cast their vote and have that vote counted.\n  The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights conducted an extensive study on \nvoting irregularities that occurred in Florida during the 2000 \npresidential election. The Commission found that African-Americans were \nnearly 10 times more likely than white voters to have their ballots \nrejected. The Commission found that poorer counties, particularly those \nwith large minority populations, were more likely to use voting systems \nwith higher spoilage rates than more affluent counties with significant \nwhite populations.\n  Additionally, an independent review of Florida's election systems \nconducted by members of the media found that, quoting from the New York \nTimes and Washington Post:\n\n       Black precincts had more than three times as many rejected \n     ballots as white precincts in [the November 2000] \n     presidential race in Florida, a disparity that persists even \n     after accounting for the effects of income, education and bad \n     ballot design . . . [s]imilar patterns were found in Hispanic \n     precincts and places with large elderly populations.\n\n  Again, this problem was not limited to Florida. The Committee also \nheard testimony at the Atlanta hearing that nearly half of all black \nvoters in Georgia used the ``least reliable equipment,'' while less \nthan 25 percent of white voters used that same equipment.\n  Election reform is clearly the first civil rights battle of the 21st \ncentury. As Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Chairperson of the Democratic \nCaucus Special Committee on Election Reform, has stated, ``there is no \nquestion, that the right to vote is the most important civil rights \nissue facing our Nation today.'' The Committee heard testimony to this \neffect at the Atlanta field hearing from Reverend Dr. Joseph E. Lowery, \nChairman of the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda. Reverend \nDoctor Lowery testified that:\n\n       No aspect of democracy is more sacred than the right to \n     vote and to have those votes counted. In 1965, thousands of \n     us marched from Selma to Montgomery to urge this nation to \n     remove any and all barriers based on race and color and \n     ethnicity related to the right to vote. . . . Dr. King could \n     not have anticipated that once we secured the ballot in 1965, \n     that we would be back here in 2001 demanding that our \n     government now assure us that our votes are fairly and \n     accurately counted.\n\n  And we must ensure that all Americans have an equal opportunity to \nhave their votes counted.\n  That is why this Senate, and this Congress, and this President, \ncannot squander this opportunity to reinforce the strengths and correct \nthe failures in our system of Federal elections. To fail to act would \nbe nothing less than an abdication of our collective obligations.\n  Luckily, unlike many other challenges that are presented to the U.S. \nCongress, the vast majority of flaws in our federal election system are \neminently fixable. As the Carter-Ford Commission found, ``the \nweaknesses in election administration are, to a very great degree, \nproblems that government can actually solve.''\n  Further, the Rules Committee found remarkable consensus regarding the \nproblems that exist with our Federal election systems and the statutory \nchanges that need to be made in response. The distinguished Ranking \nMember, Senator McConnell, noted during one of our hearings that the \nmessage to Congress was unanimous: ``Congress must act, and act soon, \nto come to the aid of states and localities.''\n  And such cannot be accomplished in a partisan manner. Only through a \nbipartisan effort to assess and support the strengths and identify and \ncorrect the failures can we achieve meaningful, and lasting, election \nreform.\n  I submit to my colleagues that the provisions of the bipartisan \nsubstitute we are voting on today are intended to accomplish just that.\n  The principle behind our approach is very simple. The Federal \nGovernment has an obligation to provide leadership, both in terms of \nestablishing minimum Federal requirements for the conduct of Federal \nelections and in terms of providing financial resources to State and \nlocal governments to meet those minimum requirements.\n  For too long leadership at the federal level has been lacking. After \nthe elections of November 2000, Congress can no longer afford to ignore \nour obligation to the States to be an equal partner in the \nadministration of the elections that choose our national leadership.\n  The provisions of this bipartisan compromise attempt to meet our \nobligation by establishing minimum Federal requirements--not a-one-\nsize-fits-all solution--but broad standards that can be met in \ndifferent ways by every balloting system used in America today. And \nthis bipartisan compromise provides the necessary resources to fully \nfund these requirements in every one of the 186,000 polling places \nacross this Nation.\n  Let me first give my colleagues a broad overview of what the bill we \nare about to adopt does and then go through each section to more fully \nexplain how the provisions will work.\n  The compromise bill, as improved by amendments adopted during Senate \ndebate, establishes three Federal minimum requirements for Federal \nelections that will affect voting systems, including machines and \nballots, and the administration of Federal elections. These three \nrequirements touch the very voting systems and administrative \nprocedures that alienated Americans across this Nation in November of \n2000 and called into question the integrity of the final election \nresults.\n  The first requirement sets minimum Federal standards that voting \nsystems and election technology must meet by the federal elections of \n2006. Essentially, these common sense standards are designed to provide \nnotice and a second-chance voting opportunity for all eligible voters, \nincluding the disabled, the blind and language minorities, in case the \nvoter's ballot was incorrectly marked or spoiled.\n  This requirement conforms to important recommendations from the \nCaltech-MIT and Carter-Ford Commission reports. As the Carter-Ford \nreport stated, we must `` . . . seek to ensure that every qualified \ncitizen has an equal opportunity to vote and that every individual's \nvote is equally effective.''\n  The Carter-Ford report specifically recommended that the Federal \nGovernment develop a comprehensive set of voting equipment system \nstandards. The Commission also took great pains to encourage the use of \ntechnology and election systems that ensure the voting rights of all \ncitizens, including language minorities. Similarly, the Caltech-MIT \nreport emphasized the importance of equipment that allows voters to fix \ntheir mistakes, provides for an audit trail, and is accessible to the \ndisabled and language minorities.\n  The second requirement provides that all voters be given a chance to \ncast a provisional ballot if for some reason his or her name is not \nincluded on the registration list or the voter's eligibility to vote is \notherwise challenged.\n  Almost every organization that has examined election problems has \nrecommended the adoption of provisional\n\n[[Page S2531]]\n\nvoting, including, but not limited to the: National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People (NAACP); National Commission on Federal \nElection Reform (Carter-Ford Commission); National Association of \nSecretaries of State (NASS); National Association of State Election \nDirectors (NASED); National Task Force on Election Reform; Democratic \nCaucus Special Committee on Election Reform; Caltech-MIT Voting \nTechnology Project; Constitution Project; League of Women Voters (LWV); \nAmerican Association of Persons with Disabilities (AAPD); Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights (LCCR); National Council of La Raza (NCLR); \nAsian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF); U.S. \nCommission on Civil Rights; and Federal Election Commission.\n  The Caltech-MIT report estimates that the aggressive use of \nprovisional ballots could cut the lost votes due to registration \nproblems in half. The Carter-Ford Commission recommended going even \nfarther than the compromise. The Commission noted, ``No American \nqualified to vote anywhere in her or his State should be turned away \nfrom a polling place in that State.''\n  According to a survey by the Congressional Research Service, at least \n15 States and the District of Columbia have a provisional ballot \nstatute; 17 States have statutes that provide for some aspects of a \nprovisional balloting process; and 18 States have no provisional ballot \nstatute but have related provisions. For example, five of these States \nhave same-day voter registration procedures and at least one State, \nNorth Dakota, does not require any voter registration.\n  Studies by GAO confirm that over three-quarters of the jurisdictions \nnationwide had at least one procedure in place to help resolve \neligibility questions for voters whose name does not appear on the \nregistration list at the polling place. However, the procedures and \ninstructions developed to permit provisional voting differed across \njurisdictions.\n  Provisional voting, as defined under the bipartisan compromise, would \navoid situations like the one recounted to the Democratic Caucus \nSpecial Committee on Election Reform by two citizens living in \nPhiladelphia, Juan Ramos and Petricio Morales.\n  They testified that in Philadelphia, voters whose names did not \nappear on the precinct roster were forced to travel to police stations \nand go before a judge, who would then determine whether or not they had \nthe right to vote. Not surprisingly, many voters whose names were \nmissing from the list wound up not voting rather than face these \nintimidating logistical hurdles.\n  If an individual is motivated enough to go to the polls and sign an \naffidavit that he or she is eligible to vote in that election, then the \nsystem ought to protect that individual's right to cast a ballot, even \nif only a provisional ballot. And that right is so fundamental, as is \nevidenced by its widespread use across this Nation, that we must ensure \nthat it is offered to all Americans, not in an identical process, but \nin a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner.\n  And that is what the compromise accomplished by ensuring that so long \nas the minimum standards were satisfied regarding the provisional \nvoting process, it does not matter what that provisional balloting \nprocess is called so long as it is a way to ensure equal access to the \nballot box. While all jurisdictions must meet this requirement, the \namendment offered by the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, \nfurther clarifies that those States which are currently exempt from the \nprovisions of the National Voter Registration Act, or Motor-Voter, can \nmeet the requirements for provisional balloting through their current \nregistration systems.\n\n  The second requirement also provides that election officials post \ninformation in the polling place on election day, such as a sample \nballot and voting instructions to inform voters of their rights. \nProvisional balloting must be available by the Federal elections of \n2004, while the posting of voting information on election day must \nbegin upon enactment of the legislation.\n  GAO found that the two most common ways jurisdictions provided voter \ninformation were to make it available at the election office and to \nprint it in the local newspapers.\n  With respect to sample ballots, 91 percent of the jurisdictions \nnationwide made them available at the election office, and 71 percent \nprinted them in the local newspaper. Nationwide, 82 percent of the \njurisdictions printed a list of polling places in the local paper.\n  In contrast, only 18 percent to 20 percent of jurisdictions \nnationwide placed public service ads on local media, performed \ncommunity outreach programs, and put some voter information on the \nInternet. Mailing voter information to all registered voters was the \nleast used approach, with 13 percent of the jurisdictions mailing \nvoting instructions, 7 percent mailing sample ballots; and finally, 6 \npercent mailing voter information on polling locations.\n  The third requirement is intended to facilitate the administration of \nelections, especially on election day, and to guard against possible \ncorruption of the system. This requirement calls for the establishment, \nby Federal elections in 2004, of a statewide computerized registration \nlist that will ensure all eligible voters can vote. It will also ensure \nthat the names of ineligible voters will not appear on the rolls.\n  The Carter-Ford Commission explicitly recommended that every state \nadopt a system of statewide voter registration. The Caltech-MIT report \nsimilarly recommended the development of better databases with a \nnumerical identifier for each voter. The Constitution Project also \ncalled for the development of a statewide computerized voter \nregistration system that can be routinely updated and is accessible at \npolling places on election day.\n  Additionally, this requirement establishes identification procedures \nfor first-time voters who have registered by mail. In order to ensure \nagainst fraud and the possibility that mail-in registrants are not \neligible to vote, first-time voters unless otherwise exempted will \npresent verification of their identify at the polling place or submit \nsuch verification with their absentee ballot. The manager's amendment \nadopted last evening harmonizes this provision with the 2004 effective \ndate for provisional balloting and the creation of computerized \nstatewide registration lists. This is an important change that \nrecognizes the administrative burden of the provision on both States \nand voters and so provides adequate time for jurisdictions to come into \ncompliance and educate voters about the new provision. This amendment \nalso establishes a uniform effective date of January 1, 2003 for first-\ntime voter registration subject to the first-time voter provision. This \nassures that all eligible voters, regardless of where they live or \nvote, will know that if they register to vote after that date, they \nwill have to meet the new requirements for first-time mail-registrant \nvoters.\n  In order to fund these requirements and other election reforms by the \nStates, the bipartisan compromise establishes three grant programs. The \nfirst grant program, the requirements grant program, provides funds to \nState and local governments to implement these three requirements. The \ncompromise authorizes $3 billion over 4 years, with no matching \nrequirement, for this purpose. Under the amendment offered by Senators \nCollins, Jeffords and others, as adopted by the Senate, each State will \nreceive a minimum grant equal to one-half of 1 percent of the total \nappropriation.\n  The second grant program is an incentive grant program designed to \nauthorize $400 million in this fiscal year to allow State and local \ngovernments to begin improving their voting systems and administrative \nprocedures, even before the requirements go into effect. These funds \nmay also be used for reform measures, such as training poll workers and \nofficials, voter education programs, same-day registration procedures, \nand programs to deter election fraud.\n  Finally, in response to the GAO report that 84 percent of all polling \nplaces, from the parking lot to the voting booth, remain inaccessible \nto the disabled, the compromise creates a third grant program to \nprovide funds to States and localities to improve the physical \naccessibility of polling places. This important initiative will help \nassure that no matter what the physical impediment, all eligible \nAmericans will be able to not only reach and enter the polling place, \nbut enter the voting\n\n[[Page S2532]]\n\nbooth to cast their ballot as well. While this bill does not eliminate \ncurbside voting, the amendment offered by Senators McCain and Harkin, \nand incorporated into the bill, as well as provisions of the amendment \nby Senator Thomas adopted last night, expresses the sense of the Senate \nthat curbside voting be the last alternative used to accommodate \ndisabled voters. We are hopeful that these funds will make that a \nreality.\n  The final provision of the compromise establishes a new, bipartisan \nFederal agency to administer the grant programs and provide on-going \nsupport to State and local election officials in the administration of \nFederal elections. This new entity reflects an appropriate continuing \nfederal role in the administration of Federal elections.\n  This bipartisan Federal election commission will be comprised of four \npresidential appointees, confirmed by the Senate, who will each serve a \nsingle, 6-year term. In order to ensure that all actions taken by the \ncommission are strictly bipartisan, including the approval of any \ngrants and the issuance of all guidelines, every action of the \ncommission must be by majority vote.\n  With that overview, let me go through the compromise and explain its \nprovisions in greater detail. The first title of the bill lays out \nthree uniform and nondiscriminatory election technology and \nadministration requirements which shall be met.\n  Although some have advocated instituting optional reforms, others \nhave insisted that only minimum Federal requirements would ensure that \nevery eligible voter can cast a vote and have that vote counted. The \nco-author of the ``Equal Protection of Voting Rights Act'' who serves \nas the ranking Democrat of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman \nJohn Conyers, cautioned in his testimony before the Rules Committee \nagainst adopting measures that would allow ``States to simply elect to \nopt out of any standards,'' noting that past landmark civil rights \nbills, including the Voting Rights Act and the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, also set minimum Federal standards.\n  As the Democratic Caucus Special Committee on Election Reform \nreported:\n\n     We do not believe that funding, without some basic minimum \n     standards, is sufficient to achieve meaningful reform. If \n     states were allowed to opt out of the recommended changes in \n     Federal elections, voters in those States would be denied the \n     opportunity to participate in Federal elections on the same \n     basis as voters in other States which adopt the reforms. In \n     presidential elections, where the votes of citizens in one \n     State are dependent on the votes of citizens in others, this \n     discrepancy could diminish the impact of votes in those \n     States that agree to implement these reforms.\n\n  The requirements approach is also supported by six members of the \nCarter-Ford Commission, who wrote in an additional statement following \nthe report that Congress should insist upon certain requirements, \nincluding voting systems and practices that produce low rates of \nuncounted ballots, accessible voting technologies, statewide \nprovisional balloting, and voter education and information, including \nthe provision of sample ballots.\n  As Christopher Edley, Jr., a member of the Carter-Ford Commission and \nprofessor at Harvard Law School, wrote, ``At their core, their reforms \nare intended to vindicate our civil and constitutional rights. They are \ntoo fundamental to be framed as some intergovernmental fiscal deal, \nbargained out through an appropriations process.''\n  These requirements are not intended to produce a single uniform \nvoting system or a single set of uniform administrative procedures. On \nthe contrary, they are intended to ensure that any voting system and \ncertain administrative practices meet uniform standards that result in \nan equal opportunity for all eligible Americans to cast a ballot and \nhave that ballot counted.\n  GAO found that both a jurisdiction's voting equipment and its \ndemographic make-up had a statistically significant effect on the \npercentage of uncounted votes. As a result, GAO found that counties \nwith higher percentage of minority voters had higher rates of uncounted \nvotes. GAO also reported that the percentages of uncounted presidential \nvotes were higher in minority areas than in others, regardless of \nvoting equipment. These findings underscore the importance of \ninstituting minimum Federal requirements that will ensure that all \nvoters have an equal opportunity to vote and have their vote counted, \nregardless of their race, disability or ethnicity or the state in which \nthey reside.\n  The House Democratic Caucus Special Committee on Election Reform \nspecifically recommended that Congress institute minimum national \nstandards that require voting systems with error detection devices that \nare fully accessible to elderly voters, voters with physical \ndisabilities, and visually impaired voters. Likewise, six members of \nthe Carter-Ford Commission advised Congress to require states and \nlocalities to use voting technologies that produce low rates of \nuncounted ballots, are accessible to voters with disabilities, are \nadaptable to non-English speakers, and allow all voters to cast a \nsecret ballot.\n  The first requirement establishes standards that all voting systems \nmust meet for any Federal election held in a jurisdiction after January \n1, 2006.\n  It is important to note, that with regard to effective dates, the \nactual date on which the requirements must be implemented will vary \nfrom jurisdiction to jurisdiction depending upon when the first Federal \nelection occurs in 2006. A Federal election is intended to include a \ngeneral, primary, special, or runoff election for Federal office.\n  There are five basic standards that all voting systems shall meet \nunder the first requirement:\n  First, a notification procedure to inform a voter when he or she has \nover-voted, including the opportunity to verify and correct the ballot \nbefore it is cast and tabulated. This first standard is modified for \nvoting systems in which the voter casts a paper or punch card ballot or \nvotes are counted at a central location, as provided for in the \namendment offered by Senator Cantwell and incorporated into the bill.\n  Second, all voting systems must produce a record with an audit \ncapacity, including a permanent paper record that will serve as an \nofficial record for recounts. As the Chairman of the Rules Committee, \nlet me advise my colleagues of the importance of this feature in the \nunlikely event that a petition of election contest is filed with the \nSenate. Often, in order to resolve such contests, the Rules Committee \nmust have access to an audit trail in order to determine which \ncandidate received the most votes.\n  Third, all voting systems must be accessible to persons with \ndisabilities.\n  Fourth, all voting systems must provide for alternative language \naccessibility; and\n  Fifth, all voting systems must meet a Federal error rate in counting \nballots, which will be established by the new election administration \ncommission.\n  A few of these standards merit additional discussion. With regard to \nthe first standard, which requires notification to the voter of an \nover-vote, there has been a great deal of misunderstanding about this \nprovision. The compromise before us made significant changes in the \noriginal bill reported by the Rules Committee. The original bill \nrequired that voting systems notify a voter of both over-votes and \nunder-votes. This compromise deletes the required notification of an \nunder-vote. While the new commission is charged with studying the \nfeasibility of notifying voters of under-votes, there is no under-vote \nnotification requirement in the compromise.\n  To further clarify the purpose of over-vote notification, there is no \nintent to have an adverse impact on any jurisdiction with election \nadministration procedures for instant runoff or preferential voting. \nAll jurisdictions, including Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, New \nMexico and Vermont are not prohibited from using such voting procedures \nto conduct instant runoff or preferential under this Act.\n  Notification is an essential standard because it provides an eligible \nvoter a ``second chance'' opportunity to correct his or her ballot \nbefore it is cast and tabulated.\n  The Caltech-MIT report emphasized the need for voting equipment that \n``. . . give[s] voters a chance to change their ballots to fix any \nmistakes . . .'' Similarly, the Carter-Ford Commission explicitly \nrecommended that: ``Voters should have the opportunity to correct \nerrors at the precinct or other polling place . . .''\n\n[[Page S2533]]\n\n  With regard to the notification, it is the voting system itself, or \nthe educational document, and not a poll worker or election official, \nwhich notifies the voter of an over-vote. The sanctity of a private \nballot is so fundamental to our system of elections, that the language \nof this compromise contains a specific requirement that any \nnotification under this section preserve the privacy of the voter and \nthe confidentiality of the ballot.\n  The Caltech-MIT study noted that secrecy and anonymity of the ballot \nprovides important checks on coercion and fraud in the form of \nwidespread vote buying.\n  This concern for preserving the sanctity of the ballot, as well as \npractical differences in paper ballots versus machines, led us to \ncreate an alternative notification standard for paper ballots, punch \ncard systems, and central count systems.\n  Paper ballot systems include those systems where the individual votes \na paper ballot that is tabulated by hand. Central count systems \nincludes mail-in absentee ballots and mail-in balloting, such as that \nused extensively in Oregon and Washington State, and to a lesser extent \nin Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, Kansas, and 13 other States \nwhere a paper ballot is voted and then sent off to a central location \nto be tabulated by an optical scanning or punch card system. Under the \nbill as clarified by Senator Cantwell's amendment, a mail-in ballot or \nmail-in absentee ballot is treated as a paper ballot for purposes of \nnotification of an over-vote under section 101 of this compromise, as \nis a ballot counted on a central count voting system. However, if an \nindividual votes in person on a central count system, as is used in \nsome states which allow early voting or in-person absentee voting, for \nthat voter, such system must actually notify the voter of the over-\nvote.\n  In the case of punch cards and paper ballot and central count \nsystems, including mail-in ballots and mail-in absentee ballots, the \nstate or locality need only establish a voter education program \nspecific to that voting system in use which tells the voter the effect \nof casting multiple votes for a single Federal office.\n  Regardless of a punch card system or a paper ballot voting system, \nall mail-in ballots and mail-in absentee ballots must still meet the \nrequirement of providing a voter with the opportunity to correct the \nballot before it is cast and tabulated under section 101 of this \ncompromise.\n  I also want to note for the record that although this compromise \nprovides an alternative method of notifying voters of over-votes for \npunch card and paper ballot systems, nothing in this legislation \nprecludes jurisdictions from going beyond what is required, so long as \nsuch methods are not inconsistent with the Federal requirements under \nthis title or any law described in section 402 of this Act.\n  In fact, Cook County, Illinois uses a punch card reader that can be \nprogrammed to notify the voter of both over-votes and under-votes. It \nis my understanding that this technology can provide an individual \nvoter with such notification in a completely private and confidential \nmanner. The system allows the voter to correct his or her ballot or \noverride the notice if the voter so desires.\n  As for the other types of voting systems, namely lever machines, \nprecinct-based optical scanning systems, and direct recording \nelectronic systems--or DREs--the voting system itself must meet the \nstandard. Specifically, the voting system must be programmed to permit \nthe voter to verify the votes selected, provide the voter with an \nopportunity to change or correct the ballot before it is cast or \ntabulated, and actually notify the voter if he or she casts more than \none vote for a single-candidate office.\n  Again, it is important to understand that it is the machine itself, \nand not the poll worker or official, that notifies the voter.\n  We believe that the bill as amended recognizes the inherent \ndifferences between paper ballot systems and mechanical or electronic \nvoting systems, and is a reasonable accommodation which nonetheless \nensures that all voters will have the information and the notice \nnecessary to avoid spoiling their ballot due to an over-vote.\n\n  Let me also take a minute to discuss the disabled accessibility \nstandard. This is perhaps one of the most important provisions of this \ncompromise. The fact is ten million blind voters did not vote in the \n2000 elections in part because they cannot read the ballots used in \ntheir jurisdiction. In this age of technology that is simply \nunacceptable.\n  The Committee received a great deal of disturbing testimony regarding \nthe disenfranchisement of Americans with disabilities. Mr. James \nDickson, Vice President of the American Association of People with \nDisabilities, testified that our Nation has a ``. . . crisis of access \nto the polling places.'' Twenty-one million Americans with disabilities \ndid not vote in the last election--the single largest demographic \ngroups of non-voters.\n  To respond to this ``crisis of access,'' this compromise requires \nthat by the federal elections of 2006, all voting systems must be \naccessible for individuals with disabilities, including nonvisual \naccessibility for the blind and visually impaired. Most importantly, \nthat accommodation must be provided in a manner that provides the same \nopportunity for access and participation, including privacy and \nindependence, as for other voters.\n  In order to assist the states and localities in meeting this \nstandard, the bill adds an important new provision that allows \njurisdictions to satisfy this standard through the use of at least one \ndirect recording electronic (DRE) voting system in every polling place.\n  Let me note that these voting systems are not just for the use of the \ndisabled. According to GAO, approximately 12 percent of registered \nvoters nationwide used DREs in the last Federal election. Obviously, \nanyone in the polling place can use the system. But these machines can \nbe manipulated by not only the blind and vision-impaired, but by \nparaplegic and other individuals with motor skill disabilities.\n  Furthermore, the Caltech-MIT study suggests that DREs have the \npotential to allow for more flexible user interfaces to accommodate \nmany languages. This means that DRE voting systems can also be used to \nmeet the accessibility requirements for language minorities as well. \nMoreover, the bill does not require that a jurisdiction purchase a DRE \nto meet the accessiblity requirements. Jurisdictions may also choose to \nmodify existing systems to meet the needs of the disabled.\n  Some of my colleagues have expressed concerns that this may be a \nwasteful requirement for jurisdictions that have no known disabled \nvoters. Let me make clear that the purpose of this requirement is to \nensure that the disabled have an equal opportunity to vote, just as all \nother non-disabled Americans, with privacy and independence. It is \nsimply not acceptable that the disabled should have to hide in their \nhomes and not participate with other Americans on election day simply \nbecause no one knows that they exist.\n  I have indicated my willingness to look at the impact of the each of \nthe bill's provisions on small communities and rural areas in \nconference, and the amendment by Senator Thomas adopted last evening \nexpresses that. With regard to the disability provisions, I will do so \nwith the twin goals of ease of administration but equality of voting \nopportunity in mind.\n  Finally, let me touch on the issue of alternative language \naccessibility. This standard generally follows the procedures for \ndetermining when a language minority must be accommodated under the \nVoting Rights Act, with an important difference. The Voting Rights Act \nrecognizes only four general groups of language minorities: Asian \nAmericans, people of Spanish heritage, Native Americans and native \nAlaskans.\n  This compromise leaves in place the numerical triggers under the \nVoting Rights Act. It merely allows groups who otherwise do not meet \nthe very narrow definition in the Voting Rights Act to nonetheless \nreceive an alternative language ballot. So, if a Haitian or a Croatian \npopulation meets the numerical triggers, they, too, will have access to \nbilingual materials in their native language.\n  With the addition of section 203 in 1975 to the Voting Rights Act of \n1965, Congress sought to increase voter turnout of language minorities \nby requiring bilingual voting assistance.\n  In 1992, Congress amended, reauthorized and strengthened section 203 \nby\n\n[[Page S2534]]\n\npassing the Voting Rights Language Assistance Act with an expiration \ndate of 2007.\n  This Act requires states and political subdivisions with significant \nnumbers of non-English speaking citizens of voting age to improve \nlanguage assistance at the polls for American voters. The required \nbilingual assistance includes bilingual ballots, voting materials, and \noral translation services.\n  These bilingual services are triggered when the Census Bureau \ndetermines that more than 5 percent of the voting age citizens are of a \nsingle language minority and are limited-English proficient; or more \nthan 10,000 citizens of voting age are members of a single language \nminority who are limited in their English proficiency.\n  Here we are in 2002 with the same concerns for our language \nminorities. Accordingly, our compromise follows the Congressional \ntradition of strengthening voting assistance to our language minority \ncitizens by including language minority groups that were not included \nin earlier amendments to the Voting Rights Act. It merely widens the \ncoverage of language minorities to ensure that a large number of \nlimited-English speakers may participate in the elections process.\n  This is accomplished by ensuring alternative language accessibility \nto voting systems, provisional balloting, and inclusion as a registered \nvoter in the statewide voter registration lists. These safeguards \nprovide an equal opportunity for all eligible language minorities to \ncast a vote and have that vote counted.\n\n  In the spirit of minority language accessibility under the Voting \nRights Act, the purpose of this bill is to establish uniform, \nnondiscriminatory standards for voting systems and administration of \nelections. To continue to recognize only four distinct language \nminority groups is neither uniform nor nondiscriminatory.\n  This Act also provides for a Commission study to determine whether \nthe voting systems are, in fact, capable of accommodating all voters \nwith a limited proficiency in the English language and make necessary \nrecommendations.\n  This compromise includes provisions specifying how lever voting \nsystems may meet the multilingual voting requirements if it is not \npracticable to add the alternative language to the lever voting system \nand the state or locality has filed a request for a waiver.\n  Finally, the requirement that voting systems meet a uniform, national \nerror rate standard is a particularly important reform. Requiring \nvoting systems to conform to a nationwide error rate ensures the \nintegrity of the results and greater uniformity and nondiscriminatory \nresults in the casting and tabulating of ballots. It is important to \nnote that error rates encompass more than just errors due to the \nmechanical failure of the equipment and can reflect design flaws that \nimpede the ability of voters to accurately operate the voting system. \nError rates should reflect the design, accuracy, and performance of \nsystems under normal voting conditions.\n  Similarly, operating failures of the voting system, or voter \nconfusion about how to operate technology or use various types of \nballots, may be the result of unclear instructions or poor ballot \ndesign. The Committee received information from the American Institute \nof Graphic Arts regarding the importance of design in the voting \nexperience. AIGA has been working with the Federal Election Commission \nto educate the FEC on the importance of communication design. It would \nbe appropriate for the new Election Administration Commission to study \nthe issue of communication design criteria and consider incorporating \nsuch ideas into its guidelines.\n  In order to ensure that states and localities have sufficient time to \nmeet these requirements, the compromise directs that the Office of \nElection Administration--which is currently housed at the Federal \nElection Commission but will be transferred to the new Election \nAdministration Commission--issue revised voting system standards by \nJanuary 1, 2004, two years before the standards must be in place. This \nshould give vendors sufficient time to modify and certify their \nproducts and allow State and local governments to procure DREs which \nare disable accessible for each polling place.\n  Most importantly, the compromise states that nothing in the language \nof the voting system requirements shall require a jurisdiction to \nchange their existing voting system for another. Unlike the H.R. 3295, \nthe bill that passed the House, this compromise presumes, protects, and \npreserves, all methods of balloting. And while some systems may have to \nbe enhanced or modified to some extent, or additional voter education \nconducted, no jurisdiction is required by this bill to exchange the \ncurrent voting system used in that jurisdiction with a new system in \norder to be in compliance.\n  However, the voting system that is in use must meet these standards \nin order to ensure that all eligible voters have access to a uniform, \nnondiscriminatory system.\n  It is vitally important that the Congress institute these basic \nvoting system standards. As Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, Chair \nof the Congressional Black Caucus testified, ``All over the world, the \nUnited States is seen as the guarantor of democracy. This country has \nsent countless scores of observers to foreign lands to assure that the \nprocess of democracy is scrupulously maintained. We cannot do less for \nourselves than we have done for others.''\n  The second Federal minimum requirement contained in the compromise \nprovides for provisional balloting and the posting of voting \ninformation in the polling place on election day.\n  For Federal elections beginning after January 1, 2004, State and \nlocal election officials shall make a provisional ballot available to \nvoters whose names do not appear on the registration rolls or who are \notherwise challenged as ineligible.\n  In order to receive a provisional ballot, the voter must execute a \nwritten affirmation that he or she is a registered voter in that \njurisdiction and is eligible to vote in that election. Once executed, \nthe affidavit is handed over to the appropriate election official who \nmust promptly verify the information and issue a ballot.\n  The election official then makes a determination, under state law, as \nto whether the voter is eligible to vote in the jurisdiction, or not, \nand shall count the ballot accordingly.\n  It is important to note that in some jurisdictions, the verification \nof voter eligibility will take place prior to the issuance of a ballot \nbased upon the information in the written affidavit. In other \njurisdictions, the ballot will be issued and then laid aside for \nverification later. Both procedures are equally valid under the \ncompromise, and the amendment adopted last evening, offered by the \nSenator from Michigan, Senator Levin, reflects that. The authors of the \ncompromise have repeatedly said that we do not require a one-size-fits-\nall approach to elections in this bill. The same is true for the \nprovisional balloting requirement which provides flexibility to states \nto meet the needs of their communities in slightly differing ways.\n  In order to ensure that voters who cast provisional ballots are \nproperly registered in time for the next election, within 30 days of \nthe election the appropriate election official must notify, in writing, \nthose voters whose ballots are not counted. A voter whose provisional \nballot is counted does not have to be individually notified of such.\n  This bipartisan compromise requires all 50 States and the District of \nColumbia to provide for provisional balloting in Federal elections, \neven if a State also permits same-day registration or requires no \nregistration. In States without voter registration requirements, \nprovisional balloting will protect the rights of voters whose \neligibility to cast a ballot is officially challenged, for whatever \nreason, at the polling place.\n  In States with same-day voter registration, the right to cast a \nprovisional ballot will protect an eligible voter who pre-registers and \nwhose name is not on the official list of eligible voters or whose \neligibility is challenged by an election official, but who cannot re-\nregister on Election Day. For example, a properly registered legal \nvoter heading to the polls might not carry the identification required \nby the State for same-day voter registration. Under this compromise, if \nthat voter's\n\n[[Page S2535]]\n\nname does not appear on the list of eligible voters or the voter's \neligibility is officially challenged, the voter could cast a \nprovisional ballot. If the voter does have the identification required \nto register on Election Day, he or she would have the option of \nregistering again and casting a ballot in accordance with state law. \nSame-day registration thus not only boosts voter turnout but also \noffers another way that states can guard against disenfranchising \nvoters as the result of registration problems that arise on election \nday.\n  This compromise further ensures that a voter will receive a \nprovisional ballot if he or she needs one. The provisional ballot will \nbe counted if the individual is eligible under State law to vote in the \njurisdiction. It is our intent that the word ``jurisdiction,'' for the \npurpose of determining whether the provisional ballot is to be counted, \nhas the same meaning as the term ``registrar's jurisdiction'' in \nsection 8(j) of the National Voter Registration Act.\n  However, the appropriate election official must also establish a free \naccess system, such as a toll-free phone line or Internet website, \nthrough which any voter who casts a provisional ballot can find out \nwhether his or her ballot was counted, and if it was not counted, why \nit was not counted. Voters casting a provisional ballot will be \ninformed of this notification process at the time they vote. And the \ncompromise requires that the security, confidentiality, and integrity \nof the information be maintained.\n  In order to ensure that voters are aware of the provisional balloting \nprocess and are provided information about sample ballots and their \nvoting rights, the compromise requires that certain election \ninformation be posted at the polling place on election day. This is a \nsignificant change from the original bill which required an actual \nmailing to each registered voter or the equivalent of such notice \nthrough publication and media distribution. Although some states \nalready mail individual sample ballots to the homes of registered \nvoters and post voting information in the polling place, the compromise \nwill establish a national uniform standard with respect to voting \ninformation.\n  Like provisional voting, increased voter education is widely \nendorsed. The Carter-Ford report recommends the use of sample ballots \nand other voter education tools. The report of the Democratic Caucus \nSpecial Committee on Election Reform also urged increased voter \neducation efforts, especially targeted to new voters.\n\n  The Caltech-MIT report advocates increased voter education, including \nthe publication of sample ballots, providing instructional areas at \npolling places, and additional training for poll workers, as a way to \nreduce the number of lost votes. Other organizations support additional \nvoter education, including the League of Women Voters, the Constitution \nProject, and the NAACP.\n  Voter education is particularly important for communities \ndisproportionately impacted by the current inadequacies in our voting \nsystems. As Anil Lewis, President of the Atlanta metropolitan chapter \nof the National Federation of the Blind, testified to at the Committee \nhearing in Atlanta:\n\n       Many of the disenfranchised, disabled voters do not have \n     [a] record of knowing that the polls are now accessible. Many \n     of them, out of frustration, have refused to go to the polls \n     to vote. They have not taken advantage of the absentee \n     opportunity to vote as an absentee ballot, but by educating \n     them that these accommodations are now in place, we are going \n     to increase the vote turnout for people with disabilities.\n\n  Hilary O. Shelton, president of the Washington, D.C. chapter of the \nNAACP, testified before the Committee about poll workers who told \nAfrican-American voters that they could not have another ballot after \nthey had made a mistake on their first one, despite a State statutory \nrequirement that voters be given another punch card if they needed one.\n  The clear message the Committee received is that voters, particularly \nthose with special needs, simply do not know what services and voting \nopportunities are available to them. This requirement will ensure that \nvoting information will be provided.\n  The specific information that must be posted in the polling place \nincludes: a sample ballot with instructions, including instructions on \nhow to cast a provisional ballot; information regarding the date and \nhours the polling place will be open; information on the additional \nverification required by voters who register by mail and are voting for \nthe first time; and general information on voting rights under Federal \nand State law and instructions on how to contact the appropriate \nofficial if such rights are alleged to have been violated.\n  The requirement for posting voting information in the polling place \nis effective for federal elections which occur after the date of \nenactment of the legislation.\n  While it is not anticipated that extensive guidelines will be \nnecessary to implement the provisional ballot requirement, any such \nguidelines must be issued by January 1, 2003, either by the Department \nof Justice, or the new Election Administration Commission if it is up \nand running.\n  The third requirement calls for the creation of a statewide \ncomputerized voter registration list and new verification procedures \nfor first-time voters who register by mail. This requirement will \nfacilitate the administration of election day activities and addresses \nconcerns about possible voter registration fraud. Although GAO found \nthere is less than a 1 percent to 5 percent incident of fraud \nnationwide the reality is that even an insignificant potential for \nfraud can undermine the confidence of voters, election officials, \npolitical parties, etc., in the results of a close election.\n  More specifically, GAO found as a general matter that most \njurisdictions did not identify this type of fraud as a major concern, \nbecause state and local election officials have established procedures \nfor preventing mail-in absentee fraud.\n  GAO estimated that less than 1 percent to 5 percent of jurisdictions \nnationwide experienced special problems with absentee voting fraud \nduring recent elections. However, the absentee voting fraud concerns \ntend to fall into three categories, including: one, someone other than \nthe appropriate voter casting the mail-in absentee ballot; two, \nabsentee voters voting more than once; and three, voters being \nintimidated or unduly influenced while voting the mail-in absentee \nballot.\n  GAO also reported that during the November 2000 elections, local \nelection jurisdictions used several procedures to prevent fraud in the \nabove three areas, including providing notice to such voters about the \npotential legal consequences of providing inaccurate or fraudulent \ninformation on the balloting materials.\n  Finally, GAO reported that some of the local election officials \ncommented that they had referred certain cases to the local District \nAttorney's office for possible prosecution.\n  Specifically, the third requirement of the compromise provides that \neach State, acting through the chief State election official, shall \nestablish an interactive computerized statewide voter registration list \nby the first Federal election in 2004.\n  This computerized list must contain the name and registration \ninformation for every legally registered voter in the State. To ensure \naccurate list maintenance and to deter potential fraud, the list must \nassign a unique identifier to each voter, and the list must be \naccessible to State and local election officials in the State. \nFurthermore, the compromise permits the use of social security numbers \nfor voter registration while ensuring that privacy guarantees are \nmaintained.\n  List maintenance must be performed regularly, and the purging of any \nname from the list must be accomplished in a fashion that is consistent \nwith provisions of the National Voter Registration Act, more commonly \nknown as the Motor-Voter law.\n  While this compromise reflects a belief that technology can provide \nan effective deterrent to fraud through the use of computerized \nregistration lists, the amendment offered last evening by Senator \nNickles also ensures that such technology is not subject to \nunauthorized use by hackers or others who wish to defraud the system by \nuse of technology. Similarly, voting system error rates doe not include \nsystem security. A voting system with a computer modem, such as used in \nthe DRE and optical scan technology, could be compromised through a \ncomputer network. Senator Nickles amendment requires that State and \nlocal officials address\n\n[[Page S2536]]\n\nthe security of voting systems technology. It would also be appropriate \nfor the new commission to consider developing security protocols for \nvoting systems as a part of its overall responsibility for overseeing \nthe creation and updating of the voluntary voting system standards.\n  Essentially, the compromise provides for the removal of individuals \nfrom official voter registration lists if such individuals are not \neligible to vote. There are many reasons an individual might be \nineligible to vote. The individual may have moved outside the State or \nmay have died. Some may have been convicted of a felony or been \nadjudicated incompetent, either of which may under some State laws \ncould end the individual's eligibility.\n  The compromise provides a mechanism for removing the names of such \nindividuals from the rolls. Under this mechanism there are three \nessential elements. First, the individual is to be notified that the \nState believes he or she is ineligible. Second, the individual is to \nhave an opportunity to correct erroneous information or to confirm that \nhis or her status has changed. And third, if the individual has not \nresponded to the notice, the individual is to be given an opportunity \nto go to the polls and correct erroneous information and then vote.\n  This third element is needed to ensure that the right to vote is not \ndependent on the mails. It allows an individual to correct erroneous \ninformation when that individual goes to the polls. These are the \nmechanisms outlined in the National Voter Registration Act, and these \nare the mechanisms that will be used under this compromise to remove \nany ineligible individuals from the voter registration rolls.\n  In addition, under this compromise, a State or its subdivisions shall \ncomplete, not later than 90 days prior to the date of an election, any \nprogram that systematically removes the names of ineligible voters from \nan official list of eligible voters.\n  And, of course, any voter removal system must be uniform, \nnondiscriminatory and in compliance with the Voting Rights Act. The \nvoter removal system shall not result in the removal of the name of any \nperson from the official list of voters registered to vote in an \nelection for Federal office by reason of the person's failure to vote.\n  The managers of this bill intend to ensure, and the legislation \nensures, that only voters who are not registered or who are not \neligible to vote are removed from the voter rolls.\n  As a practical matter, once the computerized list is up and running, \nlist maintenance will be almost automatic. While many of us have read \nof allegations of massive duplicate registrations, the truth is that \neven though duplicate names appear on more than one jurisdiction's \nlist, the vast majority of voters only live in one place and only vote \nin one place.\n  In a highly mobile society likes ours voters move constantly. And \nwhile they may remember to change their mailing address with the post \noffice, with utility companies, and with the bank and credit card \ncompanies, they may not even think about changing their address with \nthe local election official until it comes time to vote.\n  If there is no statewide system for sharing such information, voters \ncan easily remain on lists long after they have moved. If the State or \njurisdiction is not vigilant about conducting list maintenance, the \nnumber of so-called duplicate names can easily grow.\n  The State of Michigan has a very good system which we used as a model \nfor judging what was possible under this requirement. As I understand \nit, under the Michigan system, when a voter changes his or her address, \nthe address change is entered into the system, and it automatically \nnotifies both jurisdictions simultaneously. This results in an \nautomatic update which precludes the possibility of duplicate \nregistration.\n  Moreover, while the compromise does not require it, many States will \nmake this computerized list available to local officials at the polling \nplace on election day. This tool can then be used to immediately verify \nregistration information at the polling place, without the frustration \nof dialing into a toll-free number that always rings busy.\n  Let me also address an issue that has been raised by local election \nofficials. Some local officials are concerned that they will lose the \nability to effectively manage their voter rolls if the primary \nresponsibility for input and list maintenance is shifted to the State.\n  This requirement does not specify who is responsible for the daily \nmaintenance of the list--that is left to each State to decide as it \nbest sees fit. However, in order to have an interactive statewide list, \na central authority must have the ultimate responsibility for \nestablishing such a computerized system.\n  That responsibility falls clearly to the chief State election \nofficial. This proposal envisions close cooperation and consultation \nwith local election officials who are interacting with new voters every \nday.\n  Several States have already begun implementing such systems or have \nbeen running such systems for years. The Council of State Governments \nnotes that the States of Oklahoma, Kentucky and Michigan have \nparticularly good models for other States to follow.\n  To further guard against potential fraud, the third requirement also \nestablishes new verification procedures for first-time voters who \nregister by mail.\n  In the case of an individual who registers by mail, the first time \nthe individual goes to vote in person in a jurisdiction, he or she must \npresent to the appropriate election official one of the following \npieces of identification: a current valid photo id; or a copy of any of \nthe following documents: a current utility bill; a bank statement; a \ngovernment check; a paycheck; or another government document with the \nvoter's name and address.\n  The compromise does not specify any particular type of acceptable \nphoto identification. Clearly, a driver's license, a student ID, or a \nwork ID that has a photograph of the individual would be sufficient.\n  If the voter does not have any of these forms of identification, he \nor she must be allowed to cast a provisional ballot, following the \nprocedures outlined in the second requirement of the compromise under \nSection 102.\n  In the case of a voter who registers by mail and votes absentee for \nthe first time in the jurisdiction, the voter must include a copy of \none of these pieces of identification with their absentee ballot.\n  It is important to note that it is the voter, and not the State or \nlocal election official, who determines which piece of identification \nis presented for the purposes of casting a provisional ballot.\n  A first-time voter may avoid producing identification at the polling \nplace or including it with an absentee ballot by mailing in a copy of \nany of the listed pieces of identification with his or her voter \nregistration card.\n  Additionally, as added by the amendment of the Senator from Oregon, \nSenator Wyden, adopted last evening, the voter may choose to submit his \nor her driver's license number or the last four digits of his or her \nSocial Security number which the State can then match against an \nexisting database to see if the number submitted match the name, \naddress, and number in the state file. In the event that a first-time \nmail-registrant voter cannot produce the required identification, he or \nshe may cast a provisional ballot if voting in person. In the case of a \nmail-in ballot, if the required identification verification information \nis not included, the ballot will nonetheless be counted as a \nprovisional ballot.\n  This is an important and common sense change to the compromise which \npreserves the anti-fraud provisions while at the same time providing \nvoters with more options for verifying their identity while increasing \nthe flexibility of State and local administrators to verify such \nidentity. Either way, it will be easier to vote and harder to defraud \nthe system. I am greatly appreciative to all of my colleagues, and \ntheir staff, for working so diligently to achieve this modification.\n  The compromise also preserves the existing exemptions under the \nMotor-Voter law under section 1973gg-4(c)(2) of title 42 in the \nimplementation of this compromise. A State may not by law require a \nperson to vote in-person if that first-time voter is: one, entitled to \nvote by absentee ballot under section 1973ff-1 of title 42 of the \nUniformed\n\n[[Page S2537]]\n\nand Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act; two, provided the right to \nvote otherwise than in-person under section 1973ee-1(b)(2)(b)(ii) and \n1973ee-3(b)(2)(b)(ii) of the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and \nHandicapped Act; and three, entitled to vote otherwise than in-person \nunder any other Federal law.\n  There is no question about the intent to this Senator. The exemptions \nunder Motor-Voter are preserved under this compromise. There is no \nattempt to change current law with respect to preserving the long-\nstanding practice of States permitting eligible uniform service voters \nand eligible American overseas voters to continue to vote by absentee \nballot without this first-time voters requirement attaching.\n  Similarly, there is no attempt to change current law with respect to \npreserving the States' practice of permitting disabled voters and \nsenior voters to continue to vote by absentee ballot without this \nfirst-time voter requirement attaching.\n  According to GAO, ``All states provide for one or more alternative \nvoting methods or accommodations that may facilitate voting by people \nwith disabilities whose assigned polling places are inaccessible.'' For \nexample, all States have provisions allowing voters with disabilities \nto vote absentee without requiring notary or medical certification \nrequirements, although the procedures for absentee voting vary among \nStates. The GAO State survey demonstrates that all States permit \nabsentee voting for voters with disabilities. There is no intent to \nchange the underlying law for any of these covered individuals since \ncovered individuals are not subject to the requirements for first-time \nvoters under Section 103.\n  Finally, the compromise adds two new questions to the mail-in \nregistration form under the Motor-Voter law. These questions are \ndesigned to assist voters in determining whether or not they are \neligible to register to vote in the first place and thus reduce the \nnumber of ineligible applications. When a non-citizen fills out a voter \nregistration form while waiting to renew a driver's license, or a 16 \nyear-old high school senior applies to vote along with his or her \nclassmates during the voter registration drive at the high school, it \ndoes not mean that these individuals are attempting to defraud the \nsystem. They may actually be very civic-minded individuals who are just \nmisinformed about whether or not they are eligible to register.\n\n  These two additional questions will help alert such voters to the \nfact that they are not yet eligible to vote. First, the mail-in \nregistration card must include the question with a box for checking \n``yes'' or ``no'': ``Are you a citizen of the United States of \nAmerica?'' Second, the mail-in registration card must include the \nquestion with a box for indicating ``yes'' or ``no'': ``Will you be 18 \nyears of age on or before election day?'' If a voter answers ``no'' to \neither question, the registration card must instruct the voter not to \nfill out the form.\n  There has been an issue raised with regard to those States that allow \nfor early registration and the impact of this provision on that. \nHowever, this bill only applies to Federal elections and a voter must \nbe 18 years of age to vote in a Federal election. This requirement does \nnot affect State law with regard to the minimum age for registration.\n  To the extent that guidelines are required to implement the statewide \ncomputerized voter list requirement or the first-time voter provision, \nthe Department of Justice, or the new commission if it has been \nconstituted, must issue these guidelines by October 1, 2003.\n  As with any such law, enforcement of the three requirements in Title \nI will fall to the Department of Justice, and the rights and remedies \nestablished under this bill are in addition to all others provided by \nlaw.\n  Title II of the measure before us contains three grant programs to \nassist states in meeting the minimum Federal requirements and to fund \nother election reform initiatives.\n  From the beginning of this debate it has been clear to this Senator \nthat the Federal Government has not lived up to its responsibility to \nensure adequate funding for the administration of Federal elections. \nThe fundamental principle of this bipartisan compromise is that if the \nFederal Government is going to establish minimum requirements for the \nconduct of Federal elections, then we must provide the resources to \nState and local governments to meet those requirements.\n  Of equal importance is the principle that there should not be a one-\nsize-fits-all approach to meeting the Federal minimum requirements. \nConsequently, the compromise provides broad latitude to States and \nlocalities on how they meet the minimum requirements and what specific \nactivities they fund with the Federal grants.\n  The first grant program authorizes $3 billion over 4 years for grants \nto State and local governments to be used to meet the three minimum \nFederal requirements of the bill. The only limitation on the use of \nthese funds is that they be used to ``implement'' these requirements. \nThe compromise envisions that implementation activities may vary widely \nboth between States and across jurisdictions within a State. Clearly, \nfunds may be used to purchase new voting systems or enhance or modify \nexisting ones.\n  Obviously, specific grant approvals will necessarily have to be made \nby the Department of Justice or the new Election Administration \nCommission once it becomes effective, in light of the overall funding \nrequests. However, it is the intent of this Senator that States and \nlocalities be given broad latitude in making the case that the reforms \nthey seek to fund are in direct support of the implementation of these \nrequirements.\n  For example, a State may decide to upgrade an entire State from a \nlever voting system to an electronic system in order to meet the \naccessibility standard for the disabled. Clearly, the purchase of a \nnew, statewide system would be an authorized activity used to implement \nthe voting system standards of the first minimum requirement. But to \nmeet the same requirement, another State might use these funds to lease \none DRE machine for each polling place. That would be equally allowable \nand in compliance with this compromise.\n  Similarly, if some jurisdictions within a State use a central count \npunch card system, funds may be used to implement the voter education \nprogram required to notify voters of the effect of an over-vote, while \nother jurisdictions within that same State might use the funds to \npurchase precinct-based optical scan systems.\n  If a State or jurisdiction appears to already meet the requirements \nof the bill, but wishes to upgrade old equipment to newer models or add \nimprovements to ensure that it will continue to be in compliance, such \nwould also be an allowable use of funding.\n  The compromise also authorizes retroactive payments for those \njurisdictions which incurred expenses on or after January 1, 2001 for \ncosts that would otherwise have been incurred to implement the minimum \nrequirements. An amendment offered by Senators Chafee and Reed, which \nwas adopted by the Senator, clarifies that multi-year contract for the \npurchase of voting systems can also qualify for retroactive payments.\n  There is no matching requirement for these grants. If we are going to \nrequire that States and localities meet certain minimum Federal \nstandards with regard to Federal elections, then we should provide them \nwith the Federal resources to do so.\n  The requirements of the grant application process are designed \nspecifically to allow both States and localities to apply for funds \nwithout creating either overlapping funding or inconsistencies within \nStates.\n  To apply for funds to implement the requirements, States must submit \nan application to the attorney general with a State plan.\n  The State plan contains four basic components.\n  First, a description of how the state will use the funds to meet the \nthree minimum requirements, including a description of how State and \nlocal election officials will ensure the accuracy of voter registration \nlists; and the precautions the State will take to prevent eligible \nvoters from being removed from the list.\n  Second, an assessment of the susceptibility of Federal elections in \nthe State to voting fraud and a description of how the State intends to \naddress such.\n\n[[Page S2538]]\n\n  Third, assurances that the State will comply with existing Federal \nlaws, specifically: Voting Rights Act; Voting Accessibility for the \nElderly and Handicapped Act; Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee \nVoting Act; National Voter Registration Act (or Motor-Voter); and \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.\n  Fourth, and finally, the State plan must include a timetable for \nmeeting the elements of the plan.\n  In order to ensure the broadest support for the State plan, it must \nbe developed in consultation with State and local election officials \nand made available for public review and comment prior to submission \nwith any grant application.\n  In addition to the State plan, each application must include a \nstatement of how the State will use the Federal funds to implement the \nState plan.\n  Localities may also submit a separate application for funds, but the \nuse of funds must be consistent with the State plan. The application \nmust also contain any additional information required by the attorney \ngeneral or the new commission once it is effective.\n  Grant recipients must keep such records as the attorney general \ndetermines and, as is usually the case for Federal grant programs, any \ngrant recipient may be audited by the attorney general or comptroller \ngeneral. Grantees may be required to submit reports, and the attorney \ngeneral must report to Congress and the President annually on the \nactivities funded under this program.\n  One of the goals of this legislation is to encourage states and \nlocalities to move forward with election reform initiatives and apply \nfor Federal grants, even before the effective dates established for \nmeeting those requirements.\n  This is reflected in the larger appropriations in the early years and \nthe fact that the appropriations remain available until expended.\n  This is one of the provisions of the committee-reported bill which \nhas been retained in the compromise. The requirements under this \ncompromise are so simple and so self-explanatory, that we do not \nbelieve that complicated guidelines, much less full-blown regulations, \nare going to be necessary to implement the requirements.\n  Consequently, the original bill, and this compromise, encourages \nStates and localities to move expeditiously by essentially providing \nfor a grandfathering of early action.\n  The compromise allows jurisdictions that apply for Federal grants \nprior to the issuance of any guidelines or standards to nonetheless \nreceive funding to implement the requirements of the bill. If the \nattorney general approves the grant, then that approval acts as a \ndetermination that the State plan, and the activities in the State plan \nwhich will be funded with the grant, are deemed to otherwise comply \nwith the minimum requirements of the bill.\n  However, in encouraging quick action we did not want to deter State \nand local governments, much less penalize them if the early action they \ntook turns out to be somehow inconsistent with subsequently issued \nguidelines. The most obvious instance in which this might occur would \nbe with regard to the voting system standards and the not-yet-issued \nvoting system error rate.\n  In order to avoid placing a State or locality at risk of non-\ncompliance, the compromise essentially grandfathers the action that the \nState takes pursuant to an approved State plan and grant application \nand provides a safe harbor from enforcement actions on that basis.\n  Without such a provision, the Federal Government might end up \nliterally funding a State or locality twice for essentially the same \nreform--once when the State took early action and a second time when \nany subsequent guidelines or standards were finally issued.\n  Moreover, in promoting early action, the safe harbor provision \nattempts to give jurisdictions a reasonable amount of time to come into \ncompliance with any subsequently issued guidelines or standards by \nextending the grandfather period to 2010, except for the requirements \nfor disability access. Although the effective dates for most of the \nrequirements are 2004 and 2006, this additional time period provided by \nthe grandfather provision will minimize the otherwise disruptive effect \nto both voters and election officials of repeated changes to systems \nand procedures. It will also provide those States poised to act with \nthe assurance that the decision to take early action will not end up in \nan enforcement action.\n  With regard to the disability accessibility standard under the voting \nsystem requirement, because the bill provides for a specific compliance \nmechanism in the requirement of one DRE machine in every polling place, \nit was believed that the extended safe harbor period was unnecessary \nand potentially disruptive to the disabled community. Consequently, in \ntaking early action jurisdictions will still have to meet the \ndisability access standards by 2006.\n\n  Similarly, with this same goal of encouraging States to take early \naction, the compromise creates a second incentive grant program \ndesigned to fund other election reform initiatives not necessarily \nfunded under the requirements grant program.\n  The incentive grant program authorizes $400 million in this fiscal \nyear to fund such activities as: poll worker and volunteer training; \nvoter education; same-day registration procedures; procedures to deter \nand investigate voting fraud; improvements to voting systems; and \naction to bring the jurisdiction into compliance with existing civil \nrights laws.\n  The compromise also establishes a program to recruit and train \ncollege students to serve as poll workers.\n  The incentive grant programs has a matching requirement of 80 percent \nFederal to 20 percent State or local funding. The attorney general, \nhowever, can reduce the 20 percent matching requirement for States or \nlocalities that lack resources.\n  Although grants cannot be used to implement reforms that are \ninconsistent with the minimum Federal requirements, these grants can be \nused to take interim action to bring voting systems into compliance.\n  As with the requirements grant program, early action under the \nincentive grant program to implement the three minimum requirements is \nsimilarly grandfathered to 2010, with the exception of the disability \nrequirements.\n  To apply for incentive grant funds, a State or locality submits an \napplication to the attorney general or the new commission upon its \nenactment. Patterned after the requirements of the legislation \nintroduced by Senators McConnell and Schumer as S. 953, applications \nfor incentive grant funds must contain a specific showing that the \njurisdiction is in compliance with a number of existing civil rights \nlaws, including: Voting Rights Act; Voting Accessibility for the \nElderly and Handicapped Act; Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee \nVoting Act; National Voter Registration Act; Americans with \nDisabilities Act; and Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n  Before a grant application can be approved, the assistant attorney \ngeneral for civil rights must certify that the jurisdiction is either \nin compliance, or has demonstrated that it will be using the grant \nfunds to come into compliance, with these laws. Entities which receive \nfunds to come into compliance with these laws are subject to audit.\n  The purpose of this provision is not to penalize or place in jeopardy \nthose jurisdictions which are attempting to overcome compliance issues. \nInstead, it is intended to provide a source of funds for States or \nlocalities to address compliance issues under existing civil rights \nlaws before facing the effective dates for minimum Federal standards \nunder this new civil rights law. To ensure that jurisdictions are not \npenalized by this process, the compromise prohibits action being \nbrought against a State or local government on the basis of any \ninformation contained in the application.\n  In order to ensure that these funds are available this year, the \nattorney general must establish any general policies or criteria for \nthe application process so that grant applications can be approved no \nlater than October 1, 2002.\n  The final grant program contained in Title II of the compromise \nprovides funds to make polling places physically accessible to the \ndisabled. GAO found that 84 percent of all polling places in the United \nStates are not physically accessible from the parking area to the \nvoting room. Moreover, not one of the 496 polling places visited by GAO \non election day 2000 had voting equipment adapted for blind voters.\n\n[[Page S2539]]\n\n  This is a modest grant program which authorizes $100 million \nbeginning in fiscal year 2002, with such funds to remain available \nuntil expended. States or localities may use these funds to ensure \naccessibility of polling places, including entrances, exits, paths of \ntravel and voting areas of the polling facility.\n  Funds may also be used for education and outreach programs for those \nwith disabilities to inform voters about the accessibility of polling \nplaces. Education programs to train election officials, poll workers \nand volunteers on how best to promote access and participation of \nindividuals with disabilities can also be funded under this program.\n  This grant program will also be administered initially by the \nDepartment of Justice, and then by new Election Administration \nCommission. However, the general policies and criteria for the approval \nof applications for the accessibility grant program will be established \nby the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, also \nknown as the Access Board, which was established under the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.\n  The Access Board is uniquely qualified to determine what physical \nmodifications would be appropriate to make polling facilities \naccessible to disabled voters. The Board must establish such policies \nin time to ensure that applications can be approved by October 1, 2002.\n  Grants under the accessibility grant program are funded at an 80 \npercent Federal share, although the Attorney General can provide a \ngreater share to jurisdictions which lack resources. Grantees must keep \nappropriate records and are subject to audit.\n  The final title of the compromise establishes a new independent \nagency within the executive branch for administering the three grant \nprograms and providing on-going assistance to State and local \ngovernments in the administration of Federal elections.\n  The Election Administration Commission will be composed of four \nmembers appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. To \nreflect the need for a continuing nonpartisan approach to election \nadministration, no more than two commissioners may be members of the \nsame political party.\n  In recognition of the national significance of these appointments and \nto ensure the broadest bipartisan support for the President's nominees, \nthe four respective leaders of the House and Senate, including the \nSpeaker and the House Minority Leader and the Majority and Minority \nLeaders of the Senate, shall each submit a candidate recommendation to \nthe President before the initial appointment of nominees and prior to \nthe appointment of a vacancy.\n  The qualifications for appointment to the new commission reflect the \ndesire to create a diverse and experienced commission that will bring \nmore to the job than just experience in election administration or \nloyalty and service to a particular party. We would hope to also \nattract scholars and historians who appreciate and understand the \nbroadest experience of voters of all backgrounds, abilities, and party \naffiliations.\n  It would be this Senator's hope that we would attract candidates who \nhave an appreciation of the fundamental importance of the citizen vote \nto a democracy and are committed to ensuring both the inclusiveness and \nthe integrity of Federal elections.\n  Specifically, commissioners are to be appointed on the basis of their \nknowledge and experience with election law, election technology, and \nFederal, State or local election administration, as well as their \nknowledge of the Constitution and the history of the United States.\n  Appropriately, a commissioner at the time of appointment cannot be an \nelected or appointed officer or employee of the Federal Government. \nUnlike the House bill, this is a permanent, full-time commission. \nConsequently, commissioners cannot engage in any other business or \nemployment while serving on the commission.\n  To ensure that the best talent that America has to offer will be \ncontinually reflected in appointees, we limit each commissioner to one \n6-year term. Similarly, to ensure the broadest participation in the \nwork of the commission, the compromise provides that a chair and vice-\nchair must be of different parties and serve for a term of 1 year, and \nan individual may serve as chair only twice during his or her 6-year \nterm.\n  The duties of the commission reflect the fundamental approach of this \ncompromise--that of forming a partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and State and local election officials. The purpose of this \nbill is not to replace or minimize the authority or responsibilities of \nState and local election officials in administering Federal elections. \nIt is, however, an attempt to provide leadership at the Federal level, \nin the form of both financial resources and minimum Federal \nrequirements, to ensure uniform and nondiscriminatory participation in \nthose elections.\n  Consequently, the duties of the commission augment, but do not \nreplace, those of State and local election officials. The commission \ncan best be viewed as a resource for election officials rather than as \na regulatory or enforcement body.\n  Primarily, the commission shall serve as a clearinghouse on Federal \nelection administration and technology by gathering information, \nconducting studies and issuing reports on Federal elections. What \nbecame evident in the Rules Committee hearings and discussions with \nelection officials across this Nation was the apparent lack of unbiased \ninformation regarding election technology. Today, the primary source of \ninformation about the efficiency and effectiveness of voting systems \nand machines is often the manufacturer of the voting system or its \nvendor. The commission can provide a much needed role as an unbiased \nclearinghouse for technology assessments.\n  The compromise envisions that the current authority of the office of \nelection administration, at the Federal Election Commission, to develop \nvoluntary voting system standards would continue once this office is \ntransferred to the new commission. While the compromise does not \nmandate what types of machines must be used in Federal elections, the \nfact that it establishes minimum requirements for voting systems, \nspecifically acceptable error rates, necessitates that procedures for \ntesting and assessing voting technology will be required. Such would be \nan appropriate activity for the new commission. To ensure that the \ncommission has the best advice on technical and accessibility matters \nas it develops standards, the compromise directs the commission to \nconsult with the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the \nCompliance Board in developing the standards.\n  The commission will also serve an important role in communicating \ninformation regarding Federal elections to the public and the media. \nSpecifically, the compromise provides that the commission compile and \nmake available to the public the official results of elections for \nFederal office and statistics regarding national voter registration and \nturnout. The compromise also requires that the commission establish an \nInternet website to facilitate public access, comment, and \nparticipation in the activities of the commission.\n  The compromise does not go as far as the Carter-Ford Commission \nrecommended in this regard. As my colleagues may remember, the Carter-\nFord Commission recommended that\n`` . . . news organizations should not project any presidential \nelection results in any State so long as polls remain open elsewhere in \nthe 48 contiguous States . . .'' and that Congress should consider \nappropriate legislation, consistent with the first amendment to \nencourage the media to withhold early results. While the commission is \nin no way intended to replace the appropriate role of responsible media \nin informing the public of the outcome of Federal elections, the 2000 \npresidential election highlighted the need for a national clearinghouse \nfor election results. Over time, the new commission may come to be \naccepted as the most authoritative source of election results.\n  The commission will conduct on-going studies regarding election \ntechnology and administration in addition to other subjects impacting \nFederal elections. Over the course of the last year, a number of \nexcellent election reform proposals have been made that simply require \nmore study and review before they can be enacted.\n\n[[Page S2540]]\n\n  Specifically, the commission is charged with making periodic studies \nof the following: election technology, including both over-vote and \nunder-vote notification capabilities of such technology; ballots \ndesigns for Federal elections; methods of ensuring accessibility to all \nvoters; nationwide statistics on voting fraud in Federal elections and \nmethods of identifying, deterring and investigating any such \ncorruption; methods of voter intimidation; the recruitment and training \nof poll workers; the feasibility of conducting elections on different \ndays, or for extended hours, including the advisability of establishing \na uniform poll closing time or a federal holiday; Internet voting; \nMedia reporting of election related information; Overseas voters \nissues; ways in which the Federal Government can assist in the \nadministration of Federal elections; and any other matters which the \ncommission deems appropriate.\n  The commission will be providing reports and recommendations for \nadministrative and legislative action. Through the oversight process, I \nwould anticipate that the Rules Committee will be reviewing those \nrecommendations and acting to bring additional reform proposals to the \nfloor in subsequent Congresses.\n  In addition to the study and clearinghouse authorities, the \ncommission is empowered to hold hearings, take testimony, and \nadminister such oaths as are necessary to carry out its \nresponsibilities. However, since the commission is not an enforcement \nagency, it does not have the authority to issue subpoenas.\n  Most importantly, the commission will ultimately assume the ongoing \nresponsibility for administering the three minimum Federal requirements \nand the three grant programs under the bill. But so as not to \ndiscourage immediate election reform or delay the flow of Federal funds \nto support reform, the compromise does not tie the effective dates of \nthe minimum requirements and the grant programs to the establishment of \nthe commission.\n  The compromise attempts to expedite the appointment of the \ncommissioners by requiring that the President act within ninety days of \nthe date of enactment. As Chairman of the Rules Committee, the \ncommittee of jurisdiction over such nominations, it is my intent to \nmove expeditiously to consider the nominations if they occur this year.\n  But realistically, the President may require additional time to \nappoint nominees and the committee cannot act until those nominations \nare made. Because the compromise requires the commission to appoint \nboth the executive director and the general counsel by majority vote, \neven once confirmed, it will take some time for the commissioners to \ncreate a new agency and hire staff to administer over three billion \ndollars in grant programs.\n  Consequently, the compromise initially places the administration of \nboth the Federal minimum requirements and the three grant programs at \nthe Department of Justice and provides for a transition of most, but \nnot all, of those authorities to the new commission upon its \nestablishment.\n  Specifically, the compromise transfers to the commission the \nauthority to issue standards or guidelines for the three minimum \nFederal requirements, to issue policies and criteria for the three \ngrant programs, and to approve by majority vote all grant applications. \nThe Department of Justice retains the authority to approve State plans \nsubmitted under the requirements grant program and the certification \nauthority under the incentive grant program.\n  In order to ensure that the transfer of authority does not impede the \ncontinuity of the requirements or the expeditious review of grant \napplications, the compromise sets specific dates by which the \ncommission must act to overturn or modify any action of the Department \nof Justice.\n  If the Department of Justice has issued standards or guidelines \npursuant to the Federal minimum requirements, the commission must act \nby majority vote within 30 days of the transition date to either affirm \nthat action or to issue revised standards or guidelines. If the \nDepartment of Justice has not acted as of the transition date, then the \ncommission must act by majority vote by the later of the effective date \nprovided for in Title I or within 30 days of the transition date.\n  Similarly, if the Department of Justice has issued policies and \ncriteria for the approval of grant applications, the commission must \nact by majority vote within thirty days of the transition date to \neither affirm or modify such. If the Department of Justice has not \nacted, the commission must similarly issue policies and criteria by the \nlater of the date specified in Title II or within 30 days of the \ntransition date.\n  The compromise defines the effective date of the transition as the \nearlier of sixty days after all of the commissioners have been \nappointed, or the date that is 1 year after the date of enactment of \nthe act.\n  While the compromise attempts to coordinate the transition dates for \ntransfer of responsibilities to the new agency with a reasonable time \nframe for appointing and confirming commissioners, it remains the \nprerogative of the President as to when he appoints and the will of the \nSenate as to when it confirms. And until those two actions occur, the \ncommission will exist in name only and the Department of Justice will \nbe left to administer the act.\n  In addition to assuming certain authorities of the Department of \nJustice under the bill, the new Election Administration Commission will \nalso assume certain functions of the Federal Election Commission.\n  First, all functions of the director of the Office of Election \nAdministration of the Federal Election Commission are transferred to \nthe new commission. Beginning on the transition date, the director of \nthe Office of Election Administration is named as the interim executive \ndirector of the new commission and serves until an executive director \nis appointed by a majority vote of the commission. The executive \ndirector is appointed for a term of 6 years and may be reappointed by \nmajority vote of the commission for a second term.\n  Second, all functions of the Federal Election Commission under the \nNational Voter Registration Act of 1993, the so-called Motor-Voter Act, \nare transferred to the new Election Administration Commission. Section \n9 of the act provides that the Federal Election Commission shall \nprescribe appropriate regulations necessary to carry out the act with \nrespect to developing a mail voter registration application form for \nFederal elections and submit reports. The compromise also provides for \nthe transfer of Federal Election Commission personnel employed in \nconnection with the offices and functions which are transferred by the \nact.\n  Finally, Title IV of the compromise clarifies the relationship of \nthis bill to other existing civil rights laws, and makes improvements \nin voting procedures for members of the military.\n  With respect to criminal penalties, this compromise includes two \nprovisions that track existing laws and do not constitute new law. Both \nprovisions merely are restatements of the existing underlying laws and \ndo not alter the specific intent element described in sections 401(a) \nor 401(b) of this compromise. In the amendment which I offered and was \nadopted by the Senate, I inserted the existing specific intent of \n``knowingly and willfully'' and ``knowingly'' in the respective \nprovisions to ensure that those standards are the explicit legal \nstandards of review for section 1973(i)(c) of title 42 and section 1015 \nof title 18 and therefore are the same standards to be applied under \nthis act.\n  The first provision recognizes that the criminal penalties \nestablished under the National Voter Registration Act, specifically \nsection 1973(i)(c) of title 42 and means in plain language that it is \nunlawful for any individual who knowingly and willfully gives false \ninformation as to his or her name, address, or period of residence in \nthe voting district for the purpose of establishing his or her \neligibility to register or vote in an election for Federal office, or \nconspires with another individual for the purpose of encouraging his or \nher false registration to vote in an election for Federal office.\n  The second provision clarifies that any individual who commits fraud \nor makes a false statement with regard to citizenship, such as in the \ncontext of the new citizenship question on registration forms as \nprovided for under section 103 of the compromise, is in violation of \nsection 1015 of title 18 and\n\n[[Page S2541]]\n\nmeans in plain language that it is unlawful for any individual who \nknowingly makes a false statement relating to naturalization, \ncitizenship or registry of aliens, for the purpose of establishing his \nor her eligibility to register or vote in an election for Federal \noffice.\n  With regard to the effect of the bill on existing civil rights laws, \nthe compromise is specifically not intended to impair any right \nguaranteed, nor require any conduct which is prohibited under the \nvarious civil rights laws, nor are the provisions of the compromise \nintended to supercede, restrict, or limit such other laws, including: \nVoting Rights Act; Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped \nAct; Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act; National \nVoter Registration Act of 1993; Americans with Disabilities Act of \n1990; and Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n  This Senator intents that nothing in this compromise should be \ninterpreted in any manner other than to protect and preserve any and \nall rights guaranteed by these existing civil rights and voting laws.\n  For example, the approval of the Attorney General of any state plan \nunder the provisions of the requirements grant in Title II of the \ncompromise, or any other action taken by the Attorney General or a \nstate under the grant programs in Title II, specifically shall not have \nany effect on requirements for pre-clearance under section five of the \nVoting Rights Act.\n  We do not profess to have all the answers or even the best solution \nfor reforming our system of Federal elections. But we do present a \ncompromise that reflects an incremental step, but not a sea change, in \nthe role of the Federal Government in our Nation's system of \nFederal elections. This compromise has been developed with a true sense \nof the historical importance of the work and a fundamental belief that \nonly a bipartisan effort will be acceptable to the American people.\n\n  Let me address a final concern--and that is the constitutional \nquestion of whether this bipartisan legislation is on its face, \nconstitutional. In the opinion of this Senator, this compromise is \nentirely consistent with the scope of Congress's authority to enact \nstatutes regulating Federal elections.\n  According to the GAO study on the scope of congressional authority in \nelection administration, Congress has constitutional authority over \nboth congressional and Presidential elections. This report concludes \nthat there is a role for both the State and the Federal Government. \nStates are responsible for the administration of Federal, State and \nlocal elections. But, notwithstanding the traditional State role in \nelections, Congress has the authority to affect the administration of \nelections in certain ways.\n  While the Constitution does not explicitly provide the right to vote, \nmany amendments to the Constitution protect the right to vote. Congress \nhas previously acted under this explicit grant of constitutional power \nto protect the voting rights of eligible Americans.\n  Congress passed the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. More \nrecently, Congress enacted federal legislation to remove barriers to \nvoting for persons with disabilities, facilitate voting by those in the \nmilitary and Americans living overseas, and standardize voter \nregistration procedures under the Motor-Voter legislation.\n  When Congress enacted these Federal statutes, Congress legislated in \nthe subject matter of election administration in such areas as voting \nrights, voter registration, absentee voting requirements, timing of \nFederal elections, and accessibility for elderly and disabled voters. \nSimilarly, Congress also legislated to enforce prohibitions against \nspecific discriminatory practices in all elections, including Federal, \nState, and local elections.\n  Congress's scope of power is derived from a number of constitutional \nsources, including the 15th amendment's prohibition on voting \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, or previous condition of \nservitude; the 19th amendment's prohibition on the basis of sex; and \nthe 26th amendment's prohibition on the basis of age.\n  These three amendments do not grant the right to vote, but all three \nprohibit States from denying the franchise to individuals who are \nracial or ethnic minorities, women, or citizens aged 18 or older.\n  The Carter-Ford Task Force on Constitutional Law and Federal Election \nLaw also concluded that Congress has great power to regulate elections. \nThe task force makes the point that the Constitution grants to Congress \nbroad power to directly regulate Congressional elections, less power to \ndirectly regulate Presidential elections, and less power still to \ndirectly regulate state and local elections.\n  But as a practical matter, Congress has great power to collaterally \nregulate all elections through its power over the ``time, place and \nmanner'' of Congressional elections and through its power to determine \nhow Federal funds are made available to States for expenditures. That \nsame authority derives from its enforcement powers of constitutional \nsafeguards, such as the equal protection clause and due process clause \nof the 14th Amendment.\n  Opponents of this legislation might argue that it goes too far by \nproviding Federal requirements in the areas of voting system standards, \nprovisional voting and statewide voter registration lists. This Senator \ndoes not believe that will prove to be the case.\n  While the precise parameters of Congressional authority in election \nadministration relating to presidential elections are unsettled and \nhave not been clearly established, the Supreme Court has recently \nrecognized that certain measures protecting voting rights are within \nCongress's power to enforce the 14th and 15th Amendments, despite \nadministrative burdens placed on the States.\n  In Bush v. Gore which was decided following the November 2000 \nPresidential election, the Supreme Court held that differing \ndefinitions of a vote within the state of Florida during the recount \nviolated the equal protection clause and were therefore \nunconstitutional.\n  The enforcement powers from the 14th amendment alone provide adequate \nsupport for all three of the minimum Federal requirements in the \nbipartisan compromise bill. The reasoning of the Supreme Court in Bush \nv. Gore suggests that there may be a compelling governmental interest \nand constitutional authority for Congress to act in light of extensive \nevidence that African American or Asian American voters, for example, \nare being treated unequally with respect to their right to vote.\n  It should also be noted that while we take a different approach, the \nCarter-Ford Commission's recommendations also include voting system \nstandards, provisional voting and a statewide voter registration \nsystem. Many other commissions and study groups also consistently \nrecommended provisional voting.\n  We believe that the Constitution provides ample authority for these \nminimum Federal requirements and all the other provisions in this \nbipartisan compromise. Except in one instance, this legislation applies \nonly to elections for Federal office, putting this urgently needed \nlegislation beyond constitutional dispute.\n  I applaud the majority leader, Senator Daschle, for his commitment to \nmake this measure a priority of this session of Congress and for his \nunfailing commitment to bring it to the floor for debate. I also \ncommend the distinguished Republican Leader, Senator Lott, for his \nassistance in facilitating consideration of this bipartisan compromise.\n\n  Our distinguished colleagues in the House, Chairman Bob Ney and \nCongressman Steny Hoyer of the House Administration Committee have \nalready shepherded a bipartisan reform proposal through that body. The \ndifferences between the approach in the House and our bipartisan \ncompromise are not irreconcilable.\n  Both recognize that there are minimum standards that every voting \nsystem should meet. Both bills strive to ensure the greatest possible \naccess to the polling place for disabled Americans and the blind. Both \nbills ensure that all eligible voters may cast a vote and have that \nvote counted. Both bills establish a new Federal agency to provide on-\ngoing support to State and local governments. And both approaches \nprovide significant resources to the States and localities to \nunderwrite the Federal share of administering Federal elections.\n\n[[Page S2542]]\n\n  Not insignificantly, President Bush has also indicated his support \nfor providing assistance to the States for election reform. Included in \nhis fiscal year 2003 budget submission is a request for $1.2 billion \nover the next three fiscal years, including $400 million for fiscal \nyear 2003, to fund an election reform initiative.\n  There appears to be a uniform desire in both houses of Congress to \nsee that the Federal Government meets its obligation to be a partner \nwith State and local election officials in the conduct of Federal \nelections. But time is running short and state budgets are growing \nthin. It is time for the Senate to enact election reform. It is time \nfor the Senate to meet with the House to produce a bipartisan bill that \nis worthy of the signature of the President and the support of all the \nAmerican people, regardless of color or class, gender or age, \ndisability or native language, and party or precinct.\n  As this debate draws to a close, it is appropriate to recognize the \nsignificant contributions of both individuals and organizations which \nhave provided input and expertise to the committee, and to me \npersonally, in the course of this legislative matter. I have already \nexpressed my gratitude to my colleagues on and off the committee and to \nmy distinguished coauthor in the House, Congressman John Conyers, and \nto many other House Members who truly have made this effort their \ncause.\n  As we all know, no such effort can be undertaken without the \nconsiderable effort of our staff. In addition to those already \nmentioned, I want to thank Sheryl Cohen, Marvin Fast, Alex Swartsel and \nTom Lenard of my personal staff, and two former Rules Committee staff \nmembers, Candace Chin and Laura Roubicek.\n  We have also received considerable assistance from the support \noffices of the Senate, including from James Fransen and Jim Scott in \nthe Office of Legislative Counsel and from attorneys and analysts at \nthe Congressional Research Service including Kevin Coleman, Eric \nFischer, L. Paige Whitaker, and Judith Fraizer, and finally from the \nGovernment Accounting Office.\n  The list of organizations which have provided invaluable assistance \nto this effort over the last 18 months is almost too lengthy to include \nhere. But it is important to note the breadth and depth of the input \nthat went into crafting this historic legislation. At the risk of \ninadvertently leaving someone out, I want to recognize and thank the \nfollowing organizations which have provided their expertise to this \neffort: American Association of People With Disabilities; American \nCivil Liberties Union; American Federation of State, County and \nMunicipal Employees; American Institute of Graphic Arts; Asian American \nLegal Defense and Education Fund; Brennan Center for Justice; Center \nfor Constitutional Rights; Common Cause; Commission on Civil Rights; \nCaltech-MIT Voting Technology Project; Constitution Project; Lawyers \nCommittee for Civil Rights Under Law; Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights; Mexican American Legal Defense & Education Fund; National Asian \nPacific American Legal Consortium; National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People; NAACP Legal Defense & Education Fund, \nInc.; National Commission on Federal Election Reform (Carter-Ford \nCommission); National Association of Secretaries of State; National \nAssociation of State Election Directors; National Coalition on Black \nCivic Participation; National Congress of American Indians; National \nConference of State Legislatures; National Council of La Raza; National \nFederation of the Blind; Paralyzed Veterans of America; People for the \nAmerican Way; Public Citizen; U.S. PIRG.\n  It is the fervent view of this Senator that at the end of this \nhistoric process, the Senate will have made a lasting contribution to \nthe continued health and stability of this democracy for the people, by \nthe people and of the people in the United States.\n  My thanks to all who have been involved. I urge the adoption of this \nbill and yield back whatever time remains on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me take my last minute by \nthanking again my friend and colleague Senator Dodd. This has been a \nhappy experience. We can proudly recommend to all Members of the Senate \ntoday that they vote in favor of an important new piece of legislation \nthat goes right to the core of what our democracy is all about; that \nis, the ability to vote.\n  This legislation will make a positive difference in our country, and \nis a step forward for our democracy. This bill has been fashioned in a \nway that I wish we could produce more legislation, which is in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n  I enthusiastically support this bill and urge all of my Republican \ncolleagues--in fact, all of our colleagues in the Senate--to proudly \nvote for this legislation.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2907\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will turn \nto the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas. There are 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, what we have before us is an amendment \nto the election reform bill that is now pending that would basically \neliminate the mass mailing requirement to give local and State election \nofficials more time and resources to improve the overall election \nmanagement and to register voters and to comply with the newly enacted \nmandates of this bill.\n  This is an unfunded mandate. This amendment is supported by the \nNational Association of Secretaries of State. It is cosponsored by the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, and Senators \nFeinstein and Levin. Why? Because the secretaries of state and county \nelection officers have indicated there is no need to put in a mandate \nto make sure that your voters who are provisional voters must be \nnotified by mail within 30 days. There are other ways you can do this.\n  Our amendment says to States, if you want to do a mass mailing, you \ncan do that. But at least there is an option here to use a Web site and \ntoll-free numbers and other means of communication that will actually \nallow a provisional voter to know much faster than the mass mailing \nwhether or not they are properly registered and their vote counted. As \na matter of fact, it will enable local county officials and others to \nmake sure a provisional voter is registered, so you can actually make \nthe argument that we will make more progress.\n  I urge support of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, following the Roberts amendment, which \nwill be the normal 15-minute vote, I ask unanimous consent that votes \non the Clinton amendment and final passage be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I speak with great reluctance in \nopposition to the amendment of the Senator from Kansas. I misidentified \nhis State last evening. I apologize.\n  I appreciate the motivations behind this. Let me first say there is \nnothing in this bill that creates an unfunded mandate. One of the \nthings we have provided for in this bill is that every requirement must \nbe paid for by the Federal Government. That is very important to us. We \nrealize if we asked otherwise, we would in fact be doing just what the \nSenator from Kansas has suggested. But that is simply not the case.\n  We are saying with regard to provisional voters--these are some of \nthe most disadvantaged voters in the sense of where they live and their \ncircumstances, economic and otherwise--if you show up to vote and there \nis a question about whether or not you have the right to vote, this \nbill is going to give you the right to cast a provisional ballot. If at \nthe end of that process it is discovered you don't have the right to \nvote, we are saying that the state and local officials must notify that \nvoter so they don't come back and show up the next time as a \nprovisional voter and their vote doesn't count again.\n  The underlying bill already allows a state or locality to create an \ninternet site or establish a 1-800 number, and I don't have a problem \nwith that. But don't exclude the requirement that you must specifically \nnotify a voter whose\n\n[[Page S2543]]\n\nballot was not counted. Registrars of voters notify voters on all sorts \nof things during the year. Saying to a provisional voter, your vote \ndidn't count for the following reasons, this is what you need to do to \ncorrect it, is a minor request. This bill truly makes it easier to vote \nand harder to cheat. We urge the defeat of the Roberts amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2907. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Bayh) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. So everyone is aware, the next two votes are 10-minute \nvotes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3108\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 2 \nminutes evenly divided for debate on amendment No. 3108.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, this next amendment, called the \n``leave no vote behind'' amendment, aims at making sure the Office of \nElection Administration has the authority to determine whether or not \nthere are unintentional or intentional human errors. With all due \nrespect to the ranking member, it is not a burdensome provision because \nelection officials are going to have to sort out the ballots to \ndetermine whether there are mechanical errors or not.\n  Secondly, this does not have to be enforced until after January 1, \n2010, and so the language that is in the bill provides more than \nsufficient flexibility for the Office of Election Administration to \nmake a determination as to what benchmark standard to set. If we do not \ndeal with this issue, we are not dealing with the underlying concern \nthat many citizens have, that in some way their vote will not be \ncounted.\n  I urge our colleagues to give the Office of Election Administration \nthe flexibility and authority to make a determination about this kind \nof error, along with mechanical errors. They get to set the standard. \nWe do the same thing in most States to try to determine whether there \nare unintentional errors that a citizen makes in casting a vote, and in \nthe absence of having this provision in the underlying bill we will not \nhave addressed one of the major concerns that citizens have; not only \nfrom the 2000 election but from many elections.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I strongly oppose the Clinton \namendment. This is about the sanctity of the ballot and about the right \nof voters not to vote in an election if they choose. This amendment \nmandates a single voter error rate for all machines and all systems of \nvoting.\n  Each State will be forced to calculate how many voter errors are \nallowed, divide that number by the number of precincts, and tell poll \nworkers in those precincts how many errors each is allowed; all of this \nunder threat of Department of Justice prosecution.\n  Those poll workers will closely monitor undervotes and overvotes, and \nwhen they approach their maximum allowable number, they will be forced \nto plead with voters to cast a vote or to change votes they have \nalready made; all of this under threat of Department of Justice \nprosecution.\n  I say to my colleagues, especially the Senators from Oregon and \nWashington, if their home State uses paper ballots, mail-in ballots, or \nabsentee ballots, this amendment will fundamentally alter, if not \neliminate, those systems of voting. There is no way to control voter \nerror unless one is face-to-face with the voter.\n  This is an amendment that essentially unravels this legislation. I \nstrongly urge its defeat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 3108 offered by the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.

STUDY AND REPORT ON FREE ABSENTEE BALLOT POSTAGE.\n\n       (a) Study on the Establishment of a Free Absentee Ballot \n     Postage Program.--\n       (1) In general.--The Election Administration Commission \n     established under section 301 shall conduct a study on the \n     feasibility and advisability of the establishment by the \n     Federal Election Commission and the Postal Service of a \n     program under which the Postal Service shall waive the amount \n     of postage applicable with respect to absentee ballots \n     submitted by voters in general elections for Federal office \n     (other than balloting materials mailed under section 3406 of \n     title 39, United States Code) that does not apply with \n     respect to the postage required to send the absentee ballots \n     to voters.\n       (2) Public survey.--As part of the study conducted under \n     paragraph (1), the Election Administration Commission shall \n     conduct a survey of potential beneficiaries under the program \n     described in such paragraph, including the elderly and \n     disabled, and shall take into account the results of such \n     survey in determining the feasibility and advisability of \n     establishing such a program.\n       (b) Report.--\n       (1) Submission.--Not later than the date that is 1 year \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Election \n     Administration Commission shall submit to Congress a report \n     on the study conducted under subsection (a)(1) together with \n     recommendations for such legislative and administrative \n     action as the Commission determines appropriate.\n       (2) Costs.--The report submitted under paragraph (1) shall \n     contain an estimate of the costs of establishing the program \n     described in subsection (a)(1).\n       (3) Implementation.--The report submitted under paragraph \n     (1) shall contain an analysis of the feasibility of \n     implementing the program described in subsection (a)(1) with \n     respect to the absentee ballots submitted in the general \n     election for Federal office held in 2004.\n       (4) Recommendations regarding the elderly and disabled.--\n     The report submitted under paragraph (1) shall--\n       (A) include recommendations of the Federal Election \n     Commission on ways that program described in subsection \n     (a)(1) would target elderly individuals and individuals with \n     disabilities; and\n       (B) identify methods to increase the number of such \n     individuals who vote in elections for Federal office.\n       (c) Postal Service Defined.--The term ``Postal Service'' \n     means the United States Postal Service established under \n     section 201 of title 39, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 508. HELP AMERICA VOTE COLLEGE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Program.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the \n     appointment of its members, the Election Administration \n     Commission (in this section referred to as the \n     ``Commission'') shall develop a program to be known as the \n     ``Help America Vote College Program'' (in this section \n     referred to as the ``Program'').\n       (2) Purposes of program.--The purpose of the Program shall \n     be--\n       (A) to encourage students enrolled at institutions of \n     higher education (including community colleges) to assist \n     State and local governments in the administration of \n     elections by serving as nonpartisan poll workers or \n     assistants; and\n       (B) to encourage State and local governments to use the \n     services of the students participating in the Program.\n       (b) Activities Under Program.--\n       (1) In general.--In carrying out the Program, the \n     Commission (in consultation with the chief election official \n     of each State) shall develop materials, sponsor seminars and \n     workshops, engage in advertising targeted at students, make \n     grants, and take such other actions as it considers \n     appropriate to meet the purposes described in subsection \n     (a)(2).\n       (2) Requirements for grant recipients.--In making grants \n     under the Program, the Commission shall ensure that the funds \n     provided are spent for projects and activities which are \n     carried out without partisan bias or without promoting any \n     particular point of view regarding any issue, and that each \n     recipient is governed in a balanced manner which does not \n     reflect any partisan bias.\n       (3) Coordination with institutions of higher education.--\n     The Commission shall encourage institutions of higher \n     education (including community colleges) to participate in \n     the Program, and shall make all necessary materials and other \n     assistance (including materials and assistance to enable the \n     institution to hold workshops and poll worker training \n     sessions) available without charge to any institution which \n     desires to participate in the Program.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--In addition to any \n     other funds authorized to be appropriated to the Commission, \n     there are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     section such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2002 \n     and each succeeding fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 509. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as specifically provided in section \n     103(b) of this Act with regard to the National Voter \n     Registration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 1973gg et seq.), nothing \n     in this Act may\n\n[[Page S2556]]\n\n     be construed to authorize or require conduct prohibited under \n     the following laws, or supersede, restrict, or limit such \n     laws:\n       (1) The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 1973 et seq.).\n       (2) The Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and \n     Handicapped Act (42 U.S.C. 1973ee et seq.).\n       (3) The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1973ff et seq.).\n       (4) The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. \n     1973gg et seq.).\n       (5) The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. \n     1994 et seq.).\n       (6) The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 701 et seq.).\n       (b) No Effect on Preclearance or Other Requirements Under \n     Voting Rights Act.--The approval by the Attorney General of a \n     State's application for a grant under title II, or any other \n     action taken by the Attorney General or a State under such \n     title, shall not be considered to have any effect on \n     requirements for preclearance under section 5 of the Voting \n     Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 1973c) or any other \n     requirements of such Act.\n\n     SEC. 510. VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. \n     12101 et seq.) requires that people with disabilities have \n     the same kind of access to public places as the general \n     public.\n       (2) The Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and \n     Handicapped Act (42 U.S.C. 1973ee et seq.) requires that all \n     polling places for Federal elections be accessible to the \n     elderly and the handicapped.\n       (3) The General Accounting Office in 2001 issued a report \n     based on their election day random survey of 496 polling \n     places during the 2000 election across the country and found \n     that 84 percent of those polling places had one or more \n     potential impediments that prevented individuals with \n     disabilities, especially those who use wheelchairs, from \n     independently and privately voting at the polling place in \n     the same manner as everyone else.\n       (4) The Department of Justice has interpreted accessible \n     voting to allow curbside voting or absentee voting in lieu of \n     making polling places physically accessible.\n       (5) Curbside voting does not allow the voter the right to \n     vote in privacy.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the right to vote in a private and independent manner is a \n     right that should be afforded to all eligible citizens, \n     including citizens with disabilities, and that curbside \n     voting should only be an alternative of the last resort in \n     providing equal voting access to all eligible American \n     citizens.\n\n     SEC. 511. ELECTION DAY HOLIDAY STUDY.\n\n       (a) In General.--In carrying out its duty under section \n     303(a)(1)(G), the Commission, within 6 months after its \n     establishment, shall provide a detailed report to the \n     Congress on the advisability of establishing an election day \n     holiday, including options for holding elections for Federal \n     offices on an existing legal public holiday such as Veterans \n     Day, as proclaimed by the President, or of establishing \n     uniform weekend voting hours.\n       (b) Factors Considered.--In conducting that study, the \n     Commission shall take into consideration the following \n     factors:\n       (1) Only 51 percent of registered voters in the United \n     States turned out to vote during the November 2000 \n     Presidential election--well-below the worldwide turnout \n     average of 72.9 percent for Presidential elections between \n     1999 and 2000. After the 2000 election, the Census Bureau \n     asked thousands of non-voters why they did not vote. The top \n     reason for not voting, given by 22.6 percent of the \n     respondents, was that they were too busy or had a conflicting \n     work or school schedule.\n       (2) One of the recommendations of the National Commission \n     on Election Reform led by former President's Carter and Ford \n     is ``Congress should enact legislation to hold presidential \n     and congressional elections on a national holiday''. Holding \n     elections on the legal public holiday of Veterans Day, as \n     proclaimed by the President and observed by the Federal \n     Government or on the weekends, may allow election day to be a \n     national holiday without adding the cost and administrative \n     burden of an additional holiday.\n       (3) Holding elections on a holiday or weekend could allow \n     more working people to vote more easily, potentially \n     increasing voter turnout. It could increase the pool of \n     available poll workers and make public buildings more \n     available for use as polling places. Holding elections over a \n     weekend could provide flexibility needed for uniform polling \n     hours.\n       (4) Several proposals to make election day a holiday or to \n     shift election day to a weekend have been offered in the \n     107th Congress. Any new voting day options should be \n     sensitive to the religious observances of voters of all \n     faiths and to our Nation's veterans.\n\n     SEC. 512. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON COMPLIANCE WITH ELECTION \n                   TECHNOLOGY AND ADMINISTRATION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that full funding shall be \n     provided to each State and locality to meet the requirements \n     relating to compliance with election technology and \n     administration pursuant to this Act.\n\n     SEC. 513. BROADCASTING FALSE ELECTION INFORMATION.\n\n       In carrying out its duty under section 303(a)(1)(G), the \n     Commission, within 6 months after its establishment shall \n     provide a detailed report to the Congress on issues regarding \n     the broadcasting or transmitting by cable of Federal election \n     results including broadcasting practices that may result in \n     the broadcast of false information concerning the location or \n     time of operation of a polling place.\n\n     SEC. 514. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CHANGES MADE TO THE \n                   ELECTORAL PROCESS AND HOW SUCH CHANGES IMPACT \n                   STATES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the provisions of this Act shall not prohibit States to \n     use curbside voting as a last resort to satisfy the voter \n     accessibility requirements under section 101(a)(3);\n       (2) the provisions of this Act permit States--\n       (A) to use Federal funds to purchase new voting machines; \n     and\n       (B) to elect to retrofit existing voting machines in lieu \n     of purchasing new machines to meet the voting machine \n     accessibility requirements under section 101(a)(3);\n       (3) nothing in this Act requires States to replace existing \n     voting machines;\n       (4) nothing under section 101(a) of this Act specifically \n     requires States to install wheelchair ramps or pave parking \n     lots at each polling location for the accessibility needs of \n     individuals with disabilities; and\n       (5) the Election Administration Commission, the Attorney \n     General, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers \n     Compliance Board should recognize the differences that exist \n     between urban and rural areas with respect to the \n     administration of Federal elections under this Act.\n\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``An Act to require States \n     and localities to meet uniform and nondiscriminatory election \n     technology and administration requirements applicable to \n     Federal elections, to establish grant programs to provide \n     assistance to States and localities to meet those \n     requirements and to improve election technology and the \n     administration of Federal elections, to establish the \n     Election Administration Commission, and for other \n     purposes.''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n20 minutes on the energy bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator may proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/11/senate-section/article/S2527-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2527-S2556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman and \nranking member of the Rules Committee, Senators Dodd and McConnell, for \ntheir incredible leadership, perseverence and hard work in getting us a \nstrong bipartisan election reform bill.\n  I also thank Senators Schumer, Bond, Torricelli, McCain and Durbin \nfor their tireless efforts in crafting this bipartisan substitute \namendment. Without their collaboration and compromise, we would not \neven be considering, let alone passing, this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  It has been several months since we first began floor consideration \nof this bill, and I appreciate the tireless efforts, and diligence that \nSenator Dodd has maintained. Without his leadership we would not be \nhere today.\n  By working together, our colleagues have produced legislation that \nwill protect the most basic of all American rights: the right to vote, \nand to have that vote counted.\n  This bill represents a fair, balanced, and responsible approach.\n  It will ensure that nondiscriminatory voting procedures exist in \nevery polling place, while strengthening the integrity of the Federal \nelection process.\n  We all know why this bill is necessary.\n  We remember the stories from the 2000 elections about: inadequate \nvoter education; confusing ballots; outdated and unreliable voting \nmachines; poll workers who were unable to assist voters who needed \nassistance because they were overwhelmed or undertrained, or both; and \nregistered voters who were wrongly denied the right to vote, because \ntheir English was less than perfect, their name was mistakenly purged \nfrom a registration list, or some other equally unacceptable reason.\n  We heard reports of police roadblocks and other barriers that \nprevented some voters from even reaching the polls, not in the 1920s or \n30s, or even the 1960s, but in 2000.\n  Today, we are celebrating the 34th anniversary of the 1968 Civil \nRights Act, which prohibited discrimination in the sale, rental, or \nfinancing of housing.\n  In every generation, we have tried to tear down barriers to full \nparticipation in the life of this Nation.\n  But there is one means of participation that forms the foundation of \nevery other: the right to vote.\n  And that is why we cannot allow those barriers to voting, physical or \notherwise, which so tainted our democracy in the last century, to \nstretch into this one.\n  In all, it is estimated that between 4 million and 6 million \nAmericans were unable to cast a vote, or did not have their vote \ncounted, in the 2000 elections.\n  Between 4 and 6 million Americans, disenfranchised. In this day and \nage, that is simply unacceptable.\n  It is not enough for Congress to document or decry the problems we \nsaw in the last election. We need to fix the problems before the next \nelection.\n  It should not matter where you live, what color your skin is, or who \nyou vote for. In America, the right to vote must never be compromised. \nToo many people have given too much to defend that right.\n  Our system leaves it to States to decide the mechanics of election \nprocedures.\n  But the right to vote is not a State right. It is a constitutional \nguarantee. And it is up to us to see that it is protected.\n  Not all States experienced problems with voting in the last election. \nAnd some States that did have problems have taken steps to rectify \nthem, and they are to be commended for that.\n  But there are still States, nearly 17 months after the 2000 \nelections, where equal access to the voting booth is not guaranteed. It \nis time for this Congress to step in and enact basic standards, to \nensure that every American who is eligible to vote can vote.\n  That is what this bill does.\n  It requires States to ensure that their voting equipment meets \nminimum Federal standards for accuracy.\n  It says that voters who cast ``over-votes'' must be notified, and \ngiven a chance to correct their ballot.\n  It ensures that voting machines are accessible to individuals with \ndisabilities, as well as those with limited English proficiency.\n  It establishes statewide computerized voter registration lists.\n  And it allows individuals whose names don't appear on voting lists to \ncast ``provisional'' ballots.\n  If it is determined that the person's name was left off the \nregistration list mistakenly, the vote will then be counted. This will \nprevent voters from having to wait hours at the polls, or not vote at \nall, simply because of someone else's clerical mistake.\n  These are not onerous requirements, and they are not unfunded \nmandates. This bill includes $3.5 billion for States, to help them \nupgrade their voting systems. And it establishes a new,\n\n[[Page S2528]]\n\nbipartisan commission to oversee the grant program and administer \nvoting system standards.\n  I commend my colleagues, particularly the sponsors of this bill, for \nbringing us such a fair and balanced proposal. And for committing their \ntime and energy to seeing this through.\n  I am hopeful that this bill will move through conference quickly so \nwe can implement these reforms as soon as possible.\n  If people are denied their right to vote on issues that affect them \ndirectly, or if they fear their votes are not counted, democracy itself \nis threatened. If that happens, both parties, and all Americans, lose. \nThis bill will go a long way in restoring the integrity of our system \nand ensuring that all Americans will be truly able to exercise their \nright to vote.\n  Voting is the most basic right in our democracy, the one that \nguarantees the preservation of all other rights against governmental \ntyranny.\n  Let us now pass this bill and protect that most basic right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. How much on the Republican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Almost 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Almost 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, why don't I yield myself 5 minutes, and then the \nSenator from Kentucky may want to speak for 1 minute, and then we will \njust move on to the amendments.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I explained the order of the votes that \nwill occur.\n  I express my thanks to Senator Daschle and his staff and to Senator \nLott and his staff. I know I probably tried the patience of all the \nstaffs of both sides over the last number of weeks as we moved this \nproduct forward to get to the point where we are today. I would not \nwant to leave this debate without expressing publicly my sincere \ngratitude to both the Democratic and Republican floor staffs and the \ncloakroom staffs for their expression of patience--I say that \ndiplomatically--over the last number of weeks.\n  Secondly, I express my gratitude to my colleagues in the other body \nwho have worked very hard on this as well. John Conyers from Michigan \nis my principal co-author, if you will, of this proposal on the House \nside, along with my colleagues here, although Congressman Ney and \nCongressman Hoyer also have a very important bill they passed in the \nHouse, and we will be working with them.\n  Eddie Bernice Johnson, Silvestre Reyes, the respective heads of the \nBlack Caucus and Hispanic Caucus, as well as friends from the AFL-CIO, \nworked hard on this.\n  The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights--I will have printed in the \nRecord the respective members of the Leadership Conference; it is a \nlengthy list--but I express my gratitude to them as well for their \nefforts.\n  I join my colleague, Senator Mitch McConnell, in expressing our \ngratitude to the members of our committee, Senator Schumer and Senator \nTorricelli, who worked diligently to bring us to this point. I also \nwant to join the Ranking Member in thanking our colleagues who are not \npart of the committee. I say to Senator Bond, I really meant what I \nsaid last evening. I think--I say to my colleague through the Chair--\nbut for the provisions you added, which are the antifraud provisions, I \nthink this bill would be a far weaker bill, and I am not sure we would \neven have gotten a bill. So while not a member of the Rules Committee, \nI know Senator McConnell and I are deeply appreciative of your \ncontribution to this effort.\n  Senator Wyden and Senator Cantwell worked through the Oregon and \nWashington issue with their respective colleagues. Gordon Smith was \nvery concerned about this; Patty Murray as well. We thank them for \ntheir efforts.\n  The staffs of our respective offices--Shawn Maher, Kennie Gill and \nRonnie Gilliespie, and Carole Blessington, Sue Wright, and Jennifer \nCusick who supported them as well--I thank them for their work. I also \nthank Tam Somerville, Brian Lewis, and Leon Sequeira of Senator \nMcConnell's staff; Julie Dammann and Jack Bartling of Senator Bond's \nstaff; Sharon Levin and Polly Trottenberg of Senator Schumer's staff; \nSara Wills of Senator Torricelli's staff; Carol Grunberg of Senator \nWyden's staff; and Beth Stein of Senator Cantwell's staff. I thank them \nfor their terrific work. If I have left anyone out, I will add their \nnames before the Record is closed today.\n  I said this before, but Senator McConnell and I are of different \npolitical parties. We share the distinction of having gone to the same \nlaw school. We represent the alumni association of the University of \nLouisville. We share that point in common.\n\n  I wish to tell him how much I appreciate his efforts. I know he has a \nlot of things going on. He has had a huge battle on campaign finance \nreform that occurred in the middle of all of this. The fact that he and \nhis staff would find time to help us work through this election reform \nbill is something for which I will always be grateful to him. I know I \nwas hounding him. I know I bothered Brian and Jack and others to get \nthis done. And they showed patience, as well, to me and my staff. I am \nreally grateful to them for their help on that.\n  Lastly--it has been said by others--I know we have a lot of important \nbills we deal with. We have the energy bill we are considering. We have \nappropriations bills. And we are dealing with homeland security and \nterrorism issues.\n  I do not minimize at all the importance of that. But this bill goes \nbeyond any specific current issue--it goes to the heart of who and what \nwe are as Americans. Aside from the obvious results of the 2000 \nelections which provoked, I suppose, this discussion and this bill--\nthis effort is not about addressing a single issue or event. We are \ndealing with the underlying structure of our very Government.\n  Patrick Henry once said that: The right to vote is the right upon \nwhich all other rights depend. The idea that by this legislation we \nmake it easier to vote in this country and more difficult to scam the \nsystem is not an insignificant contribution. It may not get the \nnotoriety of other provisions, but the fact that we are proposing to \nspend $3.5 billion of taxpayer money on our elections system to allow \nStates to improve equipment, to allow people who are disabled, blind to \nbe able to cast a ballot in private and independently--the idea that we \nare going to have statewide voter registration lists, provisional \nballoting, these are major, major changes in the law. In addition this \nbill provides for the establishment of the independent commission on \nelections, as well as, of course, the antifraud provisions.\n  I have been proud of a lot of things with which I have been involved \nin my 22 years. Nothing exceeds the sense of pride I have this morning, \nas we close out the debate, on this bill and this Senate \naccomplishment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today is an historic day in the Senate \nmarked by passage of S. 565, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Equal \nProtection of Voting Rights Act. It has been my great honor and \nprivilege to have served as Chairman of the Rules and Administration \nCommittee during the pendency of this legislative effort and to have \nserved as floor manager during the Senate consideration.\n  This is landmark legislation. By enacting this bipartisan bill, the \nSenate will have established the authority, and responsibility, of \nCongress to regulate the administration of Federal elections, both in \nterms of assuring that voting systems and procedures are uniform and \nnondiscriminatory for all Americans and in ensuring the integrity of \nfederal election results. The House has already passed similar \nlegislation and I am confident that a House-Senate conference can act \nexpeditiously to send this measure to the White House.\n  While we should not underestimate the significance of this action, we \nhave been careful not to overstate the federal role in the \nadministration of Federal elections. This legislation does not replace \nthe historic role of state and local election officials, nor does it \ncreate a one-size-fits-all approach to balloting.\n  It does establish minimum Federal requirements for the conduct of \nFederal elections to ensure that the most fundamental of rights in a \ndemocracy--\n\n[[Page S2529]]\n\nthe right to vote and have that vote counted--is secure.\n  In Bush v. Gore, the Supreme Court condemned a recount process that \nwas `` . . . inconsistent with the minimum procedures necessary to \nprotect the fundamental right of each voter . . . ''\n  The basic equal protection doctrine underlying the majority opinion \nin Bush v. Gore is consistent with the principle of equal weight \naccorded to each vote and equal dignity owed to each voter. The Court \nstated in pertinent part:\n\n  The right to vote is protected in more than the initial allocation of \nthe franchise. Equal protection applies as well to the manner of its \nexercise. Having once granted the right to vote on equal terms, the \nstate may not, by later arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one \nperson's vote over that of another.\n\n  This legislation ensures that every eligible American voter is \nassured of such minimum procedures. Only then can we be sure that every \neligible American citizen has an equal opportunity to cast a vote and \nhave that vote counted, so that the integrity of the results of our \nFederal elections remains unchallenged. That is the minimum that a \nFederal legislature should do to ensure the vitality of its democracy.\n  This journey to secure our democratic system of government began when \nthe presidential November 2000 general election exposed to the citizens \nof this Nation, and the people of the entire world, the inadequacies of \nour Federal elections system. Throughout the last fifteen months of \nCongressional review, hearings, and legislative consideration, the \nefforts of this Senator have been guided by the words of Thomas Paine \nwho described the right to vote as the ``primary right by which other \nrights are protected.'' I would suggest that those are the words that \nshould guide the consideration and review of this legislative effort.\n  The bipartisan compromise being adopted by the Senate today is the \nculmination of several months of work by a dedicated group of our \ncolleagues with strongly held and diverse views on how best to improve \nour system of Federal elections. The compromise is just that--it is not \neverything that all of us wanted, but it is something that everyone \nwanted. And the more than 40 amendments adopted during the debate have \nfurther improved the measure. Clearly, in the case of this legislation, \nthe ability of the Senate to freely work its will through amendment and \ndebate has produced a superior product.\n  This bill is the culmination of efforts begun by the distinguished \nranking member, Senator McConnell, in the fall of 2000, as then-\nChairman of the Senate Rules Committee.\n  Shortly after the November 2000 general election, then-Chairman \nMcConnell announced a series of hearings on election reform. Under his \nleadership, the Committee held an initial hearing on March 14, 2001.\n  After the leadership of the Senate changed on June 6, 2001, I \nannounced that election reform would continue to be the primary \nlegislative priority of the Committee. As a result, the Rules Committee \nheld an additional three days of hearings last year on election reform, \nincluding an unprecedented, and enlightening, field hearing in Atlanta, \nGeorgia on July 23.\n  The Committee received testimony and written statements from a \nconglomeration of civil rights organizations, Congressional House \nmembers and caucuses, State and local election officials, study \ncommissions, election associations, task forces, academics, and average \nvoters.\n  But it was the field hearing in Atlanta that underscored this \nSenator's belief that this issue is not about what happened in one \nState or in one election. Election reform is about the systemic flaws \nin our Federal election system that we have long neglected--flaws which \nthe problems in Florida in November 2000 simply brought to our nation's \nattention.\n  Prior to the Atlanta hearing, the chief election official of the \nState of Georgia, Cathy Cox, testified to her experience. In her words:\n\n       As the presidential election drama unfolded in Florida last \n     November, one thought was foremost in my mind: there but for \n     the grace of God go I. Because the thought is, if the \n     presidential margin had been razor thin in Georgia and if our \n     election systems had undergone the same microscopic scrutiny \n     that Florida endured, we would have fared no better. In many \n     respects, we might have fared even worse.\n\n  Ms. Cox testified before the Rules Committee at its field hearing in \nAtlanta, hosted by my good friend, the Senator from Georgia, Senator \nMax Cleland. Ms. Cox reflected what many of our state and local \nelection officials believe--it could have been any State in the media \nspotlight that year--any state where the election was close.\n  In fact, according to the Caltech-MIT report, other States, including \nGeorgia, Idaho, Illinois, South Carolina, and Wyoming, and other \ncities, such as Chicago and New York, had higher rates of spoiled and \nuncounted ballots than Florida. Nor were these problems limited to just \nthe November presidential election.\n  The shortcomings in our election process have existed in many \nelections in States across this Nation. The Caltech-MIT report found \nthat there have been approximately 2 million uncounted, unmarked or \nspoiled ballots in each of the last four presidential elections. During \nhearings before the Senate Rules Committee last year, Carolyn \nJefferson-Jenkins, President of the League of Women Voters, testified \nthat:\n\n     . . . [t]he kinds of problems that we saw in 2000 are not \n     unusual. They represent the harvest from years of \n     indifference that has been shown toward one of the most \n     fundamental and important elements in our democratic system.\n\n  This concern was confirmed by the General Accounting Office, GAO, \nwhich conducted several comprehensive studies on the administration of \nelections. GAO found that 57 percent of voting jurisdictions nationwide \nexperienced major problems conducting the November 2000 elections.\n  Following the Rules Committee hearings, the Committee met on August 2 \nand voted to order reported S. 565, the Equal Protection of Voting \nRights Act. Shortly thereafter, I approached Senator Bond and Senator \nMcConnell and suggested that we attempt to find a bipartisan way to \napproach election reform. We were joined by Senator Schumer and Senator \nTorricelli and began meeting to craft a bipartisan compromise that \ncould be enacted prior to the completion of this Congress.\n  Each of my colleagues brought a unique perspective to the table. \nSenator McConnell has been steadfast in his pursuit of a new, \nbipartisan agency to ensure the continuing partnership between the \nFederal, State and local governments in Federal elections.\n  Senator Bond's long-standing interest in ensuring the integrity of \nFederal elections is reflected in the anti-fraud provisions contained \nin this compromise. Senator Schumer and Senator Torricelli were among \nthe first members of the Rules Committee to introduce bipartisan reform \nmeasures, and their commitment to the bipartisan process is evident \nthroughout this compromise.\n  I am grateful to all of them, and to their very talented staff, for \nthe time and dedication that each one committed to ensuring that a \nbipartisan solution could be presented to the Senate.\n  Throughout this process, all of us were committed to seeing \nmeaningful reform enacted. All of us were convinced that real reform \nhad to make it easier to vote but harder to defraud the system.\n  These twin goals--making it easier to vote and harder to corrupt our \nFederal elections system--underpin every provision of this compromise. \nThese goals are fundamental to ensuring that not only does every \neligible American have an equal opportunity to vote and have that vote \ncounted, but that the integrity of the results is unquestioned.\n  Nothing in this legislation, and no words spoken by this Senator in \nthis debate, should be construed to call into question the results of \nthe November 2000 elections. This effort is not about assessing whether \na particular candidate was legitimately elected. The fact that Congress \nmay ultimately enact minimum Federal requirements for the conduct of \nFederal elections should not imply that prior elections conducted \ninconsistently with such requirements are somehow less legitimate.\n  But what we cannot fail to recognize is that the mere closeness of \nthe presidential election in November 2000 tested our system of Federal \nelections to its limits and exposed both its strengths and its \nfailures.\n\n[[Page S2530]]\n\n  To underscore the uniqueness of the November 2000 general election, \nthe Carter-Ford National Commission on Federal Election Reform \nobserved, and I quote in pertinent part:\n\n       In 2000 the American electoral system was tested by a \n     political ordeal unlike any in living memory. From November 7 \n     until December 12 the outcome of the presidential election \n     was fought out in bitter political and legal struggles that \n     ranged throughout the state of Florida and ultimately \n     extended to the Supreme Court of the United States. Not since \n     1876-77 has the outcome of a national election remained so \n     unsettled, for so long. The nineteenth century political \n     crisis brought the United States close to a renewal of civil \n     war. Fortunately, no danger of armed conflict shadowed the \n     country in this more recent crisis. The American political \n     system proved its resilience. Nonetheless, the . . . election \n     shook American faith in the legitimacy of the democratic \n     process. . . . [I]n the electoral crisis of 2000 . . . the \n     ordinary institutions of election administration in the \n     United States, and specifically in Florida, just could not \n     readily cope with an extremely close election.\n\n  The legitimacy of our democratic process was called into question by \na close election because some Americans--be they people of color, or \nlanguage minority, or disability, or lesser economic condition--\nbelieved that the voting system they used, or the administrative \nprocesses they encountered, did not provide them an equal opportunity \nto cast their vote and have that vote counted.\n  The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights conducted an extensive study on \nvoting irregularities that occurred in Florida during the 2000 \npresidential election. The Commission found that African-Americans were \nnearly 10 times more likely than white voters to have their ballots \nrejected. The Commission found that poorer counties, particularly those \nwith large minority populations, were more likely to use voting systems \nwith higher spoilage rates than more affluent counties with significant \nwhite populations.\n  Additionally, an independent review of Florida's election systems \nconducted by members of the media found that, quoting from the New York \nTimes and Washington Post:\n\n       Black precincts had more than three times as many rejected \n     ballots as white precincts in [the November 2000] \n     presidential race in Florida, a disparity that persists even \n     after accounting for the effects of income, education and bad \n     ballot design . . . [s]imilar patterns were found in Hispanic \n     precincts and places with large elderly populations.\n\n  Again, this problem was not limited to Florida. The Committee also \nheard testimony at the Atlanta hearing that nearly half of all black \nvoters in Georgia used the ``least reliable equipment,'' while less \nthan 25 percent of white voters used that same equipment.\n  Election reform is clearly the first civil rights battle of the 21st \ncentury. As Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Chairperson of the Democratic \nCaucus Special Committee on Election Reform, has stated, ``there is no \nquestion, that the right to vote is the most important civil rights \nissue facing our Nation today.'' The Committee heard testimony to this \neffect at the Atlanta field hearing from Reverend Dr. Joseph E. Lowery, \nChairman of the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda. Reverend \nDoctor Lowery testified that:\n\n       No aspect of democracy is more sacred than the right to \n     vote and to have those votes counted. In 1965, thousands of \n     us marched from Selma to Montgomery to urge this nation to \n     remove any and all barriers based on race and color and \n     ethnicity related to the right to vote. . . . Dr. King could \n     not have anticipated that once we secured the ballot in 1965, \n     that we would be back here in 2001 demanding that our \n     government now assure us that our votes are fairly and \n     accurately counted.\n\n  And we must ensure that all Americans have an equal opportunity to \nhave their votes counted.\n  That is why this Senate, and this Congress, and this President, \ncannot squander this opportunity to reinforce the strengths and correct \nthe failures in our system of Federal elections. To fail to act would \nbe nothing less than an abdication of our collective obligations.\n  Luckily, unlike many other challenges that are presented to the U.S. \nCongress, the vast majority of flaws in our federal election system are \neminently fixable. As the Carter-Ford Commission found, ``the \nweaknesses in election administration are, to a very great degree, \nproblems that government can actually solve.''\n  Further, the Rules Committee found remarkable consensus regarding the \nproblems that exist with our Federal election systems and the statutory \nchanges that need to be made in response. The distinguished Ranking \nMember, Senator McConnell, noted during one of our hearings that the \nmessage to Congress was unanimous: ``Congress must act, and act soon, \nto come to the aid of states and localities.''\n  And such cannot be accomplished in a partisan manner. Only through a \nbipartisan effort to assess and support the strengths and identify and \ncorrect the failures can we achieve meaningful, and lasting, election \nreform.\n  I submit to my colleagues that the provisions of the bipartisan \nsubstitute we are voting on today are intended to accomplish just that.\n  The principle behind our approach is very simple. The Federal \nGovernment has an obligation to provide leadership, both in terms of \nestablishing minimum Federal requirements for the conduct of Federal \nelections and in terms of providing financial resources to State and \nlocal governments to meet those minimum requirements.\n  For too long leadership at the federal level has been lacking. After \nthe elections of November 2000, Congress can no longer afford to ignore \nour obligation to the States to be an equal partner in the \nadministration of the elections that choose our national leadership.\n  The provisions of this bipartisan compromise attempt to meet our \nobligation by establishing minimum Federal requirements--not a-one-\nsize-fits-all solution--but broad standards that can be met in \ndifferent ways by every balloting system used in America today. And \nthis bipartisan compromise provides the necessary resources to fully \nfund these requirements in every one of the 186,000 polling places \nacross this Nation.\n  Let me first give my colleagues a broad overview of what the bill we \nare about to adopt does and then go through each section to more fully \nexplain how the provisions will work.\n  The compromise bill, as improved by amendments adopted during Senate \ndebate, establishes three Federal minimum requirements for Federal \nelections that will affect voting systems, including machines and \nballots, and the administration of Federal elections. These three \nrequirements touch the very voting systems and administrative \nprocedures that alienated Americans across this Nation in November of \n2000 and called into question the integrity of the final election \nresults.\n  The first requirement sets minimum Federal standards that voting \nsystems and election technology must meet by the federal elections of \n2006. Essentially, these common sense standards are designed to provide \nnotice and a second-chance voting opportunity for all eligible voters, \nincluding the disabled, the blind and language minorities, in case the \nvoter's ballot was incorrectly marked or spoiled.\n  This requirement conforms to important recommendations from the \nCaltech-MIT and Carter-Ford Commission reports. As the Carter-Ford \nreport stated, we must `` . . . seek to ensure that every qualified \ncitizen has an equal opportunity to vote and that every individual's \nvote is equally effective.''\n  The Carter-Ford report specifically recommended that the Federal \nGovernment develop a comprehensive set of voting equipment system \nstandards. The Commission also took great pains to encourage the use of \ntechnology and election systems that ensure the voting rights of all \ncitizens, including language minorities. Similarly, the Caltech-MIT \nreport emphasized the importance of equipment that allows voters to fix \ntheir mistakes, provides for an audit trail, and is accessible to the \ndisabled and language minorities.\n  The second requirement provides that all voters be given a chance to \ncast a provisional ballot if for some reason his or her name is not \nincluded on the registration list or the voter's eligibility to vote is \notherwise challenged.\n  Almost every organization that has examined election problems has \nrecommended the adoption of provisional\n\n[[Page S2531]]\n\nvoting, including, but not limited to the: National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People (NAACP); National Commission on Federal \nElection Reform (Carter-Ford Commission); National Association of \nSecretaries of State (NASS); National Association of State Election \nDirectors (NASED); National Task Force on Election Reform; Democratic \nCaucus Special Committee on Election Reform; Caltech-MIT Voting \nTechnology Project; Constitution Project; League of Women Voters (LWV); \nAmerican Association of Persons with Disabilities (AAPD); Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights (LCCR); National Council of La Raza (NCLR); \nAsian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF); U.S. \nCommission on Civil Rights; and Federal Election Commission.\n  The Caltech-MIT report estimates that the aggressive use of \nprovisional ballots could cut the lost votes due to registration \nproblems in half. The Carter-Ford Commission recommended going even \nfarther than the compromise. The Commission noted, ``No American \nqualified to vote anywhere in her or his State should be turned away \nfrom a polling place in that State.''\n  According to a survey by the Congressional Research Service, at least \n15 States and the District of Columbia have a provisional ballot \nstatute; 17 States have statutes that provide for some aspects of a \nprovisional balloting process; and 18 States have no provisional ballot \nstatute but have related provisions. For example, five of these States \nhave same-day voter registration procedures and at least one State, \nNorth Dakota, does not require any voter registration.\n  Studies by GAO confirm that over three-quarters of the jurisdictions \nnationwide had at least one procedure in place to help resolve \neligibility questions for voters whose name does not appear on the \nregistration list at the polling place. However, the procedures and \ninstructions developed to permit provisional voting differed across \njurisdictions.\n  Provisional voting, as defined under the bipartisan compromise, would \navoid situations like the one recounted to the Democratic Caucus \nSpecial Committee on Election Reform by two citizens living in \nPhiladelphia, Juan Ramos and Petricio Morales.\n  They testified that in Philadelphia, voters whose names did not \nappear on the precinct roster were forced to travel to police stations \nand go before a judge, who would then determine whether or not they had \nthe right to vote. Not surprisingly, many voters whose names were \nmissing from the list wound up not voting rather than face these \nintimidating logistical hurdles.\n  If an individual is motivated enough to go to the polls and sign an \naffidavit that he or she is eligible to vote in that election, then the \nsystem ought to protect that individual's right to cast a ballot, even \nif only a provisional ballot. And that right is so fundamental, as is \nevidenced by its widespread use across this Nation, that we must ensure \nthat it is offered to all Americans, not in an identical process, but \nin a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner.\n  And that is what the compromise accomplished by ensuring that so long \nas the minimum standards were satisfied regarding the provisional \nvoting process, it does not matter what that provisional balloting \nprocess is called so long as it is a way to ensure equal access to the \nballot box. While all jurisdictions must meet this requirement, the \namendment offered by the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, \nfurther clarifies that those States which are currently exempt from the \nprovisions of the National Voter Registration Act, or Motor-Voter, can \nmeet the requirements for provisional balloting through their current \nregistration systems.\n\n  The second requirement also provides that election officials post \ninformation in the polling place on election day, such as a sample \nballot and voting instructions to inform voters of their rights. \nProvisional balloting must be available by the Federal elections of \n2004, while the posting of voting information on election day must \nbegin upon enactment of the legislation.\n  GAO found that the two most common ways jurisdictions provided voter \ninformation were to make it available at the election office and to \nprint it in the local newspapers.\n  With respect to sample ballots, 91 percent of the jurisdictions \nnationwide made them available at the election office, and 71 percent \nprinted them in the local newspaper. Nationwide, 82 percent of the \njurisdictions printed a list of polling places in the local paper.\n  In contrast, only 18 percent to 20 percent of jurisdictions \nnationwide placed public service ads on local media, performed \ncommunity outreach programs, and put some voter information on the \nInternet. Mailing voter information to all registered voters was the \nleast used approach, with 13 percent of the jurisdictions mailing \nvoting instructions, 7 percent mailing sample ballots; and finally, 6 \npercent mailing voter information on polling locations.\n  The third requirement is intended to facilitate the administration of \nelections, especially on election day, and to guard against possible \ncorruption of the system. This requirement calls for the establishment, \nby Federal elections in 2004, of a statewide computerized registration \nlist that will ensure all eligible voters can vote. It will also ensure \nthat the names of ineligible voters will not appear on the rolls.\n  The Carter-Ford Commission explicitly recommended that every state \nadopt a system of statewide voter registration. The Caltech-MIT report \nsimilarly recommended the development of better databases with a \nnumerical identifier for each voter. The Constitution Project also \ncalled for the development of a statewide computerized voter \nregistration system that can be routinely updated and is accessible at \npolling places on election day.\n  Additionally, this requirement establishes identification procedures \nfor first-time voters who have registered by mail. In order to ensure \nagainst fraud and the possibility that mail-in registrants are not \neligible to vote, first-time voters unless otherwise exempted will \npresent verification of their identify at the polling place or submit \nsuch verification with their absentee ballot. The manager's amendment \nadopted last evening harmonizes this provision with the 2004 effective \ndate for provisional balloting and the creation of computerized \nstatewide registration lists. This is an important change that \nrecognizes the administrative burden of the provision on both States \nand voters and so provides adequate time for jurisdictions to come into \ncompliance and educate voters about the new provision. This amendment \nalso establishes a uniform effective date of January 1, 2003 for first-\ntime voter registration subject to the first-time voter provision. This \nassures that all eligible voters, regardless of where they live or \nvote, will know that if they register to vote after that date, they \nwill have to meet the new requirements for first-time mail-registrant \nvoters.\n  In order to fund these requirements and other election reforms by the \nStates, the bipartisan compromise establishes three grant programs. The \nfirst grant program, the requirements grant program, provides funds to \nState and local governments to implement these three requirements. The \ncompromise authorizes $3 billion over 4 years, with no matching \nrequirement, for this purpose. Under the amendment offered by Senators \nCollins, Jeffords and others, as adopted by the Senate, each State will \nreceive a minimum grant equal to one-half of 1 percent of the total \nappropriation.\n  The second grant program is an incentive grant program designed to \nauthorize $400 million in this fiscal year to allow State and local \ngovernments to begin improving their voting systems and administrative \nprocedures, even before the requirements go into effect. These funds \nmay also be used for reform measures, such as training poll workers and \nofficials, voter education programs, same-day registration procedures, \nand programs to deter election fraud.\n  Finally, in response to the GAO report that 84 percent of all polling \nplaces, from the parking lot to the voting booth, remain inaccessible \nto the disabled, the compromise creates a third grant program to \nprovide funds to States and localities to improve the physical \naccessibility of polling places. This important initiative will help \nassure that no matter what the physical impediment, all eligible \nAmericans will be able to not only reach and enter the polling place, \nbut enter the voting\n\n[[Page S2532]]\n\nbooth to cast their ballot as well. While this bill does not eliminate \ncurbside voting, the amendment offered by Senators McCain and Harkin, \nand incorporated into the bill, as well as provisions of the amendment \nby Senator Thomas adopted last night, expresses the sense of the Senate \nthat curbside voting be the last alternative used to accommodate \ndisabled voters. We are hopeful that these funds will make that a \nreality.\n  The final provision of the compromise establishes a new, bipartisan \nFederal agency to administer the grant programs and provide on-going \nsupport to State and local election officials in the administration of \nFederal elections. This new entity reflects an appropriate continuing \nfederal role in the administration of Federal elections.\n  This bipartisan Federal election commission will be comprised of four \npresidential appointees, confirmed by the Senate, who will each serve a \nsingle, 6-year term. In order to ensure that all actions taken by the \ncommission are strictly bipartisan, including the approval of any \ngrants and the issuance of all guidelines, every action of the \ncommission must be by majority vote.\n  With that overview, let me go through the compromise and explain its \nprovisions in greater detail. The first title of the bill lays out \nthree uniform and nondiscriminatory election technology and \nadministration requirements which shall be met.\n  Although some have advocated instituting optional reforms, others \nhave insisted that only minimum Federal requirements would ensure that \nevery eligible voter can cast a vote and have that vote counted. The \nco-author of the ``Equal Protection of Voting Rights Act'' who serves \nas the ranking Democrat of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman \nJohn Conyers, cautioned in his testimony before the Rules Committee \nagainst adopting measures that would allow ``States to simply elect to \nopt out of any standards,'' noting that past landmark civil rights \nbills, including the Voting Rights Act and the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, also set minimum Federal standards.\n  As the Democratic Caucus Special Committee on Election Reform \nreported:\n\n     We do not believe that funding, without some basic minimum \n     standards, is sufficient to achieve meaningful reform. If \n     states were allowed to opt out of the recommended changes in \n     Federal elections, voters in those States would be denied the \n     opportunity to participate in Federal elections on the same \n     basis as voters in other States which adopt the reforms. In \n     presidential elections, where the votes of citizens in one \n     State are dependent on the votes of citizens in others, this \n     discrepancy could diminish the impact of votes in those \n     States that agree to implement these reforms.\n\n  The requirements approach is also supported by six members of the \nCarter-Ford Commission, who wrote in an additional statement following \nthe report that Congress should insist upon certain requirements, \nincluding voting systems and practices that produce low rates of \nuncounted ballots, accessible voting technologies, statewide \nprovisional balloting, and voter education and information, including \nthe provision of sample ballots.\n  As Christopher Edley, Jr., a member of the Carter-Ford Commission and \nprofessor at Harvard Law School, wrote, ``At their core, their reforms \nare intended to vindicate our civil and constitutional rights. They are \ntoo fundamental to be framed as some intergovernmental fiscal deal, \nbargained out through an appropriations process.''\n  These requirements are not intended to produce a single uniform \nvoting system or a single set of uniform administrative procedures. On \nthe contrary, they are intended to ensure that any voting system and \ncertain administrative practices meet uniform standards that result in \nan equal opportunity for all eligible Americans to cast a ballot and \nhave that ballot counted.\n  GAO found that both a jurisdiction's voting equipment and its \ndemographic make-up had a statistically significant effect on the \npercentage of uncounted votes. As a result, GAO found that counties \nwith higher percentage of minority voters had higher rates of uncounted \nvotes. GAO also reported that the percentages of uncounted presidential \nvotes were higher in minority areas than in others, regardless of \nvoting equipment. These findings underscore the importance of \ninstituting minimum Federal requirements that will ensure that all \nvoters have an equal opportunity to vote and have their vote counted, \nregardless of their race, disability or ethnicity or the state in which \nthey reside.\n  The House Democratic Caucus Special Committee on Election Reform \nspecifically recommended that Congress institute minimum national \nstandards that require voting systems with error detection devices that \nare fully accessible to elderly voters, voters with physical \ndisabilities, and visually impaired voters. Likewise, six members of \nthe Carter-Ford Commission advised Congress to require states and \nlocalities to use voting technologies that produce low rates of \nuncounted ballots, are accessible to voters with disabilities, are \nadaptable to non-English speakers, and allow all voters to cast a \nsecret ballot.\n  The first requirement establishes standards that all voting systems \nmust meet for any Federal election held in a jurisdiction after January \n1, 2006.\n  It is important to note, that with regard to effective dates, the \nactual date on which the requirements must be implemented will vary \nfrom jurisdiction to jurisdiction depending upon when the first Federal \nelection occurs in 2006. A Federal election is intended to include a \ngeneral, primary, special, or runoff election for Federal office.\n  There are five basic standards that all voting systems shall meet \nunder the first requirement:\n  First, a notification procedure to inform a voter when he or she has \nover-voted, including the opportunity to verify and correct the ballot \nbefore it is cast and tabulated. This first standard is modified for \nvoting systems in which the voter casts a paper or punch card ballot or \nvotes are counted at a central location, as provided for in the \namendment offered by Senator Cantwell and incorporated into the bill.\n  Second, all voting systems must produce a record with an audit \ncapacity, including a permanent paper record that will serve as an \nofficial record for recounts. As the Chairman of the Rules Committee, \nlet me advise my colleagues of the importance of this feature in the \nunlikely event that a petition of election contest is filed with the \nSenate. Often, in order to resolve such contests, the Rules Committee \nmust have access to an audit trail in order to determine which \ncandidate received the most votes.\n  Third, all voting systems must be accessible to persons with \ndisabilities.\n  Fourth, all voting systems must provide for alternative language \naccessibility; and\n  Fifth, all voting systems must meet a Federal error rate in counting \nballots, which will be established by the new election administration \ncommission.\n  A few of these standards merit additional discussion. With regard to \nthe first standard, which requires notification to the voter of an \nover-vote, there has been a great deal of misunderstanding about this \nprovision. The compromise before us made significant changes in the \noriginal bill reported by the Rules Committee. The original bill \nrequired that voting systems notify a voter of both over-votes and \nunder-votes. This compromise deletes the required notification of an \nunder-vote. While the new commission is charged with studying the \nfeasibility of notifying voters of under-votes, there is no under-vote \nnotification requirement in the compromise.\n  To further clarify the purpose of over-vote notification, there is no \nintent to have an adverse impact on any jurisdiction with election \nadministration procedures for instant runoff or preferential voting. \nAll jurisdictions, including Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, New \nMexico and Vermont are not prohibited from using such voting procedures \nto conduct instant runoff or preferential under this Act.\n  Notification is an essential standard because it provides an eligible \nvoter a ``second chance'' opportunity to correct his or her ballot \nbefore it is cast and tabulated.\n  The Caltech-MIT report emphasized the need for voting equipment that \n``. . . give[s] voters a chance to change their ballots to fix any \nmistakes . . .'' Similarly, the Carter-Ford Commission explicitly \nrecommended that: ``Voters should have the opportunity to correct \nerrors at the precinct or other polling place . . .''\n\n[[Page S2533]]\n\n  With regard to the notification, it is the voting system itself, or \nthe educational document, and not a poll worker or election official, \nwhich notifies the voter of an over-vote. The sanctity of a private \nballot is so fundamental to our system of elections, that the language \nof this compromise contains a specific requirement that any \nnotification under this section preserve the privacy of the voter and \nthe confidentiality of the ballot.\n  The Caltech-MIT study noted that secrecy and anonymity of the ballot \nprovides important checks on coercion and fraud in the form of \nwidespread vote buying.\n  This concern for preserving the sanctity of the ballot, as well as \npractical differences in paper ballots versus machines, led us to \ncreate an alternative notification standard for paper ballots, punch \ncard systems, and central count systems.\n  Paper ballot systems include those systems where the individual votes \na paper ballot that is tabulated by hand. Central count systems \nincludes mail-in absentee ballots and mail-in balloting, such as that \nused extensively in Oregon and Washington State, and to a lesser extent \nin Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, Kansas, and 13 other States \nwhere a paper ballot is voted and then sent off to a central location \nto be tabulated by an optical scanning or punch card system. Under the \nbill as clarified by Senator Cantwell's amendment, a mail-in ballot or \nmail-in absentee ballot is treated as a paper ballot for purposes of \nnotification of an over-vote under section 101 of this compromise, as \nis a ballot counted on a central count voting system. However, if an \nindividual votes in person on a central count system, as is used in \nsome states which allow early voting or in-person absentee voting, for \nthat voter, such system must actually notify the voter of the over-\nvote.\n  In the case of punch cards and paper ballot and central count \nsystems, including mail-in ballots and mail-in absentee ballots, the \nstate or locality need only establish a voter education program \nspecific to that voting system in use which tells the voter the effect \nof casting multiple votes for a single Federal office.\n  Regardless of a punch card system or a paper ballot voting system, \nall mail-in ballots and mail-in absentee ballots must still meet the \nrequirement of providing a voter with the opportunity to correct the \nballot before it is cast and tabulated under section 101 of this \ncompromise.\n  I also want to note for the record that although this compromise \nprovides an alternative method of notifying voters of over-votes for \npunch card and paper ballot systems, nothing in this legislation \nprecludes jurisdictions from going beyond what is required, so long as \nsuch methods are not inconsistent with the Federal requirements under \nthis title or any law described in section 402 of this Act.\n  In fact, Cook County, Illinois uses a punch card reader that can be \nprogrammed to notify the voter of both over-votes and under-votes. It \nis my understanding that this technology can provide an individual \nvoter with such notification in a completely private and confidential \nmanner. The system allows the voter to correct his or her ballot or \noverride the notice if the voter so desires.\n  As for the other types of voting systems, namely lever machines, \nprecinct-based optical scanning systems, and direct recording \nelectronic systems--or DREs--the voting system itself must meet the \nstandard. Specifically, the voting system must be programmed to permit \nthe voter to verify the votes selected, provide the voter with an \nopportunity to change or correct the ballot before it is cast or \ntabulated, and actually notify the voter if he or she casts more than \none vote for a single-candidate office.\n  Again, it is important to understand that it is the machine itself, \nand not the poll worker or official, that notifies the voter.\n  We believe that the bill as amended recognizes the inherent \ndifferences between paper ballot systems and mechanical or electronic \nvoting systems, and is a reasonable accommodation which nonetheless \nensures that all voters will have the information and the notice \nnecessary to avoid spoiling their ballot due to an over-vote.\n\n  Let me also take a minute to discuss the disabled accessibility \nstandard. This is perhaps one of the most important provisions of this \ncompromise. The fact is ten million blind voters did not vote in the \n2000 elections in part because they cannot read the ballots used in \ntheir jurisdiction. In this age of technology that is simply \nunacceptable.\n  The Committee received a great deal of disturbing testimony regarding \nthe disenfranchisement of Americans with disabilities. Mr. James \nDickson, Vice President of the American Association of People with \nDisabilities, testified that our Nation has a ``. . . crisis of access \nto the polling places.'' Twenty-one million Americans with disabilities \ndid not vote in the last election--the single largest demographic \ngroups of non-voters.\n  To respond to this ``crisis of access,'' this compromise requires \nthat by the federal elections of 2006, all voting systems must be \naccessible for individuals with disabilities, including nonvisual \naccessibility for the blind and visually impaired. Most importantly, \nthat accommodation must be provided in a manner that provides the same \nopportunity for access and participation, including privacy and \nindependence, as for other voters.\n  In order to assist the states and localities in meeting this \nstandard, the bill adds an important new provision that allows \njurisdictions to satisfy this standard through the use of at least one \ndirect recording electronic (DRE) voting system in every polling place.\n  Let me note that these voting systems are not just for the use of the \ndisabled. According to GAO, approximately 12 percent of registered \nvoters nationwide used DREs in the last Federal election. Obviously, \nanyone in the polling place can use the system. But these machines can \nbe manipulated by not only the blind and vision-impaired, but by \nparaplegic and other individuals with motor skill disabilities.\n  Furthermore, the Caltech-MIT study suggests that DREs have the \npotential to allow for more flexible user interfaces to accommodate \nmany languages. This means that DRE voting systems can also be used to \nmeet the accessibility requirements for language minorities as well. \nMoreover, the bill does not require that a jurisdiction purchase a DRE \nto meet the accessiblity requirements. Jurisdictions may also choose to \nmodify existing systems to meet the needs of the disabled.\n  Some of my colleagues have expressed concerns that this may be a \nwasteful requirement for jurisdictions that have no known disabled \nvoters. Let me make clear that the purpose of this requirement is to \nensure that the disabled have an equal opportunity to vote, just as all \nother non-disabled Americans, with privacy and independence. It is \nsimply not acceptable that the disabled should have to hide in their \nhomes and not participate with other Americans on election day simply \nbecause no one knows that they exist.\n  I have indicated my willingness to look at the impact of the each of \nthe bill's provisions on small communities and rural areas in \nconference, and the amendment by Senator Thomas adopted last evening \nexpresses that. With regard to the disability provisions, I will do so \nwith the twin goals of ease of administration but equality of voting \nopportunity in mind.\n  Finally, let me touch on the issue of alternative language \naccessibility. This standard generally follows the procedures for \ndetermining when a language minority must be accommodated under the \nVoting Rights Act, with an important difference. The Voting Rights Act \nrecognizes only four general groups of language minorities: Asian \nAmericans, people of Spanish heritage, Native Americans and native \nAlaskans.\n  This compromise leaves in place the numerical triggers under the \nVoting Rights Act. It merely allows groups who otherwise do not meet \nthe very narrow definition in the Voting Rights Act to nonetheless \nreceive an alternative language ballot. So, if a Haitian or a Croatian \npopulation meets the numerical triggers, they, too, will have access to \nbilingual materials in their native language.\n  With the addition of section 203 in 1975 to the Voting Rights Act of \n1965, Congress sought to increase voter turnout of language minorities \nby requiring bilingual voting assistance.\n  In 1992, Congress amended, reauthorized and strengthened section 203 \nby\n\n[[Page S2534]]\n\npassing the Voting Rights Language Assistance Act with an expiration \ndate of 2007.\n  This Act requires states and political subdivisions with significant \nnumbers of non-English speaking citizens of voting age to improve \nlanguage assistance at the polls for American voters. The required \nbilingual assistance includes bilingual ballots, voting materials, and \noral translation services.\n  These bilingual services are triggered when the Census Bureau \ndetermines that more than 5 percent of the voting age citizens are of a \nsingle language minority and are limited-English proficient; or more \nthan 10,000 citizens of voting age are members of a single language \nminority who are limited in their English proficiency.\n  Here we are in 2002 with the same concerns for our language \nminorities. Accordingly, our compromise follows the Congressional \ntradition of strengthening voting assistance to our language minority \ncitizens by including language minority groups that were not included \nin earlier amendments to the Voting Rights Act. It merely widens the \ncoverage of language minorities to ensure that a large number of \nlimited-English speakers may participate in the elections process.\n  This is accomplished by ensuring alternative language accessibility \nto voting systems, provisional balloting, and inclusion as a registered \nvoter in the statewide voter registration lists. These safeguards \nprovide an equal opportunity for all eligible language minorities to \ncast a vote and have that vote counted.\n\n  In the spirit of minority language accessibility under the Voting \nRights Act, the purpose of this bill is to establish uniform, \nnondiscriminatory standards for voting systems and administration of \nelections. To continue to recognize only four distinct language \nminority groups is neither uniform nor nondiscriminatory.\n  This Act also provides for a Commission study to determine whether \nthe voting systems are, in fact, capable of accommodating all voters \nwith a limited proficiency in the English language and make necessary \nrecommendations.\n  This compromise includes provisions specifying how lever voting \nsystems may meet the multilingual voting requirements if it is not \npracticable to add the alternative language to the lever voting system \nand the state or locality has filed a request for a waiver.\n  Finally, the requirement that voting systems meet a uniform, national \nerror rate standard is a particularly important reform. Requiring \nvoting systems to conform to a nationwide error rate ensures the \nintegrity of the results and greater uniformity and nondiscriminatory \nresults in the casting and tabulating of ballots. It is important to \nnote that error rates encompass more than just errors due to the \nmechanical failure of the equipment and can reflect design flaws that \nimpede the ability of voters to accurately operate the voting system. \nError rates should reflect the design, accuracy, and performance of \nsystems under normal voting conditions.\n  Similarly, operating failures of the voting system, or voter \nconfusion about how to operate technology or use various types of \nballots, may be the result of unclear instructions or poor ballot \ndesign. The Committee received information from the American Institute \nof Graphic Arts regarding the importance of design in the voting \nexperience. AIGA has been working with the Federal Election Commission \nto educate the FEC on the importance of communication design. It would \nbe appropriate for the new Election Administration Commission to study \nthe issue of communication design criteria and consider incorporating \nsuch ideas into its guidelines.\n  In order to ensure that states and localities have sufficient time to \nmeet these requirements, the compromise directs that the Office of \nElection Administration--which is currently housed at the Federal \nElection Commission but will be transferred to the new Election \nAdministration Commission--issue revised voting system standards by \nJanuary 1, 2004, two years before the standards must be in place. This \nshould give vendors sufficient time to modify and certify their \nproducts and allow State and local governments to procure DREs which \nare disable accessible for each polling place.\n  Most importantly, the compromise states that nothing in the language \nof the voting system requirements shall require a jurisdiction to \nchange their existing voting system for another. Unlike the H.R. 3295, \nthe bill that passed the House, this compromise presumes, protects, and \npreserves, all methods of balloting. And while some systems may have to \nbe enhanced or modified to some extent, or additional voter education \nconducted, no jurisdiction is required by this bill to exchange the \ncurrent voting system used in that jurisdiction with a new system in \norder to be in compliance.\n  However, the voting system that is in use must meet these standards \nin order to ensure that all eligible voters have access to a uniform, \nnondiscriminatory system.\n  It is vitally important that the Congress institute these basic \nvoting system standards. As Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, Chair \nof the Congressional Black Caucus testified, ``All over the world, the \nUnited States is seen as the guarantor of democracy. This country has \nsent countless scores of observers to foreign lands to assure that the \nprocess of democracy is scrupulously maintained. We cannot do less for \nourselves than we have done for others.''\n  The second Federal minimum requirement contained in the compromise \nprovides for provisional balloting and the posting of voting \ninformation in the polling place on election day.\n  For Federal elections beginning after January 1, 2004, State and \nlocal election officials shall make a provisional ballot available to \nvoters whose names do not appear on the registration rolls or who are \notherwise challenged as ineligible.\n  In order to receive a provisional ballot, the voter must execute a \nwritten affirmation that he or she is a registered voter in that \njurisdiction and is eligible to vote in that election. Once executed, \nthe affidavit is handed over to the appropriate election official who \nmust promptly verify the information and issue a ballot.\n  The election official then makes a determination, under state law, as \nto whether the voter is eligible to vote in the jurisdiction, or not, \nand shall count the ballot accordingly.\n  It is important to note that in some jurisdictions, the verification \nof voter eligibility will take place prior to the issuance of a ballot \nbased upon the information in the written affidavit. In other \njurisdictions, the ballot will be issued and then laid aside for \nverification later. Both procedures are equally valid under the \ncompromise, and the amendment adopted last evening, offered by the \nSenator from Michigan, Senator Levin, reflects that. The authors of the \ncompromise have repeatedly said that we do not require a one-size-fits-\nall approach to elections in this bill. The same is true for the \nprovisional balloting requirement which provides flexibility to states \nto meet the needs of their communities in slightly differing ways.\n  In order to ensure that voters who cast provisional ballots are \nproperly registered in time for the next election, within 30 days of \nthe election the appropriate election official must notify, in writing, \nthose voters whose ballots are not counted. A voter whose provisional \nballot is counted does not have to be individually notified of such.\n  This bipartisan compromise requires all 50 States and the District of \nColumbia to provide for provisional balloting in Federal elections, \neven if a State also permits same-day registration or requires no \nregistration. In States without voter registration requirements, \nprovisional balloting will protect the rights of voters whose \neligibility to cast a ballot is officially challenged, for whatever \nreason, at the polling place.\n  In States with same-day voter registration, the right to cast a \nprovisional ballot will protect an eligible voter who pre-registers and \nwhose name is not on the official list of eligible voters or whose \neligibility is challenged by an election official, but who cannot re-\nregister on Election Day. For example, a properly registered legal \nvoter heading to the polls might not carry the identification required \nby the State for same-day voter registration. Under this compromise, if \nthat voter's\n\n[[Page S2535]]\n\nname does not appear on the list of eligible voters or the voter's \neligibility is officially challenged, the voter could cast a \nprovisional ballot. If the voter does have the identification required \nto register on Election Day, he or she would have the option of \nregistering again and casting a ballot in accordance with state law. \nSame-day registration thus not only boosts voter turnout but also \noffers another way that states can guard against disenfranchising \nvoters as the result of registration problems that arise on election \nday.\n  This compromise further ensures that a voter will receive a \nprovisional ballot if he or she needs one. The provisional ballot will \nbe counted if the individual is eligible under State law to vote in the \njurisdiction. It is our intent that the word ``jurisdiction,'' for the \npurpose of determining whether the provisional ballot is to be counted, \nhas the same meaning as the term ``registrar's jurisdiction'' in \nsection 8(j) of the National Voter Registration Act.\n  However, the appropriate election official must also establish a free \naccess system, such as a toll-free phone line or Internet website, \nthrough which any voter who casts a provisional ballot can find out \nwhether his or her ballot was counted, and if it was not counted, why \nit was not counted. Voters casting a provisional ballot will be \ninformed of this notification process at the time they vote. And the \ncompromise requires that the security, confidentiality, and integrity \nof the information be maintained.\n  In order to ensure that voters are aware of the provisional balloting \nprocess and are provided information about sample ballots and their \nvoting rights, the compromise requires that certain election \ninformation be posted at the polling place on election day. This is a \nsignificant change from the original bill which required an actual \nmailing to each registered voter or the equivalent of such notice \nthrough publication and media distribution. Although some states \nalready mail individual sample ballots to the homes of registered \nvoters and post voting information in the polling place, the compromise \nwill establish a national uniform standard with respect to voting \ninformation.\n  Like provisional voting, increased voter education is widely \nendorsed. The Carter-Ford report recommends the use of sample ballots \nand other voter education tools. The report of the Democratic Caucus \nSpecial Committee on Election Reform also urged increased voter \neducation efforts, especially targeted to new voters.\n\n  The Caltech-MIT report advocates increased voter education, including \nthe publication of sample ballots, providing instructional areas at \npolling places, and additional training for poll workers, as a way to \nreduce the number of lost votes. Other organizations support additional \nvoter education, including the League of Women Voters, the Constitution \nProject, and the NAACP.\n  Voter education is particularly important for communities \ndisproportionately impacted by the current inadequacies in our voting \nsystems. As Anil Lewis, President of the Atlanta metropolitan chapter \nof the National Federation of the Blind, testified to at the Committee \nhearing in Atlanta:\n\n       Many of the disenfranchised, disabled voters do not have \n     [a] record of knowing that the polls are now accessible. Many \n     of them, out of frustration, have refused to go to the polls \n     to vote. They have not taken advantage of the absentee \n     opportunity to vote as an absentee ballot, but by educating \n     them that these accommodations are now in place, we are going \n     to increase the vote turnout for people with disabilities.\n\n  Hilary O. Shelton, president of the Washington, D.C. chapter of the \nNAACP, testified before the Committee about poll workers who told \nAfrican-American voters that they could not have another ballot after \nthey had made a mistake on their first one, despite a State statutory \nrequirement that voters be given another punch card if they needed one.\n  The clear message the Committee received is that voters, particularly \nthose with special needs, simply do not know what services and voting \nopportunities are available to them. This requirement will ensure that \nvoting information will be provided.\n  The specific information that must be posted in the polling place \nincludes: a sample ballot with instructions, including instructions on \nhow to cast a provisional ballot; information regarding the date and \nhours the polling place will be open; information on the additional \nverification required by voters who register by mail and are voting for \nthe first time; and general information on voting rights under Federal \nand State law and instructions on how to contact the appropriate \nofficial if such rights are alleged to have been violated.\n  The requirement for posting voting information in the polling place \nis effective for federal elections which occur after the date of \nenactment of the legislation.\n  While it is not anticipated that extensive guidelines will be \nnecessary to implement the provisional ballot requirement, any such \nguidelines must be issued by January 1, 2003, either by the Department \nof Justice, or the new Election Administration Commission if it is up \nand running.\n  The third requirement calls for the creation of a statewide \ncomputerized voter registration list and new verification procedures \nfor first-time voters who register by mail. This requirement will \nfacilitate the administration of election day activities and addresses \nconcerns about possible voter registration fraud. Although GAO found \nthere is less than a 1 percent to 5 percent incident of fraud \nnationwide the reality is that even an insignificant potential for \nfraud can undermine the confidence of voters, election officials, \npolitical parties, etc., in the results of a close election.\n  More specifically, GAO found as a general matter that most \njurisdictions did not identify this type of fraud as a major concern, \nbecause state and local election officials have established procedures \nfor preventing mail-in absentee fraud.\n  GAO estimated that less than 1 percent to 5 percent of jurisdictions \nnationwide experienced special problems with absentee voting fraud \nduring recent elections. However, the absentee voting fraud concerns \ntend to fall into three categories, including: one, someone other than \nthe appropriate voter casting the mail-in absentee ballot; two, \nabsentee voters voting more than once; and three, voters being \nintimidated or unduly influenced while voting the mail-in absentee \nballot.\n  GAO also reported that during the November 2000 elections, local \nelection jurisdictions used several procedures to prevent fraud in the \nabove three areas, including providing notice to such voters about the \npotential legal consequences of providing inaccurate or fraudulent \ninformation on the balloting materials.\n  Finally, GAO reported that some of the local election officials \ncommented that they had referred certain cases to the local District \nAttorney's office for possible prosecution.\n  Specifically, the third requirement of the compromise provides that \neach State, acting through the chief State election official, shall \nestablish an interactive computerized statewide voter registration list \nby the first Federal election in 2004.\n  This computerized list must contain the name and registration \ninformation for every legally registered voter in the State. To ensure \naccurate list maintenance and to deter potential fraud, the list must \nassign a unique identifier to each voter, and the list must be \naccessible to State and local election officials in the State. \nFurthermore, the compromise permits the use of social security numbers \nfor voter registration while ensuring that privacy guarantees are \nmaintained.\n  List maintenance must be performed regularly, and the purging of any \nname from the list must be accomplished in a fashion that is consistent \nwith provisions of the National Voter Registration Act, more commonly \nknown as the Motor-Voter law.\n  While this compromise reflects a belief that technology can provide \nan effective deterrent to fraud through the use of computerized \nregistration lists, the amendment offered last evening by Senator \nNickles also ensures that such technology is not subject to \nunauthorized use by hackers or others who wish to defraud the system by \nuse of technology. Similarly, voting system error rates doe not include \nsystem security. A voting system with a computer modem, such as used in \nthe DRE and optical scan technology, could be compromised through a \ncomputer network. Senator Nickles amendment requires that State and \nlocal officials address\n\n[[Page S2536]]\n\nthe security of voting systems technology. It would also be appropriate \nfor the new commission to consider developing security protocols for \nvoting systems as a part of its overall responsibility for overseeing \nthe creation and updating of the voluntary voting system standards.\n  Essentially, the compromise provides for the removal of individuals \nfrom official voter registration lists if such individuals are not \neligible to vote. There are many reasons an individual might be \nineligible to vote. The individual may have moved outside the State or \nmay have died. Some may have been convicted of a felony or been \nadjudicated incompetent, either of which may under some State laws \ncould end the individual's eligibility.\n  The compromise provides a mechanism for removing the names of such \nindividuals from the rolls. Under this mechanism there are three \nessential elements. First, the individual is to be notified that the \nState believes he or she is ineligible. Second, the individual is to \nhave an opportunity to correct erroneous information or to confirm that \nhis or her status has changed. And third, if the individual has not \nresponded to the notice, the individual is to be given an opportunity \nto go to the polls and correct erroneous information and then vote.\n  This third element is needed to ensure that the right to vote is not \ndependent on the mails. It allows an individual to correct erroneous \ninformation when that individual goes to the polls. These are the \nmechanisms outlined in the National Voter Registration Act, and these \nare the mechanisms that will be used under this compromise to remove \nany ineligible individuals from the voter registration rolls.\n  In addition, under this compromise, a State or its subdivisions shall \ncomplete, not later than 90 days prior to the date of an election, any \nprogram that systematically removes the names of ineligible voters from \nan official list of eligible voters.\n  And, of course, any voter removal system must be uniform, \nnondiscriminatory and in compliance with the Voting Rights Act. The \nvoter removal system shall not result in the removal of the name of any \nperson from the official list of voters registered to vote in an \nelection for Federal office by reason of the person's failure to vote.\n  The managers of this bill intend to ensure, and the legislation \nensures, that only voters who are not registered or who are not \neligible to vote are removed from the voter rolls.\n  As a practical matter, once the computerized list is up and running, \nlist maintenance will be almost automatic. While many of us have read \nof allegations of massive duplicate registrations, the truth is that \neven though duplicate names appear on more than one jurisdiction's \nlist, the vast majority of voters only live in one place and only vote \nin one place.\n  In a highly mobile society likes ours voters move constantly. And \nwhile they may remember to change their mailing address with the post \noffice, with utility companies, and with the bank and credit card \ncompanies, they may not even think about changing their address with \nthe local election official until it comes time to vote.\n  If there is no statewide system for sharing such information, voters \ncan easily remain on lists long after they have moved. If the State or \njurisdiction is not vigilant about conducting list maintenance, the \nnumber of so-called duplicate names can easily grow.\n  The State of Michigan has a very good system which we used as a model \nfor judging what was possible under this requirement. As I understand \nit, under the Michigan system, when a voter changes his or her address, \nthe address change is entered into the system, and it automatically \nnotifies both jurisdictions simultaneously. This results in an \nautomatic update which precludes the possibility of duplicate \nregistration.\n  Moreover, while the compromise does not require it, many States will \nmake this computerized list available to local officials at the polling \nplace on election day. This tool can then be used to immediately verify \nregistration information at the polling place, without the frustration \nof dialing into a toll-free number that always rings busy.\n  Let me also address an issue that has been raised by local election \nofficials. Some local officials are concerned that they will lose the \nability to effectively manage their voter rolls if the primary \nresponsibility for input and list maintenance is shifted to the State.\n  This requirement does not specify who is responsible for the daily \nmaintenance of the list--that is left to each State to decide as it \nbest sees fit. However, in order to have an interactive statewide list, \na central authority must have the ultimate responsibility for \nestablishing such a computerized system.\n  That responsibility falls clearly to the chief State election \nofficial. This proposal envisions close cooperation and consultation \nwith local election officials who are interacting with new voters every \nday.\n  Several States have already begun implementing such systems or have \nbeen running such systems for years. The Council of State Governments \nnotes that the States of Oklahoma, Kentucky and Michigan have \nparticularly good models for other States to follow.\n  To further guard against potential fraud, the third requirement also \nestablishes new verification procedures for first-time voters who \nregister by mail.\n  In the case of an individual who registers by mail, the first time \nthe individual goes to vote in person in a jurisdiction, he or she must \npresent to the appropriate election official one of the following \npieces of identification: a current valid photo id; or a copy of any of \nthe following documents: a current utility bill; a bank statement; a \ngovernment check; a paycheck; or another government document with the \nvoter's name and address.\n  The compromise does not specify any particular type of acceptable \nphoto identification. Clearly, a driver's license, a student ID, or a \nwork ID that has a photograph of the individual would be sufficient.\n  If the voter does not have any of these forms of identification, he \nor she must be allowed to cast a provisional ballot, following the \nprocedures outlined in the second requirement of the compromise under \nSection 102.\n  In the case of a voter who registers by mail and votes absentee for \nthe first time in the jurisdiction, the voter must include a copy of \none of these pieces of identification with their absentee ballot.\n  It is important to note that it is the voter, and not the State or \nlocal election official, who determines which piece of identification \nis presented for the purposes of casting a provisional ballot.\n  A first-time voter may avoid producing identification at the polling \nplace or including it with an absentee ballot by mailing in a copy of \nany of the listed pieces of identification with his or her voter \nregistration card.\n  Additionally, as added by the amendment of the Senator from Oregon, \nSenator Wyden, adopted last evening, the voter may choose to submit his \nor her driver's license number or the last four digits of his or her \nSocial Security number which the State can then match against an \nexisting database to see if the number submitted match the name, \naddress, and number in the state file. In the event that a first-time \nmail-registrant voter cannot produce the required identification, he or \nshe may cast a provisional ballot if voting in person. In the case of a \nmail-in ballot, if the required identification verification information \nis not included, the ballot will nonetheless be counted as a \nprovisional ballot.\n  This is an important and common sense change to the compromise which \npreserves the anti-fraud provisions while at the same time providing \nvoters with more options for verifying their identity while increasing \nthe flexibility of State and local administrators to verify such \nidentity. Either way, it will be easier to vote and harder to defraud \nthe system. I am greatly appreciative to all of my colleagues, and \ntheir staff, for working so diligently to achieve this modification.\n  The compromise also preserves the existing exemptions under the \nMotor-Voter law under section 1973gg-4(c)(2) of title 42 in the \nimplementation of this compromise. A State may not by law require a \nperson to vote in-person if that first-time voter is: one, entitled to \nvote by absentee ballot under section 1973ff-1 of title 42 of the \nUniformed\n\n[[Page S2537]]\n\nand Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act; two, provided the right to \nvote otherwise than in-person under section 1973ee-1(b)(2)(b)(ii) and \n1973ee-3(b)(2)(b)(ii) of the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and \nHandicapped Act; and three, entitled to vote otherwise than in-person \nunder any other Federal law.\n  There is no question about the intent to this Senator. The exemptions \nunder Motor-Voter are preserved under this compromise. There is no \nattempt to change current law with respect to preserving the long-\nstanding practice of States permitting eligible uniform service voters \nand eligible American overseas voters to continue to vote by absentee \nballot without this first-time voters requirement attaching.\n  Similarly, there is no attempt to change current law with respect to \npreserving the States' practice of permitting disabled voters and \nsenior voters to continue to vote by absentee ballot without this \nfirst-time voter requirement attaching.\n  According to GAO, ``All states provide for one or more alternative \nvoting methods or accommodations that may facilitate voting by people \nwith disabilities whose assigned polling places are inaccessible.'' For \nexample, all States have provisions allowing voters with disabilities \nto vote absentee without requiring notary or medical certification \nrequirements, although the procedures for absentee voting vary among \nStates. The GAO State survey demonstrates that all States permit \nabsentee voting for voters with disabilities. There is no intent to \nchange the underlying law for any of these covered individuals since \ncovered individuals are not subject to the requirements for first-time \nvoters under Section 103.\n  Finally, the compromise adds two new questions to the mail-in \nregistration form under the Motor-Voter law. These questions are \ndesigned to assist voters in determining whether or not they are \neligible to register to vote in the first place and thus reduce the \nnumber of ineligible applications. When a non-citizen fills out a voter \nregistration form while waiting to renew a driver's license, or a 16 \nyear-old high school senior applies to vote along with his or her \nclassmates during the voter registration drive at the high school, it \ndoes not mean that these individuals are attempting to defraud the \nsystem. They may actually be very civic-minded individuals who are just \nmisinformed about whether or not they are eligible to register.\n\n  These two additional questions will help alert such voters to the \nfact that they are not yet eligible to vote. First, the mail-in \nregistration card must include the question with a box for checking \n``yes'' or ``no'': ``Are you a citizen of the United States of \nAmerica?'' Second, the mail-in registration card must include the \nquestion with a box for indicating ``yes'' or ``no'': ``Will you be 18 \nyears of age on or before election day?'' If a voter answers ``no'' to \neither question, the registration card must instruct the voter not to \nfill out the form.\n  There has been an issue raised with regard to those States that allow \nfor early registration and the impact of this provision on that. \nHowever, this bill only applies to Federal elections and a voter must \nbe 18 years of age to vote in a Federal election. This requirement does \nnot affect State law with regard to the minimum age for registration.\n  To the extent that guidelines are required to implement the statewide \ncomputerized voter list requirement or the first-time voter provision, \nthe Department of Justice, or the new commission if it has been \nconstituted, must issue these guidelines by October 1, 2003.\n  As with any such law, enforcement of the three requirements in Title \nI will fall to the Department of Justice, and the rights and remedies \nestablished under this bill are in addition to all others provided by \nlaw.\n  Title II of the measure before us contains three grant programs to \nassist states in meeting the minimum Federal requirements and to fund \nother election reform initiatives.\n  From the beginning of this debate it has been clear to this Senator \nthat the Federal Government has not lived up to its responsibility to \nensure adequate funding for the administration of Federal elections. \nThe fundamental principle of this bipartisan compromise is that if the \nFederal Government is going to establish minimum requirements for the \nconduct of Federal elections, then we must provide the resources to \nState and local governments to meet those requirements.\n  Of equal importance is the principle that there should not be a one-\nsize-fits-all approach to meeting the Federal minimum requirements. \nConsequently, the compromise provides broad latitude to States and \nlocalities on how they meet the minimum requirements and what specific \nactivities they fund with the Federal grants.\n  The first grant program authorizes $3 billion over 4 years for grants \nto State and local governments to be used to meet the three minimum \nFederal requirements of the bill. The only limitation on the use of \nthese funds is that they be used to ``implement'' these requirements. \nThe compromise envisions that implementation activities may vary widely \nboth between States and across jurisdictions within a State. Clearly, \nfunds may be used to purchase new voting systems or enhance or modify \nexisting ones.\n  Obviously, specific grant approvals will necessarily have to be made \nby the Department of Justice or the new Election Administration \nCommission once it becomes effective, in light of the overall funding \nrequests. However, it is the intent of this Senator that States and \nlocalities be given broad latitude in making the case that the reforms \nthey seek to fund are in direct support of the implementation of these \nrequirements.\n  For example, a State may decide to upgrade an entire State from a \nlever voting system to an electronic system in order to meet the \naccessibility standard for the disabled. Clearly, the purchase of a \nnew, statewide system would be an authorized activity used to implement \nthe voting system standards of the first minimum requirement. But to \nmeet the same requirement, another State might use these funds to lease \none DRE machine for each polling place. That would be equally allowable \nand in compliance with this compromise.\n  Similarly, if some jurisdictions within a State use a central count \npunch card system, funds may be used to implement the voter education \nprogram required to notify voters of the effect of an over-vote, while \nother jurisdictions within that same State might use the funds to \npurchase precinct-based optical scan systems.\n  If a State or jurisdiction appears to already meet the requirements \nof the bill, but wishes to upgrade old equipment to newer models or add \nimprovements to ensure that it will continue to be in compliance, such \nwould also be an allowable use of funding.\n  The compromise also authorizes retroactive payments for those \njurisdictions which incurred expenses on or after January 1, 2001 for \ncosts that would otherwise have been incurred to implement the minimum \nrequirements. An amendment offered by Senators Chafee and Reed, which \nwas adopted by the Senator, clarifies that multi-year contract for the \npurchase of voting systems can also qualify for retroactive payments.\n  There is no matching requirement for these grants. If we are going to \nrequire that States and localities meet certain minimum Federal \nstandards with regard to Federal elections, then we should provide them \nwith the Federal resources to do so.\n  The requirements of the grant application process are designed \nspecifically to allow both States and localities to apply for funds \nwithout creating either overlapping funding or inconsistencies within \nStates.\n  To apply for funds to implement the requirements, States must submit \nan application to the attorney general with a State plan.\n  The State plan contains four basic components.\n  First, a description of how the state will use the funds to meet the \nthree minimum requirements, including a description of how State and \nlocal election officials will ensure the accuracy of voter registration \nlists; and the precautions the State will take to prevent eligible \nvoters from being removed from the list.\n  Second, an assessment of the susceptibility of Federal elections in \nthe State to voting fraud and a description of how the State intends to \naddress such.\n\n[[Page S2538]]\n\n  Third, assurances that the State will comply with existing Federal \nlaws, specifically: Voting Rights Act; Voting Accessibility for the \nElderly and Handicapped Act; Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee \nVoting Act; National Voter Registration Act (or Motor-Voter); and \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.\n  Fourth, and finally, the State plan must include a timetable for \nmeeting the elements of the plan.\n  In order to ensure the broadest support for the State plan, it must \nbe developed in consultation with State and local election officials \nand made available for public review and comment prior to submission \nwith any grant application.\n  In addition to the State plan, each application must include a \nstatement of how the State will use the Federal funds to implement the \nState plan.\n  Localities may also submit a separate application for funds, but the \nuse of funds must be consistent with the State plan. The application \nmust also contain any additional information required by the attorney \ngeneral or the new commission once it is effective.\n  Grant recipients must keep such records as the attorney general \ndetermines and, as is usually the case for Federal grant programs, any \ngrant recipient may be audited by the attorney general or comptroller \ngeneral. Grantees may be required to submit reports, and the attorney \ngeneral must report to Congress and the President annually on the \nactivities funded under this program.\n  One of the goals of this legislation is to encourage states and \nlocalities to move forward with election reform initiatives and apply \nfor Federal grants, even before the effective dates established for \nmeeting those requirements.\n  This is reflected in the larger appropriations in the early years and \nthe fact that the appropriations remain available until expended.\n  This is one of the provisions of the committee-reported bill which \nhas been retained in the compromise. The requirements under this \ncompromise are so simple and so self-explanatory, that we do not \nbelieve that complicated guidelines, much less full-blown regulations, \nare going to be necessary to implement the requirements.\n  Consequently, the original bill, and this compromise, encourages \nStates and localities to move expeditiously by essentially providing \nfor a grandfathering of early action.\n  The compromise allows jurisdictions that apply for Federal grants \nprior to the issuance of any guidelines or standards to nonetheless \nreceive funding to implement the requirements of the bill. If the \nattorney general approves the grant, then that approval acts as a \ndetermination that the State plan, and the activities in the State plan \nwhich will be funded with the grant, are deemed to otherwise comply \nwith the minimum requirements of the bill.\n  However, in encouraging quick action we did not want to deter State \nand local governments, much less penalize them if the early action they \ntook turns out to be somehow inconsistent with subsequently issued \nguidelines. The most obvious instance in which this might occur would \nbe with regard to the voting system standards and the not-yet-issued \nvoting system error rate.\n  In order to avoid placing a State or locality at risk of non-\ncompliance, the compromise essentially grandfathers the action that the \nState takes pursuant to an approved State plan and grant application \nand provides a safe harbor from enforcement actions on that basis.\n  Without such a provision, the Federal Government might end up \nliterally funding a State or locality twice for essentially the same \nreform--once when the State took early action and a second time when \nany subsequent guidelines or standards were finally issued.\n  Moreover, in promoting early action, the safe harbor provision \nattempts to give jurisdictions a reasonable amount of time to come into \ncompliance with any subsequently issued guidelines or standards by \nextending the grandfather period to 2010, except for the requirements \nfor disability access. Although the effective dates for most of the \nrequirements are 2004 and 2006, this additional time period provided by \nthe grandfather provision will minimize the otherwise disruptive effect \nto both voters and election officials of repeated changes to systems \nand procedures. It will also provide those States poised to act with \nthe assurance that the decision to take early action will not end up in \nan enforcement action.\n  With regard to the disability accessibility standard under the voting \nsystem requirement, because the bill provides for a specific compliance \nmechanism in the requirement of one DRE machine in every polling place, \nit was believed that the extended safe harbor period was unnecessary \nand potentially disruptive to the disabled community. Consequently, in \ntaking early action jurisdictions will still have to meet the \ndisability access standards by 2006.\n\n  Similarly, with this same goal of encouraging States to take early \naction, the compromise creates a second incentive grant program \ndesigned to fund other election reform initiatives not necessarily \nfunded under the requirements grant program.\n  The incentive grant program authorizes $400 million in this fiscal \nyear to fund such activities as: poll worker and volunteer training; \nvoter education; same-day registration procedures; procedures to deter \nand investigate voting fraud; improvements to voting systems; and \naction to bring the jurisdiction into compliance with existing civil \nrights laws.\n  The compromise also establishes a program to recruit and train \ncollege students to serve as poll workers.\n  The incentive grant programs has a matching requirement of 80 percent \nFederal to 20 percent State or local funding. The attorney general, \nhowever, can reduce the 20 percent matching requirement for States or \nlocalities that lack resources.\n  Although grants cannot be used to implement reforms that are \ninconsistent with the minimum Federal requirements, these grants can be \nused to take interim action to bring voting systems into compliance.\n  As with the requirements grant program, early action under the \nincentive grant program to implement the three minimum requirements is \nsimilarly grandfathered to 2010, with the exception of the disability \nrequirements.\n  To apply for incentive grant funds, a State or locality submits an \napplication to the attorney general or the new commission upon its \nenactment. Patterned after the requirements of the legislation \nintroduced by Senators McConnell and Schumer as S. 953, applications \nfor incentive grant funds must contain a specific showing that the \njurisdiction is in compliance with a number of existing civil rights \nlaws, including: Voting Rights Act; Voting Accessibility for the \nElderly and Handicapped Act; Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee \nVoting Act; National Voter Registration Act; Americans with \nDisabilities Act; and Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n  Before a grant application can be approved, the assistant attorney \ngeneral for civil rights must certify that the jurisdiction is either \nin compliance, or has demonstrated that it will be using the grant \nfunds to come into compliance, with these laws. Entities which receive \nfunds to come into compliance with these laws are subject to audit.\n  The purpose of this provision is not to penalize or place in jeopardy \nthose jurisdictions which are attempting to overcome compliance issues. \nInstead, it is intended to provide a source of funds for States or \nlocalities to address compliance issues under existing civil rights \nlaws before facing the effective dates for minimum Federal standards \nunder this new civil rights law. To ensure that jurisdictions are not \npenalized by this process, the compromise prohibits action being \nbrought against a State or local government on the basis of any \ninformation contained in the application.\n  In order to ensure that these funds are available this year, the \nattorney general must establish any general policies or criteria for \nthe application process so that grant applications can be approved no \nlater than October 1, 2002.\n  The final grant program contained in Title II of the compromise \nprovides funds to make polling places physically accessible to the \ndisabled. GAO found that 84 percent of all polling places in the United \nStates are not physically accessible from the parking area to the \nvoting room. Moreover, not one of the 496 polling places visited by GAO \non election day 2000 had voting equipment adapted for blind voters.\n\n[[Page S2539]]\n\n  This is a modest grant program which authorizes $100 million \nbeginning in fiscal year 2002, with such funds to remain available \nuntil expended. States or localities may use these funds to ensure \naccessibility of polling places, including entrances, exits, paths of \ntravel and voting areas of the polling facility.\n  Funds may also be used for education and outreach programs for those \nwith disabilities to inform voters about the accessibility of polling \nplaces. Education programs to train election officials, poll workers \nand volunteers on how best to promote access and participation of \nindividuals with disabilities can also be funded under this program.\n  This grant program will also be administered initially by the \nDepartment of Justice, and then by new Election Administration \nCommission. However, the general policies and criteria for the approval \nof applications for the accessibility grant program will be established \nby the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, also \nknown as the Access Board, which was established under the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.\n  The Access Board is uniquely qualified to determine what physical \nmodifications would be appropriate to make polling facilities \naccessible to disabled voters. The Board must establish such policies \nin time to ensure that applications can be approved by October 1, 2002.\n  Grants under the accessibility grant program are funded at an 80 \npercent Federal share, although the Attorney General can provide a \ngreater share to jurisdictions which lack resources. Grantees must keep \nappropriate records and are subject to audit.\n  The final title of the compromise establishes a new independent \nagency within the executive branch for administering the three grant \nprograms and providing on-going assistance to State and local \ngovernments in the administration of Federal elections.\n  The Election Administration Commission will be composed of four \nmembers appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. To \nreflect the need for a continuing nonpartisan approach to election \nadministration, no more than two commissioners may be members of the \nsame political party.\n  In recognition of the national significance of these appointments and \nto ensure the broadest bipartisan support for the President's nominees, \nthe four respective leaders of the House and Senate, including the \nSpeaker and the House Minority Leader and the Majority and Minority \nLeaders of the Senate, shall each submit a candidate recommendation to \nthe President before the initial appointment of nominees and prior to \nthe appointment of a vacancy.\n  The qualifications for appointment to the new commission reflect the \ndesire to create a diverse and experienced commission that will bring \nmore to the job than just experience in election administration or \nloyalty and service to a particular party. We would hope to also \nattract scholars and historians who appreciate and understand the \nbroadest experience of voters of all backgrounds, abilities, and party \naffiliations.\n  It would be this Senator's hope that we would attract candidates who \nhave an appreciation of the fundamental importance of the citizen vote \nto a democracy and are committed to ensuring both the inclusiveness and \nthe integrity of Federal elections.\n  Specifically, commissioners are to be appointed on the basis of their \nknowledge and experience with election law, election technology, and \nFederal, State or local election administration, as well as their \nknowledge of the Constitution and the history of the United States.\n  Appropriately, a commissioner at the time of appointment cannot be an \nelected or appointed officer or employee of the Federal Government. \nUnlike the House bill, this is a permanent, full-time commission. \nConsequently, commissioners cannot engage in any other business or \nemployment while serving on the commission.\n  To ensure that the best talent that America has to offer will be \ncontinually reflected in appointees, we limit each commissioner to one \n6-year term. Similarly, to ensure the broadest participation in the \nwork of the commission, the compromise provides that a chair and vice-\nchair must be of different parties and serve for a term of 1 year, and \nan individual may serve as chair only twice during his or her 6-year \nterm.\n  The duties of the commission reflect the fundamental approach of this \ncompromise--that of forming a partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and State and local election officials. The purpose of this \nbill is not to replace or minimize the authority or responsibilities of \nState and local election officials in administering Federal elections. \nIt is, however, an attempt to provide leadership at the Federal level, \nin the form of both financial resources and minimum Federal \nrequirements, to ensure uniform and nondiscriminatory participation in \nthose elections.\n  Consequently, the duties of the commission augment, but do not \nreplace, those of State and local election officials. The commission \ncan best be viewed as a resource for election officials rather than as \na regulatory or enforcement body.\n  Primarily, the commission shall serve as a clearinghouse on Federal \nelection administration and technology by gathering information, \nconducting studies and issuing reports on Federal elections. What \nbecame evident in the Rules Committee hearings and discussions with \nelection officials across this Nation was the apparent lack of unbiased \ninformation regarding election technology. Today, the primary source of \ninformation about the efficiency and effectiveness of voting systems \nand machines is often the manufacturer of the voting system or its \nvendor. The commission can provide a much needed role as an unbiased \nclearinghouse for technology assessments.\n  The compromise envisions that the current authority of the office of \nelection administration, at the Federal Election Commission, to develop \nvoluntary voting system standards would continue once this office is \ntransferred to the new commission. While the compromise does not \nmandate what types of machines must be used in Federal elections, the \nfact that it establishes minimum requirements for voting systems, \nspecifically acceptable error rates, necessitates that procedures for \ntesting and assessing voting technology will be required. Such would be \nan appropriate activity for the new commission. To ensure that the \ncommission has the best advice on technical and accessibility matters \nas it develops standards, the compromise directs the commission to \nconsult with the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the \nCompliance Board in developing the standards.\n  The commission will also serve an important role in communicating \ninformation regarding Federal elections to the public and the media. \nSpecifically, the compromise provides that the commission compile and \nmake available to the public the official results of elections for \nFederal office and statistics regarding national voter registration and \nturnout. The compromise also requires that the commission establish an \nInternet website to facilitate public access, comment, and \nparticipation in the activities of the commission.\n  The compromise does not go as far as the Carter-Ford Commission \nrecommended in this regard. As my colleagues may remember, the Carter-\nFord Commission recommended that\n`` . . . news organizations should not project any presidential \nelection results in any State so long as polls remain open elsewhere in \nthe 48 contiguous States . . .'' and that Congress should consider \nappropriate legislation, consistent with the first amendment to \nencourage the media to withhold early results. While the commission is \nin no way intended to replace the appropriate role of responsible media \nin informing the public of the outcome of Federal elections, the 2000 \npresidential election highlighted the need for a national clearinghouse \nfor election results. Over time, the new commission may come to be \naccepted as the most authoritative source of election results.\n  The commission will conduct on-going studies regarding election \ntechnology and administration in addition to other subjects impacting \nFederal elections. Over the course of the last year, a number of \nexcellent election reform proposals have been made that simply require \nmore study and review before they can be enacted.\n\n[[Page S2540]]\n\n  Specifically, the commission is charged with making periodic studies \nof the following: election technology, including both over-vote and \nunder-vote notification capabilities of such technology; ballots \ndesigns for Federal elections; methods of ensuring accessibility to all \nvoters; nationwide statistics on voting fraud in Federal elections and \nmethods of identifying, deterring and investigating any such \ncorruption; methods of voter intimidation; the recruitment and training \nof poll workers; the feasibility of conducting elections on different \ndays, or for extended hours, including the advisability of establishing \na uniform poll closing time or a federal holiday; Internet voting; \nMedia reporting of election related information; Overseas voters \nissues; ways in which the Federal Government can assist in the \nadministration of Federal elections; and any other matters which the \ncommission deems appropriate.\n  The commission will be providing reports and recommendations for \nadministrative and legislative action. Through the oversight process, I \nwould anticipate that the Rules Committee will be reviewing those \nrecommendations and acting to bring additional reform proposals to the \nfloor in subsequent Congresses.\n  In addition to the study and clearinghouse authorities, the \ncommission is empowered to hold hearings, take testimony, and \nadminister such oaths as are necessary to carry out its \nresponsibilities. However, since the commission is not an enforcement \nagency, it does not have the authority to issue subpoenas.\n  Most importantly, the commission will ultimately assume the ongoing \nresponsibility for administering the three minimum Federal requirements \nand the three grant programs under the bill. But so as not to \ndiscourage immediate election reform or delay the flow of Federal funds \nto support reform, the compromise does not tie the effective dates of \nthe minimum requirements and the grant programs to the establishment of \nthe commission.\n  The compromise attempts to expedite the appointment of the \ncommissioners by requiring that the President act within ninety days of \nthe date of enactment. As Chairman of the Rules Committee, the \ncommittee of jurisdiction over such nominations, it is my intent to \nmove expeditiously to consider the nominations if they occur this year.\n  But realistically, the President may require additional time to \nappoint nominees and the committee cannot act until those nominations \nare made. Because the compromise requires the commission to appoint \nboth the executive director and the general counsel by majority vote, \neven once confirmed, it will take some time for the commissioners to \ncreate a new agency and hire staff to administer over three billion \ndollars in grant programs.\n  Consequently, the compromise initially places the administration of \nboth the Federal minimum requirements and the three grant programs at \nthe Department of Justice and provides for a transition of most, but \nnot all, of those authorities to the new commission upon its \nestablishment.\n  Specifically, the compromise transfers to the commission the \nauthority to issue standards or guidelines for the three minimum \nFederal requirements, to issue policies and criteria for the three \ngrant programs, and to approve by majority vote all grant applications. \nThe Department of Justice retains the authority to approve State plans \nsubmitted under the requirements grant program and the certification \nauthority under the incentive grant program.\n  In order to ensure that the transfer of authority does not impede the \ncontinuity of the requirements or the expeditious review of grant \napplications, the compromise sets specific dates by which the \ncommission must act to overturn or modify any action of the Department \nof Justice.\n  If the Department of Justice has issued standards or guidelines \npursuant to the Federal minimum requirements, the commission must act \nby majority vote within 30 days of the transition date to either affirm \nthat action or to issue revised standards or guidelines. If the \nDepartment of Justice has not acted as of the transition date, then the \ncommission must act by majority vote by the later of the effective date \nprovided for in Title I or within 30 days of the transition date.\n  Similarly, if the Department of Justice has issued policies and \ncriteria for the approval of grant applications, the commission must \nact by majority vote within thirty days of the transition date to \neither affirm or modify such. If the Department of Justice has not \nacted, the commission must similarly issue policies and criteria by the \nlater of the date specified in Title II or within 30 days of the \ntransition date.\n  The compromise defines the effective date of the transition as the \nearlier of sixty days after all of the commissioners have been \nappointed, or the date that is 1 year after the date of enactment of \nthe act.\n  While the compromise attempts to coordinate the transition dates for \ntransfer of responsibilities to the new agency with a reasonable time \nframe for appointing and confirming commissioners, it remains the \nprerogative of the President as to when he appoints and the will of the \nSenate as to when it confirms. And until those two actions occur, the \ncommission will exist in name only and the Department of Justice will \nbe left to administer the act.\n  In addition to assuming certain authorities of the Department of \nJustice under the bill, the new Election Administration Commission will \nalso assume certain functions of the Federal Election Commission.\n  First, all functions of the director of the Office of Election \nAdministration of the Federal Election Commission are transferred to \nthe new commission. Beginning on the transition date, the director of \nthe Office of Election Administration is named as the interim executive \ndirector of the new commission and serves until an executive director \nis appointed by a majority vote of the commission. The executive \ndirector is appointed for a term of 6 years and may be reappointed by \nmajority vote of the commission for a second term.\n  Second, all functions of the Federal Election Commission under the \nNational Voter Registration Act of 1993, the so-called Motor-Voter Act, \nare transferred to the new Election Administration Commission. Section \n9 of the act provides that the Federal Election Commission shall \nprescribe appropriate regulations necessary to carry out the act with \nrespect to developing a mail voter registration application form for \nFederal elections and submit reports. The compromise also provides for \nthe transfer of Federal Election Commission personnel employed in \nconnection with the offices and functions which are transferred by the \nact.\n  Finally, Title IV of the compromise clarifies the relationship of \nthis bill to other existing civil rights laws, and makes improvements \nin voting procedures for members of the military.\n  With respect to criminal penalties, this compromise includes two \nprovisions that track existing laws and do not constitute new law. Both \nprovisions merely are restatements of the existing underlying laws and \ndo not alter the specific intent element described in sections 401(a) \nor 401(b) of this compromise. In the amendment which I offered and was \nadopted by the Senate, I inserted the existing specific intent of \n``knowingly and willfully'' and ``knowingly'' in the respective \nprovisions to ensure that those standards are the explicit legal \nstandards of review for section 1973(i)(c) of title 42 and section 1015 \nof title 18 and therefore are the same standards to be applied under \nthis act.\n  The first provision recognizes that the criminal penalties \nestablished under the National Voter Registration Act, specifically \nsection 1973(i)(c) of title 42 and means in plain language that it is \nunlawful for any individual who knowingly and willfully gives false \ninformation as to his or her name, address, or period of residence in \nthe voting district for the purpose of establishing his or her \neligibility to register or vote in an election for Federal office, or \nconspires with another individual for the purpose of encouraging his or \nher false registration to vote in an election for Federal office.\n  The second provision clarifies that any individual who commits fraud \nor makes a false statement with regard to citizenship, such as in the \ncontext of the new citizenship question on registration forms as \nprovided for under section 103 of the compromise, is in violation of \nsection 1015 of title 18 and\n\n[[Page S2541]]\n\nmeans in plain language that it is unlawful for any individual who \nknowingly makes a false statement relating to naturalization, \ncitizenship or registry of aliens, for the purpose of establishing his \nor her eligibility to register or vote in an election for Federal \noffice.\n  With regard to the effect of the bill on existing civil rights laws, \nthe compromise is specifically not intended to impair any right \nguaranteed, nor require any conduct which is prohibited under the \nvarious civil rights laws, nor are the provisions of the compromise \nintended to supercede, restrict, or limit such other laws, including: \nVoting Rights Act; Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped \nAct; Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act; National \nVoter Registration Act of 1993; Americans with Disabilities Act of \n1990; and Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n  This Senator intents that nothing in this compromise should be \ninterpreted in any manner other than to protect and preserve any and \nall rights guaranteed by these existing civil rights and voting laws.\n  For example, the approval of the Attorney General of any state plan \nunder the provisions of the requirements grant in Title II of the \ncompromise, or any other action taken by the Attorney General or a \nstate under the grant programs in Title II, specifically shall not have \nany effect on requirements for pre-clearance under section five of the \nVoting Rights Act.\n  We do not profess to have all the answers or even the best solution \nfor reforming our system of Federal elections. But we do present a \ncompromise that reflects an incremental step, but not a sea change, in \nthe role of the Federal Government in our Nation's system of \nFederal elections. This compromise has been developed with a true sense \nof the historical importance of the work and a fundamental belief that \nonly a bipartisan effort will be acceptable to the American people.\n\n  Let me address a final concern--and that is the constitutional \nquestion of whether this bipartisan legislation is on its face, \nconstitutional. In the opinion of this Senator, this compromise is \nentirely consistent with the scope of Congress's authority to enact \nstatutes regulating Federal elections.\n  According to the GAO study on the scope of congressional authority in \nelection administration, Congress has constitutional authority over \nboth congressional and Presidential elections. This report concludes \nthat there is a role for both the State and the Federal Government. \nStates are responsible for the administration of Federal, State and \nlocal elections. But, notwithstanding the traditional State role in \nelections, Congress has the authority to affect the administration of \nelections in certain ways.\n  While the Constitution does not explicitly provide the right to vote, \nmany amendments to the Constitution protect the right to vote. Congress \nhas previously acted under this explicit grant of constitutional power \nto protect the voting rights of eligible Americans.\n  Congress passed the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. More \nrecently, Congress enacted federal legislation to remove barriers to \nvoting for persons with disabilities, facilitate voting by those in the \nmilitary and Americans living overseas, and standardize voter \nregistration procedures under the Motor-Voter legislation.\n  When Congress enacted these Federal statutes, Congress legislated in \nthe subject matter of election administration in such areas as voting \nrights, voter registration, absentee voting requirements, timing of \nFederal elections, and accessibility for elderly and disabled voters. \nSimilarly, Congress also legislated to enforce prohibitions against \nspecific discriminatory practices in all elections, including Federal, \nState, and local elections.\n  Congress's scope of power is derived from a number of constitutional \nsources, including the 15th amendment's prohibition on voting \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, or previous condition of \nservitude; the 19th amendment's prohibition on the basis of sex; and \nthe 26th amendment's prohibition on the basis of age.\n  These three amendments do not grant the right to vote, but all three \nprohibit States from denying the franchise to individuals who are \nracial or ethnic minorities, women, or citizens aged 18 or older.\n  The Carter-Ford Task Force on Constitutional Law and Federal Election \nLaw also concluded that Congress has great power to regulate elections. \nThe task force makes the point that the Constitution grants to Congress \nbroad power to directly regulate Congressional elections, less power to \ndirectly regulate Presidential elections, and less power still to \ndirectly regulate state and local elections.\n  But as a practical matter, Congress has great power to collaterally \nregulate all elections through its power over the ``time, place and \nmanner'' of Congressional elections and through its power to determine \nhow Federal funds are made available to States for expenditures. That \nsame authority derives from its enforcement powers of constitutional \nsafeguards, such as the equal protection clause and due process clause \nof the 14th Amendment.\n  Opponents of this legislation might argue that it goes too far by \nproviding Federal requirements in the areas of voting system standards, \nprovisional voting and statewide voter registration lists. This Senator \ndoes not believe that will prove to be the case.\n  While the precise parameters of Congressional authority in election \nadministration relating to presidential elections are unsettled and \nhave not been clearly established, the Supreme Court has recently \nrecognized that certain measures protecting voting rights are within \nCongress's power to enforce the 14th and 15th Amendments, despite \nadministrative burdens placed on the States.\n  In Bush v. Gore which was decided following the November 2000 \nPresidential election, the Supreme Court held that differing \ndefinitions of a vote within the state of Florida during the recount \nviolated the equal protection clause and were therefore \nunconstitutional.\n  The enforcement powers from the 14th amendment alone provide adequate \nsupport for all three of the minimum Federal requirements in the \nbipartisan compromise bill. The reasoning of the Supreme Court in Bush \nv. Gore suggests that there may be a compelling governmental interest \nand constitutional authority for Congress to act in light of extensive \nevidence that African American or Asian American voters, for example, \nare being treated unequally with respect to their right to vote.\n  It should also be noted that while we take a different approach, the \nCarter-Ford Commission's recommendations also include voting system \nstandards, provisional voting and a statewide voter registration \nsystem. Many other commissions and study groups also consistently \nrecommended provisional voting.\n  We believe that the Constitution provides ample authority for these \nminimum Federal requirements and all the other provisions in this \nbipartisan compromise. Except in one instance, this legislation applies \nonly to elections for Federal office, putting this urgently needed \nlegislation beyond constitutional dispute.\n  I applaud the majority leader, Senator Daschle, for his commitment to \nmake this measure a priority of this session of Congress and for his \nunfailing commitment to bring it to the floor for debate. I also \ncommend the distinguished Republican Leader, Senator Lott, for his \nassistance in facilitating consideration of this bipartisan compromise.\n\n  Our distinguished colleagues in the House, Chairman Bob Ney and \nCongressman Steny Hoyer of the House Administration Committee have \nalready shepherded a bipartisan reform proposal through that body. The \ndifferences between the approach in the House and our bipartisan \ncompromise are not irreconcilable.\n  Both recognize that there are minimum standards that every voting \nsystem should meet. Both bills strive to ensure the greatest possible \naccess to the polling place for disabled Americans and the blind. Both \nbills ensure that all eligible voters may cast a vote and have that \nvote counted. Both bills establish a new Federal agency to provide on-\ngoing support to State and local governments. And both approaches \nprovide significant resources to the States and localities to \nunderwrite the Federal share of administering Federal elections.\n\n[[Page S2542]]\n\n  Not insignificantly, President Bush has also indicated his support \nfor providing assistance to the States for election reform. Included in \nhis fiscal year 2003 budget submission is a request for $1.2 billion \nover the next three fiscal years, including $400 million for fiscal \nyear 2003, to fund an election reform initiative.\n  There appears to be a uniform desire in both houses of Congress to \nsee that the Federal Government meets its obligation to be a partner \nwith State and local election officials in the conduct of Federal \nelections. But time is running short and state budgets are growing \nthin. It is time for the Senate to enact election reform. It is time \nfor the Senate to meet with the House to produce a bipartisan bill that \nis worthy of the signature of the President and the support of all the \nAmerican people, regardless of color or class, gender or age, \ndisability or native language, and party or precinct.\n  As this debate draws to a close, it is appropriate to recognize the \nsignificant contributions of both individuals and organizations which \nhave provided input and expertise to the committee, and to me \npersonally, in the course of this legislative matter. I have already \nexpressed my gratitude to my colleagues on and off the committee and to \nmy distinguished coauthor in the House, Congressman John Conyers, and \nto many other House Members who truly have made this effort their \ncause.\n  As we all know, no such effort can be undertaken without the \nconsiderable effort of our staff. In addition to those already \nmentioned, I want to thank Sheryl Cohen, Marvin Fast, Alex Swartsel and \nTom Lenard of my personal staff, and two former Rules Committee staff \nmembers, Candace Chin and Laura Roubicek.\n  We have also received considerable assistance from the support \noffices of the Senate, including from James Fransen and Jim Scott in \nthe Office of Legislative Counsel and from attorneys and analysts at \nthe Congressional Research Service including Kevin Coleman, Eric \nFischer, L. Paige Whitaker, and Judith Fraizer, and finally from the \nGovernment Accounting Office.\n  The list of organizations which have provided invaluable assistance \nto this effort over the last 18 months is almost too lengthy to include \nhere. But it is important to note the breadth and depth of the input \nthat went into crafting this historic legislation. At the risk of \ninadvertently leaving someone out, I want to recognize and thank the \nfollowing organizations which have provided their expertise to this \neffort: American Association of People With Disabilities; American \nCivil Liberties Union; American Federation of State, County and \nMunicipal Employees; American Institute of Graphic Arts; Asian American \nLegal Defense and Education Fund; Brennan Center for Justice; Center \nfor Constitutional Rights; Common Cause; Commission on Civil Rights; \nCaltech-MIT Voting Technology Project; Constitution Project; Lawyers \nCommittee for Civil Rights Under Law; Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights; Mexican American Legal Defense & Education Fund; National Asian \nPacific American Legal Consortium; National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People; NAACP Legal Defense & Education Fund, \nInc.; National Commission on Federal Election Reform (Carter-Ford \nCommission); National Association of Secretaries of State; National \nAssociation of State Election Directors; National Coalition on Black \nCivic Participation; National Congress of American Indians; National \nConference of State Legislatures; National Council of La Raza; National \nFederation of the Blind; Paralyzed Veterans of America; People for the \nAmerican Way; Public Citizen; U.S. PIRG.\n  It is the fervent view of this Senator that at the end of this \nhistoric process, the Senate will have made a lasting contribution to \nthe continued health and stability of this democracy for the people, by \nthe people and of the people in the United States.\n  My thanks to all who have been involved. I urge the adoption of this \nbill and yield back whatever time remains on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me take my last minute by \nthanking again my friend and colleague Senator Dodd. This has been a \nhappy experience. We can proudly recommend to all Members of the Senate \ntoday that they vote in favor of an important new piece of legislation \nthat goes right to the core of what our democracy is all about; that \nis, the ability to vote.\n  This legislation will make a positive difference in our country, and \nis a step forward for our democracy. This bill has been fashioned in a \nway that I wish we could produce more legislation, which is in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n  I enthusiastically support this bill and urge all of my Republican \ncolleagues--in fact, all of our colleagues in the Senate--to proudly \nvote for this legislation.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2907\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will turn \nto the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas. There are 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, what we have before us is an amendment \nto the election reform bill that is now pending that would basically \neliminate the mass mailing requirement to give local and State election \nofficials more time and resources to improve the overall election \nmanagement and to register voters and to comply with the newly enacted \nmandates of this bill.\n  This is an unfunded mandate. This amendment is supported by the \nNational Association of Secretaries of State. It is cosponsored by the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, and Senators \nFeinstein and Levin. Why? Because the secretaries of state and county \nelection officers have indicated there is no need to put in a mandate \nto make sure that your voters who are provisional voters must be \nnotified by mail within 30 days. There are other ways you can do this.\n  Our amendment says to States, if you want to do a mass mailing, you \ncan do that. But at least there is an option here to use a Web site and \ntoll-free numbers and other means of communication that will actually \nallow a provisional voter to know much faster than the mass mailing \nwhether or not they are properly registered and their vote counted. As \na matter of fact, it will enable local county officials and others to \nmake sure a provisional voter is registered, so you can actually make \nthe argument that we will make more progress.\n  I urge support of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, following the Roberts amendment, which \nwill be the normal 15-minute vote, I ask unanimous consent that votes \non the Clinton amendment and final passage be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I speak with great reluctance in \nopposition to the amendment of the Senator from Kansas. I misidentified \nhis State last evening. I apologize.\n  I appreciate the motivations behind this. Let me first say there is \nnothing in this bill that creates an unfunded mandate. One of the \nthings we have provided for in this bill is that every requirement must \nbe paid for by the Federal Government. That is very important to us. We \nrealize if we asked otherwise, we would in fact be doing just what the \nSenator from Kansas has suggested. But that is simply not the case.\n  We are saying with regard to provisional voters--these are some of \nthe most disadvantaged voters in the sense of where they live and their \ncircumstances, economic and otherwise--if you show up to vote and there \nis a question about whether or not you have the right to vote, this \nbill is going to give you the right to cast a provisional ballot. If at \nthe end of that process it is discovered you don't have the right to \nvote, we are saying that the state and local officials must notify that \nvoter so they don't come back and show up the next time as a \nprovisional voter and their vote doesn't count again.\n  The underlying bill already allows a state or locality to create an \ninternet site or establish a 1-800 number, and I don't have a problem \nwith that. But don't exclude the requirement that you must specifically \nnotify a voter whose\n\n[[Page S2543]]\n\nballot was not counted. Registrars of voters notify voters on all sorts \nof things during the year. Saying to a provisional voter, your vote \ndidn't count for the following reasons, this is what you need to do to \ncorrect it, is a minor request. This bill truly makes it easier to vote \nand harder to cheat. We urge the defeat of the Roberts amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2907. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Bayh) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 56, nays 43, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 63 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Bayh\n      \n  The amendment (No. 2907) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. So everyone is aware, the next two votes are 10-minute \nvotes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3108\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 2 \nminutes evenly divided for debate on amendment No. 3108.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, this next amendment, called the \n``leave no vote behind'' amendment, aims at making sure the Office of \nElection Administration has the authority to determine whether or not \nthere are unintentional or intentional human errors. With all due \nrespect to the ranking member, it is not a burdensome provision because \nelection officials are going to have to sort out the ballots to \ndetermine whether there are mechanical errors or not.\n  Secondly, this does not have to be enforced until after January 1, \n2010, and so the language that is in the bill provides more than \nsufficient flexibility for the Office of Election Administration to \nmake a determination as to what benchmark standard to set. If we do not \ndeal with this issue, we are not dealing with the underlying concern \nthat many citizens have, that in some way their vote will not be \ncounted.\n  I urge our colleagues to give the Office of Election Administration \nthe flexibility and authority to make a determination about this kind \nof error, along with mechanical errors. They get to set the standard. \nWe do the same thing in most States to try to determine whether there \nare unintentional errors that a citizen makes in casting a vote, and in \nthe absence of having this provision in the underlying bill we will not \nhave addressed one of the major concerns that citizens have; not only \nfrom the 2000 election but from many elections.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I strongly oppose the Clinton \namendment. This is about the sanctity of the ballot and about the right \nof voters not to vote in an election if they choose. This amendment \nmandates a single voter error rate for all machines and all systems of \nvoting.\n  Each State will be forced to calculate how many voter errors are \nallowed, divide that number by the number of precincts, and tell poll \nworkers in those precincts how many errors each is allowed; all of this \nunder threat of Department of Justice prosecution.\n  Those poll workers will closely monitor undervotes and overvotes, and \nwhen they approach their maximum allowable number, they will be forced \nto plead with voters to cast a vote or to change votes they have \nalready made; all of this under threat of Department of Justice \nprosecution.\n  I say to my colleagues, especially the Senators from Oregon and \nWashington, if their home State uses paper ballots, mail-in ballots, or \nabsentee ballots, this amendment will fundamentally alter, if not \neliminate, those systems of voting. There is no way to control voter \nerror unless one is face-to-face with the voter.\n  This is an amendment that essentially unravels this legislation. I \nstrongly urge its defeat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 3108 offered by the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as specifically provided in section \n     103(b) of this Act with regard to the National Voter \n     Registration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 1973gg et seq.), nothing \n     in this Act may\n\n[[Page S2556]]\n\n     be construed to authorize or require conduct prohibited under \n     the following laws, or supersede, restrict, or limit such \n     laws:\n       (1) The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 1973 et seq.).\n       (2) The Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and \n     Handicapped Act (42 U.S.C. 1973ee et seq.).\n       (3) The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1973ff et seq.).\n       (4) The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. \n     1973gg et seq.).\n       (5) The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. \n     1994 et seq.).\n       (6) The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 701 et seq.).\n       (b) No Effect on Preclearance or Other Requirements Under \n     Voting Rights Act.--The approval by the Attorney General of a \n     State's application for a grant under title II, or any other \n     action taken by the Attorney General or a State under such \n     title, shall not be considered to have any effect on \n     requirements for preclearance under section 5 of the Voting \n     Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 1973c) or any other \n     requirements of such Act.\n\n     SEC. 510. VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. \n     12101 et seq.) requires that people with disabilities have \n     the same kind of access to public places as the general \n     public.\n       (2) The Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and \n     Handicapped Act (42 U.S.C. 1973ee et seq.) requires that all \n     polling places for Federal elections be accessible to the \n     elderly and the handicapped.\n       (3) The General Accounting Office in 2001 issued a report \n     based on their election day random survey of 496 polling \n     places during the 2000 election across the country and found \n     that 84 percent of those polling places had one or more \n     potential impediments that prevented individuals with \n     disabilities, especially those who use wheelchairs, from \n     independently and privately voting at the polling place in \n     the same manner as everyone else.\n       (4) The Department of Justice has interpreted accessible \n     voting to allow curbside voting or absentee voting in lieu of \n     making polling places physically accessible.\n       (5) Curbside voting does not allow the voter the right to \n     vote in privacy.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the right to vote in a private and independent manner is a \n     right that should be afforded to all eligible citizens, \n     including citizens with disabilities, and that curbside \n     voting should only be an alternative of the last resort in \n     providing equal voting access to all eligible American \n     citizens.\n\n     SEC. 511.

After the 2000 election, the Census Bureau \n     asked thousands of non-voters why they did not vote. The top \n     reason for not voting, given by 22.6 percent of the \n     respondents, was that they were too busy or had a conflicting \n     work or school schedule.\n       (2) One of the recommendations of the National Commission \n     on Election Reform led by former President's Carter and Ford \n     is ``Congress should enact legislation to hold presidential \n     and congressional elections on a national holiday''. Holding \n     elections on the legal public holiday of Veterans Day, as \n     proclaimed by the President and observed by the Federal \n     Government or on the weekends, may allow election day to be a \n     national holiday without adding the cost and administrative \n     burden of an additional holiday.\n       (3) Holding elections on a holiday or weekend could allow \n     more working people to vote more easily, potentially \n     increasing voter turnout. It could increase the pool of \n     available poll workers and make public buildings more \n     available for use as polling places. Holding elections over a \n     weekend could provide flexibility needed for uniform polling \n     hours.\n       (4) Several proposals to make election day a holiday or to \n     shift election day to a weekend have been offered in the \n     107th Congress. Any new voting day options should be \n     sensitive to the religious observances of voters of all \n     faiths and to our Nation's veterans.\n\n     SEC. 512.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CHANGES MADE TO THE \n                   ELECTORAL PROCESS AND HOW SUCH CHANGES IMPACT \n                   STATES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the provisions of this Act shall not prohibit States to \n     use curbside voting as a last resort to satisfy the voter \n     accessibility requirements under section 101(a)(3);\n       (2) the provisions of this Act permit States--\n       (A) to use Federal funds to purchase new voting machines; \n     and\n       (B) to elect to retrofit existing voting machines in lieu \n     of purchasing new machines to meet the voting machine \n     accessibility requirements under section 101(a)(3);\n       (3) nothing in this Act requires States to replace existing \n     voting machines;\n       (4) nothing under section 101(a) of this Act specifically \n     requires States to install wheelchair ramps or pave parking \n     lots at each polling location for the accessibility needs of \n     individuals with disabilities; and\n       (5) the Election Administration Commission, the Attorney \n     General, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers \n     Compliance Board should recognize the differences that exist \n     between urban and rural areas with respect to the \n     administration of Federal elections under this Act.\n\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``An Act to require States \n     and localities to meet uniform and nondiscriminatory election \n     technology and administration requirements applicable to \n     Federal elections, to establish grant programs to provide \n     assistance to States and localities to meet those \n     requirements and to improve election technology and the \n     administration of Federal elections, to establish the \n     Election Administration Commission, and for other \n     purposes.''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n20 minutes on the energy bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator may proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/11/senate-section/article/S2556-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2556-S2571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL LABORATORIES PARTNERSHIP IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the much needed \nenergy security legislation that is before the Senate.\n  This week, at the very moment we debate this very important landmark \nlegislation, we are seeing a confluence of factors in our energy supply \nand demand that amounts to what one might call the ``perfect storm.''\n  There have been few other times in the history of our nation where we \nhave seen such a stark demonstration that our national security \ninterests are synonymous with our energy security. And here are--in \nthis ``perfect storm''--the various storm fronts that are coming \ntogether and colliding to produce some very ominous results for the \nAmerican people, their families, and small businesses.\n  The travel season is heading into its annual peak as more and more \nAmericans hit the road, and those numbers are higher than usual because \nof people's fear of flying or the aggravation, the stress of commercial \nair travel due to security concerns and desires.\n  Refineries are also beginning their annual changeover from winter \nfuels to specially formulated, cleaner burning summer fuels that cost \nmore to produce. Those increased costs at refineries, that are already \nrunning at near capacity, will be passed on to the American consumer.\n  In recent weeks, the Israelis have taken strong action to defend \nthemselves from the escalating growth of heinous suicide bombings in \nIsrael.\n  In response to all of this, the dictator of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, has \npledged to embargo Iraq's oil exports for 30 days or until Israel \nwithdraws from Palestinian territories.\n  The Associated Press quoted Saddam as saying:\n\n       The oppressive Zionist and American enemy has belittled the \n     capabilities of the [Arab] nation.\n\n  Combine all of these factors together, and the price of gasoline has \nincreased about 25 cents a gallon in just the last few weeks. This is \nthe sharpest increase in a 4-week period since the year 1990, right \nbefore the gulf war.\n  The price of a barrel of oil has risen to about $26 a barrel as of \nyesterday, and many projections indicate the price will spike to more \nthan $30 a barrel.\n  The problem is one of basic economics that a fourth grade student in \nVirginia would understand, or as the Presiding Officer would certainly \nagree, a fourth grade student in West Virginia\n\n[[Page S2557]]\n\nas well. I hope that the Senate also understands this very basic, \nsimple matter of high demand and inadequate supply. Even as the demand \nfor oil is rising, supply is constrained this year because the nations \nin OPEC have cut production since the end of the year 2000 by a total \nof about 5 million barrels of oil per day.\n  The result is financial hardship for families and enterprises that \npay more out of pocket for their basic transportation needs. It is a \nloaded weapon aimed at our economy, which appears to be moving slowly \non the road to recovery.\n  I wholeheartedly support a balanced energy policy, including \nconservation and new, advanced technologies, such as hydrogen-fuel-\ncell-powered vehicles, electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles, and clean \ncoal technology. We are the ``Saudi Arabia of coal.'' I know the Chair \nshares my desire in working for clean coal technologies--and also solar \nphotovoltaic technology.\n  But at the same time, we must increase our American-based production \nto become less reliant and dependent on foreign sources of oil.\n  Rising tensions in the Middle East will further increase our prices \nat the gas pump, damage job opportunities, and take more money from \nworking people. This increased cost in fuel will ultimately cause an \nincrease in the cost of goods and products, 95 percent of which come by \ntruck to some store or directly to your home.\n  Please be aware that the United States continues to import nearly 1 \nmillion barrels a day from Saddam Hussein. This is the same man who \nturns around and compensates the families of suicide bombers at a rate \nof $25,000. You could say that the compensation for 1 murderer is \nequivalent to about 900 barrels of oil that the United States and other \nnations buy from Saddam Hussein. We can no longer afford to let Saddam \nHussein quite literally put us over the barrel.\n\n  At a time when Iraq is calling for an OPEC embargo on oil sales to \nAmerica, environmentally safe production in a small and desolate place \non the barren Arctic Plain on the North Slope of Alaska could alone \nreplace more than 35 years of Iraqi oil imports. The potential is \nenormous for large oil reserves relatively near that of the current \nproduction at Prudhoe Bay--about 16 billion barrels. Conservative \nestimates state that ANWR has more oil than all of Texas.\n  I read that the Senator from Connecticut yesterday said it would take \n10 years to get oil flowing from the North Slope of Alaska and this \nANWR area. Let's assume it would take 10 years. Maybe this decision \nshould have been made 10 years ago. Indeed, this Senate, in 1995, as \nwell as the House, passed exploration permission legislation in 1995. \nUnfortunately, that legislation and that permission to explore ANWR was \nvetoed by the President in 1995. If that had not been vetoed, that oil \nwould be flowing and we would not have as great a dependence on foreign \noil, much less Saddam Hussein.\n  Also, there are groups of opponents. Many of those groups were also \nthe opponents who were against the Prudhoe Bay production several \ndecades ago. Thank goodness, reason and security prevailed and we are \ngetting oil through the pipeline from Prudhoe Bay.\n  The reality is, with the infrastructure and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline \nless than about 50 miles away, just a few years of work are needed to \nget oil flowing from ANWR. The pipeline is already built. We just need \nto get that 50 mile span built from Prudhoe Bay to the exploration site \nat ANWR. It is not quite the magnitude of a project back in the 1970s.\n  The amount of oil we will be getting from there is about the same as \nwhat we could replace from 30 years of Saudi Arabian imports. And on \ntop of it all, there are estimates--I will admit this is on the high \nside--of the creation of as many as 735,000 new jobs. The estimated oil \nat ANWR is valued at more than $300 billion, which could replace a \nlarge portion of foreign oil imports and clearly create hundreds of \nthousands of jobs for our economy.\n  Again, the North Slope of Alaska, the Arctic Plain, or ANWR, is not \nsome mountainous, beautiful sanctuary. It is a flat, barren, cold, \ninhospitable place, and the small local population nearby is virtually \nunanimous in its desire to see the utilization of the resources beneath \nthat frozen tundra. As it is very nearby, and similar to Prudhoe Bay, \nand as has been seen from studies, there will be no adverse impact on \ncaribou or mosquitoes, which are plentiful in the summer, or other \nflora and fauna.\n  I support environmentally responsible exploration and production at \nANWR to help at least ameliorate our dependence on OPEC. The \nannouncement of curtailed exports by Iraq should remind us more than \never that our economy and national security will remain bound together \nas long as we allow tyrants and despots to control our destiny.\n  In addition to the Middle East, the political dispute in Venezuela \nhas left their oil industry crippled as labor groups have staged a \nnationwide strike.\n  Simply put, we are entirely too dependent on foreign oil and we must \nexpand our domestic production. We must also improve our energy \nsecurity by identifying and developing new energy opportunities. \nDiversification of energy supplies is basic to our comprehensive \nnational energy policy. We should encourage new, cooperative trade \narrangements and new resources in willing prospects throughout the \nworld.\n\n  All of these initiatives, discussions, and cooperative efforts are \naimed at fulfilling just one part of our national energy policy, which \nis the diversification of our international sources of supply.\n  A commonsense, comprehensive, long-term energy plan will get us off \nthis roller coaster of restrictive supply and demand that we have \nridden for the past several decades. We must not allow the Saddam \nHusseins of the world to jerk us around and actually run that roller \ncoaster.\n  President Bush's energy plan is comprehensive. It combines \nconservation and incentives for the development of alternative energy \nsources. I look forward to voting for tax incentives for alternative-\nfueled vehicles. It also includes increased domestic production. An \nenergy policy without all of these components will not be effective.\n  We have a responsibility to the American people to address these \nchallenges head on. If you think the situation is dire today, take a \nlook just a short time from now into the future. Over the next 20 \nyears, U.S. oil consumption is projected to increase by 33 percent and \ndemand for electricity is projected to increase by 45 percent. Our \ndependence on foreign sources of oil will grow from 55 percent today to \n64 percent by the year 2020. This compares to just 42 percent from \nforeign sources less than 10 years ago.\n  Clearly, we can see that something must be done, and soon. I am \ncommitted to working for commonsense solutions based upon sound science \nand the best available technologies so that all Americans can have \naffordable, reliable access to energy to fuel our motor vehicles, our \nhomes, our farm operations, and our business operations across America.\n  I am also committed to making fuller use of the resources we have \nwithin our own borders in States that are supportive. While there may \nbe oil off the coast of California, the people of California are \nopposed to oil development off their coast. Therefore, I respect their \ndesires and would not support oil exploration off California.\n  In Alaska, Republicans, Democrats, Eskimos, Indians, all people are \noverwhelmingly in favor of production in ANWR.\n  There are other groups that support production on the North Slope of \nAlaska--groups such as the Vietnam Veterans Institute. I quote from \nthem:\n\n       War and international terrorism have again brought into \n     sharp focus the heavy reliance of the U.S. on imported oil. \n     During these times of crises, such reliance threatens our \n     national security and economic well-being. . . . It is \n     important that we develop domestic sources of oil.\n\n  Organized labor. This is from Jerry Hood of the International \nBrotherhood of Teamsters:\n\n       America has gone too long without a solid energy plan. When \n     energy costs rise, working families are the first to feel the \n     pinch. The Senate should follow the example passed by the \n     House and ease the burden by sending the President supply-\n     based energy legislation to sign.\n\n  The Hispanic community. I quote from Mario Rodriguez, president of \nthe United States-Mexico Chamber of Commerce:\n\n\n[[Page S2558]]\n\n\n       We urge the Senate leadership to pass comprehensive energy \n     legislation. This is not a partisan issue. Millions of needy \n     Hispanic families need your support now.\n\n  From Jewish organizations, Mort Zuckerman, chairman of the Conference \nof Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations:\n\n       The [Conference] at its general meeting on November 14th \n     unanimously supported a resolution calling on Congress to act \n     expeditiously to pass the energy bill that will serve to \n     lessen our dependence on foreign sources of oil.\n\n  African-American groups. Harry Alford, chairman of the National Black \nChamber of Commerce, states:\n\n       Our growing membership reflects the opinion of more and \n     more Americans all across the political spectrum that we must \n     act now to end our dependence on foreign energy sources by \n     addressing the nation's long-neglected energy needs.\n\n  And Bruce Josten of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce stated:\n\n       The events of September 11 lend a new urgency to our \n     efforts to increase domestic energy supplies and modernize \n     our nation's energy infrastructure.\n\n  The point of all this is that it has broad, bipartisan support across \nthe country, not just in Alaska. I also add that this is not simply a \nmatter of our economic security our physical security is also at stake.\n  I challenge my colleagues to join Americans in this effort. Let's \nmake America the most technologically advanced nation in the world for \nnew sources of energy to propel our motor vehicles and to provide \nclean, efficient electricity. Let's also make sure we are less \ndependent upon unpredictable and, in some cases, threatening foreign \nsources of oil. Let's control our own destiny more than we have in the \npast. Let's move forward united for America's bright future.\n  Thank you Mr. President and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair heard a clap from the gallery. Those \nhere now, or at any time in the future, if that occurs again, they will \nbe removed by the Sergeant at Arms under the rules of the Senate. That \nis not allowed and will not be tolerated.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3114\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak for up to 15 minutes in conjunction with my opposition to the \nFeinstein amendment, which has been introduced on the energy bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, this amendment and other \nCalifornia amendments are outside the agreement and would negatively \nimpact the renewable fuels standard contained in the bill. While I \ngenerally respect and certainly admire my colleagues from California, \nwho are joined by my colleagues from New York in this particular \nsituation, I must depart from their point of view and take this \nopportunity to explain that the facts do not support their amendment.\n  The renewable fuels standard is the culmination of 20 years of sound \npublic policy. We have all worked at the State, local, and Federal \nlevels to make sure we have brought together the best kind of public \npolicy for energy as it relates to renewable fuels. This standard will \nalmost triple production of biofuels over the next 10 years. The RFS, \nas it is known, will accelerate the biorefinery concept so that a wide \nrange of cellulosic biomass feedstocks will cost-effectively be \nconverted into biofuels, bioelectricity, and biochemicals.\n  Enactment of the RFS, along with other provisions in this bill, will \nemphasize new sources of energy production from biomass to wind power, \nas well as conservation, to further reduce our dependence upon foreign \nsources of energy. As the previous speaker, my colleague, Senator \nAllen, pointed out, this 100-year-old reliance on fossil fuels and on \nfuels from unstable parts of the world has put us in a position \nof instability. So this RFS is essential in helping us reverse this \n100-year-old reliance on fossil fuels and on unstable governments. \nEnactment of this bill will strengthen national and energy security and \nimprove our environment at the same time.\n\n  If you will look at this poster, according to a recent study \nconducted by AUS Consultants, adoption of the RFS will:\n\n       . . . displace 1.6 billion barrels of oil over the next \n     decade; reduce our trade deficit by $34.1 billion; it will \n     increase new investments in rural communities by more than \n     $5.3 billion--and this is all domestic, all money that will \n     inure to the benefit of Americans. It will also boost the \n     demand for feedgrains and soybeans by more than 1.5 billion \n     bushels over the next decade; it will create more than \n     214,000 new jobs throughout the U.S. economy, and it will \n     expand household income by an additional $51.7 billion over \n     the next decade.\n\n  These days, we are witnessing substantial increases in gasoline \nprices at the pump because of disruption and turmoil in the Middle \nEast. Gasoline prices are not going up because we are using ethanol; \nthey are rising because we are not using enough ethanol. Over the next \n10 years, the renewable fuels standard in S. 517 would increase United \nStates gasoline supplies to 5 billion gallons per year in 2012, \nslightly less than the volume of crude oil we currently import from \nIraq. That will come from the addition of these biofuels that will come \nfrom the renewable fuels standard. It will be bad public policy for us \nto eliminate the existing oxygenate standard without replacing it with \nthe renewable fuels standard. That is exactly what S. 517 does.\n  I congratulate California Governor Gray Davis for his support of the \nRFS section of S. 517. He recently declared:\n\n       Let's let the Daschle bill pass, have a nice schedule that \n     will affect the entire country, phase in ethanol and protect \n     the environment.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       All we need to do is use about 250 or 275 million gallons \n     of ethanol, which we already do and are prepared to do in the \n     future.\n\n  Governor Davis recently delayed his ban on MTBE in California for 1 \nyear, coinciding with the initiation of the renewable fuels standard, \nRFS, and his acceptance of that RFS package is the best option to meet \nCalifornia's current and certainly its future gasoline needs. This, in \nlarge part, is due to the fact that a Federal RFG with an MTBE ban \nwould require about 700 million gallons of ethanol annually in \nCalifornia.\n  The next alternative would be a program to eliminate the current \nminimum oxygen standard, a ban on MTBE, and retain the existing \nwintertime carbon monoxide program using ethanol. This would require \nabout 500 million gallons of ethanol annually.\n  In contrast, the Daschle-Lugar-Nelson RFS requires California \nrefiners to use only about 250 million gallons of ethanol annually.\n  Finally, the RFS provision contained in the bill allows ``credit \ntraining,'' which provides the option of reducing California's ethanol \nuse to zero, with a cost of less than 2 cents per gallon.\n  Lest anyone thinks this is somehow a plan or decision by the States \nin the Midwest to support their own economies to the detriment of \neconomies elsewhere, Governor Pataki from New York, and Governor \nShaheen of New Hampshire, representing the Northeast States for \nCoordinated Air Use Management, and other Governors belonging to the \nGovernors' Ethanol Coalition, have also signed a joint letter \nsupporting the renewable fuels standards. These are Governors from all \nover the country.\n  I also remind my colleagues that the RFS agreement was unprecedented \nin that it was accepted through the extensive and cooperative work of \nthe ethanol and biodiesel industries, their associations, most farm and \nagricultural groups, the environmental and renewable energy \ncommunities, and the American Petroleum Institute.\n  All of us, each and every one of us, is aware of how dangerously \nclose we are to an overdependence on imported oil. As Senator Allen \nsaid, currently we are over 56 percent dependent on foreign sources, \nand it will rise to over 60 percent in the very near future.\n  Too many of these supplies come from troubled nations in the Middle \nEast, the Caspian Basin, and Indonesia where almost 80 percent of the \nworld's reserves are located.\n  As our colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, warned recently, \nwe must recognize this vulnerability because it also extends to the \npotential of terrorist attacks on oil supply lines. An attack on our \noil supply lines anywhere in the world would have us on our backs \novernight.\n  The RFS is critical to the process of reducing our dependence on oil \nimports\n\n[[Page S2559]]\n\nthrough the advancement of domestically dispersed renewable and \nenvironmentally benign technologies that will generate new industries, \nhigh-quality jobs, economic activity, and rural development, while at \nthe same time expanding national and local tax bases. This is, in fact, \na win-win for everyone in America.\n  Ethanol opponents claim that it takes more energy to make ethanol \nthan is contained in the fuel. This is simply not the case. The most \nrecent USDA report shows an increase in the net energy balance of corn \nethanol from 1.24 in 1995 to 1.34 in 2002, and that new technologies \ncontinue that improvement. Furthermore, only 17 percent of the energy \nthat goes into farming and ethanol plant operations is from liquid \nfuels, and with the advent of biodiesel and advanced farming practices, \nthis number continues to drop and will continue to do so into the \nfuture.\n  Some opponents also claim that the price of gasoline could double. \nThe issue of consumer cost is clearly important to all sectors of our \nNation, certainly to the Midwest as well as to the West and the East. \nBut historically, ethanol serves as a buffer to higher prices. It does \nso by actually extending supplies. It provides an alternative to costly \nimported oil and leverage for independent gasoline marketers to compete \nagainst the larger, more powerful integrated oil companies.\n  According to the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of \nAmerica:\n\n       The Federal benefits afforded ethanol-blended fuels have \n     been an important pro-competitive influence on the Nation's \n     gasoline markets. By enhancing the ability of independent \n     marketers to price compete with their integrated oil company \n     competitors, this program has increased independent \n     marketers' economic viability and reduced consumers' costs of \n     gasoline.\n\n  On April 8 in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and the New York \nmetropolitan areas, the price of ethanol-blended premium midgrade and \nregular ranged from .0133 to .0327 cents per gallon. So availability is \nnot going to be a problem and neither is price.\n  Today and into the near future, ethanol will be in abundant supply \nbecause of market conditions and all the new plants that will be coming \nonline.\n  This chart shows the past, present, and predicted growth of the \nethanol capacity, and one can see that as it goes into this new \ncentury, the incline is rather steep. Some worry about ADM's control \nover the market and their ability to control prices, but their \ninfluence is dissipating, being replaced by farmer, rancher, and \ncommunity-owned plants. It is not concentrated within only one industry \nor within one producer. It is widely spread out over all kinds of \noperations, from the small to the medium size to the large.\n  To attack some other myths, there are some claims that ethanol does \nnot contribute to cleaner air, and that is not true. There is no \nquestion that ethanol blends reduce carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, \nbut most areas with polluted air are worried about ozone.\n\n  The good news is that 3 years of clean air quality data in the \nChicago/Milwaukee area show that it is possible to effectively reduce \nozone emissions while using ethanol blends. These blends also reduce \nair toxins, such as the carcinogen benzene.\n  The defeat of the renewable fuels standard in S. 517 would be a great \nloss to the national energy and economic security of the United States. \nThe real tragedy would be a further loss to the Europeans as they \nadvance their biorefinery technology to produce biofuels, \nbioelectricity, and biochemicals from a wide range of biomass, \nincluding much of which is wasted or ends up in landfills.\n  If there is a myth that somehow this is going to simply affect our \nfood supply by providing alternative use, it is very clear to \nunderstand that ethanol can be made from any kind of biomass, including \nthat which is waste, that which is garbage, that which is discarded and \nends up in landfills.\n  As technology continues to increase, we will have more and more \nsources for a renewable resource that will come from those production \nsources that currently have other means of disposal. Unfortunately, \nsome of them are disposed only in landfills.\n  The RFS provides a credit of 1.5 for biofuels made from cellulosic \nbiomass, oilseeds, tallow, animal fat, and yellow grease compared to 1 \ncredit for ethanol made from starch and sugar crops; that is, every \ngallon of these fuels is equal to 1.5 gallons in meeting the renewable \nfuels standards. In fact, it does go to other kinds of biomass. \nConsequently, the RFS will provide the stimulus and the market for \nbiofuels needed to produce the next generation of biorefineries.\n  In the past, it has always been the question of how you can create \nthe demand or whether you create the supply and hope, in fact, it will \ncreate the demand. This bill with the RFS in it creates both the demand \nand the opportunity and the incentive for more supplies in a cost-\neffective and a very environmentally friendly and very economic \nfriendly manner.\n  During my two terms as Governor, I watched firsthand as the private \nsector invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new community-based \nethanol plants. We went from one operating plant to more than seven \nwhen I left, and there continues to be more plants built around the \nState and a great deal of interest in further expanding the plants, \ndepending on the passage of S. 517.\n  These investments occurred primarily in response to the demand \ncreated by the Clean Air Act's oxygenate requirements. Not one of those \nplants is owned by AD in Nebraska. Farmers and ranchers own most of \nthem.\n  The ethanol industry in Nebraska has been one of the few bright spots \nin an otherwise underperforming agricultural economy, thereby creating \nquality jobs, increasing farm income, and, in some instances, maybe \nproviding the only farm income by adding value to farmers' products and \nexpanding local tax bases.\n  This is, in fact, sound public policy, and we should be doing more, \nnot less, of it. If we are going to eliminate the oxygen requirement \nthat has been proposed, then we must be sure to put in its place the \nrenewable fuels standard in S. 517. The RFS is sound public policy. The \nprovision will increase gasoline supplies and consequently serve to \nlower gasoline prices. It will have a positive impact on the Farm Belt \neconomy and also reduce energy costs for other areas of the country. \nThis is truly a national plan to control costs, spur economic activity, \nand reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote to preserve the historic agreement \nmanifested in the RFS. To do otherwise will certainly face us in the \nwrong direction, a step backwards, into deeper dependence on imported \noil.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. If I still have time left, I am happy to use \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, earlier today, my colleagues \nfrom California and New York quoted extensively from an Energy \nInformation Agency report which they said indicated the RFS would \nresult in gasoline price increases from 4 cents to almost 10 cents per \ngallon.\n  We have read this report, and it is difficult for us to understand \nhow they arrived at those cost figures when our reading of the report \nsets the increase at prices up to 1 cent per gallon for reformulated \ngasoline and up to a half a cent per gallon compared to the referenced \ncase. This is with the reformulated fuel standard without the MTBE ban.\n  When there is an MTBE ban, there would then be a greater demand for \ngasoline that would drive prices up. The availability of ethanol to add \nvolume as an additive and boost octane would put downward pressure on \nprices, which is what has been shown elsewhere in the country. So we \nare at a loss as to how that was arrived at.\n  There also was a suggestion there might be the possibility that \nethanol-blended gasoline could extend the benzene plume and contaminate \nthe ground water in the event of leaking tanks or spills.\n  Nebraska is the home of ethanol. It was first called gasohol. It has \nbeen\n\n[[Page S2560]]\n\nused extensively for the past 20 years. I have used it for as long as I \ncan recall. There is absolutely no evidence of benzene-contaminated \nwater supplies resulting from the use of ethanol in Nebraska, and we \nare not aware of anywhere else where ethanol has been used extensively \nor even modestly where there has been an increase in benzene.\n  It is going to boost the octane of gasoline, and I think most people \nlooking at science will conclude it permits the reduction of aromatics, \nincluding benzene. We found that ethanol-blended gasoline in Nebraska \nhas considerably less aromatics than unblended gasoline, and we do not \nunderstand nor do we follow the logic or the facts that have been \npresented.\n  I think it is important to consider the fact we must, indeed, reduce \nour reliance on foreign sources of oil, and we must, in fact, expand \nthe opportunity for renewable resources so we are not reliant on \nforeign sources of oil. When we can do this in an environmentally \nfriendly way, and at the same time have the economics of the country \nadvanced, it seems only too sound of logic to conclude we should go the \nother way. We must, in fact, move forward with the RFS.\n  So I call on those who would have other information to return and let \nus debate the issue on the facts as they are.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Levin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the Feinstein amendment \nfor up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, in the wake of September 11, America and the rest of \nthe free world now face dramatic new challenges as certainly evidenced \nby our Secretary of State being in the Middle East today. There are \nserious consequences to these great challenges. Energy independence is \none of these challenges.\n  Today, less than 1 percent of America's transportation fuel comes \nfrom renewable sources. In the energy bill we are debating today \nrenewable fuel would increase to approximately 3 percent of our total \ntransportation fuel supply by 2012.\n  A few weeks ago, the Senate approved the renewable portfolio standard \nfor electricity which mandates that 10 percent of all electricity must \ncome from certain renewable sources. I note that my colleagues from \nCalifornia and New York in particular voted in favor of that renewable \nelectricity mandate which the Department of Energy has estimated will \ncost the ratepayers of America about $88 billion through 2020.\n  I note also that my colleagues from California and New York voted for \na 20-percent renewable electricity standard. Yet, as I heard this \nmorning, they oppose a 3-percent renewable fuel standard. What is the \ndifference between the renewable fuel standard and the renewable \nelectricity standard?\n  Here is the difference.\n  Today, we spend about $300 million per day on foreign oil imports. We \nare nearing 60 percent of the total use of our oil coming from other \nnations. We spend $12 million a day on Iraqi oil alone--we used to. We \ndid until Saddam Hussein announced this week that Iraq would halt its \nexports of oil for a month.\n  With Iraq capping its production, Venezuela imploding, and other \nproducers such as Iran, Libya, and Nigeria sending very troubling \nsignals to the world, America must develop an accountable, responsible, \nrelevant, and workable energy policy that will replace the oil we now \nimport with alternative fuels and renewable fuels produced here in the \nUnited States.\n  Despite the regional differences that sometimes arise, this renewable \nfuel standard is good for all America. That has been highlighted by the \nfact that this standard has broad bipartisan support in the Congress. \nIt has been endorsed by a majority of Governors, Democrat and \nRepublican; the Bush administration; agricultural and environmental \ngroups; and the oil and gas industry.\n  Consider that this standard would replace 66 billion gallons--1.6 \nbillion barrels--of foreign crude oil by 2012. It would reduce the U.S. \ntrade deficit by as much as $34 billion.\n  The renewable fuel standard in the energy bill we debate today would \nalso bring a needed boost to our economy. This single provision would \ncreate 214,000 jobs nationwide--not in the Midwest but nationwide. It \nwould create $5.3 billion in new investment nationwide. It would \nincrease household income by $52 billion nationwide. It would increase \nnet farm income by $6.6 billion a year, reducing the amount spent on \nthe farm price support program that we are now debating in a conference \ncommittee, trying to resolve the differences between the House and \nSenate agriculture bills. Unfortunately, since this landmark agreement \nwas announced, the opponents of renewable fuels have distorted facts \nand tried to undermine our bipartisan compromise.\n\n  My colleagues from California and New York stated this morning that \nthe renewable fuel standard would result in substantially higher prices \nat the gas pump. However, they fail to mention that the report by the \nEnergy Information Administration at the Department of Energy stated \nthat over 90 percent of any increased costs would come from the \nphaseout of MTBE.\n  They also failed to note that the recent reports by the Energy \nInformation Administration and the GAO did not take into account the \nimportant fact that 13 States have already banned the use of MTBE. The \nfact is, any increased cost at the pump would be very minimal at most--\nperhaps a half cent a gallon--if there is an increased cost.\n  This standard does not require a single gallon of renewable fuel be \nused in any particular State or region. The additional flexibility \nprovided by the credit trading provisions will result in much lower \ncost to refiners, and thus, to consumers. Renewable fuels will be used \nwhere they are most cost effective.\n  Others claim since renewable fuels are largely produced in the \nMidwest, this standard will require substantial investments in \nincreased transportation costs. Again, not true. Ethanol has already \ntransported cost effectively from coast to coast via barge and railcar. \nAn analysis completed in January by the Department of Energy concluded \nthat no major infrastructure barriers exist to expanding the U.S. \nethanol industry to 5.1 billion gallons per year, which is comparable \nto the renewable fuel standard in the energy bill.\n  I also would like to point out that it is 7,666 miles direct from \nBaghdad to Los Angeles. It is 1,150 miles from Hastings, NE--home of \ntwo ethanol plants--to Los Angeles. If we can transport oil that we pay \nSaddam Hussein for from Iraq to the United States, we can surely \ntransport ethanol across the United States cost effectively and \ncertainly in the best security interests of our country.\n  Some have claimed there are not adequate supplies of renewable fuel \nto meet the demand created by this standard. That is not true. One look \nat the ethanol industry shows that it has been growing substantially in \nrecent years. It has been growing in anticipation of the phaseout of \nMTBE--particularly in California.\n  According to the Renewable Fuels Association, 16 new ethanol plants--\n14 of them farmer-owned cooperatives, not big companies, which I heard \nthis morning as well, not big companies, but individuals, small farmers \nbanding together, small businesspeople banding together to build \ncooperatives--several of these expansions have been completed and new \nones are being built. Thirteen additional plants are now currently \nunder construction.\n  A survey conducted by the California Energy Commission concluded that \nthe ethanol industry will have the capacity to produce 3.5 billion \ngallons a year by the end of 2004, and that capacity could double by \nthe end of 2005. With the standard beginning in 2004 at 2.3 billion \ngallons, that means there will be an adequate amount of renewable fuel \nto provide the additional volume needed.\n  Even with those assurances, we have included in this amendment \nadditional safeguards. If the standard is likely to result in \nsignificant adverse consumer impacts, then the EPA Administrator\n\n[[Page S2561]]\n\nhas the authority to reduce the volumes. Also, upon the petition of a \nState--any State--or by EPA's own determination, the EPA may waive the \nstandard, in whole or in part, if it determines the standard would \nseverely harm the economy or the environment of a State, a region, or \nthe country.\n\n  Even more ludicrous is this claim by some who say the phaseout of \nMTBE will result in a shortage of fuel supplies. That is not true. \nRemember this agreement calls for a 4-year phaseout of MTBE.\n  The large expansion of the renewable fuel industry will easily cover \nthe loss of MTBE, given this 4-year notice. As an example, in \nCalifornia, where polls show that more than 76 percent of the people of \nCalifornia support a ban on MTBE, the fuel industry is ready to make \nthe transition from MTBE to renewable fuel. Why in the world do we \nthink the oil companies agreed to this standard if they thought it \ncould not be met?\n  All six California refiners are ready to use ethanol now, today. Both \nthe ethanol industry and the California refining and transportation \nsystem have spent billions of dollars preparing to use ethanol.\n  I also keep hearing references to ethanol as an untested fuel. \nEthanol has been used across this country successfully for more than 20 \nyears. It is hardly untested. But I also note that the California \nEnvironmental Protection Agency completed a comprehensive analysis of \nethanol's environmental and health impacts, giving it a clean bill of \nhealth, before approving ethanol for use as a replacement to MTBE.\n  Ethanol has helped the Chicago area become the only ozone \nnonattainment area in the country to come into compliance with the \nnational ozone standard. Ethanol has been tested, and it has passed. \nAnd one of the reasons that Chicago has found itself in that unique \nposition is because of its use of ethanol.\n  President Bush has proclaimed the promise of renewable fuels by \nsaying recently:\n\n       Renewable fuels are gentle on the environment, and they are \n     made in America so they cannot be threatened by any foreign \n     power.\n\n  As former President Clinton said during his administration:\n\n       Ethanol production increases farm income, decreases \n     deficiency payments, creates jobs in America, and reduces \n     American reliance on foreign oil.\n\n  Both Presidents Clinton and Bush are absolutely right. This renewable \nfuel standard is good for all of America.\n  I, again, ask my colleagues to support the renewable fuels agreement \nin the Senate energy bill that we debate today. I do oppose any \namendments that would undermine this carefully crafted agreement.\n  In conclusion, before I yield the floor, I wish to respond to a \ncomment I heard this morning from one of my colleagues from New York. I \nbelieve he mentioned something to the effect that an ethanol bill in \nNebraska failed. I am not sure what his point was. But, for the record, \nand for the edification of all who heard that, and especially my \ncolleague, last year the Nebraska Legislature tried to mandate that \nevery gas station--every gas pump--in the State sell an ethanol blend. \nNow, that is a bit different--completely different--if that was the \nparallel attempted to be drawn from this standard, this bipartisan \nstandard that we have agreed to that is currently in the present energy \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for \nhis leadership in opposition to this amendment, and more importantly \nfor his leadership over the last several months in bringing together \nunity on this issue that is both bipartisan as well as across industry \nand economic sectors.\n  Madam President, there was a time when the States of New York and \nCalifornia were represented by Senators who supported requiring the use \nof ethanol and other domestic alternative fuels.\n  In fact, there was a time, less than 3 years ago, when two of the \ncurrent California Senators and the senior Senator from New York, voted \nin favor of replacing MTBE with ethanol.\n  What has changed to cause these Senators to reverse themselves? I \nfrankly don't know.\n  But there is one thing that has changed since the time New York and \nCalifornia were represented by Senators who supported replacing foreign \nfuel with domestic alternative and renewable fuels.\n  Today, more than ever, our national security is at risk because of \nour dependence upon foreign energy.\n  Today, more than ever, the Middle East oil and MTBE producers, have \nus literally, over the barrel.\n  More than ever. That is the biggest change since the time California \nand New York Senators supported replacing Middle East oil and MTBE with \nhome grown renewable and alternative fuels.\n  Yet, today, they come to the floor of the Senate, to offer an \namendment which will help assure that Middle East oil and MTBE \nproducers maintain and increase their grip over the United States.\n  Today, 75 percent of the MTBE California uses, is produced by \nforeigners.\n  Saudi Arabia is the largest supplier of California MTBE.\n  In March of 1999, California's Governor, Gray Davis, issued an \nexecutive order, stating that by the end of 2002, all MTBE would be \nbanned from California.\n  In August of 1999, Senator Boxer of California introduced a Senate \nresolution, calling for MTBE to be replaced by renewable ethanol. With \nthe help of Senator Feinstein and Senator Schumer, that resolution was \nadopted by the Senate. That resolution underscored that renewable \nethanol should replace MTBE. Why? It specifically stated that ethanol \nshould replace MTBE to reduce our dependence upon foreign energy. It \nalso stated that renewable ethanol should replace MTBE because MTBE was \npolluting drinking water.\n\n  Patriotic American farmers and ethanol producers, in direct response \nto these two initiatives by California's elected officials, invested \n$1.4 billion of their hard earned money to increase ethanol production \nby 1 billion gallons a year.\n  By the end of this year, when MTBE was supposed to be banned in \nCalifornia, our Nation's farmers and ethanol producers will be able to \nproduce 400 to 500 million gallons more than is necessary to replace \nall of California's MTBE.\n  The California Energy Commission conducted a survey and concluded \nthat by the end of 2004, U.S. ethanol production capacity will reach \n3.5 billion gallons a year.\n  The renewable fuels standard, which these Senators want to gut, \nrequires only 2.3 billion gallons of ethanol to be used starting in \n2004. So even by the California Energy Commission's admission, the \nUnited States will be producing 1.2 billion gallons above and beyond \nwhat is required under the renewable fuels standard.\n  We are awash in ethanol produced in America's Midwest, yet 3 weeks \nago, the Governor of California announced that MTBE can be used for \nanother whole year. It doesn't make sense. Some elected officials would \nrather force their consumers to use MTBE from the Middle East, instead \nof ethanol from America's Middle West. They can't seriously be worried \nabout motor fuel prices. How can increasing and diversifying your \nsources of energy, increase the price of your product?\n  Today, California has only seven refiners, and its two largest \nsources for MTBE are foreign. In sharp contrast, there are 61 ethanol \nplants in 19 States in the United States--two of which are in \nCalifornia.\n  The California Energy Commission has determined that fuel without \noxygenates, such as MTBE or ethanol, will actually be more expensive.\n  In a recent report, the commission explained and I quote--``non-\noxygenated reformulated alternatives are not necessarily easier to \nproduce (than ethanol RFG), would involve significant capacity loss, \nand would require even more complex logistics.''\n  A recent poll of Californian opinion, conducted by the California \nRenewable Fuels Partnership, found that 76 percent of likely voters \nsupport banning MTBE because we can't afford the pollution caused by \nMTBE. Only 13 percent of those polled thought that it was a bad idea to \nban MTBE because of potential higher gasoline prices.\n  The concerns expressed by opponents of the renewable fuels standard \ndon't stand up to the facts.\n\n[[Page S2562]]\n\n  So it boils down to this: If you want to take a positive step toward \nhelping our Nation become less dependent upon foreign energy and the \nMiddle East and to encourage the development of jobs and family income \nhere in the United States, then join me in defeating this attempt to \ngut the renewable fuels standard.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise today to address the amendment \nintroduced by my colleagues from New York and California to do away \nwith the renewable fuel standard. I think it is important that we \ncorrect some of the misunderstandings, misapprehensions, and \nmisstatements of fact that have gone on in this debate.\n  First, what does the bill do and what does it not do? The fact is \nthat S. 517 does not require that a single gallon of renewable fuels be \nused in any particular State or region. The additional flexibility \nprovided by the RFS credit trading system provisions of S. 517 will \nresult in a much lower cost to refiners and thus to consumers. The \ncredit trading system will ensure that ethanol is used where it is most \neffective.\n  Now, according to one of the leaders in the petroleum industry, \nChevronTexas:\n\n       The free market will not allow a California price \n     differential of 20-30 cents a gallon to be sustained. The \n     market will always find a way to take advantage of a much \n     smaller differential.\n\n  Furthermore, a nationwide Federal MTBE ban provides certainty for \ninvestments and eliminates the greater use of boutique fuels, thereby \nlowering gasoline prices. The continuation of current policy whereby \nStates may ban MTBE without any regard to regional coordination is more \ncostly than a uniform Federal ban.\n  Increasing the use of renewable fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, \ndiversifies our energy infrastructure, making it less vulnerable to \nacts of terrorism and increases the number of available fuel options, \nincreasing competition, and reducing consumer costs of gasoline.\n  A review of the publicly available price information demonstrates \nthat ethanol has been consistently less expensive per gallon in net \ncost to refiners than MTBE for the last 3 years. In fact, the March 4 \nissue of Octane Week quotes MTBE at 89 cents per gallon and ethanol at \njust 60 cents per gallon. Instead of higher prices, ethanol would lower \npump prices. While this is undeniably true in conventional gasoline, it \nis also true in RFG areas. Refiners do incur a small cost per gallon to \nproduce the RFG ethanol blendstocks, but the lower ethanol price more \nthan makes up for the difference. Thus, replacing MTBE with ethanol \nshould lead to reduced, not increased, consumer gasoline prices.\n  In other words, it is not accurate to say that the price in Missouri \nwill rise 5.9 cents per gallon or 4 cents per gallon in Wyoming.\n  My good friend and colleague from New York tells me that in my home \nState of Missouri, gas prices as a result of the RFS will increase by \n5.9 cents per gallon. He went on to tell us all that the increase is \nbased on the unavailability of ethanol, the inability of us to get \nethanol in Missouri.\n  I want to assure the senior Senator from New York that we produce a \nlot of corn in Missouri, and our friends seem to be ignoring all of the \nresidual economic benefits of ethanol use.\n  For example, ethanol production increases personal and business \nincome and results in a net savings to the Federal budget of $3.6 \nbillion annually.\n  Ethanol also adds over $450 million to State tax receipts. Ethanol \nproduction reduces the taxpayer burden for unemployment benefits and \nfarm deficiency payments.\n  When you raise the price of corn by increasing the demand, it cuts \ndown on the amount of payments that are made under existing farm \nprograms to people who raise corn.\n  Ethanol production reduces the unfavorable U.S. trade balance in \nenergy by $2 billion annually.\n  Ethanol production increases net farm income by $4.5 billion, adding \n30 cents to the value of every bushel of corn.\n  Ethanol reduces the consumer cost of gasoline by extending supplies, \nproviding an alternative to more costly imported oil, and leverage for \nindependent gasoline marketers to compete against the larger, more \npowerful, integrated oil companies.\n  A recent study found that doubling ethanol production would create \nnearly 50,000 new jobs, $1.9 billion in economic development, and \nincrease household incomes by $2.5 billion.\n  Some may say: Isn't the ethanol program just corporate welfare? The \nsimple answer is no. The ethanol tax credit is provided to gasoline \nmarketers and oil companies, not ethanol producers, as an incentive to \nblend their gasoline with clean, domestic, renewable ethanol.\n  It is a cost-effective program that actually returns more revenue to \nthe U.S. Treasury than it costs due to the increased wages, taxes, \nreduced unemployment benefits and, most importantly, reduced farm \ndeficiency payments, while at the same time holding down the price of \ngasoline and helping the American farmer.\n  In summary, I encourage those who support the amendment against the \nrenewable fuels standard to come out to the heartland where the \noccupant of the chair and I live to see Nebraska, to see Missouri, and \nsee what the industry is all about. They can learn the benefits of \nethanol, soy diesel, biodiesel, the home-grown renewable fuels to the \nenvironment and to the communities and our economy, particularly our \nrural economy.\n  Come down to my State and see what the Missouri Corn Growers \nAssociation has done to provide value-added opportunities for Missouri \nfarmers. The Missouri Corn Growers Association and the Missouri Corn \nMerchandising Council provided support for two groups of Missouri \nfarmers seeking to add value to their corn production by processing \ncorn into ethanol. In 1994, Golden Triangle Energy of Craig, MO, and \nNortheast Missouri Grain Processors of Macon, MO, organized as new \ngeneration cooperatives.\n  The latter, known as NEMOGP, broke ground for their plant on April \n17, 1999. I was pleased, proud, and excited to be there. It is now \nproducing 22 million gallons of ethanol per year, and they are in the \nprocess of doubling the capacity to make over 40 million gallons.\n  Similarly, the prospects at Craig are also very promising, and other \ngroups of farmers are looking to build ethanol plants and to build soy \ndiesel plants. We are growing it, we are processing it, we are \nproducing it, and we are ready to sell it. It is going to be good for \nour trade balance, for our farmers, for our economy, and for the \nenvironment.\n  I believe when one goes to a station that offers the E85 plan--there \nare 100 of them nationwide: 1 in Kansas City, 2 in St. Louis, 2 in \nJefferson City, MO, and they are expected to have more around the \ncountry. One can find out about the closest station by checking the Web \nsite of the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition. One will find one can \nget good cleaner burning ethanol blended gasoline, and it is available.\n  Before we decide we are going to back off from this very wise, \nmultiple-benefit usage of renewable fuels, come see in the heartland \nwhat a positive deal this is and come see why we in Missouri--I assume \nmy neighbors in States around us--are proud to be using E85 ethanol and \nB20 soy diesel.\n  I yield the floor. I urge my colleagues not to support the amendment. \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those \nwho support the ethanol provisions in this legislation. Ethanol is one \nof our most promising renewable resources. By blending ethanol with \ngasoline, we can reduce oil imports and reduce the environmental damage \nof vehicle emissions.\n\n[[Page S2563]]\n\n  As America struggles to meet its growing energy needs, ethanol \nprovides extraordinary opportunities. The product is made from corn. It \ncan be produced in abundance, unlike other fossil fuels.\n  The more ethanol we use to fuel our cars and trucks, the less oil we \nneed to import from hostile countries such as Iraq. Rather than looking \nto the Mideast for energy, we would be far better served to look to the \nMidwest.\n  This legislation lays out a plan for increasing the amount of ethanol \nAmericans use to meet their transportation fuel needs.\n  I find it absurd that some claim these provisions are included in \nthis bill simply for the benefit of ethanol producers. Ethanol is an \nenvironmentally safe and economically efficient way to reduce our \ndependence on foreign sources of oil.\n  In short, additional use of ethanol to meet our needs for \ntransportation fuel will be good for our environment, good for our \neconomy, and good for our national security interests. Not only do I \nsupport the renewable fuels standard we are debating today, I look \nforward to supporting an amendment that will be offered by the Finance \nCommittee. That amendment incorporates several aspects of legislation \nthat I introduced last year.\n  Specifically, it will expand eligibility for the tax credit available \nto small producers of ethanol. These changes will ensure that farmer-\nowned cooperatives are eligible to receive a tax credit. It will also \nencourage small producers to expand the size of their operation to meet \nincreased demand. These changes will help us meet the demand for \nethanol envisioned by the bill.\n  Ethanol is truly a win-win solution to our energy needs. The \nincreased use required by this legislation represents a positive step, \none for our farmers, for our environment, and for our energy \nindependence. I support the compromise in this bill that will lead to \nincreased uses of ethanol, and I urge my colleagues to support it as \nwell. The renewable fuels standard included in this bill is an \nimportant part of a balanced energy policy that we need.\n\n\n                    Transport of Spent Nuclear Fuel\n\n  Mr. President, on a separate topic, I would like to discuss an \namendment I will be offering next week. Two years ago, the Department \nof Energy proposed to send a shipment of foreign spent nuclear fuel \nthrough Missouri. The route selected went through the heavily populated \nareas of St. Louis, Columbia, and Kansas City, along a major highway, \nInterstate 70, that was undergoing major repairs. Governor Carnahan \nintervened, and an alternate, more rural route was selected. The \nshipment was completed without incident.\n  Then last year, Missouri was asked to accept another shipment through \nthe State. Governor Holden raised the same objections that had been \ndiscussed the year earlier. And after he did, a curious thing happened: \nThe Department of Energy held up shipments from a reactor inside \nMissouri. This reactor produced isotopes used in cancer treatment. If \nthese shipments did not go forward as scheduled, the reactor would have \nto be closed, halting production of needed medicines for bone cancer \npatients.\n  I insisted these two matters--the shipments from the reactor in \nMissouri and the transport of spent nuclear fuel through the State--be \ndelinked, and they were.\n  Eventually, Governor Holden worked out a safety protocol with the \nDepartment and the foreign spent fuel shipment went forward. Although \nthe shipment was completed, we encountered some problems with the \ntiming of its passage through Missouri.\n  Our experience in Missouri over the past 2 years suggests the \nDepartment of Energy's route selection process deserves careful study. \nHow we deal with spent nuclear fuel in this country may be a matter of \ngreat controversy, but regardless of one's position on this topic, \neveryone ought to be able to agree that when spent fuel has to be \ntransported we want it to be done in the safest possible way.\n  One of the key components in ensuring safe transport of spent fuel is \nthe process for selecting the safest route. My amendment would \ncommission the National Academy of Sciences study of the Department of \nEnergy's route selection process for shipments of spent nuclear fuel. \nThe National Academy would examine the way DOE picks potential routes, \nthe factors it uses to evaluate the safety of these routes, including \ntraffic and accident data, the quality of roads and the proximity to \npopulation centers and venues where people congregate, and the process \nit uses to compare the risks associated with each route.\n  There are a number of reasons why it makes sense to commission this \nstudy now. First, the responsibility for this program is divided among \nmultiple agencies. The Department of Transportation sets the \nregulations for transportation of spent nuclear fuel. The Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission has oversight responsibility and the Department \nof Energy makes the final decision in consultation with these \norganizations.\n  A study will help ensure these agencies are working together and are \nproperly performing their function.\n  Secondly, these agencies are using regulations drafted in the 1990s. \nThe devastating events of September 11 have taught us we have to \nrethink all of our security procedures, and while I understand the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission has issued some additional guidelines \nsince that date, I believe a complete review is in order and an NSA \nstudy will help us ensure that our agencies are focused on the \nappropriate safety factors.\n  Finally, Congress will be considering a highway bill next year. If \nthere are safety problems on routes that are likely to be used for \ncross-country shipments of spent nuclear fuel, we ought to address them \nin the highway bill. We need to start the study now, however, if we \nwant to have the information in time for a debate on the highway bill.\n  This amendment is not intended to take sides on the controversial \nissue that will soon be before this Senate. Its purpose is to get a \nneutral, nonpartisan review of an important public safety function that \nhas received very little scrutiny.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3094, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the pending business be an amendment \noffered yesterday by Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I send a modification to the desk on behalf of Senator \nDurbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3094), as modified, is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a Consumer Energy Commission to assess and \n    provide recommendations regarding energy price spikes from the \n                       perspective of consumers)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title XVII, insert:\n\n     SEC. 1704. CONSUMER ENERGY COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Commission.--There is established a \n     commission to be known as the ``Consumer Energy Commission''.\n       (b) Membership.--\n       (1) In general.--The Commission shall be comprised of 11 \n     members who shall be appointed within 30 days from the date \n     of enactment of this section and who shall serve for the life \n     of the commission.\n       (2) Appointments in the senate and the house.--The majority \n     leader and the minority leader of the Senate and the Speaker \n     and minority leader of the House of Representatives shall \n     each appoint 2 members--\n       (A) 1 of whom shall represent consumer groups focusing on \n     energy issues; and\n       (B) 1 of whom shall represent the energy industry.\n       (3) Appointments by the president.--The President shall \n     appoint 3 members--\n       (A) 1 of whom shall represent consumer groups focusing on \n     energy issues;\n       (B) 1 of whom shall represent the energy industry; and\n       (C) 1 of whom shall represent the Department of Energy.\n       (c) Initial Meeting.--Not later than 60 days after the date \n     of enactment of the Act, the Commission shall hold the first \n     meeting of the Commission regardless of the number of members \n     that have been appointed and shall select a Chairperson and \n     Vice Chairperson from among the members of the Commission.\n       (d) Administrative Expenses.--Members of the Commission \n     shall serve without compensation, except for a per diem and \n     travel\n\n[[Page S2564]]\n\n     expenses which shall be reimbursed, and the Department of \n     Energy shall pay expenses as necessary to carry out this \n     section, with the expenses not to exceed $400,000.\n       (e) Study.--The Commission shall conduct a nationwide study \n     of significant price spikes since 1990 in major United States \n     consumer energy products, including electricity, gasoline, \n     home heating oil, natural gas and propane with a focus on \n     their causes including insufficient inventories, supply \n     disruptions, refinery capacity limits, insufficient \n     infrastructure, regulatory failures, demand growth, reliance \n     on imported supplies, insufficient availability of \n     alternative energy sources, abuse of market power, market \n     concentration and any other relevant factors.\n       (f) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     first meeting of the Commissions, the Commission shall submit \n     to Congress a report that contains the findings and \n     conclusions of the Commission; and recommendations for \n     legislation, administrative actions, and voluntary actions by \n     industry and consumers to protect consumers and small \n     businesses from future price spikes in consumer energy \n     products.\n       (g) Consultation.--The Commission shall consult with the \n     Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission, the Department of Energy and other Federal and \n     State agencies as appropriate.\n       (h) Sunset.--The Commission shall terminate within 30 days \n     after the submission of the report to Congress.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on or in \nrelation to this amendment at 3:45, with the time prior to that time \nequally divided, and there be no amendments in order prior to that \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the floor to the majority leader.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 3525 and ANWR\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am waiting to propound a unanimous \nconsent request having to do with border security. I will not do that, \nof course, until the Republican leader returns.\n  My preference, as I said before on several occasions, and Senator \nLott has said, is that we take up the ANWR amendment. We have even said \nwe are prepared to offer it ourselves in order to move this process \nalong. I am told the sponsors of the amendment still are not prepared \nto offer this amendment. So I have no choice, under these \ncircumstances, as much as I would like very much to be on it right now, \nbut to postpone consideration of the ANWR amendment and to make the \nmost of what time we have available to us.\n  I have consulted with the distinguished Republican leader. I know the \nadministration believes, as we do, to move the border security \nlegislation along is something in everyone's interest.\n  The House has passed a bill. It is my hope that we can pass the \nborder security bill as well. The House has passed two different \nversions of border security, one involving the so-called 245(i) \nprovisions, and one without those provisions included. What we are \ndoing this afternoon would be to take up a bill that does not include \n245(i), but I have indicated publicly, and indicated to Senator Lott \nand to my colleagues, that it is my desire to bring up the 245(i) \nprovisions.\n  I know there is opposition--I am told on both sides of the aisle. But \nwe must address the issue. It is an important issue. It is one that \nshould be resolved. It is one on which the Senate has acted on several \nother occasions. So there will come a time when we will do that.\n\n  But in order to at least pass those pieces of border security that we \nall agree on, I will ask unanimous consent the Judiciary Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of H.R. 3525, the border security \nbill, and that the Senate proceed to its consideration on Friday, April \n12, at 11:30, and that no call for the regular order serve to replace \nthe bill; and that, upon resumption of the energy bill, S. 557, Senator \nMurkowski be recognized to offer his ANWR amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if Senator Daschle will yield, I did not \nobject because I think, all things considered, this is a good way to \nproceed at this time.\n  I, too, would prefer we go ahead and begin consideration of the ANWR \namendment with regard to oil exploration in that area of Alaska. But we \nhave other amendments that are pending. Work has continued to be done \non those issues this afternoon and perhaps, I assume, some in the \nmorning, even while a process is worked out as to exactly how to \nproceed with the ANWR amendment.\n  One of the problems I understand--it is a legitimate one--is that the \namendment Senator Murkowski would like to offer has some provisions \nthat need to have some scoring done. I think that is legitimate. They \nwant to know what it might cost. I think Members are entitled to know \nthat. I presume he could have offered the amendment and had the scoring \ndone over the weekend, but I think both sides were a little bit \nhesitant to have it offered and just have it kind of hanging out there, \nnot knowing what the final form would be--whether, if it would be \nmodified, we would get into a fuss over second-degree amendments. So I \nthink this is a good way to go. Hopefully, we will be ready to go back \nto this on Tuesday, deal with the ANWR provisions, deal with the tax \nprovisions, and finish the amendments we have remaining. I still think \nit is absolutely essential for our country that we get an energy bill.\n  I understand there is a need to complete our work next week on that \nissue so we can move on to other issues. We are pressing Senator \nDaschle to take up other issues, including this border security and the \n245(i) immigration issue and the trade legislation--other issues.\n  By doing it this way, we can dispose of a bill that is needed. Border \nsecurity needs to be dealt with. It has bipartisan support. The \nadministration supports it. We can do that by taking it up tomorrow, \nbeing on it Monday, and I hope we can be done with it sometime early on \nTuesday, and then go back to ANWR.\n  I have checked this out with the sponsors of the border security bill \nand with Senator Murkowski and it seems this is agreeable to all \nparties and this is the way we can get some work done while we work out \nthe process on the other amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their \ncooperation in the effort to move this legislation along. As I say, my \nchoice would have been to have completed our work on ANWR already. We \nhave now been on the bill about a month. We have been on it 20 \nlegislative days, but over a month of calendar days.\n  There is no reason why we should continue to wait for an amendment \nthat I thought might have been the first out of the box.\n  Having said that, I urge my colleagues to come down to the floor. We \nare about to have a vote on the Durbin amendment. There are other \namendments pending on which we can have votes. And there are other \namendments to be offered that we should have votes on as quickly as \npossible.\n  I ask my colleagues to offer amendments this afternoon. The floor is \nopen for additional business. This does not preclude additional \namendment consideration this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me underscore what the majority \nleader has said, and also the Republican leader, and indicate that I \nalso believe we can complete action on this energy bill fairly quickly \nonce we come back to it and once we have the ANWR-related amendment \noffered by Senator Murkowski and the other proponents of that \namendment.\n  I regret that we are not able to begin dealing with that today. But \nwe are not. Therefore, I support the majority leader's decision to move \nto this other legislation beginning tomorrow.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3094\n\n  Let me say a few words about the Durbin amendment. The Durbin \namendment was offered yesterday. It would establish the Consumer Energy \nCommission. It provides for an 11-member Commission which would have \nthe job of doing a 180-day study of a variety of issues related to the \ngeneration of electricity in our country and the potential failures of \nthe system.\n\n[[Page S2565]]\n\n  I think it is a good amendment. I think it is one which has the \nprospect of improving our understanding of this issue.\n  This board is to be concluded after 180 days and report back to the \nCongress within 30 days. At the end of the 180 days, the group goes out \nof existence 30 days later.\n  I don't think there should be any substantial objection to this. To \nmy mind, it is a meritorious amendment. I said yesterday that I thought \nit should be approved. I certainly believe that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that in a moment we \nwill vote on my amendment. I certainly thank the chairman, Senator \nBingaman, for his kind words of support. A number of my colleagues are \ncosponsors of this amendment to create a Consumer Energy Commission: \nSenator Smith, Senator Schumer, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Stabenow.\n  In this bill involving energy policy in America, there are many \nworthwhile issues to be considered. But I think there is one position \nthat needs to be filled with this amendment. It is time for us to \ninvite consumers from across America to be part of this conversation \nabout America's energy future--the families who have to pay the heating \nbills, the hard-working people who have to pay for gasoline to get back \nand forth to work, the individuals and small businesses that may find \nbecause of price hikes they cannot keep their employees on the job, the \nfarmers who are worried about aspects of energy price fluctuations and \nwhat that means to their lives.\n  This Commission is a short-term effort of limited duration and \nlimited expense to try to invite that conversation so the consumers, \nsmall businesses, and family farmers will be part of our national \nstrategy for energy security. We do not believe that the GAO, as good \nas it is, can really speak from that human and real perspective. They \ncannot provide the kind of study of which we are asking. The GAO and \nthe IEA have provided plenty of studies and data on a variety of energy \nissues. However, they haven't brought the analysis, industry, and \nconsumer groups together to consider particularly the problem of price \nspikes.\n  I have a chart that shows gasoline retail prices. You can see why a \nlot of people in the Midwest, for example, call me and call the \nPresident from time to time to ask: What is going on at the gasoline \nstation? Today it is $1.30 a gallon and the next day it is $2 a gallon. \nWhy would that happen? Has war broken out in the Middle East? No. It is \njust the Easter surprise that you have every year in the Midwest. \nGasoline prices have gone out of control. For months at a time, \nfamilies find they are spending extraordinary amounts for gasoline. \nBusinesses cut back on their employees. Whether it is trucking \ncompanies, delivery services, we find a lot of sacrifices are being \nmade.\n  I do not know that this Commission is going to come up with the \ndirect answer to it, but what is wrong with inviting the consumers of \nAmerica into this conversation? What is wrong with asking families and \nsmall businesses to join us in this effort?\n  That is why I hope we can bring all the stakeholders to the table. \nThat is why I think we need to give consumers and small business a \nvoice. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in strong \nsupport of this amendment creating a Consumer Energy Commission.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Texas (Mr. Gramm) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 69, nays 30, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 66 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--69\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--30\n\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Hagel\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Gramm\n       \n  The amendment (No. 3094), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to amendment No. 3114, offered by Senator Feinstein, and that \nthe time until 4:35 p.m.--for the next 20 minutes--be equally divided \nin the usual form, and at 4:35 the Senate vote on or in relation to the \namendment, with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I \nbelieve there is objection on this side. I am happy to check on that \nand respond.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Feinstein \namendment on the renewable fuels standard.\n  The Senate energy bill contains a landmark renewable fuels standard \nthat is an essential part of a sound national energy policy. The bill \nprovides for an orderly phase-down of MTBE use, removal of the oxygen \ncontent requirement for reformulated gasoline (RFG) and the \nestablishment of a nationwide renewable fuels standard--RFS--that will \nbe phased in over the next decade. The standard has strong bipartisan \nsupport and is the result of long and comprehensive negotiations \nbetween farm groups, the American Petroleum Institute, and coastal and \nMidwestern states. It is the first time that a substantive agreement \nhas been reached on an issue that will reduce our dependency on foreign \noil and greatly improve the nation's energy security. aa\n  Moreover, the renewable fuels standard in S. 517 provides a \nnationwide, cost-effective solution to address the concerns over MTBE \nuse. Although individual states are banning or considering banning \nMTBE, the states are still left with meeting the federal oxygenate \nstandard for reformulated gasoline. The provisions of S. 517 address \nboth of these issues in a balanced manner and do so without mandating \nindividual states to meet specific levels of renewable fuels production \nor use.\n  I have spoken in the past about the benefits of renewable fuels. \nThese home-grown fuels will improve our energy security and provide a \ndirect benefit for the agricultural economy of South Dakota and other \nrural states. The new standard is largely based on legislation that I \nintroduced with Senator Chuck Hagel. The leadership of Senators Daschle \nand Bingaman resulted in the consensus legislation on this issue.\n  The consensus package would ensure future growth for ethanol and \nbiodiesel through the creation of a new, renewable fuels content \nstandard in all motor fuel produced and used in the U.S. Today, ethanol \nand biodiesel comprise less than one percent of all transportation fuel \nin the U.S--1.8 billion\n\n[[Page S2566]]\n\ngallons is currently produced in the US. The consensus package would \nrequire that 5 billions gallons of transportation fuel be comprised of \nrenewable fuel by 2012 nearly a tripling of the current ethanol \nproduction.\n  I do not need to convince anyone in South Dakota and other rural \nstates of the benefits of ethanol to the environment and the economies \nof rural communities. We have many plants in South Dakota and more are \nbeing planned. These farmer-owned ethanol plants in South Dakota, and \nin neighboring states, demonstrate the hard work and commitment being \nexpended to serve a growing market for clean domestic fuels.\n  Today, 3 ethanol plants--Broins in Scotland and Heartland Grain Fuels \nin Aberdeen and Huron--produce nearly 30 million gallons per year. With \nthe enactment of the renewable fuels standard, the production in South \nDakota and other states could grow substantially, with at least 2000 \nfarmers owning ethanol plants and producing 200 million gallons of \nethanol per year or more.\n  I understand the concerns raised by the senators from California and \nNew York. This is a major a major change in the makeup of our \ntransportation fuel. The goal of the agreement that has been reached on \nthis title is to phase in the renewable fuels standard in a manner that \nis fair to every region of the country. It also bans MTBE and \neliminates the oxygenate standard, two changes that Californians have \nsought for years. The goal of this agreement is not to raise gas \nprices, but to diversify our energy infrastructure and increase the \nnumber of fuel options. This helps to increase our energy security, \nincrease competition and reduce consumer costs of gasoline.\n  The new standard does not require that a single gallon of renewable \nfuel must be used in any particular state or region. Moreover, the \nlanguage includes credit trading provisions that gives refiners \nflexibility to meet the standard's requirements. In no way is this \nintended to penalize California, New York or any other region in the \ncountry.\n  In addition, there are allegations of huge price increases at the \npump should the standard be enacted. This concern is unfounded and the \nanalysis that the figures are based upon is flawed. Two recent reports \nby the Energy Information Administration--EIA--and the General \nAccounting Office--GAO--have raised some concerns about higher gasoline \ncosts as well supply implications of the renewable fuels standard. \nThese reports failed to take into account several factors, resulting in \nconclusions that are incomplete.\n  The EIA report notes that 90 percent of the costs associated with the \nprovisions of the bill are because of the ban on MTBE, not the \ninclusion of the renewable fuels standard. The report also states that \nthe RFS without the MTBE ban would raise prices up to one cent a gallon \nfor reformulated gasoline and up to .5 cents a gallon for all gasoline. \nHowever, the report failed to account for the provisions of the \nlegislation that allow for credit banking and trading, which would \nlower any increase in prices.\n  The GAO report only evaluated a California ban on MTBE but assumed \nthe continuation of the federal oxygenate standard. Because S. 517 \neliminates the oxygen standard, the high costs in the GAO report are \nexaggerated. The American Petroleum Institute analysis of the effect of \nthe RFS on gasoline costs, including the trading program and the \nelimination of the oxygenate standard, indicates that there are almost \nno additional costs.\n  The renewable fuels standard in S. 517 addresses the difficulties \nthat states have encountered in meeting the makeup of federal gasoline \nstandards, while promoting the use of home-grown fuels that will reduce \nthe nation's dependency on foreign oil. Any attempts to reduce or \neliminate the standard should be opposed so that we can move forward \nand improve the nation's energy security.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, the majority leader has authorized me to \nannounce there will be no more rollcall votes tonight. As per the \nagreement we made earlier this afternoon, there will be no rollcall \nvotes tomorrow. There will be rollcall votes on Monday, for the \ninformation of all Senators.\n  This has been a difficult week, but we have made significant \nprogress. We\n\n[[Page S2567]]\n\nhave completed election reform. We have gotten permission to move to \nthe port security bill which we will start debating tomorrow. Senator \nBingaman and Senator Murkowski have slogged their way through this \namendment process. I think we have made significant progress on the \nlist of amendments we have. Although we have not gotten unanimous \nconsent to agree to a finite list, each side has worked on amendments. \nWe had a period when there were about 250 amendments. We are down now \nto probably 40 or so. Not all of those could be referred to as serious \namendments. There is still a long way to go.\n  The amendment agreement entered into by the two leaders earlier today \nindicates we are going to finish the border security legislation, \nhopefully, by Tuesday. At that time, the Senator from Alaska will offer \nhis amendment on ANWR. We are not going to take up the energy bill \nuntil the ANWR amendment is ready. When that is done, we will take it \nup.\n  It is my understanding in speaking with the Senator from Alaska, and \nseveral others, and also the Republican leader that they are very close \nto having an amendment which they feel good about and will offer. I \nhope that can be finalized by Tuesday.\n\n\n        Amendments Nos. 3119, 3120, 3121, 3122, and 3123 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, the recent debate shows the challenges our \ncountry faces in balancing environmental protection with our Nation's \nenergy security. Containing nearly 95 percent of our countries surface \nfresh water, the Great Lakes are a natural treasure which we must work \nto protect. Today I offered an amendment which would request that the \nSecretary of Energy, in consultation with representatives of the \nappropriate Federal and State agencies and the National Academy of \nScience, conduct a study of the transmission of natural gas and \nelectricity across the Great Lakes and report back to Congress within \n365 days regarding the impacts of such lines and recommendations for \nminimizing their environmental impact.\n  As the cleanest fossil fuel, natural gas will play an increasingly \nimportant role in addressing our nations energy demands. Even today, \nnatural gas consumption is forecasted to increase at over 2 percent per \nyear. However, the infrastructure for transporting natural gas is \nalready strained.\n  To address this problem, a number of companies have applied for \npermits to place pipelines and electric transmission lines across the \nGreat Lakes. One such project is a pipeline which would transport up to \n700 million cubic feet of natural gas per day to New York and the \nnortheast. The pipeline would cross the bottom of Lake Erie for 93.8 \nmiles, from Port Stanley, Ontario to Ripley, NY. This pipeline will be \nconstructed using a new technique called jet trenching, which will \nsuspend two and a half million cubic yards of sediment in Lake Erie. \nMuch of this sediment may be contaminated and the effects of its \nredistribution are at best, unknown. Further, no one has analyzed the \ncapacity of the Lakes to handle suspended sediments.\n  It is obvious that energy transmission infrastructure is important, \nbut it is critical that we understand\n\n[[Page S2568]]\n\nthe impacts of placing this infrastructure across the lake beds. It is \nalso imperative that we develop a long term strategy for their \nplacement. This amendment would require the Department of Energy to \nexamine these questions and make recommendations on how to assure that \nthese incredible bodies of water are protected for future generations.\n  This amendment is simple, but its role in addressing the challenges \nwe now face is essential. I want to thank my colleagues in supporting \nthis amendment.\n\n\n                       ENERGY TRANSMISSION LINES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the Senate considers this nation's \nfuture energy policy, we would like to discuss the intent of the \namendment that the Senate will adopt regarding the planning and \ncoordination of energy transmission lines in the Great Lakes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues, Mr. \nBingaman and Mr. Murkowski, for working with us to authorize the \nDepartment of Energy, in consultation with Federal and State agencies, \nto study the anticipated growth of energy transmission infrastructure \nin the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes ecosystem is complex, so it's \nimportant to understand how to minimize the possible impacts that the \nvarious energy transmission infrastructure proposals may have on the \nGreat Lakes ecosystem.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleagues' concerns and \nagree that a comprehensive study that considers the environmental \nimpacts of energy transmission infrastructure in the Great Lakes will \nbe useful, as will any recommendations on ways to minimize any possible \nimpacts.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is our intent that this amendment \nrequire the Secretary of Energy to complete a study that will include a \nreview of the expected energy demand--including the geographic \ndistribution of the demand--in the Great Lakes States and northeastern \nStates for a 10-year period; a review of the proposed locations for new \nnatural gas-fired electric generation facilities; a review of the \nlocations and capacity of interstate and intrastate natural gas \ntransmission pipelines in all Great Lakes states and other energy \ntransmission infrastructure across the Great Lakes in existence or \nproposed as of the date of the completion of the study; a review of the \npotential environmental effects that could result from the construction \nof pipelines and other energy transmission infrastructure across the \nGreat Lakes.\n  When reviewing the potential environmental effects of construction, \nthe Secretary should consider contaminated sediment deposits, Areas of \nConcern as designated by the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, \nhighly sensitive fisheries, and highly sensitive nearshore and coastal \nhabitat. The Secretary should also include an analysis of potential \nenvironmental benefits of new natural gas-fired electric generation \nfacilities and reduced consumption measure that could be undertaken; an \nanalysis of the capacity of the Great Lakes to handle suspended \nsediment; takes into consideration the impacts of accommodating the \nenergy transmission infrastructure on land use along the coasts of the \nGreat Lakes; and takes into consideration the emergency response time \nfor accidents in the energy transmission infrastructure. Not later than \n180 days after enactment of the underlying bill, the Secretary should \nreport his findings and recommendations for the coordination of the \ndevelopment of natural gas and other energy transmission infrastructure \nthat would minimize the aggregate negative environmental effects on the \nGreat Lakes ecosystem.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished \nSenators from Michigan and Ohio and our colleagues from the Great Lakes \nstates for clarifying the intent of their amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today the Senate will pass by voice vote \nan amendment to the energy bill that would establish a Conserve by Bike \nPilot Program in the Department of Transportation, as well as fund a \nresearch initiative on the potential energy savings of replacing car \ntrips with bike trips. This program would fund up to 10 projects \nthroughout the country, using education and marketing to convert car \ntrips to bike trips. The research would document the energy \nconservation, air quality improvement, and public health benefits \ncaused by increased bike trips. The goal is to conserve energy \nresources used in the transportation sector by turning some of our gas \nguzzling miles into bike rides.\n  There is no single solution for our nation's energy challenges. Every \npossible approach must be considered in order to solve our energy \nproblems.\n  It would be unrealistic to expect most Americans to make a \nsubstantial increase in the number of trips they make by bicycle. But \neven a small percentage of bike trips replacing our shorter car trips \ncould make a significant difference in oil and gas consumption.\n  Right now, less than one trip in one hundred--.88 percent--is by \nbicycle. If we can raise our level of cycling just a tiny bit: to one \nand a half trips per hundred, which is less than a bike trip every two \nweeks for the average person, we would save over 462 million gallons of \ngasoline in a year, worth over $721 million. That's one day a year we \nwon't need to import any foreign oil.\n  In addition to conserving our energy, an increased number of bike \ntrips can improve our air quality. Significant declines in vehicle \nemissions would follow from increased bike trips. A study in New York \nCity showed that bicycling spares the city almost 6,000 tons of carbon \nmonoxide each year. A reduced number of trips made by cars would \nincrease this number and help to clean our nation's air.\n  The Federal Highway Administration estimates that 60 percent of all \nautomobile trips are under five miles in length. And these short trips \ntypically emit more pollutants because cars during these trips run on \ncold engines. Engines running cold produce five times the carbon \nmonoxide and twice the hydrocarbon emissions per mile as engines \nrunning hot. These cold engine trips could most easily be replaced by \nbike rides.\n  Americans would experience additional advantages from increased bike \nusage. The decreased number of cars on our nation's highways would help \nreduce traffic and parking congestion. Congestion costs have reached as \nmuch as $100 billion annually according to the Federal Highway \nAdministration. A reduction in cars on the roads will decrease the high \ncosts associated with congestion.\n  The ``Conserve by Bike'' amendment will also improve public health. \nThe exercise from more frequent bike trips would help improve our \nphysical well-being. Biking has proven to be effective in the \nprevention of heart disease, our nation's number one killer. And, \nbiking also has been shown to help individuals who are trying to give \nup health-impairing behaviors such as smoking and alcohol abuse.\n  The ``Conserve by Bike'' amendment will help America take a simple \nbut meaningful step in energy conservation. It will help fund up to 10 \npilot projects that will use education and marketing to facilitate the \nconversion of car trips to bike trips, and document the energy savings \nfrom these trips. These projects will facilitate partnerships among \nthose in the transportation, energy, environment, public health, \neducation, and law enforcement sectors. There is a requirement for a \nlocal match in funding, so that these projects can continue after the \nFederal resources are exhausted. In addition, this amendment will fund \na research initiative with the National Academy of Sciences to examine \nthe feasibility and benefits of converting bike trips to car trips.\n  It is imperative that Americans are fully informed of the entire \nrange of benefits from biking in terms of energy conservation, air \nquality, and public health. We also need to provide the best resources \nin bike safety and convenience.\n  We have been spending a modest amount of Federal, State and local \nfunds on bicycle facilities since 1991. This amendment will leverage \nthose investments and help people take advantage of the energy \nconservation choices they have in getting around their communities. I \nam pleased that this amendment will be accepted by the Senate as part \nof the energy bill that Senators Daschle and Bingaman have brought to \nthe floor.\n\n[[Page S2569]]\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President I am proud to join my colleague from \nIllinois in offering an amendment to recognize and promote bicycling's \nimportant impact on energy savings and public health.\n  With America becoming more and more dependent on foreign oil, it is \nvital that we look to the contribution that bike travel can make \ntowards solving our Nation's energy challenges. This amendment would \nestablish a Conserve By Bike pilot program that would oversee up to 10 \npilot projects throughout the country designed to conserve energy \nresources by providing education and marketing tools to convert car \ntrips to bike trips. By replacing even a small percentage of short car \ntrips with bike trips, we would save over 462 million gallons of \ngasoline in a year, worth over $721 million.\n  While more bike trips would benefit our energy conservation efforts, \nthey would also contribute to the public's health. According to the \nU.S. Surgeon General, less than one-third of Americans meet Federal \nrecommendations to engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate physical \nactivity at least five days a week. Even more disturbing is the fact \nthat approximately 300,000 U.S. deaths a year currently are associated \nwith being obese or overweight. By promoting biking, we are working to \nensure that Americans will increase their physical activity.\n  Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to meet with a delegation \nrepresenting the Bicycle Coalition of Maine. This group has done an \noutstanding job of advocating bicycling safety, education, and access \nthroughout the State. As a result of the work of the Bicycle Coalition \nof Maine, people living in and visiting Maine will have accessible and \nsafe conditions where they may comfortably and responsibly bicycle. The \n``Conserve by Bike'' amendment has received support from this group and \nmany others on the national, State, and local level, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, these five amendments have been cleared \non both sides. They include an amendment by Senator Rockefeller to \nensure the safety of the Nation's mines and mine workers, one by \nSenator Levin to require the Secretary of Energy to conduct a study on \nthe effects of natural gas pipelines in the Great Lakes, one by Senator \nSchumer to promote the demonstration of certain high-temperature \nsuperconducting technologies, one by Senator Smith of Oregon to \nauthorize a study of energy efficiency standards, and one by Senator \nDurbin to encourage energy conservation through bicycling.\n  I believe there is no objection to any of these amendments. I urge \nthe Senate to adopt them at this time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, speaking from the standpoint of the \nminority, we have worked with the majority on these amendments and find \nthem agreeable. They have been cleared on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3119, 3120, 3121, 3122, and 3123) were agreed to \nen bloc.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I want the body to note that on our \nside there are about 10 or 14 amendments. I have no idea what the \nsituation is on the majority side with regard to amendments.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I reiterate what the Senator from Nevada \nsaid earlier, which is that we have a few more than that on the \nDemocratic side. But we have been making very good progress in reducing \nthe number of amendments. We are optimistic that after we conclude the \ndebate on the amendment which the Senator from Alaska is going to offer \nnext week, we will be able to move to complete other amendments and \ncomplete action on the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on a note of levity and in the spirit \nof Senator Durbin with the authorization of a study on the use of \nbicycles as a pilot program, I am going to pilot my program home \ntonight on my girls' bicycle which I bought for $20. It is one which I \ndon't have to lock up because nobody would bother to steal it. It gets \nme here a lot faster than driving.\n  I recall one day being behind an automobile of the junior Senator \nfrom New York which was stalled in the drive, and they had to push it \nout. I certainly recommend the amendment proposed by Senator Durbin, \nwhich suggests obvious benefits of the bicycling. It is much easier to \nget through security, and when the dogs come around you only have to \nworry about one thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nelson of Nebraska are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join with \nmy colleagues in talking about the very difficult choices that are \nbeing foisted upon some of our States and all of our consumers because \nof the renewable fuels provisions in the energy bill now under \nconsideration.\n  Now, these renewable fuels provisions do accomplish some very \nimportant goals. First, they ban the use of MTBE, which has resulted in \nserious ground water pollution all over our country. They revoke the \noxygenate requirements that led so many States to make such heavy use \nof MTBE in the first place. And they do keep in place the same \nstringent air pollution standards mandated by the Clean Air Act.\n  My State has, unfortunately, experienced firsthand the effects of \nMTBE contamination in our drinking water sources.\n  While the full health and environmental impacts of MTBE are still \nunknown, we do know that it smells bad, it tastes bad, and the bottom \nline is that people do not want to be drinking MTBE-contaminated water \nany more than they want to be drinking water with arsenic or some other \ncontaminant in it.\n  As many of my colleagues know, because of poor air quality in certain \nareas of the country, we are required to meet something called an \n``oxygenate requirement'' under the Clean Air Act.\n  New York City and surrounding counties constitute one of those areas. \nThis requirement requires that consumers use gasoline additives that \naid in reducing harmful air pollution. The additives available at this \ntime are primarily MTBE and ethanol. So those of us in the Northeast, \nwho need to meet this oxygenate requirement, have been adding MTBE to \nour gasoline because we have no readily accessible, affordable, \navailable sources of ethanol in places such as New York.\n  The unfortunate consequence is that, as a result of leaking \nunderground storage tanks, other leaks, and runoffs, we are now \nexperiencing MTBE contamination in our underground water sources.\n  This has been a big problem in our State, particularly on Long \nIsland, which has an aquifer that provides drinking water that runs the \nfull length of the island. In Suffolk County alone, MTBE has been found \nin both private and public wells in all 10 of the towns in that county.\n  This is a serious problem and the costs of cleaning up this MTBE \ncontamination are significant. While having clean air to breathe is \ncritically important, so is having clean water to drink. We should not \nhave to trade off air for water. We should be able to figure out how to \nprovide both clean air and clean water.\n  That is why New York State took the very bold step of banning MTBE by \nJanuary 1, 2004--less than 2 years from today. In fact, I believe that \nabout 13 States--including my own--have made the decision to restrict \nor ban the use of MTBE in the next couple of years.\n  I agree that phasing out MTBE is exactly the right thing to do from a \ndrinking water perspective and from an overall environmental \nperspective. That is why, in the last session, the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee voted out S. 950 by voice vote,\n\n[[Page S2570]]\n\nthe provisions of which are incorporated in the renewable fuels \nprovisions that we are now discussing.\n  S. 950 includes a phaseout of MTBE and a repeal of the Federal \noxygenate requirement, as recommended by the EPA's Blue Ribbon Panel on \nOxygenates in Gasoline. I strongly support these provisions, and I \ncommend the bipartisan leadership of the EPW Committee for their work \non this important issue. But the committee-passed bill did not include \nthe ethanol mandate that we are here to discuss.\n  Now, I am not here--I want to make this absolutely clear--to oppose \nethanol. I believe in ethanol. I think it is a great step forward for \nrenewable fuels. And I know that it is an important use of the products \nthat are grown in many parts of our country. It is a new market. And I \nbelieve that it does take us in the right direction.\n  And phasing out MTBE, even with a repeal of the oxygenate \nrequirement, will still lead to an increase in the use of ethanol in \nour country. That is why a Federal mandate is not needed to ensure a \ncontinuing market for ethanol. And that is why I and my senior \ncolleague from New York, and my colleagues from California, and others, \nare opposing the ethanol mandate that is included in this bill.\n  The energy bill we are currently debating includes what I can only \ndescribe as an astonishing new anticonsumer Government mandate: that \nevery refiner in our country use an ever increasing volume of ethanol \nor pay for ethanol credits.\n  At first when this was described to me, I thought there had to be \nsome mistake because I, and I guess the majority of my colleagues, \nsupport ethanol. But to be told it has to be used, and the amount of it \nhas to increase over time, struck me as exactly the opposite of what we \nare trying to achieve in this new energy policy. Because regardless of \nthe market, and whatever the demand would be for ethanol, this bill \nrequires the use of ethanol or the purchase of ethanol credits at a set \namount, an amount that will eventually exceed 5 billion gallons.\n  Currently U.S. refiners use approximately 1.7 billion gallons of \nethanol. Starting in 2004, the Nation's refiners would be required to \nuse 2.3 billion gallons of ethanol. And that number would ratchet up to \n5 billion gallons of ethanol by 2012. And the use of a constant \npercentage of ethanol per volume of gasoline would be required every \nyear thereafter no matter what kind of new breakthroughs we had in \nmaking gas both more efficient and cleaner. It would not matter. We \nwould have a big brother, big-hand Federal Government mandate: You have \nto use it no matter what.\n  This means that from 2012 on, the Nation's ethanol producers would \nhave a Government-guaranteed annual market of at least 5 billion \ngallons, or perhaps even more.\n  Now, oil refiners could, in a competitive market, find smarter, \ncleaner, and less expensive ways to reformulate gasoline, but they \nwould be forced to keep using billions of gallons of ethanol annually \nnonetheless.\n  Refiners in States outside the Corn Belt that lack the infrastructure \nto transport and refine ethanol would nonetheless be forced to pay for \nethanol credits. The credits would result in rising gas prices and the \ntransfer of funds from hard-pressed consumers in one part of the \ncountry to ethanol-rich areas in the rest of the country, while doing \nnothing to improve air quality. In other words, consumers in every \nState would be forced to pay for ethanol whether they used it or not.\n  Make no mistake about it, this is tantamount to a new gas tax. This \nwill cause the price of gasoline to go up anywhere from 4 cents to 10 \ncents a gallon. Others who spoke earlier today discussed specifically \nwhat would happen in their own States. I believe for New York this \nwould mean more than 7 cents per gallon at the pump.\n  The reasons for these cost increases are manyfold. There are costs of \nproduction issues. Ethanol simply costs more to produce than gasoline \nor MTBE. Since ethanol is primarily made from corn, if there is a bad \ncorn crop one year, we can expect not only food prices but gas prices \nas well to increase under this bill.\n  There are also supply issues. According to a recent report by the \nCongressional Research Service, in the short term ethanol is unlikely \nto be available in sufficient quantity. If the supply is not there, the \ngasoline supply can't be there, and prices will inevitably rise as a \nresult.\n  There are transportation distribution issues, as has been discussed \nearlier. The cost of using ethanol is also influenced by the fact that \nalmost 90 percent of ethanol production occurs in just five States: \nIllinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Indiana. The geographic \nconcentration of ethanol production is an obstacle to its use on either \nthe east or west coasts, particularly because ethanol-blended gasoline \ncannot travel through petroleum pipelines and, therefore, it must be \ntransported by truck, rail, or barge which significantly increases its \nper-unit cost.\n  As has already been mentioned, ethanol production is also \nconcentrated among a few large producers. The top 5 companies that \nproduce ethanol account for approximately 60 percent of production \ncapacity, and the top 10 companies account for approximately 75 percent \nof production capacity. ADM alone markets about half of the ethanol \nproduced in the country.\n  All of this is going to mean higher prices for the American consumer, \nparticularly on the east and west coasts. There will be other costs to \nconsumers as well.\n  As many know, ethanol already gets a tax break in terms of the \ngasoline tax. Every gallon of gas with ethanol gets a 5.4-cent Federal \nsubsidy. The subsidy is currently costing $600 million in Federal \nhighway funds at today's ethanol use level. That means that with a 5-\nbillion-plus-gallon-a-year ethanol mandate, we will have even less \ndollars for much needed transportation projects in all of our States, \nresulting in more traffic congestion, less safe roadways, and other \nconsumer costs.\n  Another cost to consumers will be the potential environmental cost of \nan increased use of ethanol, not to mention the safe harbor from \nliability that is included in this bill.\n  I have to give it to the sponsors and authors of this provision; they \nhave thought of everything: subsidies; put a tax on everybody else who \nhas to use it; make it even less likely that the environmental costs \nare going to be in any way taken care of because the environmental and \npublic health impacts of ethanol are still not fully understood.\n\n  Studies have indicated that while reducing carbon dioxide emissions, \nethanol may increase emissions of smog-producing and other toxic \ncompounds.\n  Despite the questions on its environmental and public health impacts, \nthis bill also includes a renewable fuels safe harbor provision. What \ndoes that mean? It gives product liability protection against consumers \nand communities that may seek legal redress from the manufacturers and \noil companies that produce or utilize defective additives in their \ngasoline. That is adding insult to injury. First, we are going to tax \nyou and, second, we are going to make it impossible for you to get any \nkind of redress if what we are making you buy makes you sick or \npollutes the environment.\n  This means companies have less incentive to ensure that the additives \nthey manufacture and use are safe, eliminating an important \ndisincentive to pollute.\n  What is the net result? We are providing a single industry with a \nguaranteed market for its products--subsidies on top of subsidies on \ntop of subsidies and, on top of that, protection from liability. What a \nsweetheart deal.\n  If the average American consumer tunes in on this debate and realizes \nwhat is happening, there will be a revolt. I dare predict that voting \nfor this bill, which will raise gas prices in 45 of our States, will be \na political nightmare for the people who end up voting for it. Higher \ngas prices at the pump, reduced Federal assistance for much needed \ntransportation projects, possible negative air quality, and public \nhealth impacts, to say nothing of raiding the Federal Treasury to give \nthis giveaway to these large producers, makes it impossible to \nunderstand why any proconsumer, prohealth, pro-environment, \nantigovernment mandate Member of this body would vote for this \nprovision.\n  For consumers, the ethanol mandate is a one, two, three, four punch. \nFirst, consumers will pay more at the pump\n\n[[Page S2571]]\n\nto meet arbitrary goals that boost the sale of ethanol, whether we need \nit or not. Second, consumers will face reduced Federal assistance for \ntransportation projects because the money is going to be going to the \nethanol producers, not to fix your roads or your bridges. Third, \nconsumers may experience potential environmental and public health \nimpacts. But guess what. You are barred from seeking redress. Who needs \ntort reform, just stick this in the energy bill and forget about ever \ngetting any kind of liability against anybody who may be intentionally \nor negligently causing health or environmental harm. And fourth, you \ncan't sue the manufacturers and the oil companies.\n  There are some very positive aspects of these provisions to phase out \nMTBE and eliminate the oxygenate requirement. We have long fought for \nthis. There are many in this body who have been working on this a lot \nlonger than I have. I applaud those Members for doing everything \npossible to ban MTBE and eliminate this oxygenate requirement. With \nabout 13 States having already taken such action, this is an issue that \nneeds to be addressed. But this is the wrong way to do it.\n  New York and California are on the front lines of this battle because \nCalifornia had originally banned MTBE as of January 1, 2003, although \nthe Governor was forced to push the date back a year. Now California \nand New York, with millions and tens of millions of consumers, are in \nthe same boat because New York has also banned MTBE. But Arizona has \nalso taken final action to ban MTBE. Colorado has mandated a phaseout, \nConnecticut has also phased it out as of 2004, and even Illinois has \nbanned the use, sale, distribution, blending, or manufacturing of MTBE \nas a fuel additive, along with Kansas and Michigan. And Minnesota has \nprohibited the sale of gasoline containing more than .3 percent volume \nby weight of MTBE and required the phaseout by July 2005.\n  There are many States that have taken actions. They have actually \npassed laws. There are numbers of others who are trying to take action \nto phase it out.\n  We do need Federal action. My colleagues from New York and California \nand I understand that we need to pass provisions that will work. But \nthat does not mean we should pass a 5-billion-gallon, anticonsumer, \ngas-price-increasing ethanol mandate.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that calmer heads will prevail in this \ndebate, that we will understand the important role of ethanol, provide \nan opportunity for that market to grow, but not mandate it, not \ninterfere with the operation of the market, not provide subsidies, not \nrequire consumers to buy it whether we need it or not, and not protect \nthe producers from public health and environmental liability.\n  What is going on here? Any business or any sector of the economy \nwould love to have a mandated tax increase directly into their \npocketbooks. That is not the purpose of having an energy bill that puts \nus on the path to self-sufficiency. I certainly don't think the tens of \nmillions of consumers who may be following this debate think at the end \nof the day they are going to be transferring hard-earned money out of \ntheir pockets into the pockets of ethanol manufacturers, whether it \nhelps or not.\n  So I really hope my colleagues will consider the impact of this \npolicy and join with those of us who are looking at this from the \nlonger term perspective to come up with an amendment that provides the \nkind of support for ethanol we all believe would be in our best \ninterest, without the damaging mandates that this approach would \nrequire.\n  Again, I don't think anybody in this body came to this energy debate \nthinking they were voting to raise this gas tax, but indeed if we pass \nthis as currently written, that is exactly what we are going to do. \nThose people who are going to pay that increased cost, starting in a \nfew years, are going to turn around and say: Why is this happening?\n  It is going to be hard for us to explain. There is no reason for us \nto make this decision when there are alternatives and we can work \ntogether and make it possible for us to have a much better approach \nwithout the damaging impact this amendment on ethanol would cause to \nour entire country.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand we have the regular order, and the Senator \nwho is supposed to speak is not here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. There is no order for \nspeakers. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to a very \nspecial anniversary that many in my home state of New Mexico will take \ntime to remember this weekend. Saturday, April 13th will mark the \nsixty-year anniversary of the Bataan Death March. Some eighteen-hundred \nmen from the 200th Coast Anti-Artillery Aircraft and the 515th Coast \nAnti-Artillery, Aircraft, New Mexico National Guard Units were involved \nin that infamous march.\n  I do not think words can fully describe the bravery of these veterans \nand the horrific conditions they endured. In all, more than seventy \nthousand American and Filipino prisoners of war were captured in April \n1942 and force-marched to a Japanese work camp. Suffering from \nstarvation and physical abuse, more than seven thousand died and only \nabout fifty-six thousand reached the camp. Thousands later died from \nmalnutrition and disease. Of those eighteen-hundred from the New Mexico \nBrigade, fewer than nine-hundred returned.\n  On Saturday, in Las Cruces, New Mexico, we will dedicate the Bataan \nDeath March Memorial in memory and in honor of these men. And because \nNew Mexicans made up such a large proportion of those prisoners \ninvolved in the march, this anniversary and dedication ceremony have \nstirred many emotions throughout my state. For those survivors and \ntheir families, there is a great sense of pride. Of course, there is \nmuch lingering pain, as well. But by establishing a memorial in their \nhonor, we build a bridge to that emotion--a bridge that will allow all \ngenerations of Americans to imagine the suffering these men endured, \nand to remember, forever, their true valor.\n  For all Americans who are unable to travel to the Southwest to see \nthe beautiful bronze statue portraying an American soldier and a \nFilipino soldier comforting an injured American comrade during the \nmidst of that seven-day march, I would encourage you to take the time \nto learn about the horrors these men suffered--to learn their story. It \nis both sobering and inspiring, and I pay tribute to their heroism \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today with the deposit of the 66th \ninstruments of ratification of the Rome Statute, the International \nCriminal Court is on track to enter into force on July 1. I rise to \nacknowledge and congratulate those who have labored to reach this \nmoment--the creation of a permanent international forum to bring to \njustice heinous criminals who have committed crimes against humanity, \nthe fulfillment of the legacy of Nuremberg. The Nuremberg Trial of the \nleading Nazi war criminals following World War II was a landmark in the \nstruggle to deter and punish crimes of war and genocide, setting the \nstage for the Geneva and Genocide Conventions. It was also largely an \nAmerican initiative. Justice Robert Jackson's team drove the process of \ndrafting the indictments, gathering the evidence and conducting this \nextraordinary case.\n  My father, Thomas J. Dodd, served as executive trial counsel at \nNuremberg, it was among his proudest accomplishments. I believe that he \nwould have been proud today to see the International Criminal Court, \nICC, come into existence. He believed that America had a special role \nto help make the rule of law relevant in every corner of the globe. I \nbelieve that he would have endorsed President Clinton's decision to \nsign the Rome Statute in December of 2000 on behalf of the United \nStates. President Clinton did so knowing full well that much work \nremains to be done before the United States can become a party to the \nU.N. convention establishing an International Criminal Court.\n  Now that the establishment of the ICC is inevitable, the United \nStates must now determine what its relationship with the Court will be. \nRather than adopting a course that will pit us against our best friends \nand allies, I call for the United States to be actively engaged with \nthe ICC in working to ensure that it demonstrates the highest standards \nof jurisprudence and integrity. Although the United States is not a \nparty to the treaty, The United States should feel free to raise its \nvoice and give its opinion on who should be selected to be the Court's \njudges and prosecutors. The United States should also use its seat on \nthe U.N.'s Security Council to refer situations to the Court, such as \nthe current conflict in Sudan that has already claimed over 2 million \nlives as a result of war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity. \nAnd above all, the United States should be a watchdog of the Court's \nintegrity and keep it laser focused on its primary task, bringing to \njustice the worlds worst criminals.\n  There are those in Congress and the Administration who would have the \nUnited States repudiate the ICC, and work to tear it down. They would \nhave us take the unprecedented step of ``unsigning'' the Rome Statute. \nI have just cited a number of vital American interests that are wrapped \nup in the Court. Those interests are not going to be erased with the \nname of the United States from the Rome Statute. That is why I \nstrenuously oppose such action: it is irresponsible, isolationist, and \ncontrary to our vital national interests. Many of our closest allies \nhave put their faith in the vision of this new legal instrument. We \nshould give them the benefit of the doubt that they are committed to \nmaking the court work to strengthen international respect for the rule \nof law. I will include the list of the States that have signed and \nratified the Rome Statute at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  I call on the Bush administration to recognize that there is a \nconstructive and useful role that the United States can perform without \nmaking a decision at this juncture concerning US ratification. We \nshould be prepared to lend our expertise in grappling with the many \nissues that remain to be resolved before the court becomes fully \nfunctioning. That is what a global power with the stature of the United \nStates should do.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the list of States to \nwhich I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     ROME STATUTE OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL

Mr. President, for the third time in 6 weeks, a gunman has \nkilled a young girl in Detroit. The first time it was a 7-year-old, \nkilled by a man who opened fire on a car full of children. The second \ntime it was a 3-year-old, shot while she was watching television in her \nroom. And just this past Wednesday, an 8-year-old was shot while \nsleeping at home. The Detroit Police Department has one man in custody, \nbut no one has been formally\n\n[[Page S2573]]\n\ncharged. These are very tragic events. In addition to prosecuting the \ncriminals who commit these horrific crimes, we can do more to prevent \nthem, we should close the gun show loophole so that it is more \ndifficult for criminals to gain access to guns.\n  In 1994, Congress passed the Brady Law, which requires Federal \nFirearm Licensees to perform criminal background checks on gun buyers. \nHowever, a loophole in this law allows unlicensed private gun sellers \nto sell firearms at gun shows without conducting a background check.\n  In April of last year, Senator Jack Reed introduced the Gun Show \nBackground Check Act which would close this loophole in the law. The \nReed bill, which is supported by the International Association of \nChiefs of Police, extends the Brady Bill background check requirement \nto all sellers of firearms at gun shows. I cosponsored that bill \nbecause I believe it is critical that we do all we can to prevent guns \nfrom getting into the hands of criminals and terrorists. I urge the \nSenate to debate and pass this common sense gun-safety legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/11/senate-section/article/S2573-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CELEBRATING OVER A HALF CENTURY OF SERVICE TO VETERANS\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I am pleased today to say a few \nwords about the Paralyzed Veterans of America, PVA to those of us who \nwork on veterans matters, in connection with the organization's PVA \nAwareness Week, which takes place next week.\n  PVA began in February 1947, when delegates from seven groups of \nparalyzed veterans from around the country met at the Hines VA Hospital \nin Chicago, IL. Those veterans agreed to form a national organization \nto address the needs of spinal cord injured veterans. They believed \nthat veterans with spinal cord injuries would have the strongest voice \nin speaking for veterans with such injuries and for all who were \nsimilarly disabled, a belief that has been borne out over the years. \nThe original members of PVA also emphasized the need both to conduct \nresearch to find a cure for spinal cord injury while, at the same time, \nproviding for the basic, immediate needs of spinal cord injured \nveterans.\n  Since its inception, PVA has dedicated itself to the well being of \nsome of America's most catastrophically disabled veterans as it has \ndeveloped a unique expertise on a wide variety of issues involving the \nspecial needs of its members, veterans of the armed forces who have \nexperienced spinal cord injury, SCI, or dysfunction. PVA, which \nreceived a Congressional charter as a veterans service organization in \n1971, is a dynamic, broad-based organization with more than 40 chapters \nand sub-chapters nationwide and nearly 20,000 members. In addition to \nits Washington, D.C. headquarters, PVA operates 58 service offices \naround the country to serve the needs of all veterans seeking \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs' claims and benefits.\n  PVA is a leading advocate for quality health care not only for spinal \ncord injured veterans, but for all other veterans as well. They also \ncontinue to press for research and education addressing spinal cord \ninjury and dysfunction.\n  PVA's commitment to research can be seen in its sponsorship of the \nSpinal Cord Research Foundation which supports research to alleviate, \nand ultimately end, medical and functional consequences of paralysis; \nits endowment in 1980 of a Professorship in SCI Medicine at Stanford \nUniversity; its creation of the Spinal Cord Injury Education and \nTraining Foundation to support innovative education and training \nprograms; and its role in establishing the PVA-EPVA Center for \nNeuroscience and Regeneration Research at Yale University along with \nthe Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, and Yale University, with the goal of restoration of function \nin people with spinal cord dysfunction.\n  PVA also coordinates the activities of two coalitions of \nprofessional, payer, and consumer groups, the Consortium for Spinal \nCord Medicine and the Multiple Sclerosis Council, which develop \nclinical practice guidelines defining standards of care for people with \nspinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis.\n  While PVA's Congressional charter requires it to devote substantial \nresources to representing veterans in their claims for benefits from \nVA, the PVA Veterans Benefits Department goes above and beyond the call \nof duty, providing assistance and representation, without charge, to \nveterans with a spinal cord dysfunction and other veterans seeking \nhealth care and other benefits for which they are eligible. This \nassistance is offered through a network of PVA national service \nofficers across the nation who assist veterans in making claims for \nbenefits and monitor medical care at local VA medical facilities. PVA's \nnational service officers assist claimants through every stage of the \nVA claims process and also offer representation to veterans who have \nclaims pending before the Social Security Administration.\n  PVA's advocacy does not stop at the Board of Veterans' Appeals. It \nhas one of the most active presences at the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nVeterans Claims and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, \narguing cases that have set precedents that have helped thousands, if \nnot millions, of veterans and their families.\n  Other key PVA programs include its Architecture Program, which plays \nan important role in the lives of severely disabled veterans with \nquality design and construction of affordable and accessible housing; \nits Health Analysis Program, which keeps a constant eye on the \nperformance of the VA health care system as well as other health care \nsystems in the public and private sector; and its Sports and Recreation \nProgram which is dedicated to promoting a range of activities for its \nmembers and other people with disabilities, with special emphasis on \nactivities that enhance lifetime health and fitness, including through \nco-sponsorship of the National Veterans Wheelchair Games with the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  For 16 years, PVA has co-authored an important, highly respected \npolicy guide for the Congress, The Independent Budget: A Comprehensive \nPolicy Document Created by Veterans for Veterans, with the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, AMVETS, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars which \naddresses the needs of veterans on issues ranging from health care to \nbenefits and the resources required to meet these needs in the VA \nbudget every year.\n  PVA's Government Relations staff is well-known here on Capitol Hill. \nIt's Advocacy Program is a leading voice for civil rights and \nopportunities that maximize independence of individuals who have \nexperienced spinal cord injury or disease, or other severe \ndisabilities. PVA played an important role in the passage of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. It continues its advocacy as an active \nmember of the Consortium for Citizens With Disabilities. Its \nLegislation Program staff is directly involved in every budget, \nlegislative, and policy initiative affecting veterans under \nconsideration in the Congress every year.\n  Over the years, I have relied heavily on PVA members in my State of \nWest Virginia to keep me informed about the issues so critical to \nveterans with spinal cord injuries. I am particularly grateful for the \nwisdom and counsel of my friend Randy Pleva, President of WV PVA and \none of PVA's National vice presidents. I do not know a more dedicated \nand compassionate advocate for paralyzed veterans.\n  Those of us who work with PVA every day recognize the dedication and \nexpertise that this organization brings to Capitol Hill. The \norganization is one of the top national veterans' service organizations \nin terms of expertise and dedication. We must acknowledge the extreme \nsacrifices that the members of their organization have made in service \nto this country and honor the fact that PVA members continue that \nservice on behalf of veterans and all Americans with disabilities.\n  At a time when this country has soldiers deployed to far-off lands in \ndefense of freedom, it is important that we recognize these men and \nwomen who have served this country in the past and continue to serve \nour nations' veterans today. I look forward to a continuing partnership \nwith PVA to provide for the needs of veterans, past, present, and \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/11/senate-section/article/S2573-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2573-S2574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate\n\n[[Page S2574]]\n\ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred August 18, \n1994 in Indianola, OH. Four lesbians women were attacked by a female \nteen who, encouraged by a crowd of onlookers, yelled anti-gay epithets. \nThe assailant, Shanika Campbell, 18, was charged with four counts of \nassault in connection with the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/11/senate-section/article/S2574-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        KOREAN WAR COMMEMORATION\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, today I rise to respectfully ask my \nfellow colleagues join me in honoring the men and women who so bravely \nand fiercely fought for freedom and democracy during the Korean War and \nthose who fight for these same freedoms today.\n  This week at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, the often ``forgotten \nwar'' will take center stage as an expected crowd of more than 10,000 \nwill gather today at the Marine Corps Base to partake in various \ncommemorative activities. The commemoration will begin with a full \nhonors ceremony and address by Navy Secretary Gordon R. England and \nwill include flyovers by vintage aircraft, modern attack helicopters, \nF/A--18 Hornets, AV--8B Harriers and A--10 Thunderbolts as well as a \nparachute jump by the Army's Golden Knights. The events, set to end \nnext year, are part of the military's three-year commemoration of the \n1950-1953 War.\n  On June 25, 1950, eight divisions and an armored brigade of 90,000 \nsoldiers from the North Korean People's Army attacked in three columns \nacross the 38th parallel and invaded the Republic of Korea. The \nfollowing day, President Harry S Truman sanctioned the use of American \nair and naval forces below the 38th parallel. 37 long months later on \nJuly 27, 1953, an Armistice was signed and the fighting ended. In all, \nAmerica lost 33,686 of its best and brightest. However, these men lost \ntheir lives safeguarding something bigger than any of us in this room, \ndemocracy.\n  Today, many veterans of the Korean War feel as if their sacrifice is \nforgotten. They believe that their place in history has been nearly \nerased. I urge my fellow colleagues and my fellow Americans to remember \nand embrace what these men and women were fighting to defend fifty \nyears ago in North and South Korea. They were protecting the notions of \nfreedom and democracy our forefathers so bravely brought to this great \nland nearly 226 years ago. In many ways, our soldiers at home and \nabroad are fighting to protect these same ideals today. In 1950, \ncommunists in North Korea, China, and Russia threatened to take away \npeople's innate right to sleep under a blanket of freedom. Today, \nterrorists from around the globe are attempting to do the same. We must \nnever forget those who have fought and died to ensure that our way of \nlife continues. I applaud the efforts of the Department of Defense and \nthe nearly 5000 partners around the world for conducting this three-\nyear commemoration ceremony. History and the people who played such a \nvital part in it should never be forgotten for what they accomplished \nand what they sacrificed. As Winston Churchill stated, ``Out of the \ndepths of sorrow and sacrifice will be born again the glory of \nmankind.''\n  Finally, I would like to pay a special tribute to the more than \n57,000 Kentuckians who served in the military during the Korean War \nera, many who undoubtedly fought on the front lines. I am extremely \nproud to know that so many Kentuckians were willing to fight for all \nthat this great country stands for. God Bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/11/senate-section/article/S2574-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNITION OF DR. KATHY HUDSON'S SERVICE TO NIH\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize the exemplary work of Dr. Kathy Hudson, who after 10 years is \nleaving government service. For the last 7 years Dr. Hudson has served \nwith distinction as the Director of the Office of Policy, Planning and \nCommunications and the Assistant Director of the National Human Genome \nResearch Institute at the National Institutes of Health. While at the \nInstitute, she has been responsible for communications, government \nrelations, program planning, and education activities.\n  Dr. Hudson has provided focus and leadership in numerous areas for \nthe Institute. She has played a particularly important leadership role \nin public policy and public affairs for the Human Genome Project, the \ninternational effort to decipher the human genetic code and apply the \nresults to improving human health.\n  She has led efforts to identify barriers such as genetic \ndiscrimination that could impede the fair and equitable application of \ngenetic information to public health and has led development of \npolicies to protect privacy and prevent genetic discrimination. In his \nregard, she was instrumental in the development of an Executive Order \nsigned in February 2000 that banned discrimination in Federal \nemployment based on genetic information. She has also provided \nexceptional technical advice to my staff and many others in drafting \nlegislation on genetic nondiscrimination. I look forward to seeing that \nimportant legislation enacted soon.\n  Dr. Hudson received her B.A. in biology at Carleton College in \nMinnesota; her Masters in microbiology from the University of Chicago; \nand the Ph.D. in molecular biology from the University of California, \nBerkeley. Before joining the NIH, Dr. Hudson was a senior policy \nanalyst in the office of the Assistant Secretary for Health at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. She advised the assistant \nsecretary on national health and science policy issues involving NIH. \nPrior to that, Dr. Hudson worked in the Congressional Office of \nTechnology Assessment as a congressional science fellow.\n  Through her signal contributions to social policy and to the Nation's \nhealth, Dr. Hudson's work has exemplified the best of government \nservice and the difference in our Nation's well being that a dedicated \nscientist can make. I wish Dr. Hudson all the best in her new venture \nas the Director of the Genetics and Public Policy Center at the Johns \nHopkins University, and on behalf of the Congress and the country, \nthank her for her outstanding government service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/11/senate-section/article/S2574-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2574-S2575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                               __________\n                               \n\nIN RECOGNITION OF FRESNO COUNTY SUPERVISOR, JUAN ARAMBULA, RECIPIENT OF \n                THE 2002 ROSE ANN VUICH LEADERSHIP AWARD\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Since the \nmiddle of the 20th century, the congregants of First Baptist have \nwillingly contributed to the advancement and well-being of their \nsurrounding community by building and running a parsonage, establishing \na Food Pantry ministry, and creating the First Baptist Church Federal \nCredit Union. First Baptist has also addressed the need of adequate and \naffordable housing through the First Baptist Church Development \nCorporation. Just recently, the Corporation completed construction and \nsale of its first affordable housing unit.\n  I am impressed by First Baptist's commitment to Christian \ndiscipleship. Under the leadership of Reverend William B. Sutton, III, \nand former Pastor, Doctor William O. Johnson, it has provided growth \nand development to both congregants and the surrounding community. In \nthese difficult times, I believe the services rendered by First Baptist \nserve as a positive example to all religious congregations.\n  Once again, I congratulate the First Baptist Church of Stratford on \nits 125th anniversary. I hope that the congregation will keep up its \nimportant work and continue to make lasting contributions to the \ncommunity of Stratford for many generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/11/senate-section/article/S2575-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  IN RECOGNITION OF NANCY RICHARDSON, RECIPIENT OF THE EXCELLENCE IN \n                          PUBLIC SERVICE AWARD\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. TORRICELLI:\n  S. 2090. A bill to eliminate any limitation on indictment for sexual \noffenses and make awards to States to reduce their DNA casework \nbacklogs; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Sexual \nAssault Prosecution Act. This legislation will ensure that no rapist \nwill evade prosecution when there is reliable evidence of their guilt.\n  As Federal law is written today, a rapist can walk away scot-free if \nthey are not charged within five years of committing their crime. This \nis true even if overwhelming evidence of the offender's guilt, such as \na DNA match with evidence taken from the crime scene, is later \ndiscovered. Some States, including my home State of New Jersey, have \nrecognized the injustice presented by this situation and have already \nabolished their statutes of limitations on sexual assault crimes, and \nmany other States are considering similar measures. Given the power and \nprecision of DNA evidence, it is now time that the Federal Government \nabolish the current statute of limitations on Federal sexual assault \ncrimes.\n  The precision with which DNA evidence can identify a criminal \nassailant has increased dramatically over the past couple decades. \nBecause of its exactness, DNA evidence is now routinely collected by \nlaw enforcement personnel in the course of investigating many crimes, \nincluding sexual assault crimes. The DNA profile of evidence collected \nat a sexual assault crime scene can be compared to the DNA profiles of \nconvicted criminals, or the profile of a particular suspect, in order \nto determine who committed the crime. Moreover, because of the \nlongevity of DNA evidence, it can be used to positively identify a \nrapist many years after the actual sexual assault.\n  The enormous advancements in DNA science have greatly expanded law \nenforcement's ability to investigate and prosecute sexual assault \ncrimes. Unfortunately, the law has not kept pace with science. Given \nthe precise accuracy and reliability of DNA testing, however, the legal \nand moral justifications for continuing to impose a statute of \nlimitations on sexual assault crimes are extremely weak. To that end, I \nam introducing the ``Sexual Assault Prosecution Act'' which will \neliminate the statue of limitations for sexual assault crimes. This \nlegislation will not affect the burdens of proof and the government \nwill still have to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt before any \nperson could be convicted of a crime.\n  Currently, the statue of limitations for arson and financial \ninstitution crimes is 10 years and is 20 years for crimes involving the \ntheft of major artwork. If it made sense to extend the traditional \nfive-year limitations period for these offenses, surely it makes sense \nto do so for sexual assault crimes, particularly when DNA technology \nmakes it possible to identify an offender many years after the \ncommission of the crime. By eliminating this ticking clock, we can see \nto if that no victim of sexual assault is denied justice simply because \nthe clock ran out. I look forward to working with each and every one of \nyou in order to get this legislation enacted into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2090\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code to prohibit \ngunrunning, and provide mandatory minimum penalties for crimes related \nto gunrunning; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Gun \nKingpin Penalty Act. In introducing this bill, I hope that my \ncolleagues will soon join me in sending a clear and strong signal to \ngunrunners, your actions will no longer be tolerated.\n  Data gathered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms clearly \ndemonstrates what many of us already know all too well, several of our \nNation's highways have become pipelines for merchants of death who deal \nin illegal firearms.\n  My own State of New Jersey is proud to have some of the toughest gun \ncontrol laws in the Nation. But for far too long, the courageous \nefforts of New Jersey citizens in enacting these tough laws have been \nweakened by out of State gunrunners who treat our State like their own \npersonal retail outlet.\n  ATF data shows that in 1996 New Jersey exported fewer guns used in \ncrimes, per capita, than any other State, less than one gun per 100,000 \nresidents, or 75 total guns. Meanwhile, an incredible number of guns \nused to commit crimes in New Jersey came from out of State, 944 guns \nwere imported, a net import of 869 illegal guns used to commit crimes \nagainst the people of New Jersey.\n  This represents a one way street, guns come from, States with lax gun \nlaws straight to States, like New Jersey, with strong laws. It is clear \nthat New Jersey's strong gun control laws offer criminals little choice \nbut to import their guns from States with weak laws. We must act on a \nFederal level to send a clear message that this cannot continue and \nwill not be tolerated.\n  The Gun Kingpin Penalty Act would create a new Federal gunrunning \noffense for any person who, within a twelve-month period, transports \nmore than 5 guns to another State with the intent of transferring all \nof the weapons to another person. The Act would establish mandatory \nminimum penalties for gunrunning as follows: a mandatory 3 year minimum \nsentence for a first offense involving 5-50 guns; a mandatory 5 year \nminimum sentence for second offense involving 5-50 guns; and a \nmandatory 15 year minimum sentence for any offense involving more than \n50 guns.\n  We can never rest when it comes to gun violence. This problem will \nnot just go away, and we cannot standby and watch as innocent men, \nwomen and children die at the hands of criminals armed with these guns. \nI urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2091\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Gun Kingpin Penalty Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act \nof 1973 to assist the neediest of senior citizens by modifying the \neligibility criteria for supplemental foods provided under the \ncommodity supplemental food program to take into account the \nextraordinarily high out-of-pocket medical expenses that senior \ncitizens pay, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Senior \nNutrition Act that will help prevent our seniors from having to make \nthe choice between food and medicine as they try to balance their \nbudgets.\n  That, is the most horrible of choices.\n  The problem, is this:\n  The average senior citizen pays over $1,000 per year on prescription \ndrugs. Many of these seniors, the majority of whom are widows, depend \nentirely on Social Security for their income and cannot afford to buy \ntheir prescription drugs without cutting back on their food.\n  At the same time, many food banks and other nutrition programs are \nreporting an increase in participation by seniors.\n  These same food banks also say they are frustrated that many seniors \nthey would like to help are not eligible because under the United \nStates Department of Agriculture's, USDA, important nutrition program, \nthe Commodity Supplemental Food Program, CSFP, seniors are not able to \ndeduct the cost of their medications when seeking eligibility for food \nassistance.\n  While clearly in need of help, and clearly deserving of help, these \nseniors have to be turned away.\n  Michigan has the greatest number of CSFP participants in the country, \nlast year over 80,000 people benefited from this important program in \nmy State and 66,123 were seniors. I have a letter from the Director of \nthe largest program in our State asking for help. I\n\n[[Page S2581]]\n\nwould like to insert his letter for the record because he raises some \nvery important points. Most importantly, he points out that if \nsomething is not done to fix this program, many seniors will be turned \naway. These are seniors just barely getting along, who rely on the \nmodest food package provided by the CSFP.\n  The Senior Nutrition Act helps resolve this problem and helps the \nneediest seniors by amending the eligibility criteria for nutrition \nassistance provided through the CSFP. Most importantly, the bill \nacknowledges the extraordinarily high out-of-pocket medical expenses \nthat senior citizens have and helps these seniors by making many of \nthem eligible for the food available through the CSFP. The Senior \nNutrition Act means the fewer seniors will be forced to make the tough \nchoice between medication or food.\n  Nationally, 28 States and the District of Columbia participate in the \nCSFP, which works to improve the health of both women with children and \nseniors by supplementing their diets with nutritious USDA commodity \nfoods. An average of more than 388,000 people each month participated \nin the CSFP during fiscal year 2000. Of those, 293,000 were elderly and \nthat number is on the rise. This program is important for anyone who \ncares about making sure seniors have enough to eat.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the Senior Nutrition Act, makes the \nfollowing important changes: one: In those areas where CSFP operates, \ncategorical eligibility is granted for seniors for the CSFP if the \nindividual participates or is eligible to participate in the Food Stamp \nProgram. No further verification of income would be necessary in such \ncases. The Food Stamp Program provides a medical expense deduction, \nwhich seniors may use to account for their high prescription drug \ncosts.\n  Two: This bill says that the same income standard that is currently \nused to determine eligibility for women, infants and children in the \nCSFP, 185 percent of the Poverty Income Guidelines, would be applied to \nseniors as well. The current income eligibility standard for seniors \nhas been capped by regulation at just 130 percent. Under the current \nstandards a single senior must earn no more than $11,518 per year to \nqualify. By raising the standard to 185 percent of poverty, the same \nsenior can earn as much as $16,391 to qualify for food. This will make \na major difference in the lives of so many seniors who are struggling \nwith the high cost of prescription drugs.\n  Finally, this bill establishes an authorization for the CSFP that \nwill double the current appropriation levels to $200 million over five \nyears to accommodate any expansion that may occur in the program due to \nthe changes in eligibility standards.\n  This bill has been endorsed by the National CSFP Association. I would \nlike to submit a copy of their letter for the Record.\n  The golden years should be bright and active years for our seniors. \nThey should not be lived in a grey dusk of indifference as we sit by \nand watch them make literal life and death decisions between food and \nmedicine.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues who have joined me as original \ncosponsors of this bill, Senators Levin and Domenici. Together, I know \nwe can make a difference for seniors.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill and that the \nletters from Mr. Frank Kubik and Ms. Barb Packett be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2108\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Senior Nutrition Act of \n     2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) senior citizens in the United States have significant \n     out-of-pocket costs for medical expenses, especially for \n     prescription drugs;\n       (2) 3 in 5 Medicare beneficiaries do not have dependable, \n     affordable, prescription drug coverage;\n       (3) as medical costs continue to rise, many senior citizens \n     are forced to make the difficult choice between purchasing \n     prescription drugs and purchasing food;\n       (4) the commodity supplemental food program provides \n     supplemental nutritious foods to senior citizens in a number \n     of States and localities;\n       (5) under the commodity supplemental food program--\n       (A) women, infants, and children with household incomes up \n     to 185 percent of the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines \n     published annually by the Department of Health and Human \n     Services may be eligible for supplemental foods; but\n       (B) senior citizens are ineligible for supplemental foods \n     if their household incomes are greater than 130 percent of \n     the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines;\n       (6) during fiscal year 2000--\n       (A) an average of more than 388,000 people each month \n     participated in the commodity supplemental food program; and\n       (B) the majority of those participants, 293,000, were \n     senior citizens; and\n       (7) in order to serve the neediest senior citizens, taking \n     into account their high out-of-pocket medical (including \n     prescription drug) expenses, the eligibility requirements for \n     the commodity supplemental food program should be modified to \n     make more senior citizens eligible for the supplemental foods \n     provided under the program.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Debbie Stabenow,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: I am writing this letter to ask for \n     your continued support for the Commodity Supplemental Food \n     Program. We are facing some potential problems in the \n     upcoming months that I would like to bring to your attention.\n       For FY02 we may be seeing program participation threaten to \n     exceed our assigned caseload of 42,700 here at Focus: HOPE as \n     well as other programs nationally that are at or above their \n     assigned caseloads due to the downturn in the economy. \n     November saw us serve 43,553 and 42,902 participated in \n     January. These are traditionally slow months for us and my \n     concern is that if we continue to serve over one hundred per \n     cent of our caseload and additional resources are not found, \n     we may be faced with the prospect of removing senior citizens \n     from our program. The Department of Agriculture has done an \n     outstanding job in assigning caseload nationally to maximize \n     its usage but if this participation trend continues they may \n     not have the ability to meet the demand. Seniors depend \n     heavily on the nutritious commodities provided by CSFP. In \n     many cases this is a lifeline for them by not only giving \n     them access to the food but also the additional services many \n     CSFP's are able to bring to the\n\n[[Page S2582]]\n\n     seniors by the strong use of volunteers and other community \n     programs.\n       My hope is that we will not get to the point of removing \n     seniors from the program and that additional caseload, if \n     needed, can be found.\n       Another point I would like to bring up is the plight of \n     senior citizens who are over the income guideline limits of \n     one hundred and thirty per cent of the poverty level and are \n     ineligible for CSFP. We routinely have to turn away seniors \n     who's income is over the guidelines yet have major expenses \n     in the way of prescriptions and other medical care that \n     leaves very little to live on for the rest of the month. The \n     average income of a senior on our program is around $520 a \n     month. Even though the maximum amount for participation is \n     $931 a month we find many who don't qualify due to the \n     reasons I've mentioned. A possible solution is to increase \n     the senior income guidelines to the same amount as mothers \n     and children who are participating in CSFP of one hundred and \n     eighty five per cent of the poverty level. Originally when \n     the senior program was piloted in 1983, the income guidelines \n     were the same. They were reduced after the seniors were \n     permanently added to the program. Increasing the income \n     guidelines would address the needs of a growing senior \n     population while still maintaining priority to mothers and \n     children in the program as required by regulations.\n       I know that this is a time of tightening budgets but I am \n     hopeful that a way will be found to continue to support this \n     much needed program that has made a difference in so many of \n     our most vulnerable citzens.\n       I am most appreciative of all of your support for Focus: \n     HOPE and the Commodity Supplemental Food Program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Frank Kubik,\n     CSFP Manager.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    National CSFP Association,\n\n                                                   March 18, 2002.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: The National Commodity Supplemental \n     Food Program (CSFP) Association strongly supports your \n     efforts to introduce and pass The Stabenow/Domenici Senior \n     Nutrition Act in the upcoming weeks.\n       CSFP enables us to reach the most vulnerable seniors along \n     with mothers and children every month with a food package \n     designed to supplement protein, calcium, iron and vitamin A & \n     C. The Hunger in America 2001 study done by America's Second \n     Harvest reports that of the people seeking emergency food \n     assistance, 30 percent had to choose between paying for food \n     and paying for medicine or medical care. By amending the \n     eligibility criteria for the seniors served by CSFP, this Act \n     will assist the neediest of seniors in receiving nutrition \n     assistance they so desperately need to remain in better \n     health.\n       On behalf of the Association, let me thank you again for \n     all your efforts on behalf of the CSFP and the participants \n     we serve. We are committed to supporting The Stabenow/\n     Domenici Senior Nutrition Action.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Barb Packett,\n                                        Legislative Affairs Chair.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, today I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of the Senior Nutrition Act. This legislation which is \ncosponsored by my friend and colleague from my home state of Michigan, \nSenator Stabenow as well as my good friend Senator Domenici seeks to \naddress in inequity in the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, CSFP, \nthat I have long sought to address.\n  CSFP is an important U.S. Department of Agriculture commodity food \nprogram that serves nearly four hundred thousand individuals every \nmonth, many of whom live in my home state of Michigan. The vast \nmajority of these individuals are senior citizens. In fact, CSFP is the \nprimary senior commodity program of the USDA. The average senior \ncitizen pays $1000 dollars per year to purchase prescription drugs, and \nmany senior citizens living on fixed incomes, are forced to choose \nbetween prescription drugs and food.\n  Given the dire choices facing many seniors, reforming the Commodity \nSupplemental Food Program so that it can serve more seniors is a matter \nof great importance. This legislation seeks to increase the ability of \nseniors to get the food that they need by granting categorical \neligibility for seniors if they can participate in the Food Stamp \nProgram. Additional verification is not needed in this case. The Food \nStamp Program provides a medical expense deduction which seniors may \nuse to account for their high prescription drug costs. This legislation \nwill also raise the CSFP eligibility level for seniors to 185 percent \nof the poverty level. Raising the eligibility level to 185 percent of \nthe poverty level, from the current level of 130 percent, would make \neligibility levels consistent for women with children and senior \ncitizens. In addition this bill will raise the authorized level for \nCSFP to $200 million of funding over 5 years. This will ensure that all \neligible to receive food under CSFP will do so while allowing for the \nexpansion of the program beyond the 28 States and the District of \nColumbia which currently participate in the program.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, and would \nlike to thank Senators Stabenow and Domenici for their hard work in \ncrafting this legislation. I hope that my Senate colleagues will join \nus in supporting and assign this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska):\n  S. 2110. A bill to temporarily increase the Federal Medicare \nassistance percentage for the Medicaid Program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am pleased today to rise, with my \ngood friend Senator Ben Nelson, to introduce a bill that would assist \nStates through a period when many are experiencing a fiscal crisis. \nStated simply, for the remainder of this year and next, the bill would \nincrease the Federal Government's share of each State's Medicaid costs \nby 1.5 percent and hold the Federal matching rate for each State \nharmless in order to provide approximately $7 billion in fiscal relief \nto States and allow them to expand, not contract, their Medicaid \nprograms.\n  Last month, I was pleased to join with an overwhelming number of our \ncolleagues in passing an economic recovery bill that extended benefits \nfor unemployed workers and provide depreciation incentives for \nbusinesses to invest in new facilities and equipment. In short, the \nbill provided welcome relief to our unemployed workers and to our \neconomy. But it also posed a difficult choice to State governments.\n  In all but a handful of States, corporate and individual income taxes \nare calculated based on the Federal tax code's definition of income. \nThus, when we change how taxable income is calculated under the Federal \ncode, the changes automatically affect the amount of tax collected by \nStates. It has been estimated, for example, that the tax changes made \nby the economic recovery package will reduce State revenues by $14 \nbillion. States can avoid the revenue loss by ``decoupling'' their tax \npolicies from Federal law, but they do so at a price. Decoupling \nincreases the complexity of paying taxes and forces businesses to \ndevote more resources to compliance. At the most basic level, they \nwould have to calculate taxes two different ways and would have to \nfactor the dueling tax consequences into their business decisions.\n  States that automatically or affirmatively decide to conform to the \ntax law changes in the economic recovery package are faced with finding \nways to cover the loss in expected revenue. This could mean making \npainful cuts in important areas such as health care, transportation, \nand education. My home State of Maine was faced with a $27 million \nrevenue loss over the next two years if it chose to conform to the \nFederal tax law changes, and this on top of a much larger structural \nbudget shortfall. The resulting bleak picture forced the State \nlegislature to contemplate some extremely problematic alternatives, \nincluding cuts in the State Medicaid program.\n  Today, Medicaid is the fastest growing component of State budgets. \nWhile State revenues were stagnant or declined in many States last \nyear, Medicaid costs increased 11 percent. Maine is only one of a \nnumber of States that has been forced to consider cuts in their \nMedicaid programs to make up for their budget shortfalls.\n  Earlier this year, Maine was facing a $248 million revenue shortfall. \nFaced with nothing but tough choices, our Governor proposed $58 million \nin Medicaid cuts, including reductions in payments to hospitals, \nnursing homes, group homes, and physicians. He was also forced to \npropose a delay in the enactment of legislation passed by the State \nLegislature last year to expand Medicaid to provide health coverage to \nan estimated 16,000 low-income uninsured Mainers.\n  While subsequent revisions in the State's revenue forecasts enabled \nthe Governor to restore most of these Medicaid cuts, the loss of \nrevenue due to the tax law changes in the economic recovery package \ncould very well put\n\n[[Page S2583]]\n\nthem back on the table, particularly because the Maine legislature has \ndecided to defer a decision on whether to fully conform in 2002 to the \nbonus depreciation provisions of the economic recovery package until \nits next legislative session.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will help to bridge Maine's \nfunding gap by bringing an additional $40 million to my State's \nMedicaid program over the next two years. This should not only \nforestall the need for any further cuts, but will also provide \nadditional funds to Maine to proceed with its plans to expand its \nMedicaid program to provide health care coverage for more of our low-\nincome uninsured.\n  I do not want Maine or other States to have to choose between helping \nour economy recover from recession and helping people in need. Our \nStates need more Federal assistance in providing health care services \nthrough Medicaid, not less, which is why I am introducing this bill \ntoday. By increasing the Federal medical assistance percentage for all \nStates this year and next, we can relieve the pressure put on States to \ncut spending on important programs while increasing their capacity to \nprovide services through Medicaid. I urge our colleagues to join \nSenator Nelson and me in this effort.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I come to the floor to talk \nabout a bill I plan on introducing later on today with my good friend \nSenator Susan Collins. I am pleased to say that our legislation could \nbe considered the next step in economic stimulus. A little more than a \nmonth ago, this body passed and the President signed a bill to \nstimulate the economy and help workers. It was not a perfect bill, but \nfew are. But the economy was hurting and it was time to act.\n  One of the unintended consequences of the stimulus bill was a revenue \nloss for many states. The final package included a provision that will \nstimulate business development through tax incentives. Unfortunately, \nbecause the majority of states ``couple'' their tax rates to the \nfederal tax rates, this benefit for businesses will mean an estimated \n$14 billion loss in state revenues. States can avoid the revenue loss \nby decoupling from the federal law, but this approach is not without \nits own traps and pitfalls. Decoupling makes the tax codes of states \njust that much more confusing.\n  Many states have explored ways to decouple, or in simpler terms, they \nhave searched for ways to hold their state harmless from the \nexperienced revenue loss. In fact, the state Legislature in Nebraska is \nconsidering such a measure today, as it attempts to find a way out of \nit's expected $119 million budget shortfall.\n  We must now take steps to alleviate the unintended impact of the tax \nreductions on state budgets. In previously debated stimulus packages, a \nprovision was included that would have helped state governments by \nincreasing the federal contribution of the Federal Medicaid Assistance \nPercentage, FMAP, by 1.5 percent. This provision enjoyed wide support. \nUnfortunately, and over the objections of the crafters of the Centrist \nstimulus plan, it was not included in the final package signed by \nPresident Bush.\n  Even before the passage of the stimulus bill, Medicaid costs were \nrising at the same time state tax revenues were decreasing. States are \nnow faced with the choice of either cutting Medicaid services or \ndiverting funding from other essential programs to fund Medicaid. This \n``choice'' is no choice at all either cut health care service to \nMedicaid recipients or cut funding for schools, roads, police and \nfirefighters. In a time of economic turmoil this ``choice'' can stall \nthe economic recovery the stimulus bill was meant to jump-start.\n  Our bill would revive the FMAP provision this body earlier \nconsidered. It would provide a direct response to the false ``choice'' \nfaced by states. This bill will alleviate state's Medicaid liabilities \nby increasing the federal government's contribution to the Medicaid \nprogram by 1.5 percent for this year and next. This would mean an \nadditional $7 billion for states. In Nebraska, the savings would amount \nto an estimated $42.7 million. This more than offsets the $34 million \nthat Nebraska is expected to lose if they comply with the business tax \nincentives in the stimulus bill and would in fact provide $8.7 million \non top of what was lost.\n  A month ago, we took steps to help the economy recover and to help \nworkers. Today, we need to take an additional step to help states \nstruggling with fiscal calamity. With this increase in federal Medicaid \nassistance throughout this year and next, states will be given some \nbreathing room to deal with the difficult choices they face in \nbalancing their budgets. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Collins \nand I in this effort and show the states that Congress is not \nindifferent to their budget problems and that we will step in and \nprovide meaningful assistance at a time when governors need it most.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I commend my colleague from Nebraska \nfor recognizing the extraordinary burdens that are being placed on our \nStates both because of the economic slowdown and the increase in health \ncosts, as well as the effects of the 9-11 attacks in our State \nparticularly, but also because of the unintended consequences of some \nof the efforts that were undertaken in the stimulus bill to stimulate \ninvestment which have the direct effect of further cutting State \nrevenues.\n  As a former Governor, I know our colleague from Nebraska understands \nthis intimately. I very much appreciate his leadership on this issue \nand look forward to working with him.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank the Senator.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Byrd, and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 2113. A bill to reduce temporarily the duty on N-\nCyclohexylthiophthalimide; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I am pleased to introduce this bill \ntoday with Senators Specter and Byrd to temporarily suspend a portion \nof the tariff applicable to a specific chemical product, N-\n(Cyclohexylthio)-phthalimide, which is usually referred to as ``PVI,'' \nand thereby provide for greater economic growth.\n  Import duties are intimately related to the tax and trade policies of \nthe United States. Just as Congress expressly imposes duties on \nimported goods to protect specific domestic industries and at the same \ntime raise revenue, Congress abolishes, reduces, or suspends duties to \nencourage domestic business enterprise and export activity, \nparticularly if a specific domestic industry will not be harmed. This \nis the situation applicable to PVI.\n  PVI stands for ``Pre-Vulcanization Inhibitor,'' which means that PVI \nretards the onset of the vulcanization when rubber is being processed. \nIn other words, PVI functions as a safeguard when rubber articles are \nbeing manufactured. There is no direct substitute product for PVI.\n  As you might expect, there is a reasonable demand for this product in \nthe U.S. rubber industry, particularly in the tire industry. To meet \nthis demand, various companies around the world now manufacture PVI and \nexport it to the United States; however, PVI is not manufactured in the \nUnited States.\n  Therefore, the U.S. economy is paying a duty for the use of PVI, but \nno domestic industry is being protected. Therefore, this tariff should \nbe suspended to the maximum extent possible. This legislation would \nsuspend the tariff above the 2 percent level, which will provide for \ngreater economic growth for the United States.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this initiative. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2113\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Attorney General to carry out a \nracial profiling educating and awareness program within the Department \nof Justice and to assist state and local law enforcement agencies in \nimplementing such programs; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, we've heard all too often of \nsituations in cities and towns across the country in which concerns \nover racial profiling are creating serious divisions between \ncommunities and law enforcement agencies. Despite the shared interest \neach have in fighting crime and making neighborhoods safer, mistrust \nand wariness stands in the way of cooperation.\n  Today I introduced a bill entitled the ``Racial Profiling Education \nand Awareness Act of 2002'' that I believe will put us on the road to \npreventing problems caused by racial profiling and help begin \nreconciliation in communities torn apart by racial unrest connected to \npolice-community relations.\n  Rooted in the belief that education and dialogue are the most \neffective tools for bridging racial divides, my bill establishes a \nprogram within the Department of Justice to educate city leaders, \npolice chiefs, and law enforcement personnel on the problems of racial \nprofiling and the value of community outreach, as well as to recognize \nand disseminate information on ``best practice'' procedures for \naddressing police-community racial issues.\n  My experience as mayor of Cleveland and governor of Ohio has taught \nme that reaching the hearts and minds of people is the most effective \nmeans of dealing with intolerance and the problems that result.\n  As mayor of Cleveland I established the city's first urban coalition, \nthe Cleveland Roundtable, to bring together representatives of the \ncity's various racial, religious and economic groups to create a common \nagenda. I also established a one-week sensitivity training course for \nall Cleveland police officers and created six police district community \nrelations committees to open lines of communication between police \nofficers and community members.\n  As governor, I launched efforts to increase community outreach by law \nenforcement in order to foster a cooperative, rather than adversarial, \nrelationship between citizens and law enforcement. Through my \n``Governor's Challenge,'' I worked to bring members of local \ncommunities together with law enforcement officials and members of the \nbusiness community in order to educate and break down barriers that \nlead to intolerance. Outstanding communities were recognized for their \nefforts.\n\n  On Friday, April 12, 2002, Attorney General Ashcroft is scheduled to \ntravel to Cincinnati, Ohio to endorse a settlement agreement between \nthe Cincinnati Police Department and the Department of Justice. The \nsettlement is in reference to a Federal lawsuit, filed last March that \nalleges a 30-year pattern of racial profiling by the department. Just \none month after the suit was filed, riots broke out in the city of \nCincinnati after a white officer shot and killed an unarmed black \nteenager in a foot chase. The riots prompted Mayor Luken of Cincinnati \nto invite the Justice Department to review the practices and procedures \nof the Cincinnati Police Department and make recommendations for \nimprovement.\n  What results is a settlement, endorsed by all parties, including the \nlocal Fraternal Order of Police chapter and the local ACLU chapter, \nwhich sets forth several recommendations for the department, including \nrevising procedures governing the use of deadly force, choke holds and \nirritant spray; increasing training requirements; and keeping a \ndatabase of all citizen-reported positive interactions with police. \nMost importantly in my eyes, however, is the requirement that the \ndepartment works to improve relations between communities and the \npolice.\n  I firmly believe that Cincinnati can become a model for turning \naround a difficult situation and building good community-police \nrelations. And I believe that if other cities and towns throughout the \ncountry can open the lines of communication between their communities \nand law enforcement as Cincinnati is doing, they can prevent problems \nfrom ever happening.\n  The overwhelming majority of State and local law enforcement agents \nthroughout the Nation discharge their duties professionally and justly. \nI salute them for their committed efforts in what is one of America's \ntoughest jobs. It is unfortunate that the misdeeds of a minute few have \nsuch a corrosive effect on the police-community relationship. Through \neducation and dialogue we can help turn situations around so that \ngroups who once thought they had little in common can realize how much \nthey actually have to gain by working together to make our communities \nsafer places to live.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2114\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Racial Profiling Education \n     and Awareness Act of 2002.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Whereas, the overwhelming majority of state and local law \n     enforcement agents throughout the nation discharge their \n     duties professionally and without bias.\n       Whereas, a large majority of individuals subjected to stops \n     and other enforcement activities based on race, ethnicity, or \n     national origin are found to be law-abiding and therefore \n     racial profiling is not an effective means to uncover \n     criminal activity.\n       Whereas, racial profiling should not be confused with \n     criminal profiling, which is a legitimate tool in fighting \n     crime.\n       Whereas, racial profiling violates the Equal Protection \n     Clause of the Constitution. Using race, ethnicity, or \n     national origin as a proxy for criminal suspicion violates \n     the constitutional requirement that police and other \n     government officials accord to all citizens the equal \n     protection of the law.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND:\n  S. 2115. A bill to amend the Public Health Act to create a Center for \nBioterrorism Preparedness within the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto create a National Center for Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response \nwithin the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This center will \nbe the first in the Federal Government to be dedicated solely to \nprotecting the Nation against the public health threats posed by \nbiological, chemical, and radiological weapons attacks.\n  The monumental importance of this task, compounded by the potentially \ndevastating consequences of a failure to give it the national \ncommitment it deserves, makes the creation of a single center that will \nfocus all its energies and resources on encountering the public health \nthreat of bioterrorism imperative and of the greatest urgency.\n  The events of last fall made it painfully clear that we as a nation \nare not as prepared as we need to be to deal with a bioterrorist \nattack.\n  The Federal response to the anthrax crisis has been variously \ncharacterized as fragmented, slow, confused, ineffectual--in a word, \ninadequate. This is in no way a reflection on the dedication or \nabilities of the men and women who performed so exceptionally well in \ntheir roles at the Federal, State, and local level in response to a \nthreat none of us had encountered before. They did not let us down. If \nanything, we, the Congress of the United States, let them down through \nyears of neglect of the public health sector and by failing to give \nadequate recognition sooner to the threat posed to us by bioterrorism.\n  It was not until 1999 that the Department of Health and Human \nServices launched its bioterrorism initiative. The military had \nunderstood and taken steps to counter the threat of biological warfare \nagainst our troops decades earlier. But it took the civilian sector \nuntil 3 years ago even to begin to take seriously the threat of \ndomestic terrorism.\n  Today not one of us could possibly fail to understand how serious the \nthreat posed by bioterrorism truly is. Some among us were the intended \ntargets of last fall's bioterrorist attack. All of us keenly felt the \nthreat.\n  Between 1999 and 2001, we spent in this Nation a total of $730 \nmillion on HHS's bioterrorism initiative, the lion's share of which was \nused by the CDC to bolster bioterrorism preparedness and response \ncapacity of State and local health departments.\n  This initiative was a good start, but it is now clear that between \n1999 and September 11, 2001, we continued to grossly underestimate the \nnational commitment that would be required to counter the threat of \nbioterrorism.\n  Finally, late last year, as we finished allocating funds for fiscal \nyear 2002 in the wake of September 11 and the anthrax attacks, we \nboosted HHS bioterrorism spending to $3 billion, roughly a tenfold \nincrease.\n  Congress is often accused of being reactive instead of proactive, and \nI think that criticism is, I am sad to say, valid in this case. \nCertainly a dramatic ratcheting up to our commitment to bioterrorism \ndefense was the right reaction to the events of last fall. But now we \nare presented with the opportunity, and I think the obligation, to take \nproactive steps to anticipate future threats and needs based on our \nrecent experiences.\n  My proposal today is just such a step, and I exhort my colleagues in \nthis body and in the House to support the immediate authorization of a \nNational Center for Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response.\n\n  The CDC is on the public health front in the war against domestic \nterrorism, the tip of the spear. It is not the only weapon in our \narsenal. The CDC joins the National Institutes of Health, the Food and \nDrug Administration, and Health Resources and Services Administration, \nthe many State and local health departments, and many others on the \nfront line. But the CDC is the one with the greatest responsibility in \nthe event of a bioterrorist attack.\n  Despite the critical nature of these responsibilities, we must \nremember how new they are to the CDC, especially relative to the CDC's \n56 years of experience addressing public health threats of a \nfundamentally different nature.\n  The threat posed by bioterrorism bears a surface resemblance to that \nposed by more conventional disease outputs. But closer inspection \nreveals real substantive differences, and a recognition of these \ndifferences can make the difference between an effective and \nineffective emergency response.\n  The scientists and other experts at the National Center for \nInfectious Diseases and the National Center for Environmental Health \nare highly skilled in controlling and preventing disease outbreaks of a \nnatural origin, but when it comes to bioterrorism, they are treading \nnew ground without a compass.\n  CDC's rapid response personnel, in the absence of the specialized and \nfocused bioterrorism training that a national center could provide, \nwill inevitably bring to bear epidemiological models and methods that, \nwhile exceptionally effective in approaching naturally occurring \ndisease outbreaks, are poorly suited to manmade outbreaks.\n  As my friend and former Senator Sam Nunn so wonderfully noted in \ntestimony to Congress just months before September 11 of last year:\n\n       A biological weapons attack cuts across categories and \n     mocks old strategies.\n\n  We need a new approach. Under the present structure, CDC's \nbioterrorism preparedness and response efforts exist alongside and are \ndispersed among its more traditional programs. This is the prevailing \nstate of affairs because HHS's bioterrorism initiative is still \nrelatively new, not because it is the ideal method of organizing CDC's \nresponse to bioterrorism, but the time has come to give the CDC's \nbioterrorism defense efforts the focus they deserve.\n  Counterbioterrorism activities at the CDC jumped from zero percent of \nthe CDC's overall budget in 1998 to 4 percent in 2001 and 34 percent in \n2002.\n  Each of the CDC's other major programs, none of which now even \napproaches the bioterrorism program in terms of size, has been given a \nnational center with its own director, its own budget authority, and \nown accountability to Congress.\n  The CDC's Bioterrorism Preparedness and Emergency Response Program, \nby contrast, is not even funded through the CDC. Its resources come \nfrom the external public health and social service emergency fund.\n  In the Children's Health Act of 2000, we authorized a National Center \non Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, not because the CDC \nhad no prior programs relating to birth defects and developmental \ndisabilities, but rather because only in their own dedicated center \ncould these programs receive the focus and priority they deserve.\n  There is a National Center for Health Statistics, but there is right \nnow no National Center for Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response. It \nseems to me that if a dedicated center is called for by the need for \naccurate health statistics, the urgent need for a comprehensive, \neffective, and focused defense against bioterrorism certainly demands \none as well.\n  Under my legislation, the National Center for Bioterrorism \nPreparedness and Response would be charged with the following \nresponsibilities: training, preparing, and equipping bioterrorism \nemergency response teams, who will become the special forces of the \nPublic Health Service, for the unique purpose of immediate emergency \nresponse to a man-made assault on the public health; overseeing, \nexpanding, and improving the laboratory response network; and that is a \nmission; developing response plans for all conceivable contingencies \ninvolving terrorist attacks with weapons of mass destruction, that is \nmuch needed and developing protocols of coordination and communication \nbetween Federal, State, and local actors, as well as between different \nFederal actors, in collaboration with these entities, for each of those \ncontingencies,\n\n[[Page S2586]]\n\nwhich is highly needed; maintaining, managing, and deploying the \nNational Pharmaceutical Stockpile, what an important challenge that is; \nregulating and tracking the possession, use, and transfer of dangerous \nbiological, chemical, and radiological agents that the Secretary of HHS \ndetermines pose a threat to the public health; developing and \nimplementing disease surveillance systems, including a nationwide \nsecure electronic network linking doctors, hospitals, public health \ndepartments, and the CDC, for the early detection, identification, \ncollection, and monitoring of terrorist attacks involving weapons of \nmass destruction; administering grants to state and local public health \ndepartments for building core capacities, such as the Health \nAlert Network; and organizing and carrying out simulation exercises \nwith respect to terrorist attacks involving biological, chemical, or \nradiological weapons in close coordination with other relevant federal, \nstate, and local actors.\n\n  This Center is designed specifically to complement HHS's existing \nstructure for the coordination of its multi-agency counter-bioterrorism \ninitiative. At present, the Director of the Office of Public Health \nPreparedness is responsible for coordinating the bioterrorism functions \nof the CDC with those of the NIH, with those of the FDA and so forth. \nThe housing of all the CDC's bioterrorism functions in one dedicated \ncenter will facilitate the Director's coordination task by providing a \nsingle point of contact within the CDC for its bioterrorism defense \nefforts. When the National Center for Bioterrorism Preparedness and \nResponse goes online, the CDC will benefit from a much more focused and \nprioritized bioterrorism mandate; the Office of Public Health \nPreparedness will benefit from a streamlining of its coordination \nduties; and the American people will benefit from a firmer, sounder, \nstronger defense against bioterrorism.\n  Let me be clear that what I am proposing is not an added layer of \nbureaucracy. Most of the responsibilities that would be assigned to the \nNational Center for Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response already \naccrue to the CDC in Atlanta. My legislation would gather these \nexisting bioterrorism functions from their various locations throughout \nthe CDC, which has 21 different buildings, I might add, and bring them \nall under one roof, one center--an elimination of bureaucratic layers, \nnot an addition of a new one. There are a few new responsibilities that \nmy legislation would charge to the Center that do not currently reside \nwith the CDC, but I challenge anyone to claim that they constitute \nmerely an added layer of bureaucracy. Where there are \nnew responsibilities--for instance, the tracking and regulation not \nmerely of the transfer but of the possession and use of deadly \nbiological toxins--it is only in instances of national security \nimperatives of the highest order.\n\n  In 1947, President Truman advocated and presided over the creation of \nthe National Military Establishment, a new department bringing the \nDepartments of War and Navy under one aegis. In 1949, the National \nMilitary Establishment was renamed the Department of Defense. President \nTruman recognized in the waning days of World War II that the Nation's \nmilitary as it was then structured would be incapable of meeting future \nthreats. That is important. The Department of Defense, with its unified \ncommand structure and cohesive focus on national defense, was his \nsolution to the problem. Today, we all know how well the Department of \nDefense has served us. In the 1980s, President Reagan appointed the \nfirst drug czar to lend focus to what had previously been a loosely \ndispersed and consequently ineffectual war on drugs. More recently, \nPresident Bush created the Office of Homeland Security because he \nrecognized that we need one office and one director whose sole \nresponsibility is to ensure the security of our homeland. In this same \ntradition, I propose a National Center for Bioterrorism Preparedness \nand Response. When a threat--be it our inability to win future wars, \nrampant drug use, or terrorist designs on our homeland--reaches \ncritical proportions, our Nation has historically responded by creating \na focal point whose sole mandate is addressing that threat. Today, I \ncan say without fear of contradiction that the threat of bioterrorism \nhas surpassed the critical threshold. In my view, we are therefore \ncalled upon by history and by our obligation to future generations to \ncreate a dedicated National Center for Bioterrorism Preparedness and \nResponse.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2115\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reform the program of block grants to States for \ntemporary assistance for needy families to help States address the \nimportance of adequate, affordable housing in promoting family progress \ntowards self-sufficiency, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nWelfare Reform and Housing Act. This bill contains measures to improve \naccess to adequate and affordable housing for families eligible for \nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF, benefits.\n  It is essential that low-income families struggling to make the \ntransition from welfare to work have access to affordable, quality \nhousing options. Families with housing affordability problems are often \nforced to move frequently, which disrupts work schedules and \njeopardizes employment. Many of the affordable housing options are \nlocated in areas that have limited employment opportunities and are \nlocated a long distance from centers of job growth. Furthermore, high \nhousing costs can rob low-wage workers of a majority of their income, \nleaving insufficient funds for child care, food, transportation, and \nother basic necessities.\n  Maintaining stable and affordable housing is critically important to \nholding down a job, yet an alarming number of low-income families do \nnot have access to affordable housing. The data from Massachusetts is \nshocking: in order to afford a two-bedroom unit at the fair market rent \nestablished by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, a \nminimum-wage worker would have to work 105 hours per week; in 1995, \n2,900 poor families used private homeless shelters, while in 2000 the \nnumber grew to 4,300, with a majority of these families being low-wage \nworkers who had once been on welfare. Lack of affordable housing is not \na problem exclusive to Massachusetts. The Brookings Institution found \nthat nearly three-fifths of poor renting families nationwide pay more \nthan half of their income for rent or live in seriously substandard \nhousing. Nationwide there are only 39 affordable housing units \navailable for rent for every 100 low-income families needing housing. \nAnd for the fourth year in a row, rents have increased faster than \ninflation. We must address the issue of affordable housing during \nreauthorization of the welfare law because many low-income families hit \nthis formidable roadblock on their path to employment.\n  Though access to affordable housing is often left out of the \ndiscussion of welfare reform, it is crucial that we address this issue \nduring our reauthorization of the welfare reform law this year. The \nwelfare reform legislation will not allocate considerable new funds to \nincrease affordable housing opportunities, however, modifications to \nthe TANF statute can be made to address the problem by other means. \nThat is why today I am introducing the Welfare Reform and Housing Act. \nThis legislation will address the housing issue in the context of \nwelfare reform in six major ways:\n  First, the measure will make it simpler for states to use TANF funds \nto provide ongoing housing assistance. TANF-funded housing subsidies \nprovided for more than four months would be considered ``non-\nassistance'' instead of ``assistance''. By considering these subsidies \nas ``non-assistance,'' states that want to implement housing assistance \nprograms using TANF funds will not have to work within the constraints \nof current Health and Human Services rules surrounding ``assistance'' \nsubsidies.\n  Second, the bill would encourage states to consider housing needs as \na factor in TANF planning and implementation. My legislation would \ndirect the Department of Health and Human Services to work with the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development to gather increased and \nimproved data on the housing status of families receiving TANF and the \nlocation of places of employment in relation to families' housing. \nStates will be required to consider the housing status of TANF \nrecipients and former recipients in TANF planning.\n  Third, the legislation would allow states to determine what \nconstitutes ``minor rehabilitation costs'' payable with TANF funds. It \nis now permissible to use TANF funds for ``minor rehabilitation'' but \nthere is no guidance from HHS on what types or cost of repairs are \nallowable, making it difficult for states to determine the extent to \nwhich using TANF funds in this area is permissible. By allowing states \nto define what constitutes ``minor rehabilitation,'' more states with \nsimilar needs will follow suit. A recent study of the health of current \nand former welfare recipients found that non-working TANF recipients \nwere nearly 50 percent more likely than working former recipients to \nhave two or more problems with their housing conditions. Research has \nshown that poor housing conditions often can cause or exacerbate health \nproblems.\n  Fourth, my bill would encourage cooperation among welfare agencies \nand agencies that administer federal housing subsidies. By improving \nthe dialogue between public housing agencies and state welfare \nagencies, the two groups will be able to enter into agreements on how \nto promote the economic stability of public housing residents who are \nreceiving or have received TANF benefits.\n  Fifth, the legislation would authorize HHS and HUD to conduct a joint \ndemonstration to explore the effectiveness of a variety of service-\nenriched and supportive housing models for TANF families with multiple \nbarriers to work, including homeless families.\n  Finally, my bill would clarify that legal immigrant victims of \ndomestic violence eligible for TANF and other welfare-related benefits \nare also eligible for housing benefits. The proposal would ensure that \nabused immigrant women seeking protection under the 1994 Violence \nAgainst Women Act that are also eligible for other federal benefit \nprograms have access to federal housing programs under section 214 of \nthe Housing and Community Development Act.\n  Recent proposals made by the Administration and some members of \nCongress aim to increase work requirements for families receiving TANF \nfunds. Therefore it is important that we are committed to ensuring that \nlow-income families have a fair chance at employment. We have made \nprogress addressing many barriers to work for low-income families such \nas child care, job training, and transportation. But in order to fully \nsupport families make the transition to work we must address the \nshortage of adequate and affordable housing. The Welfare Reform and \nHousing Act brings housing into the welfare reform dialogue and aims to \nhelp ameliorate the housing problem so that low-income families leaving \nwelfare have a chance to succeed in the work force.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. DeWine, \n        Mr. Breaux, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 2117. A bill to amend the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAct of 1990 to reauthorize the Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nSenators Snowe, Jeffords, DeWine, Breaux, Reed, Rockefeller, and \nCollins. By joining together on this legislation, we are indicating a \nstrong bipartisan consensus to invest in both improving the quality of \nchild care and expanding assistance to low income working families.\n  It is significant that we are joining together today not only in a \nbipartisan manner, but also as members of the\n\n[[Page S2588]]\n\nHELP and Finance Committees in recognition of the support and \nneccessity of child care assistance.\n  Today we are introducing legislation to reauthorize the Child Care \nand Development Block Grant. We are calling this legislation the \n``Access to High Quality Child Care Act'', because it's about time that \nwe put the focus on ``Development'' back into the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant. Children are 20 percent of our population, but \n100 percent of our future.\n  Today, 78 percent of mothers with school-age children are working. 65 \npercent of mothers with children under 6 are working. And, more than \nhalf of mothers with infants are working.\n  Most parents are simply not home full-time anymore. Many would like \nto be. For those who are, I introduced legislation in the Senate to \nprovide a tax credit for stay-at-home parents. Because they, too, \ndeserve support in their efforts to raise their children.\n  But most families don't have a choice. If the kids are going to eat, \ngo to school, and have a roof over their heads, both parents must work. \nI don't know of any working parents who think that balancing work and \nfamily is easy. It's not.\n  Since 1996, the number of families receiving child care assistance \nhas grown dramatically to about 2 million children today. But, for as \nmany children who receive assistance, available child care funds reach \nonly one out of seven eligible children.\n  Child care in too many communities is not affordable. And in too many \nmore, it's not available, or, even worse, of dubious quality.\n  About 14 million children under the age of 6 are in some type of \nchild care arrangement every day. This includes about 6 million \ninfants. The cost of care averages between $4,000 and $10,000 a year, \nmore than the cost of tuition at any state university.\n  Far too many of America's parents are left with far too little \nchoice.\n  Nearly 20 States currently have waiting lists for child care \nassistance. Every State has difficulty meeting child care needs. No \nstate serves every eligible child.\n  Now, I know that there are some who say that we don't need more money \nfor child care, that during the last few years we have pumped billions \nmore into child care. But, I think we have a responsibility to look at \nwhat has happened over the last few years as well.\n  The welfare caseload dropped by 1.8 million families from 1996 to \n1999. The majority of welfare leavers are now employed in low wage \njobs.\n  The share of TANF families working or participating in work-related \nactivities while receiving TANF has soared to nearly 900,000 in fiscal \nyear 99.\n  Between 1996 and 1999, the number of employed single mothers grew \nfrom 1.8 million to 2.7 million.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, there has been a \nmarked increase in single mothers working, from 63.5 percent in 1996 to \n73 percent in 2001.\n  But, let's face it. Most welfare leavers are leaving for low wage \njobs. On average, they are making $7 or $8 an hour. They are working, \nbut they are still struggling to get by. Many low wage parents move \nfrom one low wage job to another, but rarely to a high wage job. \nTherefore, even over time, these parents still need child care \nassistance to stay employed.\n  I am very concerned that the Administration's welfare reauthorization \nplan, with no additional funds for child care, will result in States \nshifting assistance from the working poor to those on welfare. House \nRepublicans joined with Secretary Thompson on Wednesday to announce the \nintroduction of the President's welfare plan in the House. One change \nthey made to address child care needs was to allow states additional \nflexibility to transfer 50 percent of TANF funds to child care instead \nof 30 percent under current law.\n  Since States are already spending all of their TANF money and the \nAdministration's welfare plan adds significant additional work \nrequirements for TANF recipients, I just don't see what giving the \nStates additional flexibility buys them in child care dollars. At best, \nit's robbing Peter to pay Paul, taking cash assistance payments away \nfrom welfare parents to pay for child care for working TANF parents. \nThat makes no sense. So, instead of robbing assistance from the working \npoor to pay for child care assistance for welfare recipients, states \nwould rob welfare assistance directly from the worst off who are not \nworking to pay for child care for those on welfare who are working? \nWhat's the logic? How does this help anyone?\n  We held two hearings on child care in March. At one hearing, a woman \nfrom Maine testified who earns about $18,000 a year, pays half her \nincome in child care every week, but remains on a waiting list to \nreceive assistance. In the meantime, she and her two year old sleep on \nher grandmother's couch because she can't afford a place of her own.\n  At another hearing, a woman from Florida with $13,000 in earnings a \nyear recently lost her child care assistance because in Florida \nfamilies working their way off TANF have only 2 years of transitional \nchild care. After that, they must join the waiting list of some 48,000 \nchildren. Because she lost her child care assistance and the state \nwaiting list is so long, this woman may have to return to welfare.\n  I've heard some say the answer is flexibility, that if we give the \nStates more flexibility, then they will step up to the plate. A more \nrealistic prediction would be that if we give states the resources, \nthey will step up to the plate.\n  Let me tell you what flexibility without sufficient resources leads \nto: low eligibility levels, no outreach, low provider reimbursement \nrates, high co-pays, and waiting lists. Sound familiar? That's right. \nWith the cost of child care today, even with additional resources \nprovided over the last several years, too many of the states are forced \nto restrict access to low income working parents. Assistance that is \nprovided often limits parents' choices.\n  We can do better than this. Too often I hear about low income \nfamilies stringing together whatever care they can find so that they \ncan hold their jobs. For many this means Grandma one day, an aunt the \nnext day, an uncle the following day, and then maybe the aunt's \nboyfriend.\n  It's no wonder that 46 percent of kindergarten teachers report that \nhalf or more of their students are not ready for kindergarten.\n  We need to look at these issues in an integrated manner. The \neducation bill that the President recently signed will require schools \nto test every child every year from 3rd through 8th grade, and the \nresults of those tests will be used to hold schools accountable.\n  But, if we expect children to be on par by third grade, we need to \nlook at how they start school. The learning gap doesn't begin in \nkindergarten, it is first noticed in kindergarten.\n  If we are serious about education reform, we need to look at the \nchild care settings children are in and figure out how to strengthen \nthem. Seventy-five percent of children under 5 in working families are \nin some type of child care arrangement. Too often it is of poor \nquality.\n  The bill we are introducing today is geared toward improving the \nquality of care to promote school readiness while expanding child care \nassistance to more working poor families.\n  The Child Care and Development Block Grant is designed to give \nparents maximum choice among child care providers. In our bill, we \nretain parental choice, but provide States with a number of ways to \nhelp child care providers improve the quality of care that they \nprovide.\n  We set aside 5 percent of child care funds to promote workforce \ndevelopment, helping States to improve child care provider compensation \nand benefits, offer scholarships for training in early childhood \ndevelopment, initiate or maintain career ladders for childhood care \nprofessional development, foster partnerships with colleges and \n``resource & referral'', R, organizations to promote teacher \ntraining in the social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development \nof children, including preliteracy and oral language so necessary for \nschool readiness.\n  We set aside 5 percent of child care funds to help States increase \nthe reimbursement rate for child care providers to ensure that parents \nhave real choices among quality providers. Under current law, child \ncare payment rates are supposed to be sufficient ``to ensure equal \naccess for eligible children to comparable child care services in the \nState or substate area that are provided to children whose parents are \nnot\n\n[[Page S2589]]\n\neligible to receive assistance''. But, low State reimbursement rates do \nnot offer parents comparable care.\n  The children of working parents need quality child care if they are \nto enter school ready to learn. Yet, 30 States require no training in \nearly childhood development before a teacher walks into a child care \nclassroom. Forty-two States require no training in early childhood \ndevelopment before a family day care provider opens her home to \nunrelated children.\n  Our bill would require States to set training standards, just as they \nare required to do now for health and safety under current law. Such \ntraining would go beyond CPR and first aid to include training in the \nsocial, emotional, physical, and cognitive development of children.\n  Relatives would be exempt, but through the quality funding in CCDBG, \nStates could partner with colleges and R to provide training to \nrelatives and informal caregivers on a voluntary basis. Initial \nevaluations in Connecticut of such efforts show that relatives and \ninformal caregivers are voluntarily participating and are feeling \nbetter about themselves and their interactions with the children have \nimproved.\n  Leading studies have found that early investments in children can \nreduce the likelihood of being held back in school, reduce the need for \nspecial education, reduce the dropout rate of high school students, and \nreduce juvenile crime arrest rates.\n  If we don't improve both the quality of child care that our children \nnow spend so much time in and expand access to child care assistance to \nmore of the working poor, we will be in danger of missing the boat on a \nwhole generation of children.\n  I think I speak for all of the cosponsors of this legislation that we \nhope to mark up child care in conjunction with the Finance Committee \nconsideration of welfare reform.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to join my good friend and \ncolleague Senator Dodd, in introducing the ``Access to High Quality \nChild Care Act of 2002.'' This legislation seeks to build upon \nCongress' efforts in 1996 to reform the Nation's welfare system and \nwith it, overhaul the Nation's largest child care assistance program, \nthe Child Care Development Block Grant.\n  One of the most important tasks before Congress this session is the \nreauthorization of two critical public assistance laws, the landmark \n1996 welfare reform law, and the Child Care Development Block Grant. \nTogether, these two programs, which are inextricably linked, comprise \nthe backbone for our Nation's support infrastructure for working \nfamilies.\n  The 1996 welfare law reformed the entire nature of the welfare \nsystem, ending welfare as a way of life and making it instead a \ntemporary program, providing a hand up instead of a hand out to \nfamilies making the transition from welfare to work. The Child Care \nDevelopment Block Grant, working with the welfare law, provides more \nthan $4.8 billion for child care in 2002, giving assistance to those \nfamilies that are in transition as well as those who have already \nsuccessfully made it out of the welfare system, and helping them stay \nout of the welfare system by helping them meet the high cost of child \ncare. The result is that since 1996, with more parents working, more \nchildren than ever before are receiving child care subsidy assistance.\n  The key to the successful welfare reform, as witnessed by the 52 \npercent decline in welfare caseloads since 1996, is the system of work \nsupports that provides assistance to working parents to help them make \nends meet while in low paying jobs, and sustain the family's successful \ntransition from welfare to self sufficiency. And perhaps the most \ncritical of all work supports is child care. Without access to quality \nchild care, a parent is left with two choices, to leave their child in \na unsafe, and often unsupervised situation, or to not work at all. \nFrankly, neither option is acceptable.\n  This is the underlying philosophy behind the legislation we introduce \ntoday: to ensure that working parents have access to affordable, high \nquality child care.\n  From the onset, our goal has been to reauthorize the Child Care \nDevelopment Block Grant to ensure the working parents of America can \ncontinue their jobs with the peace of mind that their children are in a \nsafe and quality child care situation, whether it is at a child care \ncenter, a relative's home, or in their own home.\n  We do so by increasing the amount of funding set aside to raise the \nquality of care, giving states the ability to improve strengthen their \nchild care workforce. States will have the option to choose how they \nwill do so, but options include partnering with community colleges and \nResource and Referral agencies to provide training in early childhood \ndevelopment to the workforce, or by simply increasing child care \nworker's wages. Astonishingly, the national average salary for a child \ncare worker is between $15,000 and $16,000, and usually with few \nbenefits. This legislation would give states even greater flexibility \nto decide how to improve quality using even greater resources.\n  Additionally, our legislation simplifies and streamlines the use of \nfederal welfare dollars for child care, whether it be spent directly on \nchild care or whether it is transferred to the Child Care Development \nBlock Grant, while holding these expenditures to the same health and \nsafety standards as those under the CCDBG. As a member of the Senate \nFinance Committee, which has the jurisdiction over the welfare \nreauthorization, fixing what's wrong with the rules regarding the use \nof federal welfare funding for child care is a high priority of mine as \nwelfare works its way through Committee consideration.\n  Approximately 14 million children under the age of six are regularly \nin child care, corresponding with the fact that 65 percent of mothers \nwith children under age six are in the workforce. Considering that the \ngoal of welfare reform is to move people off the welfare rolls and onto \npayrolls, offering help with the cost of child care is one sure way to \nensure that parents can work. Child care is expensive and often \ndifficult to find. In some states, child care costs as much as four \nyears in a public college. And that's even before considering the \nadditional cost of caring for infants, or for odd hour care for those \nworking nights or weekends, or care for children with special needs.\n  And the fact is, we know child care pays off in encouraging more \nparents on welfare to find and keep a job. States have devoted \nsignificant funding to child care assistance, and have redirected the \nbulk of unspent federal welfare dollars under the Temporary Assistance \nfor Needy Families block grant, TANF, and state Maintenance of Effort, \nMOE, dollars to child care assistance. In 2000 alone, states \ntransferred $2.4 billion in TANF dollars to the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant, and spent an additional $1.5 billion in direct \nTANF dollars for child care. Why? Because they realize that child care \nassistance keeps parents working and that is the key to self \nsufficiency.\n  However, since parents who are making the transition from welfare to \nwork typically hold minimum wage jobs, those workers' ability to place \ntheir children in quality child care often stretches their families' \nbudget to the limit. And while these families may no longer be in need \nof, or eligible for, cash assistance, without child care assistance, \nthey may be forced back on the welfare rolls.\n  The fact of the matter is, quality affordable child care remains \ndifficult to afford for families nationwide. This reality was made \nclear last month, when a young woman from Maine, Sheila Merkinson, \ntestified before Senator Dodd's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nSubcommittee, that the cost of her son's child care absorbs 48 percent \nof her weekly income, leaving her to provide for her family with only \nhalf of her $18,000 a year earnings. Sadly, Sheila's situation is not \nunique.\n  Our legislation will help Sheila, and thousands like her, by \nimproving the current child care delivery system, and increases the \nfunding for the Child Care Development Fund to meet the needs \nestablished by the welfare work requirements. This link not only makes \nsense, it also is critical, responsible and essential for the future of \nour nation's children and families.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I would like to thank Senators Dodd, \nSnowe, DeWine, Breaux, Reed, Rockefeller, and Collins for their hard \nwork and dedication to helping provide\n\n[[Page S2590]]\n\nworking families with access to high-quality child care, and I am proud \nto be an original co-sponsor of this important legislation. Senator \nDodd and I have been working together on this and other critical issues \naffecting children for over twenty years now. And, I look forward to \ncontinue working with him and my esteemed colleagues as we move forward \nin helping children and families across the country.\n  A recent Administration report reveals that as many as 75 percent of \nchildren under the age of five in this country are in some form of \nchild care arrangement. And, as more mothers of young children enter \nthe workforce, working families need even greater access to higher \nquality child care. In my State of Vermont, approximately 87 percent of \nVermont children under the age of six live with two working parents, \nand only 56 percent of the estimated need for child care in Vermont is \nmet through regulated care.\n  The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the quality of early \nchild care and education has a significant effect on children's health \nand development and their readiness for school. According to a recent \nstudy, children participating in quality, comprehensive early care and \neducation programs had a 29 percent higher rate of high school \ncompletion, a 41 percent reduction in special education placement, a 40 \npercent reduction in the rate of grade retention, a 33 percent lower \nrate of juvenile arrest, and a 42 percent reduction in arrest for a \nviolent offense.\n  All other industrialized nations acknowledge the great value of early \ncare and education, and make the care and education of toddlers and \npre-schoolers a mandatory part of their public education system, and \npay for it. Unfortunately, the United States does not.\n  Quality child care is available in the United States to young \nparents, but in many cases, it costs more than ten thousand dollars per \nyear. This is almost twice the cost of going to many public colleges.\n  Earlier last week, the President proposed an initiative to strengthen \nearly learning. He stated that he wants every child to enter school \nready to learn. I am pleased that the President is making the care and \neducation of our youngest children a priority. However, if we really \nwant to help all children enter school ready to learn, then we need to \nactually provide the resources to do so. The costs of quality child \ncare exceed what most working families can afford. Yet, unbelievably, \nthe President has proposed NO additional funding to help families gain \naccess to quality child care. This just doesn't make any sense.\n  Many States across the country are working hard to improve the \nquality and accessibility of child care, but they simply do not have \nthe resources to provide sufficient access and quality. For example, \nthe State of Vermont spends approximately $33 million to provide \nworking families with access to child care and to improve the quality \nof child care around the State. For a small State like Vermont, this is \na lot of money, but is hardly sufficient to provide the type of access \nand quality necessary to make sure all kids enter school ready to \nlearn. The State would need an additional $40 to $50 million to \neffectuate real change.\n  And further, due to the recent economic downturn, a majority of the \nStates has reported revenues well below expected levels. Accordingly, \nwhile the States want to do more to further the quality and \naccessibility of child care, many States will actually have less money \nto spend on helping families with quality care and education. Again, \nthe President has proposed no additional funding to help States provide \nfamilies with quality child care. On the contrary, we must \nsignificantly increase funding for child care to help States and local \ncommunities provide this vital support to working families and their \nchildren.\n  I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of the new Access to High \nQuality Child Care Act of 2002.\n  The 2002 ACCESS Act not only helps provide families with greater \naccess to child care, but also significantly raises the bar on the \nquality of child care in this country. The 2002 ACCESS Act provides \nStates with real resources to help them improve the quality of child \ncare for working families. It allows for great flexibility, yet holds \nStates accountable for making real quality improvements.\n  Research shows that qualified and well-trained providers are critical \nto supporting and enhancing the cognitive and social development of \nchildren in child care. The 2002 ACCESS Act helps States strengthen the \nquality of the child care workforce by setting aside a dedicated \nportion of funds to support State initiatives that improve both the \nqualifications and the compensation of child care providers.\n  The ACCESS Act also helps States increase child care provider \nreimbursement rates to more accurately reflect the true cost of care. \nIt helps States provide training and technical assistance to informal \nand family child care providers as well as center-based providers. It \nhelps States develop and expand resource and referral services. It \nhelps families gain access to quality child care for infants and \ntoddlers, and children with special needs. It provides oversight to \nchild care centers situated on Federal property. And, the ACCESS Act \nalso helps States leverage funding to provide technical assistance, and \nshare in the cost of construction and improvement of child care \nfacilities and equipment.\n  I believe that we all recognize that the foundation for learning \nbegins in the earliest years of life. However, a failure to nurture \ndevelopment in these early years is a lost opportunity forever. The \n2002 ACCESS Act provides States and local communities with a real \nopportunity to nurture that development and improve the quality of care \nfor our youngest children in this country so that all of our children \nenter school ready to learn. I urge my colleagues to support this bold, \nyet critical initiative, so that indeed, every child truly has an \nopportunity to learn.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenators SNOWE and DODD, in introducing the Access to High Quality \nChild Care Act, ACCESS. This legislation would reauthorize the Child \nCare and Development Block Grant through 2007 and rename it the ACCESS \nAct.\n  We all know that our children are the most vulnerable members of our \npopulation and our most valuable resources. Today, 75 percent of \nchildren less than five years of age are in some kind of regular \nchildcare arrangement. Parents need to feel confident that the people \ncaring for their children are giving the love and support that children \ndeserve. The bill we are introducing today would help give parents that \nkind of piece of mind.\n  There are two pieces of the ACCESS Act that I would like to focus on \nbecause they are vital to improving the accessibility of high quality \ncare. Last year, Senator Dodd and I introduced the Child Care \nFacilities Financing Act, which uses small investments to help leverage \nexisting community resources. In my home State of Ohio, and throughout \nthe country, resources for the development or enhancement of space are \nextremely scarce for childcare facilities. This leveraging approach has \nbeen successful in helping expand childcare capacity. Let me give you \nan example.\n  Wonder World in Akron, OH, is an urban childcare center located in an \nold church. This facility was in dire need of repairs. The upstairs \nspace was poorly lit and not well ventilated, and the downstairs was a \ndamp basement. The childcare rooms had no windows and no direct access \nto bathrooms or a kitchen. There was no outdoor play space. This \nenvironment, itself, had a negative effect on the children, no matter \nhow dedicated the caregivers. In spite of these dismal conditions, the \ncenter had a waiting list. There were no other choices for affordable \nchildcare facilities within the community!\n  Fortunately, in Ohio, we have the Ohio Community Development Finance \nFund, OCDFF, which is a statewide nonprofit organization that works \nwith local organizations in low-income communities. This fund was able \nto coordinate public and private monies to build a new eight-room \nchildcare facility, a facility that serves approximately 200 children! \nIt is programs like OCDFF that are possible under the Child Care \nFacilities Fund. The ACCESS Act includes the language from the Child \nCare Facilities Fund bill that Senator Dodd and I introduced, which \nauthorizes $50 million dollars for the Child Care Facilities Fund.\n\n[[Page S2591]]\n\n  The second most important part of our ACCESS Act is a section that \ncontains vital language to help provide emergency childcare services. \nThis section would allow parents to access quality care when their \nchildcare provider is sick or has a family emergency. The need for this \ntype of care was made clear by a tragic incident that happened in Ohio, \nwhen little two-year-old Charles Knight's mother had to go to work and \nhad no one available to care for Charles and his siblings.\n  The boy's father was supposed to baby-sit, but he failed to show up \nthat day. Charles' mother tried to find a neighbor or family member to \ncare for her children, but no one was available. Tragically, she made \nthe poor decision to leave her sleeping children unattended, so she \ncould work her 12-hour shift. She thought her boys' father would \neventually show up and baby-sit while she worked.\n  The father never arrived. Charles was able to climb up on the \nbalcony. This young, unsupervised child fell nine stories off the \napartment balcony to his death. His mother was charged with \nmanslaughter, and his father was charged with child neglect.\n  This sad incident just might have been prevented with emergency \nchildcare centers. With access to such a center, Charles' mother could \nhave gone to work knowing her children were safe and secure.\n  Just last month, Summit County, OH, started a program called \nChildCare NOW in response to an alarming spike in child death and \ninjuries. ChildCare NOW is being offered at 17 centers in the Akron-\nCanton area of Ohio. These childcare centers are opening their doors to \nmany parents whose baby-sitter cancels at the last minute. This program \nis not meant as a permanent childcare replacement but when an \n``emergency'' arises, these are safe alternatives to parental care.\n  The language I have included in this bill, emphasizes that local and \nState childcare agencies may use funds on emergency childcare programs, \nprograms like ChildCare NOW. More importantly, the next time a mother \nmust chose between going to work and leaving her children all alone or \nstaying at home and losing a day's pay, she will have a third option, \nto leave her children in an emergency child care center. I think that \nis an important option that we must give to working mothers. It is my \nhope that this language will prevent future tragedies like the death of \ntwo-year-old Charles Knight.\n  Once again, I want to thank Senator Snowe and Senator Dodd for their \nwork on the ACCESS Act. This bill is necessary for parents who work, \nespecially parents who have worked hard to get off welfare. They should \nbe confident that their children are receiving quality care.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \n2002 ACCESS Act. It is imperative that the Congress continue its \ncommitment to low-income families by presenting the President with a \nbipartisan bill reauthorizing the Child Care and Development Block \nGrant.\n  I share the Administration's goal to ``Leave No Child Behind.'' \nChildren should not be the victims of welfare reform, left behind with \ninconsistent child care accommodations that do not adequately prepare \nthem for the challenges to come. It is precisely this cycle of \ndependency and poverty that welfare reform was intended to end.\n  In 1996, we fundamentally changed the mentality of welfare from \ndependence to independence by creating the Temporary Assistance to \nNeedy Families TANF, block grant. At the same time, we made a \ncommitment to poor families that were sent into the work force at low \nwages that they would be supported with access to quality child care.\n  Reliable child care is directly related to job retention. A parent \ncannot be in two places at once, and an employer is not likely to \nretain an employee that is unreliable at work due to a lack of \nconsistent care for their child. It is not just about getting a job, \nthis is about helping families keep their jobs and move up the career \nladder.\n  In Louisiana, I hear over and over again about access to safe and \naffordable child care. The legislation being introduced today will \nensure that child care provided to these families is not only \naffordable, but that it meets certain safety and quality standards to \nensure children are placed in an environment where they can grow and \nlearn.\n  Access to child care is often limited by states to families with the \nlowest incomes. National studies show only 12-15 percent of children \neligible for federally subsidized child care get it. And in many rural \nareas, there are no child care providers at all. So as Congress debates \nincreasing work requirements for people on welfare, the increasing need \nfor working families to have quality child care must also be taken into \nconsideration.\n  I commend Senators Dodd and Snowe for their efforts to increase \naccess to child care for low income families, while improving the \nquality of child care services.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 2118. A bill to amend the Toxic Substances Control Act and the \nFederal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to implement the \nStockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and the Protocol \non Persistent Organic Pollutants to the Convention on Long-Range \nTransboundary Air Pollution; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the POPs \nImplementation Act of 2002.\n  POPs, or persistent organic pollutants, are chemicals that are \npersistent, bioaccumulate in human and animal tissue, biomagnify \nthrough the food chain, and are toxic to humans. These substances \ntravel across international boundaries, creating a circle of pollution \nrequiring a global solution.\n  In April 2001, one year ago, President Bush announced his support for \nthe Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, POPs, and in \nMay 2001, the U.S. signed the Convention. I share the President's \nenthusiasm for this sound and workable treaty that targets chemicals \ndetrimental to human health and the environment.\n  The Stockholm Convention seeks the elimination or restriction of \nproduction and use of all intentionally produced POPs. The POPs that \nare to be initially eliminated include the pesticides aldrin, \nchlordane, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, mirex, and toxaphene, and the \nindustrial chemicals hexachlorobenzene and polychlorinated biphenyls, \nPCBs. Use of the pesticide DDT is limited to disease control until \nsafe, effective, and affordable alternatives are identified. The \nConvention also seeks the continuing minimization and, where feasible, \nultimate elimination of releases of unintentionally produced POPs such \nas dioxins and furans.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill to amend the Toxic Substances Control \nAct, TSCA, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, \nFIFRA, to implement the Stockholm Convention on POPs and the Protocol \non POPs to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. \nThese are the first amendments to TSCA since its enactment in October \n1976.\n  Currently in the U.S., the registrations for nine of the twelve POPs \ncovered by the Stockholm Convention have been canceled, the manufacture \nof PCBs has been banned, and stringent controls have been placed on the \nrelease of the other covered chemicals. The POPs Implementation Act of \n2002 provides EPA with the authority, which it currently does not have, \nto prohibit the manufacture for export of the twelve POPs and POPs that \nare identified in the future. In addition, this legislation provides a \nscience-based process consistent with the Stockholm Convention for \nlisting additional chemicals exhibiting POPs characteristics, thereby \nattempting to avoid the further production and use of POPs. To assist \nin this goal, the National Academy of Sciences is directed to develop \nnew strategies to screen candidate POPs and new sampling methodologies \nto identify future POPs.\n  Although a previous EPA draft included a mechanism for adding new \nchemicals, the Administration's current POPs implementation package \ndoes not. The Stockholm Convention was not intended to be a static \nagreement, as it explicitly provides for the additional of new \nchemicals. If we are to be most effective in globally reducing these \ndangerous chemicals, we must fully commit to this treaty.\n\n[[Page S2592]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 2119. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the tax treatment of inverted corporate entities and of \ntransactions with such entities, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise today to offer a bill on behalf \nof Senator Baucus and myself, to address the growing problem of \ncorporate inversions. Our legislation, the ``Reversing the Expatriation \nof Profits Offshore,'' REPO Act, will stem the rising tide of corporate \ninversions.\n  It's tax season. Citizens across America are filing their taxes this \nweek. They're paying their taxes. A lot of taxes. But some corporate \ncitizens are relaxing this tax season. They've moved their mailing \naddress out of the country. They've set up a filing cabinet and a mail \nbox overseas. This way, they escape from millions of dollars of Federal \ntaxes.\n  These corporate expatriations aren't illegal. But they're sure \nimmoral. During a war on terrorism, coming out of a recession, everyone \nought to be pulling together. But instead, these companies are using \nrecession and terrorism to get out of the United States. If companies \ndon't have their hearts in America, they ought to get out.\n  Adding insult to injury, some of these companies have fat contracts \nwith the government. So they'll take other people's tax dollars to make \na profit, but they won't pay their share of taxes to keep America \nstrong.\n  The bill Chairman Baucus and I are introducing today will place \ncorporate inversions on the endangered species list. Our bill requires \nthe IRS to look at where a company has its heart and soul, not where it \nhas a filing cabinet and a mail box. If a company remains controlled in \nthe United States, our bill requires the company to pay its fair share \nof taxes, plain and simple.\n  When I am firmly committed to halting corporate inversions, I also \nrecognize that the rising tide of corporate expatriations demonstrates \nthat our international tax rules are deeply flawed. In many cases, \nthose flaws seriously undermine an American company's ability to \ncompete in the global marketplace. This competitive disadvantage is \noften cited by companies that engage in inversion transactions.\n  I believe that we need to bring our international tax system in line \nwith our open market trade policies, and wish to affirm for the record \nthat reform of our international tax laws is necessary for our U.S. \nbusinesses to remain competitive in the global marketplace. Moreover, \nthose U.S. companies that rejected doing a corporate inversion are left \nto struggle with the complexity and competitive impediments of our \ninternational tax rules. This is an unjust result for companies that \nchose to remain in the United States of America. I am committed to \nremedying this inequity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na technical explanation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2119\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Following is a brief summary of the \n     REPO Act.\n       In general, this legislation would curtail the tax benefits \n     sought by U.S. companies undertaking inversion transactions. \n     The legislation would apply to two types of inversion \n     transactions, which would be subject to different regimes \n     under the proposal.\n       The first type would be a ``pure'' or nearly pure \n     inversion, in which: 1. a U.S. corporation becomes a \n     subsidiary of a foreign corporation or otherwise transfers \n     substantially all of its properties to a foreign corporation; \n     2. the former shareholders of the U.S. corporation end up \n     with 80 percent or more (by vote or value) of the stock of \n     the foreign corporation after the transaction; and 3. the \n     foreign corporation, including its subsidiaries, does not \n     have substantial business activities in its country of \n     incorporation. The legislation would deny the intended tax \n     benefits of this type of inversion by deeming the top-tier \n     foreign corporation to be a domestic corporation for all \n     purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. This proposal would be \n     effective as to inversion transactions occurring on or after \n     March 21, 2002.\n       For purposes of this proposal, corporations with no \n     significant operating assets, few or no permanent employees, \n     or no significant real property in the foreign country of \n     incorporation would not be treated as meeting the substantial \n     business activities test. In addition, companies would not be \n     considered to be conducting substantial business activities \n     in the country of incorporation by merely holding board \n     meetings in the foreign country or by relocating a limited \n     number of executives to the foreign jurisdiction.\n       The second type of inversion covered by the legislation \n     would be a transaction similar to the ``pure'' inversion \n     defined above, except that the 80 percent ownership threshold \n     is not met. In such a case, if a greater-than-50 percent but \n     less than 80 percent ownership threshold is met, then a \n     second set of rules would apply to these ``limited'' \n     inversions.\n       Under these rules, the inversion transaction would be \n     respected, i.e., the foreign corporation would be respected \n     as foreign, but: 1. the corporate-level ``toll charge'' for \n     establishing the inverted structure would be strengthened, \n     and 2. restrictions would be placed on the company's ability \n     to reduce U.S. tax on U.S.-source income going forward. These \n     measures generally would apply for a 10-year period following \n     the inversion. This prong of the proposal would be effective \n     as to inversion transactions in this second category \n     occurring on or after March 21, 2002. It would also be \n     effective as to all structures arising from pure inversions \n     or limited inversions that are grandfathered under the \n     legislation, but it would be applied to those structures \n     prospectively.\n       Under the legislation, the corporate-level ``toll charge'' \n     imposed under sections 304, 311(b), 367, 1001, 1248, or any \n     other provision of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to \n     the transfer of controlled foreign corporation stock or other \n     assets from a U.S. corporation to a foreign corporation would \n     be taxable, without offset by any other tax attributes, e.g., \n     net operating losses or foreign tax credits. No similar \n     ``walling-off'' of toll charges would apply to shareholder-\n     level toll charges imposed under section 367(a).\n\n[[Page S2594]]\n\n       In addition, no deductions or additions to basis or cost of \n     goods sold for transactions with foreign related parties \n     would be permitted unless the taxpayer concludes an annual \n     pre-filing agreement, advance pricing agreement, or other \n     agreement with the IRS, a ``preapproval agreement'', to \n     ensure that all related-party transactions comply with all \n     relevant provisions of the Code, including sections 482, 845, \n     163(j), and 267(a)(3). Similarly, the transfer or license of \n     intangible property from a U.S. corporation to a related \n     foreign corporation would be disregarded, and cost-sharing \n     arrangements would not be respected unless approved under \n     such an agreement.\n       The confidentiality and disclosure rules normally \n     applicable to advance pricing agreements would apply to all \n     preapproval agreements entered into pursuant to this \n     legislation, and the parameters for the IRS's statutorily \n     required annual APA report would be amended to require a \n     summary section for inversion transactions.\n       The second set of measures also includes modifications to \n     the ``earnings stripping'' rules of section 163(j) (which \n     deny or defer deductions for certain interest paid to foreign \n     related parties), as applied to inverted corporations. The \n     legislation would eliminate the debt-equity threshold \n     generally applicable under that provision and reduce the 50 \n     percent threshold for ``excess interest expense'' to 25 \n     percent.\n       The provisions of both prongs of this legislation also \n     would apply to certain partnership transactions similar to \n     corporate inversion transactions.\n       The legislation also strengthens the present-law rules of \n     section 845(a) in a manner intended to address reinsurance \n     transactions with foreign related parties that have the \n     effect of stripping out earnings of a U.S. corporation, \n     regardless of whether an inversion transaction has occurred. \n     The legislation modifies the present-law provision permitting \n     the Treasury Department to allocate or recharacterize items \n     of investment income, premiums, deductions, assets, reserves, \n     credits or other items, or to make other adjustments, under a \n     reinsurance agreement between related parties, if necessary \n     to reflect the proper source and character of income. The \n     legislation permits such an allocation, recharacterization or \n     adjustment if necessary to reflect the proper amount, source \n     or character of income. This provision would be effective for \n     any risk reinsured after April 11, 2002.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I am pleased to be a co-sponsor, with \nSenator Grassley, of this important piece of legislation. Our \nlegislation, Reversing the Expatriation of Profits Offshore, (REPO), \nAct, is designed to put the brakes on the potential rush to move U.S. \ncorporate headquarters to tax havens, through increasingly popular \ntransactions known as corporate inversions. Prominent U.S. companies \nare literally re-incorporating in off-shore tax havens in order to \navoid U.S. taxes. They are, in effect, renouncing their U.S. \ncitizenship to cut their tax bill.\n  Tax avoidance costs honest taxpayers tens of billions of dollars each \nyear. When one taxpayer, whether a corporation or an individual, \ndoesn't pay their fair share of taxes, we all pay. The REPO Act cracks \ndown on corporations that avoid taxes at the expense of honest, \nhardworking American taxpayers.\n  The local hardware store in Butte, MT, isn't re-incorporating in \nBermuda or one of these tax haven countries. He is keeping his company \nan American company. The companies reincorporating in tax haven \ncountries, and their executives, are still physically located in the \nUnited States. Their executives and employees enjoy all the privileges \nafforded to honest U.S. taxpayers.\n  I understand that the corporate inversion issue is complex. I also \nunderstand that, over the long term, we may need to consider whether \nthe structure of the U.S. international tax rules creates an incentive \nfor U.S. corporations to shift their operations abroad in order to \nremain competitive. For now, we are putting a stop to the erosion of \nthe U.S. tax base through these tax avoidance schemes.\n  Our legislation distinguishes between two types of inversions, pure \ninversions and limited inversions. A pure inversion is when a U.S. \ncompany becomes a subsidiary of a foreign company or shifts \nsubstantially all of its properties to a foreign corporation and 80 \npercent of more of the shareholders in the original U.S. company are \nnow shareholders in the new foreign company. The foreign company has no \nsubstantial business activity in the foreign tax haven country. \nCompanies that hold board meetings in the tax haven country or send a \nfew employees or executives to work in the tax haven country will not \nmeet the substantial business activity standard. Under our legislation, \nthe parent company will be treated as a U.S. company.\n  A limited inversion transaction is when more than 50 percent and \nfewer than 80 percent of the shareholders are the same. The new foreign \ncompany is recognized as a foreign company for tax purposes but there \nis a tax cost. The company won't be able to use tax attributes, such as \nnet operating losses and foreign tax credits, to offset the gain \nincurred upon inverting. Finally, the company won't be able to strip \nearnings out of the U.S. to avoid U.S. taxes.\n  This week is the last week leading up to the April 15 tax filing \ndeadline. Families in Montana and across the nation are sitting down at \ntheir kitchen tables, or at their home computers, and figuring out \ntheir taxes. The calculations may be complex, the tax bite may seem \nhigh, but by and large, with quiet patriotism, average Americans will \nstep up and pay the tax they owe.

Madam President, my friends on the other side of the \naisle have defended the slow pace of the judicial confirmation process \nby saying their treatment of President Bush's nominees compares \nfavorably with precedents. I had the Congressional Research Service \nlook into this, and their research showed this is clearly not the case. \nThis Congress's treatment of President Bush's judicial nominees \ncompares quite poorly, at all stages of the confirmation process, with \nthe treatment that prior Congresses afforded the judicial nominees of \nPresident Bush's four predecessors during their first Congress.\n  It has done a poor job with respect to confirming both district and \nappellate court nominees, but it has been particularly bad with regard \nto circuit court nominees, which is what I am going to talk about \ntonight.\n  From Jimmy Carter through Bill Clinton, over 90 percent of the \ncircuit court nominees received a Judiciary Committee hearing during \nthe President's first Congress. This is illustrated by this chart. \nDuring President Carter's term, 100 percent of his circuit court \nnominees received a hearing during his first Congress. Under President \nReagan, 95 percent--19 out of 20 circuit court nominees--received a \nhearing during his first Congress. Under the first President Bush, 95.7 \npercent of his nominees for the circuit courts--22 out of 23--received \na hearing during the first Bush's Presidency. During President \nClinton's first Congress, 91 percent, or 20 of 22 circuit court \nnominees received a hearing during the first Congress.\n  Now we are in the second session of the first Congress under \nPresident George W. Bush, and only 10 of 29 circuit court nominees have \neven received a hearing, for a percentage of 34.5 percent.\n  What is going on here in the Senate with regard to even giving a \nhearing to circuit court judicial nominees is simply without precedent.\n  No President has been treated so poorly in recent memory--not even a \nhearing. Ten of the 29 circuit court nominees of President George W. \nBush have not even received a hearing. By contrast, only about one-\nthird of President Bush's circuit court nominees have received a \nhearing.\n  With respect to receiving a Judiciary Committee vote, looking at it a \ndifferent way, from Jimmy Carter through Bill Clinton at least 86 \npercent of circuit court nominees received a Judiciary Committee vote.\n  During President Carter's first Congress, 100 percent of his nominees \nfor the circuit court received a vote in committee.\n  During President Reagan's first Congress, 95 percent of his circuit \ncourt nominees--19 out of 20--received a vote of the committee.\n  During the first President Bush's first Congress, 22 of 23 received a \ncommittee vote. That is 95.7 percent.\n  During President Bill Clinton's first Congress, 86.4 percent of his \ncircuit court nominees--19 out of 22--received a Judiciary Committee \nvote during his first 2 years. Of course, those were years during which \nhis party also controlled the Senate.\n  During the first 2 years of President George W. Bush, only 27.6 \npercent--or 8 out of 29--of the nominees for circuit courts received a \nJudiciary Committee vote--very shabby treatment and certainly \nunprecedented in recent times.\n  With respect to Senate floor votes, at least 86 percent of circuit \ncourt nominees from the administration of President Jimmy Carter \nthrough President Bill Clinton got a full Senate vote.\n  Looking at President Carter's first 2 years, 100 percent of his \nnominees for the circuit court received a Senate vote.\n\n  Looking at President Reagan's first 2 years, 95 percent of his \nnominees received a Senate vote.\n  Looking at the first President Bush circuit court nominees during the \nfirst 2 years, 95.7--or 22 out of 23--got a full Senate vote. Of \ncourse, that was when the Senate was controlled by the opposition party \nunder the first President Bush.\n  President Clinton in his first 2 years in office, 86.4 percent--or 19 \nout of 22--of the circuit court nominees got a full Senate vote. Of \ncourse that was during a period where President Clinton's own party \ncontrolled the Senate.\n  Looking at the first 2 years of President George W. Bush, to this \npoint,\n\n[[Page S2602]]\n\nonly 24.1 percent of the nominees to the circuit courts have received a \nfull Senate vote--only 7 of 29.\n  This is really unprecedented, shabby treatment of President Bush's \ncircuit court nominees.\n  The final chart shows comprehensively how poorly we are doing right \nnow at all stages of the process in moving circuit court nominees.\n  Looking at it in terms of hearings, committee votes, or full Senate \nvotes, during a President's first 2 years in office, the picture tells \nthe story.\n  Under President Carter, 100 percent received both a hearing, a \ncommittee vote, and a full Senate vote during his first 2 years.\n  During President Reagan, 95 percent of his nominees received a \nhearing, a committee vote, and a full Senate vote.\n  The first President Bush, 95.7 percent of his nominees got all \nthree--a hearing, a committee vote, and a full Senate vote.\n  President Clinton: 91 percent of his nominees in his first 2 years--\nagain, remembering that President Clinton's party controlled the Senate \nhis first 2 years--91 percent received a hearing in committee, and 86.4 \npercent received a vote both in committee and in the full Senate.\n  Then, looking at President George W. Bush, only 34.5 percent of his \nnominees for circuit court--a mere 10 out of 29--have even been given a \nhearing in committee, only 27.6 percent have been given votes in \ncommittee, and only 24 percent--a mere 7 out of 29--have been given \nvotes in the full Senate.\n  This is a very poor record that I think begins to become a national \nissue. At the rate this is going, I think it will be discussed all \nacross our country in the course of the Senate elections this fall.\n  It is pretty clear that we are not doing a very good job of filling \nvacancies, particularly the 19 percent of vacancies that exist at the \ncircuit court level, and 50 percent of the vacancies that exist in my \nown State of Kentucky.\n  We did have a markup for a lone circuit court nominee this morning, \nand we had a confirmation hearing this afternoon for another lone \ncircuit court nominee. I suppose that is a step in the right direction. \nSome progress is certainly, of course, better than none. But if we are \ngoing to address the major vacancy problem on the appellate courts, we \nmust have more than one circuit court nominee per confirmation hearing, \nand we must have more than one circuit court nominee at a markup.\n  Furthermore, we are going to have to have regular hearings and \nregular markups for circuit court nominees. Before today, for example, \nit had been 4 weeks since we had a markup. Thus, in the 2 weeks prior \nto recess, we had only one markup with only one circuit court nominee \non the agenda. And that nominee was, in fact, defeated on a party-line \nvote. When Senator Hatch was chairman, 10 times he held hearings with \nmore than one circuit court nominee on the agenda. With the circuit \ncourt vacancy rate approaching 20 percent, this is something we should \nbe doing now as well.\n\n  In sum, we need to do a better job in the confirmation process, \nparticularly with respect to circuit court nominees.\n  These historical precedents give us a reasonable goal to which to \naspire, and we need to redouble our efforts to meet past practices.\n  I might say in closing that we have a particular crisis in the Sixth \nJudicial Circuit, which includes the States of Michigan, Ohio, \nKentucky, and Tennessee. The Sixth Circuit is 50-percent vacant. Eight \nout of 16 seats are not filled--not because there haven't been \nnominations. Seven of the eight nominations are before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. A couple of them have been there for almost a \nyear. No hearings have been held. We have a judicial emergency in the \nSixth Circuit.\n  I think this needs to be talked about. Regretfully, our record is \nquite sorry. We have some months left to be in session. Hopefully, this \nwill improve as the weeks roll along.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded and that I be recognized to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/11/senate-section/article/S2602-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2602-S2603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PIPELINE AND TRANSMISSION STREAMLINING\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I would like to spend a few minutes \ntoday talking about an amendment that I filed on the energy bill, \namendment No. 3116. It is titled the ``Integrated Review of Energy \nDelivery Systems Act of 2002.''\n  This amendment, which Senator Landrieu has cosponsored, will \nstreamline the siting process for energy pipelines and transmission \nlines.\n  As my colleagues know, one of the biggest challenges we face in \nensuring that we have a consistent energy policy is ensuring we get \nenergy to where it is needed. One of the problems we have had in \nprevious winters has been the inability of energy supply to meet the \ndemand solely because of bottlenecks in the distribution system.\n  Unless we address the situation, each winter places such as the \nnortheastern part of the United States will continue to face high \nspikes in prices because their electric power grid and their pipeline \nsystem are both severely overtaxed. Removing this bottleneck will help \nstem huge potential problems down the road.\n  The Presiding Officer knows that one of the concerns we had last year \nwas whether or not we would be able to get electricity into New York, \ninto the Presiding Officer's part of the country, because of the issue \nof transmission lines. We were fortunate last summer was not that hot \nand the demand was not up, so there were not any brownouts or \nblackouts. But it is very important we move forward with siting these \ntransmission lines so we can get power into the areas that need them.\n\n  The amendment Senator Landrieu and I have written would require all \nFederal agencies to coordinate the environmental reviews of energy \npipelines and transmission lines so that the reviews take place \nsimultaneously and a decision can be reached quickly on whether to move \nforward with the projects.\n  This amendment does not change underlying environmental statutes, nor \ndoes it change the environmental standards used for approving these \nprojects. All current and future environmental laws are not changed by \nthe amendment. Let me repeat that: Current and future environmental \nlaws are not changed.\n  This amendment is based on a bill I introduced last year, S. 1580, \nthe Environmental Streamlining of Energy Facilities Act of 2001, which \nwould have applied to all energy facilities.\n  The idea for this amendment is from the environmental streamlining \nprovisions of the highway bill, TEA-21. In that legislation, an \namendment offered by Senators Wyden, Graham, and Bob Smith required the \nTransportation Department to coordinate all environmental reviews for \nhighway projects so that the reviews would take place at the same time, \nsaving years on major highway projects.\n  What we are trying to do today is apply this same concept to the \nbuilding of pipelines and transmission lines. Today we are facing a \nshortage of pipelines, and it is becoming more difficult every day to \nsite transmission lines. While this amendment would not change the laws \nof eminent domain or the environmental standards, what it will do is \nhelp expedite the review process.\n  I would like to briefly outline the provisions of my amendment.\n  First, we designate one lead agency to coordinate the review process. \nTo eliminate the duplication efforts by agencies with oversight for the \nconstruction, operation, and maintenance of pipelines and transmission \nlines, a single Federal agency would be identified to coordinate all \nrequired paperwork and research for the environmental review of a \nproposed pipeline or transmission system.\n  The agencies involved in this process would include the Environmental \nProtection Agency, the Department of Energy, FERC, the Army Corps of \nEngineers, and the Department of Transportation's Office of Pipeline \nSafety.\n  Agencies with partial oversight for a project would provide \ninformation from their area of expertise, while the\n\n[[Page S2603]]\n\nlead agency would be responsible for establishing the deadlines, \nfacilitating communication between the agencies, and defining the role \nof participating agencies during the environmental review process.\n  The lead agency, along with the Governor of the State where the \napplication for the facility has been made, would work together to \nprovide early notification to the public in order to identify and \naddress any environmental concerns associated with the proposed system.\n  If there appears to be an environmental concern related to the \npermitting, the Council on Environmental Quality, in conjunction with \nthe heads of the lead agency and participating agencies, would work \ntogether to resolve the matter within 30 days.\n  The problem is, when differences of opinion arise, it can take \nforever for these differences to be resolved. What we are suggesting in \nthis legislation is that they would be brought to the Council on \nEnvironmental Quality, and they would sit down with the lead agency and \nparticipating agencies, and they would work together to get a \nresolution within 30 days.\n  The amendment directs coordination between the Federal, State, and \nlocal governments on particular projects. After a lead agency is \nappointed, it would be required to coordinate the environmental review \nprocess with input from Federal, State, and local governments. This \nincludes the preparation of environmental impact statements, review \nanalysis, opinions, determinations, or authorizations required under \nFederal law.\n  The amendment also allows for Federal delegation to the States. At \nthe request of a Governor, and with the agreement of the applicant, a \nState agency may assume the role of lead agency. The Federal agency \nwould delegate to the State agency the authority to prepare the Federal \nenvironmental impact statement or other environmental assessment \nfollowing the procedures for a Federal lead agency.\n  Where there is a delegation of authority to the State, the lead \nagency continues to provide guidance and participation in preparing the \nfinal version of the environmental impact statement or environmental \nassessment. The lead Federal agency must also provide an independent \nevaluation of the statement or assessment prior to its approval.\n  Finally, the standard of review under State and Federal laws relating \nto the siting or construction or operation of a pipeline or \ntransmission line would not be preempted, and the lead Federal agency \nis authorized to provide funding to the State when they assume the \nFederal responsibility.\n  It is vital that we act on the problem of expediting the siting of \npipelines and transmission lines. This is a problem that plagues the \nentire country, including my home State of Ohio. However, in my view, \nthe region which probably needs this provision the most is the \nNortheast.\n  According to a study by ISO New England Corporation, the nonprofit \noperator of New England's power grid has said that New England is \nincreasing its natural gas demand from 16 percent in 1999, to a \nprojected 45-percent demand in 2005. Unfortunately, they lack the local \npipelines to distribute that gas to their markets.\n  The study says that there is no worry about any blackouts, unless \nnothing has changed one year from now. Three of the changes they need \nare: New gas-fired plants should be allowed to develop the ability to \nburn oil as a backup. The second is the regional pipeline system has to \nbe expanded. And third, new compressors need to be added to existing \npipelines to increase delivery capacity. So there is a genuine need \nthere to move forward with providing pipelines so they can get gas into \nthe Northeast, s ISO stated in its report issued in January of last \nyear.\n\n  The chairman of the ISO New England, Mr. William Berry, said:\n\n       The long and complicated federal permitting process for \n     building new interstate pipelines is a greater obstacle than \n     the technical construction work.\n\n  The amendment Senator Landrieu and I introduced will help speed up, \nas Mr. Berry calls it, ``the long and complicated federal permitting \nprocess,'' and it will do so without jeopardizing any environmental \nprotections and without changing any of our current environmental laws.\n  This amendment is supported by the American Gas Association, the \nAmerican Chemistry Council, the Edison Electric Institute, the \nInterstate Natural Gas Association of America, the Association of Oil \nPipelines, and the National Association of Manufacturers.\n  This is a commonsense approach to requiring our Federal agencies to \nwork together to get the permitting decisions considered at the same \ntime. According to the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, \nthe United States will need 49,500 miles of new natural gas \ntransmission lines between now and 2015. That is just to keep up with \nthe large projected increase in demand for natural gas. It is also \nprojected that our demand for natural gas will increase by 50 percent \nby the year 2020.\n  We need to act today to ensure that our energy can be delivered to \nAmerican homes tomorrow. I hope this amendment will be accepted and we \ncan move forward with providing both industry and American consumers \nthe confidence that the Federal Government will not be an obstacle to \nthe delivery of energy and that this can be done without changing or \nundermining our environmental laws.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/11/senate-section/article/S2603-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:30 A.M.
