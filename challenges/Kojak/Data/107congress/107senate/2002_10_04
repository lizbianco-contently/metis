Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of S.J. Res. 45, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 45) to authorize the use of \n     United States Armed Forces against Iraq.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 11:30 a.m. shall be equally divided between the two leaders or \ntheir designees, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 \nminutes each.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 46 to \nauthorize the use of U.S. Armed Forces against Saddam Hussein's Regime \nin Iraq.\n  This bipartisan resolution would enable the President to take \nnecessary action in order to defend our Nation and our people against \nIraq and any other threatening terrorist nation or organization.\n  I believe it will pass Congress by broad bipartisan support and send \na signal to the world that America stands united behind our President.\n  This vote will be one of the most important--if not the most \nimportant--that I or any of my colleagues will ever take in Congress.\n  Nothing is more sobering or serious than voting to send troops into \nbattle and committing our Nation to war.\n  As the President said the other day, war is not our first choice. In \nfact, it is our last choice.\n  Having this debate and making this vote is something that none of us \nwants but in the end, I am afraid that we have no other choice.\n  The case against Saddam Hussein is clear. We can no longer tolerate \nhim and the threat that he poses not only to us, but to his neighbors, \nthe Middle East and the entire world.\n  To do anything else would be to repeat the mistakes of the past and \nto bury our heads in the sand.\n\n[[Page S9934]]\n\n  After September 11, we cannot afford to simply sit on our hands. Now \nis the time to take bold and decisive action in our own self-defense.\n  The arguments against Saddam Hussein are compelling, and I believe \nthe President made a convincing case when he spoke to the United \nNations about Saddam's contempt for the rest of the world.\n  Eleven years ago after he was defeated in the Gulf War, Saddam \nsuspended hostilities and agreed to a series of commitments to help \nbring peace and stability to the Middle East.\n  He has broken each of these commitments.\n  In 1991, U.N. Security Council Resolution 688 demanded Saddam cease \nrepression and torture of his own people.\n  He broke that promise.\n  Also in 1991, the Security Council passed resolutions demanding that \nIraq return all prisoners from Kuwait and other lands. Saddam Hussein \nbroke that promise also.\n  The U.N. Security Council, through Resolution 687, demanded that Iraq \nrenounce all involvement with terrorism and permit no terrorist \norganizations to operate in Iraq. Saddam not only broke that promise, \nbut he continues to harbor terrorists, including al-Qaida leaders who \nfled from Afghanistan.\n  Most importantly, after the Gulf War, Iraq promised to destroy and to \nstop the development of weapons of mass murder and agreed to \ninspections by the world community. Once again, Saddam Hussein broke \nthat promise. In fact, U.N. officials believe Iraq has produced tons of \nbiological and chemical agents and failed to account for more than 3 \nmetric tons of material that could be used to produce biological \nweapons.\n  In 1995, Iraq finally admitted it had a nuclear weapons program prior \nto the Gulf War.\n  And up to now, Iraq continues to withhold important information about \nits nuclear program. We know Iraq is working on rebuilding its nuclear \ncapability.\n  After the Gulf War, Saddam promised to allow for a vigorous series of \ninspections of his military programs.\n  But for 7 years, we watched, on almost a daily basis, as the Iraqi \nGovernment bobbed and weaved and did everything in its power to delay, \nstop and confuse the inspectors.\n  Finally, in 1998, Saddam kicked the United Nations Inspectors out of \nIraq altogether. Once again, he broke his promise.\n  All in all, Iraq has failed to abide by 16 U.N. Security Council \nresolutions. Saddam has broken his word at every opportunity.\n  There is an old saying: ``fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, \nshame on me.''\n  I don't see how we can let Saddam fool us again. There is absolutely \nno doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein cannot be trusted.\n  The time for inspections, diplomacy, and delay has passed. It is time \nfor us to act.\n  Many in Congress believe we should not use force against terrorist \nnations such as Iraq without approval from the United Nations or our \nallies.\n  I believe this resolution takes the right approach and addresses \ntheir concerns.\n  It says that we should do all we can to work with our friends and the \nUnited Nations to address the menace of Saddam Hussein.\n  But it does not tie our hands and preserves our right to act in self-\ndefense.\n  In trying to resolve tensions with Iraq, America has gone the extra \nmile. And I believe that our allies and the U.N. have done so as well.\n  We have done all that we can to ensure a peaceful resolution of \ndisputes with Saddam.\n  And I support Secretary Powell's continuing efforts to reach out to \nthe security council and the rest of the world to find a way to bring \npeace to the Middle East without using violence.\n  But I do not believe that in the end you can negotiate with a madman.\n  Sooner or later, we are going to have to act, and we should pass this \nresolution to give the President every tool at his disposal to prevail \nin this struggle with evil.\n  I know that some of my colleagues and many in the world community \nworry that America is acting without provocation and that we should not \npreemptively attack another Nation.\n  I have to disagree with them on two grounds.\n  First, we have already been attacked.\n  Last September 11 was the bloodiest day in our history. We have \nalready lost 3,000 of our friends and neighbors.\n  Many of those involved in planning and carrying out those attacks are \nnow living in Iraq.\n  In fact, Saddam Hussein has openly praised their actions.\n  We are not acting preemptively. We are reacting to an assault on our \nNation and our people.\n  Second, in the case of Saddam Hussein, he has made it clear many, \nmany times already that he will attack us as soon as he feels he can \neffectively do so.\n  His past actions against his neighbors and even his own people prove \nhe is a man of his word.\n  To say now that we should wait and not act first is foolhardy and \nnaive.\n  In the wake of September 11, we have a choice. We can either act or \nwe can wait and react.\n  I do not think we should sit like children on the beach and simply \nwait for the tide to come in and wash us away.\n  We should act now to protect ourselves and our Nation.\n  Some have even made the argument that attacking Saddam would \ndestabilize the Middle East and lead to further tensions in that \nsensitive part of the world.\n  But I cannot imagine a more destabilizing and threatening menace than \nSaddam.\n  This is one time where that old saying ``The devil you know is better \nthan the devil you don't'' is wrong--dead wrong.\n  After all, under Saddam's rule, Iraq has used nerve gas and other \nweapons of repression to slaughter tens of thousands of its own people.\n  It used chemical weapons over and over during its war with Iran in \nthe 1980s.\n  Saddam has launched ballistic missiles at four of his neighbors--\nIsrael, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain.\n  He has had his followers assassinate opponents in Iraq and abroad.\n  During the Gulf War, his regime beat and tortured Americans and used \nthem as ``Human Shields.''\n  And on almost a daily basis Iraq continues to fire missiles and \nartillery at U.S. and coalition aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones in \nNorthern and Southern Iraq--no-fly zones that Saddam agreed to after \nthe Gulf War.\n  Looking at the evidence, I cannot imagine anything more destabilizing \nand threatening than the status quo.\n  Some say wait and let the U.N. pass another resolution. They argue \nthat more inspections and towing a tougher line against Saddam will \nwork this time.\n  But surely Saddam is not going to adhere to the 17th resolution after \nignoring the first 16.\n  Finally, those who make the argument about preemption say we need \nmore proof--that we can't act first without a smoking gun.\n  Even if they ignore all of the evidence, I would still argue that the \nlast thing we want is a smoking gun.\n  A gun only smokes after it is fired and our goal and fight must be to \nprevent Saddam from firing that weapon.\n  I have heard the arguments from the opponents of this resolution say \nthat we should wait and deal with Saddam after the upcoming November \nelection.\n  They say this issue smacks of politics and that President Bush is \nusing the war as a political tool in this next election.\n  Some have even had harsh words for President Bush on this issue and \nat times I wonder who they think the real enemy is--President Bush or \nSaddam.\n  I believe that politics should not be part of this debate from either \nparty.\n  This debate is about war and peace, not petty political squabbles.\n  The congress should vote now and the President should act when it \nwould be most effective to end Saddam's evil regime.\n  I don't know if that's today, tomorrow, the day after the election, \nor some other time in the near future.\n  But I will give the Commander-in-Chief and our military leaders the \nbenefit of the doubt.\n  What is most important is that we do this right and launch our \nassault when it will be most effective.\n  The longer we wait, the more time this mad man has to hatch his evil \nplots.\n\n[[Page S9935]]\n\n  There are risks in acting. But there are more risks in not acting.\n  In conclusion, I urge support for the resolution.\n  The evidence is clear. And the arguments against acting do not stand \nup to hard-headed reality.\n  Saddam Hussein is a deadly threat, a threat we have ignored, put off \nand used every excuse for not finally dealing with for too long.\n  We cannot afford to wait anymore. After September 11, the world has \nchanged. It is time for us to act. It is time for us to be bold.\n  God bless this republic and our Great People.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak for up to 30 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Resolution on Iraq\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in \nsupport of an alternative resolution which I will be introducing, and \nto explain why I believe it is the right way to go, and is a better \nalternative than the White House approach.\n  At the outset, it must be noted that whatever differences there may \nbe among us, the one thing which we can all agree upon is Saddam \nHussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the \nMiddle East. He has used weapons of mass destruction against his own \npeople and against Iran. He has launched invasions of Iran and Kuwait. \nFor the last 11 years, he has defied the will of the entire world, as \nexpressed in United Nations security resolutions, by refusing to \ndestroy his weapons of mass destruction and prohibited ballistic \nmissiles.\n  Another point which I believe there is a consensus on among Members \nof the Senate is the fact that confronting the threat posed by Saddam \nHussein could lead to committing U.S. military forces, including ground \nforces, into combat, and that the vote we take on a resolution relating \nto Iraq may be the most important vote we make this year.\n  Whether we commit our forces to attack Iraq as part of a United \nNations authorized coalition, or whether we go it alone, could have \nimmense consequences for our security and for future peace and \nstability in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East and beyond. That is \nwhy I will be introducing an alternative resolution.\n  The resolution agreed to between the White House and House leadership \nfails to address the two main problems with the original White House \ndiscussion draft. Those problems are the following: The White House \napproach still specifically authorizes at this time the use of force on \na unilateral go-it-alone basis. That is, without Security Council \nauthorization. Second, the White House approach authorizes the use of \nforce beyond dealing with Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and their \nmeans of delivery.\n  The resolution I will be introducing is consistent with how I think \nmost Americans want us to proceed. It emphasizes the importance of \ndealing with Iraq on a multilateral basis and it withholds judgment at \nthis time on the question of whether the United States should go it \nalone, should go unilaterally against Iraq, should the United Nations \nfail to act.\n  My alternative resolution does the following: First, it urges the \nUnited Nations Security Council to adopt promptly a resolution that \ndemands unconditional access for U.N. inspectors so Iraq's weapons of \nmass destruction and prohibited ballistic missiles may be destroyed; \nand within that same U.N. resolution authorizes the use of necessary \nand appropriate force by U.N. member States to enforce such resolution \nin the event Iraq refuses to comply.\n  My alternative resolution will also specifically authorize the use of \nthe United States Armed Forces, pursuant to that U.N. Security Council \nresolution if Iraq fails to comply with its terms and the President \ninforms the Congress of his determination that the United States has \nused appropriate diplomatic and other peaceful means to obtain \ncompliance by Iraq with such U.N. resolution.\n  My resolution affirms under international law and the U.N. Charter, \nthe United States has at all times the inherent right to use military \nforce in self-defense, affirming the fact there is no U.N. veto over \nU.S. military action. The alternative resolution which I will be \nintroducing affirms that Congress will not adjourn sine die so that \nCongress can return to session to consider promptly proposals relative \nto Iraq if, in the judgment of the President, the U.N. Security Council \ndoes not adopt the resolution I described above.\n\n  It provides further that the President report to Congress every 60 \ndays on the status of efforts to have the U.N. Security Council adopt \nsuch a resolution, and if such a resolution is adopted, to obtain \ncompliance by Iraq with the resolution.\n  Many were relieved when the President of the United States went to \nthe United Nations and rightfully declared the Iraqi threat is \n``exactly the kind of aggressive threat that the United Nations was \nborn to confront.'' The President reminded the world that Iraqi \naggression was stopped after the invasion of Kuwait ``by the might of \ncoalition forces and the will of the United Nations.'' In calling upon \nthe United Nations to act again, the President committed the United \nStates to ``work with the U.N. Security Council to meet our common \nchallenge. We will work,'' the President said, ``with the U.N. Security \nCouncil for the necessary resolutions.''\n  Acting in this manner, the President was setting in motion the same \nprocess that was used when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August of 1990. At \nthat time, then-President Bush on November 29, 1990, obtained U.N. \nSecurity Council authorization for the use of force if Iraqi forces did \nnot withdraw from Kuwait by January 15, 1991. President Bush assembled \na coalition of 39 nations that included Arab nations, Bahrain, Egypt, \nOman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, The United Arab Emirates, and Muslim \nnations Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Morocco, Niger, Pakistan, Senegal, \nSierra Leone, and our NATO ally, Turkey.\n  The Senate and the House of Representatives passed a joint resolution \nauthorizing the use of force to achieve implementation of the U.N. \nresolution on January 12, 1991, almost 7 weeks after the U.N. acted, \nand 3 days prior to the U.N.'s deadline.\n  The fact the United States went to and obtained U.N. authorization \nfor the use of force meant that, with very few exceptions, the world \nwas united in support of the United States and against Saddam \nHussein. It did not mean the United States was going to war against an \nArab nation. It meant that the world community, with the participation \nof Arab nations, was taking action against Iraq. It did not mean the \nUnited States was going to war against a Muslim nation. It meant the \nworld community, with the participation of Muslim nations, was going to \nwar against Iraq. It resulted in the sharing of risks and the sharing \nof costs of war.\n\n  Also important, the United Nations, by its approval, gave \nunquestioned international legitimacy to the United States-led military \naction. And the United States, by seeking U.N. approval, cemented the \ncredibility and the relevancy of the United Nations.\n  President Bush has now gone to the U.N., as his father did before \nhim, and laid out the issues with the following words:\n\n       All the world now faces a test and the United Nations, a \n     difficult and defining moment. Are Security Council \n     resolutions to be honored and enforced, or cast aside without \n     consequences? Will the United Nations serve the purpose of \n     its founding, or will it be irrelevant? The United States \n     helped found the United Nations. We want the United Nations \n     to be effective, and respectful, and successful. We want the \n     resolutions of the world's most important multilateral body \n     to be enforced. And right now those resolutions are being \n     unilaterally subverted by the Iraqi regime. Our partnership \n     of nations can meet the test before us, by making clear what \n     we now expect of the Iraqi regime.\n\n  That test for the United Nations was laid out clearly by President \nBush. Negotiations are going on now among the\n\n[[Page S9936]]\n\npermanent members of the U.N. Security Council. We all pray they will \nmeet the test, and that is why my resolution specifically urges the \nSecurity Council to adopt, promptly, a resolution that:\n\n     demands that Iraq provide immediate, unconditional, and \n     unrestricted access of the United Nations weapons inspectors \n     so that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, nuclear-weapons-\n     usable material, ballistic missiles with a range in excess of \n     150 kilometers, and related facilities are destroyed, \n     removed, or rendered harmless; and authorizes the use of \n     necessary and appropriate military force by member states of \n     the United Nations to enforce such resolution in the event \n     that the Government of Iraq refuses to comply.\n\n  Congress has a test that we have to face as well, and that test, in \nmy view, is to support the President's request to the United Nations \nand not to do anything that will undermine the effort to get the United \nNations to do what the President has requested that they do, and that, \nin my judgment and I think in the judgment of most of us, they should \ndo.\n  In other words, if Congress endorses the use of force, even in the \nabsence of a U.N. authorization at this time, what it does is enable \nthe members of the Security Council to take a pass on the use of force. \nThey can avoid taking a tough position on the basis that the United \nStates will act no matter what the U.N. does.\n  I think we all want the U.N. to be relevant and credible. We want the \nU.N. to succeed. We do not want the U.N. to be relegated to \nhumanitarian and disaster relief and other tasks that are useful to \ninternational peace and security but are not essential.\n  I believe if it is done wisely, we can unite not only the Congress, \nbut ultimately the world community, on a course of action that we all \nseek: The elimination of Saddam Hussein's ability to threaten the world \nwith weapons of mass destruction. In other words, our focus should be \non uniting the world and not dividing it.\n\n  Let me say that again. I strongly believe that the test for Congress \nis to help the President lead and unite the world, and not divide it.\n  The resolution the White House supports authorizes the use of \nmilitary force with or without world community support. In addition to \nletting the members of the U.N. Security Council off the hook, the \nadoption of that type of resolution tells the world that the United \nStates is ready to act unilaterally, to go it alone, and the Congress \nis not even willing to wait to see if the United Nations will act to \nfollow the President's request and unite the world to enforce its \nresolutions before deciding we will go it alone.\n  Moreover, by not limiting the authorization for the use of force at \nthis time to the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and \ntheir means of delivery, the White House resolution endorses the use of \nforce for regime change and for a host of other purposes as minor as \ngetting the return of Kuwaiti archives, which is a requirement of one \nof the U.N. resolutions which the White House resolution says we will \ngo to war to enforce.\n  That language saying we will use force for purposes other than the \nelimination of weapons of mass destruction separates us from the one \nnation that has been our most faithful and trusted ally, Great Britain. \nBritish Prime Minister Tony Blair and British Foreign Secretary Jack \nStraw made clear on numerous occasions that Great Britain's willingness \nto go to war with Iraq is to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction. Why on Earth would we want to divorce ourselves from Great \nBritain? Even if we abandoned the effort to unite the world, why would \nwe emphasize the only apparent difference that we have with Great \nBritain?\n  But the most important question, in my opinion, is whether we decide \nto go it alone at this time, to go to war with or without the support \nof the world community. In my view, a go-it-alone approach, where we \nattack Iraq without the support and participation of the world \ncommunity, entails serious risks and could have serious consequences \nfor us in the Middle East and around the world. It makes a difference. \nIt makes a difference, when deciding to use force, whether or not the \nuse of force has the support of the world community.\n  If we go it alone, will we be able to secure the use of airbases, \nports and supply bases, and overflight rights in that region? Those \nrights and those capabilities are so important to the success of a \nmilitary operation against Saddam.\n  If we go it alone, will there be a reduction in the broad \ninternational support for the war on terrorism, including the law \nenforcement, financial, and intelligence cooperation that is so \nessential?\n  If we go it alone, will that destabilize an already volatile region, \nundermine governments such as Jordan and Pakistan, and possibly end up \nwith a radical regime in Pakistan, a country that has nuclear weapons?\n  If we go it alone, if we go it without the support of the world \ncommunity, will Saddam Hussein or his military commanders be more \nlikely to use weapons of mass destruction against other nations in the \nregion and against our military forces in response to our attack than \nwould be the case if he faced a U.N.-authorized coalition, particularly \nif that coalition included Muslim nations as the coalition did during \nthe gulf war?\n  If we go it alone, will other nations view our action as a precedent \nfor threatening unilateral military action against their neighbors in \nthe future?\n  If we go it alone, will we be undercutting efforts to get other \ncountries to help us with the expensive, lengthy task of stabilizing \nIraq after Saddam is removed?\n  By seeking a U.N. resolution that will authorize U.N. member states \nto use force if Iraq does not comply with its terms, we are not giving \nthe United Nations a veto. Rather, we are getting from the United \nNations strength and international credibility and legitimacy, should \nmilitary force be needed.\n  The alternative resolution which I will offer is clear about the fact \nthat we are not giving the U.N. a veto. We are just seeking support \nfrom the world community before we decide whether to go it alone.\n  This is a similar approach to what Prime Minister Tony Blair said \nrecently in an interview with David Frost. Prime Minister Blair is \nquoted as saying, ``I do not think that the U.N. will avoid the issue; \nbut if they do, then we'll see at that time.''\n  In his testimony before the Armed Services Committee on September 23, \nformer Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. John Shalikashvili \naddressed the issue of acting pursuant to a U.N. Security Council \nresolution that authorizes the use of force in the following manner:\n\n       I am convinced that such a resolution would in fact be a \n     powerful tool, and I say that for a number of reasons. First \n     of all, we need to impress upon Saddam Hussein that he is not \n     just facing the United States, but that he is facing the will \n     of the majority of the world.\n       We must also ensure that we have made it possible for as \n     many of our friends and allies to join us. Some of them \n     privately tell us they would do so, but that it's difficult \n     for political, internal reasons, whatever, very difficult to \n     do so without the United Nations having spoken on the issue. \n     Some of them believe deeply that you should go to war only--\n     unless you're directly attacked--that you should go to war \n     only with the sanction of the United Nations. Others just \n     have that in their culture.\n       Finally, I think it's important from a security point of \n     view, because every time we undermine the credibility of the \n     United Nations, we are probably hurting ourselves more than \n     anyone else. We are a global Nation with global interests. \n     And undermining the credibility of the United Nations does \n     very little to help provide stability and security and safety \n     to the rest of the world.\n\n  General Shalikashvili ended by stating, ``So I see nothing but value \nadded for the United States to try our very best to get that kind of a \nresolution.''\n  General Clark, the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, who \ntestified at the same hearing, echoed the views of General \nShalikashvili and added ``we need to be certain we really are working \nthrough the United Nations in an effort to strengthen the institution \nin this process and not simply checking a block.''\n  Those two former senior commanders were concerned, of course, not \nonly with the diplomatic and political aspects of working through the \nUnited Nations, but also with the practical impact that not going \nthrough the United Nations would have on the actual conduct of a war.\n  General Joseph Hoar, former Commander in Chief of U.S. Central \nCommand, the command with responsibility for the Middle East region, \nincluding Iraq, testified that:\n\n\n[[Page S9937]]\n\n\n       And the Arab countries, while they are supporting us in \n     private, have a serious problem in convincing their \n     populations that this is the right thing to do. And so I \n     believe that we have to give them top cover, as well, and we \n     will do that with the United Nations.\n       On an operational level, I would just point out this, that, \n     for example, if you can't bring Saudi Arabia into the \n     coalition to be able to use, at a minimum, air space, but, \n     ideally air bases as well, the complications associated with \n     carrying out a military campaign will grow exponentially.\n       We need them. We need a broad base. We need it for the \n     political reasons as well as the military reasons that we all \n     understand. It will make the whole job a great deal easier. \n     And, in the long run, as Wes (General Clark) said, in our \n     relationship with these countries in the future, it will \n     expedite and ease our ability to do business after the \n     military campaign is over.\n\n  General Hoar's testimony points out the practical problems that \nresult if we are using military force against Iraq without the support \nof the world community. The Saudi Foreign Minister has stated that if \nthere was a Security Council Resolution backing military action, all \nUnited Nations members would have to honor it. But he made clear that \nSaudi Arabia remained opposed in principle to a unilateral attack by \nthe United States. The inability to use Saudi airspace--no less Saudi \nair bases--would be a major impediment to the use of military force \nagainst Iraq.\n  The position of European allies need to be considered as well. As the \nWashington Post reported last Monday, a senior European official \nresponding to the United States going it alone, said ``A lot of \nEuropeans would feel they'd been put in an intolerable position.'' For \nthose who would agree to participate militarily, ``it would be less a \ncoalition of the willing than of the dragooned.''\n  That says a lot.\n  It is very important that we carefully consider the short-term and \nthe long-term effects of unilateral action by the United States, and \nwhether we need to make a decision on that at this point when we should \nbe pressing all of our energies for United Nations action, and--as my \nalternative resolution does--letting the United Nations know we are \nready to enforce their resolution.\n  My alternative resolution specifically authorizes the use of American \nforces in support of a United Nations resolution. My alternative \ndoesn't wait to see what the United Nations will do. My resolution puts \nthe focus on getting the United Nations to act, and says in advance to \nthe United Nations that we will authorize military force and use it in \nsupport of the resolution that we are seeking.\n  It is very different than waiting for the United Nations to act, \nwhich, in fact, is what we did during the gulf war. This body didn't \nvote on authorizing military force until after the United Nations \nauthorized member states to use force.\n  My alternative resolution is stronger than that. It is a strong \nmessage to the United Nations. We are so committed to your acting to \nenforce your resolution and to authorize member states to enforce those \nresolutions with military force--we are so committed to that course and \nwe believe it is so important that we force Saddam Hussein to open up \nto inspections and to disarm, we are so committed to that--that this \nCongress in my alternative resolution authorizes U.S. military force \nnow in the expectation and the hope and the belief that you as a United \nNations body will authorize member nations to act.\n  This alternative approach--called The Multilateral Use of Force \nAuthorization Act of 2002--provides for the use of force pursuant to a \nsubsequent United Nations Security Council resolution that authorizes \nUnited Nations member states to use force.\n  It withholds judgment at this time on the question of whether the \nUnited States should go it alone unilaterally against Iraq. It doesn't \npreclude that. Should the President call us back into session and seek \nthat authority, it does not preclude that at all.\n  If we authorize the use of our military forces on a go-it-alone basis \nat this time--at the time we are seeking United Nations support--we \nwill send the wrong message to the United Nations. Telling the United \nNations that, if you do not enforce your resolutions, we will, not only \nsend an inconsistent message, but it lets the United Nations off the \nhook.\n  We should be seeking to unite the world against Saddam Hussein and \nnot divide it. The best chance of having Saddam Hussein comply is when \nhe looks down the barrel of a gun and sees the world at the other end, \nand not just the United States.\n  So our focus should be securing a United Nations resolution that can \nunite the world; that has the best chance of forcing compliance; that \nreduces the risk to our forces and to our interests throughout the \nworld; that avoids to the maximum extent possible the negative \nconsequences, if force is required, including the loss of cooperation \non the war on terrorism; and that has the best chance of isolating \nSaddam Hussein rather than isolating the United States.\n  This resolution, again, does not determine that we will not go it \nalone if the United Nations does not authorize the use of force. It \nwithholds judgment on that very difficult and very different issue. But \nit says in that case, if the United Nations does not act, that the \nPresident can convene us quickly in order to seek authorization for \ngoing it alone should the United Nations not act in a prompt way.\n  The vote that we take may have significant consequences for our \nchildren and our grandchildren. I believe our security is enhanced when \nwe seek the authority and the credibility of the United Nations, and if \nmilitary force is required, that it is used with the full support of \nthe world community.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I first compliment my good friend from \nMichigan. He is one of the more thoughtful Members of this body, \naddressing a very grave issue.\n\n\n                 Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of 2002\n\n  Mr. President, as we debate the degree to which the United States and \nthe Congress should be giving authorization to the President of the \nUnited States to commit military action, a decision which affects all \nof us as Americans, I also want to point out there is another group of \npeople whom we have neglected, and that is our armed services \npersonnel, in many of the provisions of the Tax Code.\n  I am now going to explain several provisions of a tax bill we passed \nlast night which will have a very direct, positive effect on millions \nof Americans individuals, and those are our men and women serving in \nour Armed Forces and our Foreign Service.\n  For several months, the Finance Committee has been working on tax \nlegislation that would affect the individuals who fight our country's \nwars. As our Nation responded to the attacks on 9/11, as military \npersonnel went through Afghanistan to fight the Taliban and to break \napart the al-Qaida network, Senator Grassley and I began looking at how \nthe Tax Code affects those who defend our national security.\n  We consulted first with Senator Cleland, who chairs the Personnel \nSubcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. He and his staff pointed \nout several areas where the tax law had not kept up with changes in \nmilitary compensation. We reviewed military tax legislation that was \nintroduced by various Senators, including Senator McCain and Senator \nDeWine.\n  We listened to the problems that other Senators had identified \nthrough discussions with their constituents. I went back home to my \nState, Montana, to Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls, to meet \nwith military leadership there. I also worked with Major General \nPrendergast of the Montana National Guard. He provided a great deal of \nassistance as we crafted this package.\n  The Finance Committee met with the Armed Services Committee \nleadership, Senator Levin and Senator Warner, to discuss these \nproposals. The result is, last night the Senate unanimously passed the \nArmed Forces Tax Fairness Act of 2002.\n  I come to the Chamber today to explain this bill in a little more \ndetail, to pay tribute to the men and women who serve in our military \nand Foreign Service, and to pay tribute to the Senators who helped \nshape this legislation.\n  I will begin with military death gratuity payments.\n  In 1986, the U.S. Government paid death gratuity payments to the \nfamilies of military personnel who died in the line of duty. That was \n$3,000. Prior to 1991, none of that was taxable income to the estate.\n\n[[Page S9938]]\n\n  In 1991, the Congress increased the gratuity death benefit to $6,000, \nand, regrettably, we failed to exclude all of that from taxable income. \nSo $3,000 of that death gratuity was treated as taxable income.\n  So the proposal we passed last night is one that restores the full \ntax exclusion of the death benefit gratuity. So now when the $6,000 is \npaid to the family of the deceased military personnel, all $6,000 is \npaid tax free.\n  Another provision applies to the exclusion-of-gain on the sale of a \nprincipal residence. The general rule, prior to 1997, for most \ntaxpayers, is that they would have the gain on their home excluded, so \nlong as they replaced their home within 2 years after its sale, so long \nas the principal place of their residence was established 2 years after \nthe sale.\n\n  We provided a break for the military at that time, prior to 1997, and \nthat is, the military personnel could replace their home within up to 8 \nyears. They were given an additional 6-year period within which to \nreplace their home and still get the full exclusion from the gain on \ntheir home.\n  In 1997, Congress changed the law with respect to exclusion of gain \non the sale of a principal residence. The new law provided that the \ntaxpayer must live in a home for at least 2 years of the 5 years \npreceding the sale of that home. That has been the standard rule since \n1997.\n  The Congress, however, neglected to make this special change for our \nmilitary personnel, neglecting to recognize that military personnel \ntravel a lot more, which is not of their choice, because of their \nmilitary orders as to where they are stationed.\n  So the general rule has been the same for them, and it has made it \nvery difficult for them, because sometimes they cannot live in their \nprincipal residence, their home, for 2 years of the preceding 5 years \nto get the full exclusion.\n  So what we have done is this, essentially. We have suspended the 2 \nyears out of 5 rule for military personnel when they are on active duty \nor when they are in the line of duty, stationed someplace else around \nthe world, someplace different from their principal residence. It is \nsuspended during that period. So when they come back to their principal \nresidence, then the 2 out of 5 years begins to apply.\n  So it is much more fair to military personnel now, so they will also, \nin effect, as with other taxpayers, be able to get the full exclusion \nfrom the sale of their principal home so long as they live there 2 of \nthe 5 years.\n  Another change is the Military Homeowners Assistance Program. Under \ncurrent law, the homeowners in the military, who stay at a base that \nhas changed because of BRAC--the Base Realignment and Closure \nCommission--sometimes experience a loss in the value of their home. The \nresults of BRAC recommendations--they either close a military \ninstallation or substantially change a military installation--have the \neffect of changing the value of the home of someone in the military.\n  Here is an example of what happens today. Let's say the value of a \nhome prior to the BRAC decision was $140,000. Then the sale price, \nafter the announcement of the BRAC decision, fell to $100,000; the \nloss, obviously, being $40,000 on that home.\n  Currently, the U.S. Government, the military, in what is called the \nMilitary Homeowners Assistance Plan, will reimburse that person in the \nArmy, the Air Force, the Navy. It is a formula. In this example, the \nreimbursement would be $30,000 out of the $40,000 loss. Unfortunately, \nunder current law, that $30,000 law is fully taxable income to someone \nin the military. So what we have done is said: No, none of that \nmilitary reimbursement is taxable. It is not taxable.\n  Another change is this. We have extended the filing delay rules to \ncontingency operations. So now it will not only be for combat zones but \nalso for contingency operations. What does that mean? That means, when \nsomeone in the military is overseas, currently, if he or she is in a \ncombat zone, that person gets to file a delayed filing date of 180 days \nafter departure to file his or her tax return. We are extending this to \napply to not only combat zones but also to contingency operations when \nmilitary personnel are sent overseas.\n  Next we are changing the tax treatment with respect to our Reserve \nofficers--Army Guard, Air Guard,--when they are on reserve, when they \nare off in training, so that they are not penalized for the expenses \nthey have incurred when they were in training.\n  This is above-the-line deductions for overnight travel expenses of \nNational Guard and Reserve members. For example, let's say Reserve \nSergeant Jones--basically the rank would be E-5--is on a weekend drill. \nHis take-home pay would be $200. His weekend drill expenses might be \n$65 for travel, roughly $110 for lodging, and meals for $25, also \ntotaling $200. That is not reimbursed. That is an expense that the \nreservist or the person in the National Guard has to incur him or \nherself. That is not reimbursed.\n  So we are saying, OK, we will take that full cost of overnight travel \nexpenses, and that will be an above-the-line deduction from that \nperson's taxable income. That is an above-the-line deduction. The \nexpenses are deducted above the line.\n  We have two more items.\n  Another change in legislation that passed last night, essentially, is \nto extend the definition of Qualified Veterans' Organizations. Today, \nthe membership test is 75 percent of the members--let's say, the \nAmerican Legion or the Veterans of Foreign Wars,--75 percent of the \nmembership has to be present or past military personnel. That is \ncurrent law.\n\n  In addition, substantially all of the members must be military or \nspouses or widowers of the members. The trouble is, a lot of military \norganizations, a lot of these organizations, veterans organizations, \nwould like to expand the definition of membership to include ancestors \nand lineal descendants, and we have done that with the law that was \npassed last night.\n  Finally, we are clarifying the treatment of childcare subsidies. \nCurrently, the military reimburses half the childcare expense. That is \nbasically a subsidy. Let's say on average a subsidized benefit for two \nchildren is $7,700. The current exclusion for childcare subsidies today \nis $5,000. That is the limit. No more than $5,000 can be excluded from \na person's income to date generally. We are now clarifying the law so \nthat for military personnel, the childcare subsidy portion of 50 \npercent is fully excluded from taxable income.\n  I believe these changes will go a long way. I thank my colleagues for \nmaking tax law more fair to military personnel. We have neglected them \nover the years. This makes the laws much more fair to them. After all, \nthey are serving us, helping make this country continue to be the \ngreatest country on earth. We are deeply indebted to all of them.\n  I thank Senators who helped with this legislation, provided ideas, \nwho worked with us to make sure these are in a form that should be \nenacted into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                               Education\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as I have every day and will every day we \nare in session, I will make a few remarks, and then ask unanimous \nconsent to go to the education appropriations bill, to bring it up so \nwe can debate it and get the funding out there for our schools. I have \nwarned the Republican side, I said every day I am here, I am going to \nask unanimous consent to bring it up.\n  Our schools need this money. If we go to a continuing resolution, we \ncould lose up to $1 billion in funding for special education. We could \nlose up to $700 million in title I so we can really help our schools \ntruly leave no child behind.\n  Pell grants for our kids going to college, there is an increase in \nthe education funding bill for middle-class kids to go to college under \nthe Pell grant system. That will not be there for them, either, if we \ngo into a continuing resolution.\n  Again, the Republicans are holding up funding of education. I don't \nknow why. I have heard all these speeches about the President going \naround the country, banging on the podium, saying he wants the Congress \nto act. Well, we are here to act. We are here to move. The education \nfunding bill passed the subcommittee unanimously. It passed the full \ncommittee unanimously.\n\n[[Page S9939]]\n\n  I have tried for 2 or 3 days in a row to bring it up. Yet every time \nI try to bring it up, there is an objection from the Republican side to \nmoving to the education appropriations funding bill.\n  I will ask unanimous consent again to bring this up today. I see we \ndon't have any Republicans on the floor right now. I see my colleague \nfrom Oregon waiting to speak also on another topic. I know Senate \ncomity requires we have at least someone from the other side on the \nfloor before propounding a unanimous consent request.\n  I have said repeatedly, every day I am here I will be offering this, \nso it should come as no surprise to the Republicans I am trying to \nbring up a unanimous consent request to move to the education \nappropriations bill. I will hold off a couple of minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I yield the floor to my colleague from \nOregon, and then when one of the Republicans shows up on the floor, we \ncould interrupt his speaking to move to my unanimous consent request at \nthat point in time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBaucus, who I know has a unanimous consent request to make at this \ntime--and then I could follow him for my remarks--I would like to let \nSenator Baucus make his unanimous consent request at this time, and \nthen per my unanimous consent request, when Senator Baucus has \ncompleted, I would then make my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3018\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. 3018, a bill to amend title 18 of \nthe Social Security Act; that the bill be read a third time, passed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and that any statements \nthereon be printed in the Record at the appropriate place.\n  I might say before I put the question to the Chair, as Senator Harkin \nhas said, there are no Members of the body on the other side, the \nRepublican side, who I know, if here, would object. This has been \ncleared on the Democratic side.\n  This is the Medicare give-back bill. It has been cleared on the \nDemocratic side.\n  I might say in all fairness--here he is. I was going to say, the \nfailure of someone to appear is tantamount to an objection from the \nother side.\n  I will repeat the request for the benefit of my good friend and \ncolleague from Oklahoma.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration \nof S. 3018, a bill to amend title 18 of the Social Security Act, the \nbill be read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on \nthe table, and that any statements thereon be printed at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  Before putting that request to the Chair, again, I add, this has been \ncleared on this side. Nobody on the Democratic side objects to this \nunanimous consent request. So I put the request to the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I might \nask my friend and colleague from Montana, chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, I am just wondering--I happen to be a Member of the \ncommittee. I can't remember a markup--did we mark up this bill in \ncommittee?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there are so few days ramaining in this \nsession that in order to help American hospitals, American doctors, \nbeneficiaries who desperately need this bill, and with so little time \nremaining, as chairman of the committee I feel I have an obligation to \nthe people of Montana to get this legislation up and passed. There are \nso few days remaining. We are on the Iraq resolution, which is going to \ntake a lot of time. We are on homeland security, which is not passed. \nWe have all the appropriations bills not passed. As a service to the \npeople of the State of Montana, as a service to the American people, \nand because this is a bill Senator Grassley, the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, and I have worked out together, working with all \nMembers of the committee, trying to find an agreement, which Senator \nGrassley and I do have, an agreement to the provisions of this bill, \nthis is by far the most efficient and best way to get the help to the \npeople in our States who need this legislation passed.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield further, I am a little \ndisgruntled. I am a Member of that committee. I had some issues. \nSenator Sessions wanted me to work with him to do something for the \nwage index for rural areas. I understand that is not in the bill.\n  I had a provision I wanted to do dealing with the outpatient \nprospective payment system. I understand that is not in the bill. There \nwas nothing done on prescription drugs. Senator Snowe and many of us \nwanted to do something this year. We never had a markup on that issue \nin the Finance Committee.\n  So waiting until the last minute, we have known, frankly, of the \nnecessity to do some type of adjustment. The House passed some of these \nprovisions months ago. The Senate, to never have a markup, never to \nschedule one even in the Finance Committee, to debate and let all \nMembers--not one and maybe two Members--to offer amendments, to come up \nwith a Medicare adjustment bill, I think, is not letting the Senate \nwork. To come up and say we introduced a bill--correct me if I am \nwrong, I believe it was placed on the calendar Wednesday, and on Friday \nthey want to pass it without letting somebody offer other amendments. \nThat is not allowing the Senate to work its will as it should.\n  I happen to have waited many years to be on the Finance Committee. I \nwaited for a purpose. I thought it was such a prestigious committee \nbecause it dealt with issues I like dealing with--Medicare, Medicaid, \nwelfare, Social Security, and taxes. Not to be able to do a markup on \nbills such as this, on which almost always we would have a markup--we \nwould have a bipartisan consensus and maybe then it could pass by \nunanimous consent through the Senate.\n  But I don't think we did anything on the wage index for rural areas \nor on the outpatient payment system. I know we didn't do anything on \nprescription drugs. So, regretfully, at this point, unless there is--I \nask my colleague, how much does this bill cost?\n  (Mrs. LINCOLN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In answer to the question, my good friend knows that \nOctober 1 has come and gone. That means 15 percent of home health care \nprovisions that we have to address--large nursing home cuts--the so-\ncalled ``cliff'' that we have to address--and teaching hospital \nprovisions, and after October 1, we have to move. I also say to my good \nfriend from Oklahoma that the ranking Republican on the committee and I \nspent a lot of time talking with staffs of Senators on both sides, \nincluding that of the Senator from Oklahoma--all Senators on the \ncommittee and their staffs. This is the bill we all agree on, Senator \nGrassley agreed to. This has been worked out very thoroughly, and it \nhas been around a long time. The Senator well knows the provisions of \nthe bill. There was a selective error on one--that is, we do address \nthe wage index factor. Most importantly, this has to pass quickly to \nhelp our people. The cost of the bill is $43 billion over 10 years.\n  Mr. NICKLES. It is $43 billion over 10 years. If the Senator will \nyield further, what is the cost over 2 or 3 years?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I don't have that estimate because we have been dealing \nwith 10-year figures here. So it is calculated over 10 years. They are \nvery good provisions. When this comes up for a vote, in whatever form, \nit is going to get a large vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, the bill was introduced, I believe, on \nMonday. It was printed in the Record, I believe, on Tuesday or \nWednesday. Many of us--most all Senators, including most on the Finance \nCommittee--have not had a chance to look at the bill. I don't believe \nit dealt with the wage index for rural areas, at least satisfactorily \nto Senator Sessions and myself. I don't believe it dealt with \noutpatients. I know it didn't deal with prescription drugs, which \nSenator Sessions and others want to deal with this year.\n  We may be willing to do something, but before we pass bills by \nunanimous consent--introduce bills on Wednesday and say we want to pass \nthem Friday--\n\n[[Page S9940]]\n\nit is going to take a little more bipartisan work. There has not been \nenough of that. Maybe two Senators are in agreement on this bill in the \ncommittee. But other committee members are entitled to look at it and \nto have some input and have a little more of a chance to figure out \nwhat is in it. To introduce a bill or have it put on the calendar \nWednesday and say we want to pass it on Friday by unanimous consent, I \ndon't think is a proper way to legislate. Also, all of us have known \nOctober 1 was fast approaching. As I mentioned before, the House passed \nthis months ago. There is no reason, in my opinion, to not have a \nmarkup in the full committee. There is no reason in my mind. We didn't \nhave a markup on prescription drugs in the full committee. I don't \nthink you should disenfranchise members of the committee, some of whom \nhave waited a long time to be a member. For those reasons, I object.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. While we are waiting, Madam President--\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I know the Senator is concerned about a \ncouple provisions, and I would like to clarify what the costs are. \nThere are provisions here with respect to wage index for rural \nhospitals. We clearly want to do the best we can, and all these \nprovisions cost a little bit of money. The provisions suggested by \nSenator Sessions would cost about $10 billion over 10 years. That will \nbe in addition to the $43 billion that is already there.\n  For the Senator's information, we did rough calculations for 2 years, \nand it would be about $10 billion for the cost of the bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield further, you estimate the cost \nover 2 years to be $10 billion?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let me work with my colleague. I may be willing to come \nback with a counteroffer in the not too distant future, pulling in a \nfew other members of the Finance Committee and maybe the \nadministration. I would like to see us do something this year in this \narea. It is not too late. I haven't had a chance to review the proposal \nthat the chairman is trying to pass this morning. I am happy to look at \nit. I am happy to look at what others are trying to do. We may make a \ncounteroffer in the not too distant future.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2766\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmajority leader, after consultation with the Republican leader, turn to \nthe consideration of S. 2766, the Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, reserving the right to object--and I \nwill object--the majority leader has the right to move to any bill he \nwants to move to. It is one of the prerogatives of the majority leader. \nIf he wishes to move to the Labor-HHS bill, he has to set aside a few \nother bills. I happen to think we should finish the appropriations bill \nwe started a month ago, the Department of Interior bill. If he really \nwants to move off the Interior bill and go to Labor-HHS, the majority \nleader can do that.\n  I don't know what kind of games are being played. People are running \nto the floor saying, ``I want to pass this bill,'' and it never was \nmarked up in committee or ``I want to pass this,'' and we want to do \nunemployment compensation. And some people said on the floor, oh, it is \na straight extension, but it costs about three times as much as a \nstraight extension. I have not figured out all the differences, but we \nfind out it is much more expensive. It is not a good way to legislate. \nThey say we are going to pass unemployment compensation legislation, \nand it was estimated by the proponents that it might cost $10 billion \nor $12 billion. Now I get estimates it is going to cost $18 billion. \nThe proposal was made a moment ago to do Medicare adjustment, and the \ncost was estimated by the proponents at $43 billion. I have not even \nhad a chance to look at it. So one proposal was $17 billion, dealing \nwith unemployment.\n  I guess this proposal by the chairman of the Finance Committee is $43 \nbillion, and that is $60 billion. Most of the expenses are over the \nfirst couple of years, certainly on unemployment compensation, and I \nwould think on the Medicare adjustment bill as well. And then on \nsuccessive actions we have people running to the floor saying: I want \nto pass a unanimous consent, and I hope a Republican will object, and \nthen we can say we didn't pass that bill because a Republican \nobjected--not telling people, wait a minute, did these things go \nthrough committee? Do we have an idea how much they cost?\n  That is a pretty crummy way to legislate. The fiscal year just began \nOctober 1, but we didn't know it was going to come, so we will go to \nthe floor. I have made umpteen speeches this month as to why are we not \nmarking up bills and passing the Interior bill. We should have passed \nthe Interior bill in 2 days. We got stuck on a provision dealing with \nfire management. Several Senators said they wanted to have flexibility \non how to deal with fire in their own States. The Senator from South \nDakota got a fix in for his State. They are able to do it in South \nDakota. I compliment him, but shouldn't the rest of the West be able to \nhave fire management tools to get out some of the dead timber so they \ndon't have such enormous fires? That is what several Senators have \nasked. Yet we have not even been able to get a vote on that proposal.\n  If you were managing a bill in days past, you would have an \namendment, and you would vote on it. If you didn't like it, you moved \nto table it. We didn't do either of those. We just let the bill amble \nalong and take up the entire month of September.\n  Then we have the Department of Homeland Security. I do not know if we \nare any closer today than we were when we started the day after Labor \nDay. We are on that bill now for the fifth week. People are running to \nthe Chamber saying: We need to pass an appropriations bill; we are just \ngoing to do it by unanimous consent. That is a pretty crummy way to \nlegislate. We did not know we were running out of time; we did not know \nOctober 1 was coming; we did not know it was the beginning of the \nfiscal year. There is gross ineptitude as far as management of the \nappropriations process and the budget process.\n  I used to be a member of the Appropriations Committee. I still am a \nmember of the Budget Committee. It is the first time since 1974 that we \nhave not passed a budget. Because we did not pass a budget, \nunfortunately, it has really clogged up the appropriations process. Now \nthe Interior bill is back on the calendar. We have homeland security, \nwhich the majority leader promised the President we would pass. We \nthought we would pass it before the August break. We have not done it, \nand we are well into October.\n  Now we are on the Iraq resolution and, hopefully, we will be able to \nconclude that shortly. I happen to be one who wants to do the \nappropriations bills, but the majority leader is the one who sets the \nagenda, and he is the one who calls up the appropriations bills, not \nindividual Senators calling them up and saying: I have my bill; let's \npass it today. No one gets to look at it; no one gets to know how much \nis in it. No one gets to know whether it is signable or not.\n  The bill the chairman of the Finance Committee is promoting today has \na lot of provisions that I am sure a lot of Senators want. I would like \nto get a bill the President will sign. I would like to get a bill that \ndoes not bust the budget. I would like to get a bill that is \nresponsible. Maybe we can do that. I am willing to work with \ncolleagues. But if you are going to come to the floor and pass a bill \ndealing with an unemployment compensation extension, it is going to \ntake unanimous consent. We are not going to be able to pass a bill that \ncosts $17 billion or $18 billion when we might be able to do a straight \nadjustment for $5 billion or $6 billion.\n  It is the same for the Medicare adjustment bill. It is going to have \nto be a unanimous consent package that all people sign off on, not just \ntwo, and all members of the Finance Committee should have a chance to \nreview it and say: Yes, this is a good package.\n  I will work with my colleagues. We pass a lot of legislation by \nunanimous consent, but it takes bipartisan cooperation to do it. I do \nnot think we have seen evidence of that enough. I\n\n[[Page S9941]]\n\nhope we will see it in the next few days as we conclude this very \nunproductive year in this session.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Montana speak next to respond and then, per my unanimous consent \nrequest, I will make my comments following those of the Senator from \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Objection \nwas heard to the prior request.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I thank my friend. We are down to the \nlast several days. It is important we all work together. As we all \nknow, under Senate rules, that number 60 means a lot, particularly with \nso few days remaining, not knowing exactly how many days remain, but we \nall know there are not many of them. It is important we all work \ntogether.\n  I thought it unfortunate the Senator used the words ``gross \nineptitude'' in managing the budget process and the appropriations \nprocess. I am sure he did not really mean that because, in the spirit \nof comity, in working these issues out, the Senator well knows both \nsides are trying to work out solutions, and sometimes there are \nSenators on both sides who have their particular views which tend to \nimpede or slow down the work of the majority. That happens on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  I urge we work together and find ways. Honey attracts more than \nvinegar, we all know that. I am trying to figure out a way to get more \nhoney around here and a little less vinegar so we can do what we all \nwant to do. I know the Senator agrees with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I appreciate my colleagues's remarks. \nHe mentioned 60 as a magic number. At this point, 100 is the magic \nnumber. So it takes a lot of bipartisan work and cooperation to get \nthings done because right now we have to do a lot of legislation by \nunanimous consent.\n  I think my statement of gross ineptitude in dealing with the budget \nprocess is probably pretty accurate. I was not defining any one \nSenator, but we have not passed a budget. That is a pretty significant \nfailing. We have passed one every year I have been in the Senate for \nthe last 22 years. It is never easy but is always done. Because we did \nnot get a budget done this year, we do not have the appropriations \nbills done. It has led to a whole chain of failures.\n  This is the first year--you have to give Congress an F in the \nappropriations-budget process. We have not sent to the President one \nappropriations bill, other than a continuing resolution. Not one. I \nhope we can break that train. I hope we can pass several appropriations \nbills, certainly the Department of Defense, and I hope others, but we \nare going to have to move much more rapidly.\n  The majority leader is going to have to call them up. I hope maybe we \ncan change and have a more productive week. I hope it is just a week \nand not 2 weeks.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I wonder if the Senator can make a telephone call to the \nother body and have them send over appropriations bills so we can pass \nthem over here--they have not sent over appropriations bills yet--in \nthe spirit of comity.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to urge my friends and colleagues in the \nHouse to pass more appropriations bills, but frankly, they are reticent \nto do so because the Senate is working off much different numbers than \nthe House. Always before, when we passed a budget, ultimately the House \nand the Senate worked off similar numbers, the same gross numbers. So \nthere is a reason the House is reluctant to pass bills because they are \ngoing to pass them at lower figures than the Senate, and they feel as \nif that puts them at a disadvantage when they go to conference.\n\n  I do not know that I agree with that. I know Senator Harkin was on \nthe floor wanting to pass Labor-HHS. The House has not passed Labor-\nHHS. I never believed constitutionally that we had to wait on the \nHouse. Some people have made that argument, but that is not \nconstitutional. The Senate does not have to wait on the House of \nRepresentatives to pass an appropriations bill--a tax bill, yes, not an \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is the point I was going to make, revenue bills, \nyes. Appropriations bills are not required in the Constitution. \nHowever, it has been a matter of tradition for years.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I understand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Business of the Senate\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I had intended to talk on energy, but \nsince our good friend, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, is here \nand talking about getting the important business of the Senate done in \nthe last few days, I wish to reflect for a minute on how we are in \nthese delays, particularly on issues such as homeland security.\n  I note that the New York Times this morning points out that on the \nhomeland security bill--and I am going to quote from an editorial in \nthe New York Times:\n\n     . . . the Democrats have made key concessions on personnel \n     management for the department in recent weeks that give the \n     administration almost everything it wants.\n\n  It is clear Senators on this side are very anxious to attack the \nserious questions that are before this country. This editorial really \nsums it up. They point out literally that Democrats have practically \ndone somersaults to address these important questions that colleagues \non the other side and the administration have with respect to homeland \nsecurity, and this morning in one editorial in the New York Times, they \nsay on the other side of the aisle there is an inexcusable filibuster \ntaking place on a measure that is of great importance to this country \nas we struggle to win this war against terrorism.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that editorial be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Impasse Over Homeland Security\n\n       The prospect of war so dominates Washington that vital \n     elements of the campaign against terrorism have fallen by the \n     wayside. One victim is the drive to establish a new Homeland \n     Security Department by consolidating disparate parts of the \n     government into an agency to protect Americans from attack. \n     Such a department has widespread support in Congress, but \n     President Bush is foolishly holding up its creation by \n     demanding complete freedom to hire and fire those working \n     there. He claims that such power is needed to run the \n     department properly. There is no basis for such a claim. \n     Moreover, the Democrats have made key concessions on \n     personnel management for the department in recent weeks that \n     give the administration almost everything it wants. Yet Mr. \n     Bush and his Republican allies are inexcusably filibustering \n     a homeland measure that has a majority of votes in the \n     Senate.\n       For months after Sept. 11 last year, Mr. Bush and the \n     Republicans adamantly opposed efforts to create a department \n     for domestic security. When support for such a measure grew, \n     the White House shifted tactics. Behind closed doors it wrote \n     a bill that would give radical powers to the president to \n     hire, fire and punish employees without due process and to \n     hire people from the outside without respect to Civil Service \n     rules. Since there were no consultations with the departments \n     being consolidated, it was obvious that this demand came more \n     from ideology than from a careful look at what was needed to \n     run the new department.\n       A group of conservative Democrats has joined with Senator \n     Lincoln Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, to give Mr. Bush \n     substantially what he wants. The bill would confer on him the \n     power to decertify union affiliation for any federal workers \n     because of national security concerns, but it would require \n     him to declare that their mission had changed in a way that \n     justified such a move. This is a wholly reasonable \n     limitation. The bill would also give the new agency head more \n     flexibility than now available to offer raises, shift \n     someone's job or punish an employee. But it would also \n     require a good-faith effort to consult with the employee or \n     union and submit any disagreements to a federal panel whose \n     members would all be appointed by him.\n       In trying to eliminate even these narrow limits on \n     presidential prerogative, Mr. Bush has accused the Democrats \n     of putting ``special interests''--by which he means unions \n     and workers--above the nation's security. But one might \n     equally argue that Mr. Bush, in refusing to compromise, is \n     making the nation's security secondary to the \n     administration's union-busting conservatism. If the\n\n[[Page S9942]]\n\n     homeland security bill goes down, it will kill not only a \n     vital consolidation of federal agencies but also such \n     measures as an independent commission to investigate the \n     Sept. 11 attacks and increased funding to protect container \n     ports against possible nuclear bombs. In the waning weeks of \n     this session, Mr. Bush should compromise for the sake of one \n     of the nation's most urgent priorities.\n\n\n                             Energy Policy\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, as our country faces the possibility of \nwar with Iraq, one of the most patriotic steps our Nation can take is \nto change our energy policy and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Today, more than half of our Nation's oil is imported from overseas. \nReducing our dependence on foreign oil would reduce threats to our \nNation's economy and security, whether from enemies who would do us \nharm, like Saddam Hussein, or simply the greed of the OPEC cartel.\n  If Congress passes an energy bill that truly reduces our dependence \non imported oil, that would be important. It would be a strategic \nsecurity action. Reducing our dependence on oil imports would clearly \nstrengthen our energy and our national security. It would provide an \nadditional measure of economic security.\n  Reducing oil imports also strengthens our economy by reducing our \nvulnerability to shortages and price spikes. And it would be patriotic. \nAs our Nation does face the possibility of war, this would reduce our \nvulnerability to one of the enemy's most powerful weapons. So far this \nyear, the United States has been importing more than 600,000 barrels of \noil per day from Iraq.\n  How does the energy bill currently in the House-Senate conference \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil and strengthen our Nation's \nsecurity? The short answer is it does not do enough. The best way to \nreduce our dependence on imported oil is, in fact, to take specific \nsteps that do that. That is the critical yardstick--my guess is a lot \nof Americans might call it a dipstick--that could be used for measuring \nthe importance of any energy bill that Congress passes.\n  I happen to think the best place to look for those energy savings is \nin the transportation sector. All the evidence shows the best place to \nlook is in the transportation sector with the cars, trucks, and sport \nutility vehicles all of us drive each day. By that measure, the \nconference has basically left us stalled by the side of the road.\n  At a time when the fuel economy has sunk to the lowest point in 21 \nyears, the conference agreed on provisions that amount to savings of \nless than 1 mile per gallon. Think about that: At a time when fuel \neconomy has sunk to the lowest point in 21 years, the conference agreed \non provisions that amount to savings of less than 1 mile per gallon. \nThat is doing virtually nothing to reduce our dependence on foreign \noil.\n  The bottom line, when one looks at all of the fuel economy provisions \ntogether, as far as I can tell by the energy conference at this point, \nthis country would actually be increasing consumption of gasoline by \nbillions of gallons.\n  Where is that oil going to come from to meet the increased demand for \ngasoline that I think will be required by the conference as the bill is \nwritten now? It is not going to come from the United States. Our Nation \nhas only 3 percent of the known oil reserves in the world. Almost two-\nthirds of the reserves come, in fact, from the Middle East. Instead of \nreducing dependence on foreign oil, the energy conference has adopted \nprovisions that would increase consumption and, my guess is, increase \nimports from the Middle East.\n  Better fuel economy could have saved millions of barrels of oil a \nday, almost as much as U.S. imports from the Persian Gulf. The energy \nconference not only has missed the boat as far as reducing oil imports, \nit missed the supertanker when it failed to adopt an increased fuel \neconomy standard.\n  Passing the right kind of energy bill, in fact, would advance our \nNation's energy security, our economic vitality, and our strategic \ninterests. I fear Congress may pass legislation that has the word \n``energy'' in the title but does little or nothing to reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil. That will not strengthen our national \nsecurity. That will not strengthen our economic security, and it is \ngoing to send the wrong message around the world to all of those who \nwould use oil as a weapon against the United States of America.\n\n  There are those who are going to try to claim the energy bill could \nmeet all the goals if only the Congress opened the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge to drilling. But even if Congress authorized drilling \ntoday, the oil produced would be too little too late to reduce our \nreliance on foreign oil. Even the rosiest scenarios show if the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge is open to drilling, it would provide only a \n6-month supply of oil, and it would take about 10 years to even do \nthat.\n  Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is certainly a risky \nproposition. The U.S. Geological Survey, in their most likely scenario, \nestimates a profitable yield of just 2 billion barrels. If that is the \ncase, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge drilling, at peak production, \nwould supply no more than 1 percent of America's projected daily \npetroleum needs.\n  By comparison, the National Academy of Sciences says the fuel economy \nsavings needed to reduce our dependence on foreign oil would be \nachieved using existing technologies.\n  That is the choice, use existing technologies, technologies today \nthat are available in Arkansas, Oregon, Montana, and around this \ncountry, something we can look to now to stop those who are using oil \nas a weapon against us, or look at risky scenarios that do not produce \na whole lot and take a long time to do it like drilling in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge.\n  Our country urgently needs an energy policy that meets our national \nsecurity needs and our economic needs, especially as the prospect of \nwar with Iraq looms on the horizon. If the energy conference can \nproduce a bill that actually does it, I think one of the most patriotic \nsteps the Congress can take now is to pass that legislation. If \nCongress cannot come up with an energy bill that actually meets those \nchallenges, maybe there should not be an energy bill at all.\n  That is not what I want. I want a bill that takes away the weapons of \nthose around the world who are using oil against this country. That is \none of the key challenges we face.\n  As I go home to Oregon--I am sure this is true in Arkansas, Montana, \nand all of our States--I see such extraordinary patriotism at this \ntime. The people of our country understand we face extraordinary \nthreats around the world, and I want us to come together to show that \nwe understand how strongly we feel about the concerns of our citizens \nand that we identify with the patriotism that we see in our communities \nevery day. One of the most patriotic steps that can be taken now is to \nchange our energy policy, stop those who are using oil as a weapon \nagainst us, and to actually pass energy legislation that reduces our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n        negotiations regarding a u.s.-chile free trade agreement\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I want to take a few minutes today to \ndiscuss the trade negotiations that are currently taking place with \nChile.\n  Let me get straight to the point.\n  We worked tirelessly this year to reinvigorate our trade agenda by \npassing the Trade Act of 2002. This legislation includes, as most \npeople know, an extension of fast track negotiating authority--\nsomething which was stalled for nearly a decade.\n  We were able to pass that legislation only after agreeing on a \ndelicate balance for new trade negotiations--particularly on the issues \nof labor and environment, investment, trade laws, and congressional \nconsultations.\n  The first test of this new legislation will likely be the U.S.-Chile \nFree Trade Agreement. Those negotiations are in the final stages--and \nthey are down to some of the most controversial issues.\n  Let me say at the outset--I have been an advocate for trade \nnegotiations with Chile for several years.\n  And as recently as several weeks ago, I felt confident about this \nagreement. Most importantly, the President had just signed the Trade \nAct, which lays out Congress's goals regarding new agreements. That \nlegislation passed with bipartisan support, particularly in the Senate.\n  At the same time, an agreement with Chile makes sense--it is, first \nand foremost, an important trading partner.\n\n[[Page S9943]]\n\nLast year we exported over $3 billion worth of goods to Chile. And with \nan agreement, our opportunities should increase.\n  Completing an agreement with Chile will also increase pressure on \nother countries in the region, particularly Brazil, to let go of their \nprotectionist tendencies, and instead work toward their own agreements \nwith the United States.\n  Because a free trade agreement with Chile seemed substantively \npromising, I really viewed it as a major opportunity. Here is a chance, \nI thought, to take this great trade bill we passed, and use it to \nregain some momentum on trade--to move beyond the arguments of the \npast.\n  I now fear that some in the administration, and frankly some of my \ncolleagues, may be squandering this opportunity.\n  On issues that were critical to passing this bill--congressional \nconsultations, labor, environment, and investment--some seem bent on \nclawing back the progress that has been made.\n  Let me begin with consultations, and by that I mean real \ncongressional participation in trade policy an equal partnership.\n  During negotiations of the trade bill, there was a clear \nunderstanding that congressional trade advisors would be able to \nobserve negotiations. Yet just last week I sought to send one of my \nstaff to observe--simply observe--negotiation between the U.S. and \nChile. Ambassador Zoellick declined this request.\n  The argument the administration makes is separation of powers. But, \nas Justice Jackson famously remarked, the Constitution ``enjoins upon \nits branches separateness but interdependence, autonomy but \nreciprocity.'' We need some reciprocity to make the fast track deal \nwork.\n  The administration when criticized about consultations seems fond of \nrecounting a list of times they have met with Congress. But these \nstatistics have little meaning. The test of consultations is not the \nnumber of meetings; it is the willingness to hear substantive input and \nhave that input reflected in trade negotiations.\n  Similarly, we in Congress certainly expect that the administration \nwill allow us to see negotiating documents far enough in advance to \nhave a meaningful opportunity to comment. That means there must be \nenough time for reasonable congressional suggestions to be incorporated \ninto U.S. negotiating potions.\n  In the first test, the results were mixed. On the highly charged \nissue of investment, a proposal was shared, but only one day before the \nlatest round of negotiations with Chile were to begin. That is clearly \nnot enough time to provide Congress with the opportunity to carefully \nconsider and suggest revisions.\n  These actions undermine confidence. Why would the administration be \nso concerned about Congress merely observing negotiations? Why are they \nreluctant to share documents with Congress that they plan to share with \nforeign governments? It suggests, perhaps unnecessarily that there is \nsomething to hide.\n  The bottom line is this: There is no substitute for first-hand \ninformation. There is no substitute for seeing and evaluating events \nthrough your own eyes. And having this greater transparency in the \nprocess could have many benefits--better relations between the Hill and \nthe White House, better agreements, and, I believe, a better likelihood \nthat agreements will pass. Given the benefits, I cannot for the life of \nme understand why the administration would not make more of an effort \nto engage Members of Congress early in the process.\n  In the trade act we also hammered out a clear direction to the \nadministration to follow the so-called Jordan standard on labor and \nenvironment issues--that is, non-derogation from existing laws and \nequal access to dispute settlement.\n  Senator Grassley and I agreed on this--it was key to moving forward--\nand we spelled this out very clearly in the Finance Committee report.\n  In fact, just so everyone understands this point, let me read the \nexact provision in the report that Senator Grassley and I authored:\n\n       The provisions on labor and environment standards are \n     ``based upon the trade and labor and trade and environment \n     provisions found in articles 5 and 6 of the United States-\n     Jordan Free Trade Agreement. Those provisions (including \n     their coverage by the Agreement's general dispute settlement \n     procedures) have come to be known as the ``Jordan standard.'' \n     They seek to ensure that a country does not promote exports \n     or attract investment by lowering or relaxing the enforcement \n     of its environmental and labor laws. The agreement with \n     Jordan accomplishes this through several commitments, which \n     the present bill directs negotiators to pursue in ongoing and \n     future trade negotiations.\n\n  To me, this is not ambiguous. Yet there are indications that both the \nadministration and some of my colleagues would now like to ignore this \nclear direction in the Trade Act. They do so at the risk of losing \nsupport--including my support--for future agreements.\n  Finally, let me address the issue of investment. As many will recall, \nthis was one of the most contentious issues in the Senate debate on the \ntrade bill. The question is, in setting rules for arbitration between \ninvestors and governments, how do we balance the interests of U.S. \ninvestors abroad with the interests of Federal, State and local \nregulation here at home? In the trade act, we laid out a blueprint for \nachieving that balance. The objectives we set in this area include:\n  Mechanisms for prompt dismissal of frivolous claims;\n  Clearer definitions of key terms--such as ``expropriation''--based on \nU.S. legal principles and practice; and\n  The establishment of an appellate body to review arbitration \ndecisions in investment disputes and bring coherence to the \ninterpretation of investment provisions.\n  I am cautiously optimistic about the administration's approach to \nimplementing these objectives.\n  Early consultations suggest that Congress's instructions were \nunderstood.\n  The one issue on which I have particular concern is the appellate \nbody. It is perhaps the most important aspect of the objective on \ninvestment. An appellate body will help ensure that erroneous \nconclusions of law are corrected and that text is interpreted \nconsistently from one case to the next. Given the potential for \ninvestor suits to challenge legitimate policies designed to promote the \npublic welfare, it is crucial that the decisions in these cases ``get \nit right.''\n  I realize that establishing an appellate body is a big task. It is \nsomething new. The closest analogy under current investor-state dispute \nsettlement rules is what is known as ``nullification.'' In certain \ncircumstances, a party may ask to have an arbitration award \n``nullified'' by a court or other competent body. However, the standard \nfor nullification is extraordinarily high. The question is not whether \nthe arbitrator got it right, but rather, whether the arbitration \nprocess itself was fundamentally tainted.\n  We need something more than nullification review. We need an \ninstitution that will take a fresh look at arbitrators' conclusions of \nlaw and decide whether they got it right.\n  It may be that we will not be able to build a new appellate body for \ninvestor-state dispute settlement in the context of the Chile agreement \nover the course of the next few months. However, it is my expectation \nthat our negotiators will continue this endeavor beyond the formal \ninitialing of that agreement, and that they will secure Chile's \ncommitment to that endeavor. I want to make it clear that any first \nsteps short of true appellate review included in the U.S.-Chile \nAgreement should be understood as just that--first steps. The trade \nact's objective requires that we go further.\n  An agreement with Chile can be one of two things--if supported by a \nlarge bipartisan majority, it can put us on the right track for other \nagreements--agreements with Singapore and Morocco, agreements for \nhemispheric free trade. It can even help us achieve success in the WTO.\n  Or this agreement can become a political battleground--where those in \nCongress who were promised a partnership of equals in trade policy feel \nduped. Where commitments to agreements that reflect strong labor and \nenvironmental standards go unrealized.\n  I hope that I can strongly support an agreement with Chile--I want \nto. And I know many of my colleagues who voted for the trade act also \nwant to. But I\n\n[[Page S9944]]\n\nwould caution the administration that they have responsibilities to \nCongress under this Act. And so far, they seem willing to play fast and \nloose with those responsibilities. I say respectfully that they \ncontinue that path at their peril.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I was privileged 2 days ago to join on \nthe floor with my esteemed colleague, Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, \nand Senator Bayh and Senator McCain when the four of us introduced the \nresolution which is the pending resolution before the body. We came \ntogether as a foursome, sort of, under the following circumstances.\n  Senator Lieberman and I, in 1991, were the principal cosponsors of \nthe resolution which authorized President George Herbert Walker Bush to \ninstitute the use of force with the U.S. men and women in uniform \ntogether with numbers of uniformed individuals from the coalition that \nhe, President Bush, had put together in the fall of 1990 and early \n1991.\n  I had talked with Senators Lieberman and McCain about this \nforthcoming resolution, which our President requested. I happened to be \namong the Senate leadership in the Cabinet Room when he spoke to us \nabout a month or so ago indicating he would want the Congress to \nprovide a resolution, given the growing crisis that the world faces \nwith Saddam Hussein and his threatened use of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  I think our President has shown extraordinary leadership in this \ncrisis. I remember vividly the fall of 1990 and 1991 as the buildup was \ntaking place. But that buildup was taking place against the background \nof the clear, unwarranted, blatant use of force by Saddam Hussein \nagainst the people of Kuwait. Together with a number of our colleagues, \nI visited that region several times. Ever so vivid is my memory of the \nburning oilfields, of the capital of Kuwait severely damaged. It was \nsomething that was indelibly emblazoned in my mind.\n  The purpose of this resolution is to show the resolve of the Congress \nof the United States, show the resolve of other nations, not to let \nthat happen again. People say: Where is the smoking gun? Let's hope we \ndo not have a smoking gun. In other words, that gun will not have been \nfired, leaving a trail of smoke, as it was in 1990 and 1991.\n  The rapid development of technology in the decade-plus since that \nconflict undergirds the decision now to bring together a coalition of \nnations and for the Congress to speak with one voice with our President \nto try to avoid a conflict.\n  Each day, I watch our President address this issue. Wherever he is \ntraveling in the United States, time and time again he reminds the \npeople: The last option is the use of force and war. Throughout the \nhistory of the world, famous military leaders, George Washington and \nothers, have said the best way to avoid war is to show clearly the \npreparations and the ability and the willingness to fight.\n  Through the centuries, that has proven to be the most effective way \nto deter war.\n  It is the desire of our President, it is the desire of everyone \nprivileged to serve in the Senate, and indeed in the House of \nRepresentatives, to avoid war. But through the leadership of our \nPresident, he has brought to the attention not only of the people of \nthe United States but to the people of the entire world the threat \nposed today by Saddam Hussein.\n  The conflict in 1990-1991 was fought by Saddam Hussein and repelled \nby the coalition of nations led by the United States. That conflict, \nalmost without exception, was fought with what we refer to as \nconventional weapons--the tanks, the artillery people, the rifles, and \nthe hand grenades. We were fortunate in that conflict that weapons of \nmass destruction such as biological and chemical were not employed to \nany great extent.\n  I say that because Saddam Hussein had those weapons strategically \nplaced with his various elements inside Iraq and some forward-deployed \ncache, if he were to give the order to use them. So they were there. \nIndeed, the destruction of some of the cache could well have had \ninjured some of our troops. That is still not fully known. But those \nweapons of mass destruction were poised and ready for use.\n  Now we know that in the years subsequent to that conflict--once he \ndrove the inspectors who were there in accordance with United Nations \nresolutions out of Iraq some 4 years ago--he has put the resources of \nhis country behind replenishing those weapons and even building larger \nstocks and newer types--types that are now more easily transportable, \ntypes that can be containerized in weapons.\n  Here we are faced with the situation of an individual who has \nextensively utilized in years past--not in the 1990-1991 conflict but \nin the war with Iran--chemical weapons. He also used those chemical \nweapons against elements of his own people who he was trying to repress \nand subject to his tyrannical regime.\n  So there is a clear case history of the use of these weapons. There \nis now a clear, documented case of open intelligence that he possesses \nlarger stocks, more versatile stocks and the ability to use them.\n  How can this Nation and how can other nations just sit and wait?\n  To the everlasting credit of President Bush, our President, he has \nalerted the world, and he has taken those steps necessary to prepare \nthis Nation and those steps necessary to engage every possible \ndiplomatic means to avoid conflict. That is the course of action he is \nembarking on now here at home and in the United Nations and foreign \ncapitals of the world.\n  Madam President, I have been advised that one of our colleagues has a \nvery tight schedule to enable him to return to his State. This Senator \nis going to be available throughout the day. At this point in time, I \nwould like to yield the floor as a courtesy to a colleague.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for \nextending the courtesy to allow me to speak for about 13 minutes in \nregard to the resolution that is before us today.\n  Madam President, after careful consideration, meditation and prayer \nto the Holy Spirit for enlightment and wisdom, I rise today in support \nof the resolution before us.\n  We all recognize that the world is a very different place than it was \nbefore September 11. In spite of the 1993 bombing at the World Trade \nCenter, the attack on the U.S.S. Cole, and the attacks on our Embassies \nin Africa, the threat of terrorism was not taken seriously enough by \nour country and the rest of the world. The tragic events of that day--\nour 21st century Pearl Harbor changed the way that we and the rest of \nthe world perceive terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. For \nAmerica, the loss of more than 3,000 lives demanded this change and, as \nI said on 9/11, demanded that we ``identify those who committed these \ncowardly acts, as well as those who encourage them through actions or \nsilence, and make them fully pay for their crimes.''\n  Saddam Hussein poses a clear threat to peace in the world, to America \nand our interests, to regional stability, and to his own people. After \nbriefings by the Secretary of Defense, the President's National \nSecurity Advisor, the Director of the CIA, and members of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, I am convinced that the threat is real. He has an \narsenal of sophisticated chemical and biological weapons and continues \nto refine and manufacture them and develop ways to deliver them. He is \nworking as if his life depended on it to acquire nuclear weapons and \ndeliver them. He supports terrorist groups and encourages violence \nagainst Israel with cash payments to the families of suicide bombers. \nAlthough we have not connected the acts of al-Qaida and 9/11 directly \nwith Iraq, we know that al-Qaida is present there as are \nrepresentatives of other terrorist groups.\n\n[[Page S9945]]\n\n  After 9/11, do we doubt that terrorist groups would turn down the \nopportunity to get their hands on Saddam's weapons and use them against \nus?\n  It is well documented that Saddam Hussein has used chemical weapons \nagainst his own people and his neighbors. According to the Center for \nStrategic and International Studies, during the Iraq-Iran War Saddam \nused chemical weapons in August 1983, against Iranians and Kurds, \nresulting in 100 casualties; in October and November of 1983 against \nIranians and Kurds resulting in 3,000 casualties; in February and March \nof 1983 against Iranians causing 2,500 casualties; in March 1984 \nagainst Iranians causing between 50 and 100 casualties; in March 1985 \nagainst Iranians causing 3,000 casualties; in February 1986 against \nIranians causing 8,000-10,000 casualties; in December 1986 against \nIranians causing 1,000 casualties; in April 1987 against Iranians \ncausing 5,000 casualties; in October 1987 against Iranians causing \n3,000 casualties; and in March of 1988 against Iranians and Kurds \ncausing hundreds of casualties.\n  And, no one needs to be reminded that he invaded a peaceful neighbor \nand committed countless atrocities against the people of Kuwait until \nthe world community acted in concert to drive him out.\n  Saddam Hussein has thumbed his nose at the international community \nfor a decade by ignoring U.N. Security Council resolutions--resolutions \nthat required him to disclose his weapons stockpiles, to disarm, and to \ncut ties to terrorist groups. He has lied repeatedly and has proven \nbeyond any possible doubt that he cannot be trusted.\n  Moreover, by example, Iraq encourages other rogue nations and groups \nto follow its lead with a simple message: ``Go ahead and do what you \nwant. The world community does not have the backbone to stop you.''\n  That example cannot be allowed to stand. Saddam Hussein is the \nneighborhood bully and only when neighbors come together and say enough \nis enough can he be stopped. He needs to understand that the jig is up \nand the world must act now together to protect the peace by confronting \nthis bully.\n  It is not only appropriate but essential that members of the United \nNations come together to confront Saddam Hussein, and I applaud the \nPresident for challenging the United Nations to reaffirm its relevance \nby standing up to Iraq. Already his diplomatic efforts have produced \nresults. If the President had not successfully crystallized \ninternational attention with his speech before the United Nations, then \nIraq would not even have started talking about letting inspectors \nreturn.\n  It is imperative that the U.N. Security Council pass a strong \nresolution demanding that Iraq comply with U.N. resolutions allowing \nfor unfettered inspection without conditions, dismantle his weapons of \nmass destruction, and that the U.N. back up these demands with the \nthreat of force.\n  It is my hope and prayer that these diplomatic efforts will succeed. \nHowever, if the world is to be safe from Saddam Hussein, if we are to \npreserve stability in the Middle East, and if the United States is to \nbe safe, then we--in cooperation with our allies--have to be willing to \ntake military action if our diplomatic efforts are rebuffed.\n  In the event that military action should be required, it should be \ndone under the auspices of the U.N. or, in the alternative, in \nconjunction with our allies as we did in Operation Desert Storm. That \ncoalition successfully drove Saddam out of Kuwait and paid for $57 \nbillion of the operation. A broad, multinational coalition will send a \nstrong signal of international resolve not only to Saddam Hussein, but \nto others who seek to acquire weapons of mass destruction. It will show \nthat the international community will not sit idly by, but will instead \ncome together to confront grave threats to peace and security in the \nworld.\n  Finally, should Saddam Hussein be removed from power as a result of \nmilitary action or internal upheaval, a strong international coalition \nwill more effectively implement peacekeeping and rebuilding efforts--\nrebuilding efforts that can largely be paid for with Iraq's substantial \noil resources. If we are to count on the international community's \nparticipation throughout this effort then it is imperative that we work \nto solidify their support from the very beginning.\n  Let us be perfectly clear, Congress has already enacted strong \nlegislation concerning Iraq. The Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 passed the \nSenate unanimously and passed the House by a vote of 360-38. This \nlegislation established that regime change is U.S. policy toward Iraq \nand it provided $97 million to Iraqi opposition groups.\n  The resolution before us today puts a premium on diplomacy first but \nbacks up words with actions if necessary. It is a significant \nimprovement over previous versions that, frankly, failed to adequately \nprioritize diplomacy and the need for the U.S. to seek international \ncooperation.\n  One of the concerns I have heard repeatedly from Ohioans was the fear \nthat the U.S. would go it alone and preemptively strike Iraq without \nfirst reaching out diplomatically or engaging the international \ncommunity. I would strongly oppose that course of action. The \nresolution before us today, in my opinion, does not allow that to \nhappen.\n  It makes clear the convictions of Congress that the President should \nexhaust all diplomatic options first, but if Iraq resists diplomatic \nsolutions, then the President is authorized to use all necessary means \nto enforce U.N. Security Council resolutions in Iraq.\n  In section 2, the resolution calls on the President to work with the \nUnited Nations. In section 3, the resolution allows the President to \nback up our diplomacy with action, defend American interests against \nIraqi threats and enforce U.N. resolutions concerning Iraq.\n  In exercising the authority under section 3, the President is \nrequired to first determine that reliance on diplomacy alone will not \nsucceed in protecting our national security or lead to enforcement of \nU.N. Security Council resolutions. Also, he is required to report that \ndetermination to Congress and make regular reports on the status of any \nmilitary action.\n  This version of the resolution is an improvement over previous \nversions because it contains new language supporting the President's \nefforts in the U.N. to obtain Saddam's compliance with Security Council \nresolutions. It also limits and defines the scope of the authorization \nto use military force specifically to Iraq instead of the entire \nregion. It limits the duration of authorization to the current and \nongoing threats from Iraq and clarifies that the authorization to use \nforce applies to the U.N. resolutions concerning Iraq.\n  The resolution today reflects compromise, is balanced, limited in \nscope, and specific in its goals. Most importantly, it reflects the \nimportance of putting diplomacy first and working with the \ninternational community to solve the Iraqi threat.\n  Madam President, I do not take my vote on this resolution lightly and \nunderstand the enormous impact it can have on the men and women who \nserve in our Armed Forces and their families, and on our country and \nthe world.\n  As Governor I served as the commander-in-chief of the Ohio National \nGuard during Operation Desert Storm. I attended the funerals of those \nthat did not come back and, because my wife Janet and I have lost a \nchild, I understand the grief of parents and have an insight into the \nenormous loss to surviving spouses and to their children. I also grieve \nfor those we lost on 9/11 and for their families and I vowed that I \nwould do all in my power to make sure that we would never have another \n9/11. Madam President, I believe that voting for this resolution will \nhelp me keep my vow. I also believe that voting for this resolution \nwill reduce the likelihood of using force.\n  Madam President, I trust our President. He is a man of good \ncharacter. He has surrounded himself with one of the most experienced, \nknowledgeable teams fielded by any President in my memory starting with \nVice President Cheney to Secretary Powell, Secretary Rumsfeld and \nNational Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice.\n  I have been briefed by State, Defense, the CIA and the White House. I \nwish all Americans could have sat in on these briefings.\n  I believe the resolution before us that was put together in \nbipartisan negotiations reflects the balance of power that must exist \nbetween the executive and legislative branches. It allows the\n\n[[Page S9946]]\n\nPresident the authority to use force but respects Congress' power to \nrestrict that authority. It reflects the concerns of Congress that \nevery diplomatic effort be made first and that any action take place in \ncooperation with the international community.\n  May the Holy Spirit enlighten the leaders of the world to understand \nthe true meaning of the Second Great Commandment to love they neighbor \nas thyself and may God continue to bless America as we go forward.\n  Thank you, Madam President. And I thank the Senator from Virginia for \nallowing me to make this statement on my support of the fine resolution \nhe has put together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank our colleague for a very strong \nstatement of support. I know he has reflected long and hard on this \nissue, and will continue to do so. He has searched his conscience, \nreached his decision and, in a most fitting way, concluded his remarks \nwith prayer, which is so important as we go into these difficult times \nahead. I hope at some point he might consider becoming a cosponsor of \nthe resolution.\n  With the resolution Senators Lieberman, Bayh, McCain and I put before \nthe Senate, we embark on this historic debate. One of my great \nrecollections is of the debate we had in 1991 at the time the first \nGeorge Bush was President, and sought to use force. It was, with a deep \nsense of humility, one of the highlights of my career to have been on \nthe floor as a comanager with then-Republican leader Senator Dole and \nSenator McCain, Senator Stevens, and others who were working the \nmanagement side of that historic debate. On the other side of the aisle \nwas the distinguished majority leader, Senator Mitchell, a lifelong \nfriend, Senator Sam Nunn, who at that time was chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, and I was ranking member. They took quite a \ndifferent position.\n  The Nation experienced a very good debate by the Senate. Of course, \nat the conclusion of that debate, only by a mere five votes did the \nresolution--I won't say on our side of the aisle, but it was \nbipartisan--the resolution Senator Lieberman and I submitted to the \nSenate prevailed.\n  We are on the threshold of another debate of similar significance and \nproportions. I welcome it, as do other colleagues, who at the moment do \nnot agree with the contents of the resolution. We will see in the days \nto come the evolution of one of the greater debates in the contemporary \nhistory of the Senate.\n  One of the most difficult things any of us here in Congress, indeed, \nany citizen of the United States, ever faces is a decision to authorize \nthe use of the Armed Forces.\n  I have been privileged myself to serve twice in uniform, once as a \n17-year-old sailor at the concluding months of World War II. I did not \ngo overseas at that time. Fortunately, the war was concluded rather \nunexpectedly. But we were prepared, my age group of 17 and 18, 19-year-\nolds, not unlike those today in uniform, to follow out the orders of \nthe Commander in Chief, President Harry Truman. I have in my office \ntoday a small bronze statue of him given to me by one of the veterans' \norganizations as a reminder of the courage that President showed at \nthat time in our history.\n  When I enlisted in January 1945, the Battle of the Bulge was just \ncompleting. It was an extraordinary battle, where Hitler had thrown his \nlast divisions against the force that crossed the Normandy beaches and \nhad been working its way through Belgium toward Germany. I remind our \naudience today, in that one battle alone, 41,000 Americans were killed, \nwounded, or missing in action, to give the proportion of the battles \nthat our Nation, together with Great Britain, France, and others, were \nengaged in in that conflict. That is in comparison to the valiant \nefforts of our troops today in Afghanistan, where the casualties, \nfortunately, are in the 100s to 200s so far in their heroic efforts to \nturn the tide of terrorism.\n  It is important to remind America of the sacrifices of previous \ngenerations, as we make this difficult decision. The Battle of the \nBulge was followed by United States forces in the Pacific, when the \nMarines and elements of the United States Army stormed Iwo Jima. That \nwas a battle of some 6 to 7 weeks. There 21,000 Americans were killed, \nwounded, or missing. Again, we always have to reflect on the enormity \nof the sacrifices previous generations have made to enable us to be \nstanding here today with the same courage and conviction they had to \nface the dangers of the world in this hour, on this day, and in the \nweeks and months to come.\n\n  I remember so well the Korean war. Again, I had the privilege of \nserving in the Marines. My two periods of military service were very \nmodest. I am always extremely humble when I am in the presence of \nothers who served far more valiantly and displayed far more courage \nthan I ever had the opportunity to display. I was able to serve \nalongside brave men and some women in both of those conflicts.\n  Again, in the Korean war, for a brief period, I served in Korea with \nthe First Marine Air Wing. I remember the aviators in our squadron. \nThey flew every day. Occasionally I was in the capacity of an observer \nwith them. Again, I don't put myself in the combat arms category \nbecause I was a staff officer. I remember they didn't come home from \nthose missions; several in the tent in which I slept. You are mindful \nof the sacrifices when you have to take the personal effects of your \nbunkmate, wrap them in a blanket, and send them back home.\n  So those are the things that cross my mind as I stand here today and \nas I will stand on this floor in the days to come as we pursue this \nresolution.\n  Even though I had those modest experiences of active duty, and then, \nI must say, during the next major engagement, the war in Vietnam, I was \nprivileged to serve in the Pentagon, again, alongside the brave men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces of the United States who fought in that \nbattle, several of whom are serving in this Chamber today: Senators \nMcCain and Hagel. Those are truly warriors. But in visiting the \nbattlefields in Vietnam in the concluding months and years after, \n50,000-plus Americans were casualties in that conflict. Again, it was \nthe courage and the resolve of that generation and previous generations \nthat undergird the same courage and resolve that is in the Armed Forces \ntoday, if the Commander in Chief has to give the order to engage them \nin conflict.\n  It is with a sense of deep emotion I deliver these remarks today in \nsupport of this resolution which I was privileged with others to draw.\n  Senator Lott, throughout the drawing up of this resolution, has shown \nextraordinary leadership. His door and his office were opened. He \nconvened from time to time small groups of Senators to sit down and \ngather their ideas and their thoughts. He continues to do that. \nFinally, the time came when the administration, working actively with \nthe group that was drawing up the resolution, laid down a marker, and \nthat is this resolution.\n  My distinguished friend and colleague, the chairman of the committee \non which I am privileged to serve as ranking member, Senator Levin, \nengaged in his debate this morning in setting forth his ideas, which \nare very different from mine. Perhaps there will be other Senators who \nwill come to the floor and set forth their ideas, which could be \ndifferent from this resolution. We will see how, procedurally, the \nSenate addresses the differing views. But I think those debates and \ndiffering views will add to the strength of the ultimate resolution, \nwhich I respectfully say to my colleagues will be passed upon with \nstrong, bipartisan support behind the ultimate resolution and the form \nit takes. I believe it will remain as it is today, but I will not make \na prediction as to what might occur.\n  We must pay due respect to our colleagues who have different views. \nBut the important thing is that the Congress speaks with one voice with \nour President as he proceeds to address these issues in the United \nNations and as he proceeds to engage other nations' leaders to \nencourage them to accept the same responsibility the United States is \nprepared to accept in addressing the potential dangers of these weapons \nof mass destruction which are clearly possessed by Saddam Hussein and \nhis regime.\n  This is, quite literally, a decision to put our Nation's sons and \ndaughters in harm's way. It is a decision that must never be taken \nlightly. It is also a decision we must be willing to make when\n\n[[Page S9947]]\n\nthe security of our Nation or our vital national security interests are \nthreatened. Today, our President and others have made it eminently \nclear that those interests are threatened.\n  Another interesting bit of history is that our Republic--some 200-\nplus years old--has sent forth the men and women of our Nation in \nuniform--depending on the calculation you use--close to 100 times. Some \ncalculations use 80, some 90, but it is roughly 100 times.\n  The issue is often put to me as to the Constitution, which created \nthe two coequal branches of our Government--the executive branch headed \nby the President of the United States, and the legislative branch \ncomposed of the two Houses of Congress, coequal in their \nresponsibilities as it relates to the crisis we face today and the \ncrises we have had over 200 years when about 85 times--I will use that \nfigure--men and women have gone forth into harm's way. The interesting \nthing is that in article I, section 8, of the Constitution, it lays out \nthe responsibilities of the Congress. I would like to read this:\n\n       The Congress shall have the Power to lay and collect Taxes, \n     Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for \n     the common Defense and general Welfare of the United States; \n     but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform \n     throughout the United States.\n\n  Then it goes on to enumerate with specificity the duties and the \npowers of Congress. One is to declare war. What does that mean? Well, \nthat is the ultimate and most serious responsibility of the Congress of \nthe United States. But as I look over those 80-plus times that the men \nand women of the Armed Forces have gone forward, only 4 times in the \n200-plus-year history has this Congress ever declared war. My \nrecollection is the War of 1812, and then in 1840, and--5 times--the \nSpanish-American War, World War I, and World War II--5 out of the 80-\nplus times that the men and women have gone forward.\n  So why is it we are not declaring war? Well, it would take too long \nto engage my colleagues, in my own view, as to why we do not declare \nwar. What we are about to do, let me say unequivocally, has the same \ndepth of seriousness and the same depth of consequences to the men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces as does the constitutional recitation of the \npower to declare war. So it is an awesome one.\n  I respect the vote of every person in this Chamber with whom, I say \nwith a sense of humility, I have enjoyed friendships, working \nrelationships--with some for the 24 years I have been privileged to \nserve here, almost a quarter century, and with others who are \ncompleting their first term, such as my colleague from Virginia, George \nAllen, with whom I have discussed this in great depth. He has a \nsearching mind, is intensely interested in the points of this issue, is \nclearly aware of the threat to this Nation, and is strongly in favor of \nthis resolution.\n  But each will have their own conscience to serve. I doubt if there is \na Member of this Chamber who has not spent a great deal of time already \nin studying the implications of this perplexing conflict that looms \nwith Saddam Hussein, the individual, and his immediate regime--not the \npeople of Iraq, but it is this dictator and those around him. Each of \nour colleagues has spent time studying this matter.\n  We have received, in varying degrees, briefings on the facts. My \nlong-time friend, Senator Stevens, the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee and the ranking member of the Defense \nSubcommittee on Appropriations, and I conferred with our leadership \nyesterday. I think there will be a similar initiative taken by the \nDemocratic leadership to bring others in early next week to provide \nfurther briefings, particularly in the area of intelligence.\n  I have undertaken--I will speak for myself--to encourage the \nadministration to see what further declassification we can make of \ncertain facts that could be important to each Senator as he and she \nreach their decisions on this resolution--facts that will enable them \nto go back home with coequal responsibility to the duties we have in \nthe Chamber. It is going back home--as I will do this weekend, with two \nscheduled meetings with people and to talk with my constituents about \nthis resolution, but more importantly, the overall problems that face \nthis Nation today, as posed by this arsenal of weapons of mass \ndestruction possessed by Saddam Hussein.\n  I cannot tell you the satisfaction I receive--and I think others do--\nwhen we go back home to our communities, whether large or small--and it \nis not necessarily whether they are Republicans, or Democrats, or \nIndependents; they are citizens, and they are focused on this problem. \nIt has been my experience, in the past weeks particularly, that they \nare focused very intently on this problem. Many have their sons and \ndaughters serving in uniform today. Many now recognize, in the wake of \nthe tragedy of September 11 of last year, that we no longer as a nation \nenjoy the protections of being here in this country and so much of the \nthreat being beyond the oceans.\n  If I may, I will enter into a little personal story. My father served \nin World War I. He was a young doctor who served in the trenches. I \nproudly hang his picture on the wall of my Senate office--in uniform, \nin France, where he was decorated for valor and gallantry for going to \nthe front trenches to care for the wounded--wounded himself. I remember \nwhen I was growing up and the looming clouds of war began to make an \nawareness in this country in the late thirties when I was a very young \nman and the forties that the United States could become embroiled. He, \nof course, having deep roots in the State of Virginia, took me on \ntrips. We took a trip down the coastline in the area of Norfolk, VA. He \nwanted to show me the coastal artillery weapons. Not one of those \nweapons exist today, except maybe in a museum. They were enormous \ncannons. The whole cannon itself was probably half the width of the \nSenate Chamber from the barrel back to the carriage where the shell was \nput in the breech.\n\n  My father would say: You know, son, these oceans protect us, but if \nan enemy were to come, this weapon fires 20 miles out to sea with \nenormous accuracy. This was a brilliant man, my father. He had seen \nwar. He said: We are protected by the ocean. We are protected by our \ncoastal defenses.\n  He was proven wrong. In the first place, those weapons hardly ever \nfired. They were eventually, during World War II, melted down and the \nmetal incorporated in more modern artillery pieces. We did, however, as \na nation, experience warfare right off the coast of Virginia and other \ncoastal States on the Atlantic coast when the German submarine force \nbegan to sink merchant ships. We were trying to supply those nations \nabroad in Europe that were suffering the ravages of World War I, and \nthose ships were sunk right off the coast of Virginia.\n  I went back with my father one time. To his astonishment, there on \nthe beaches was scattered the debris from those sinkings. Those are \nmemories that I cherish and I keep.\n  I always remember those oceans have protected us--those long \ndistances. Saddam Hussein is up to 6,000 miles away, and people in the \nsecurity of our homes say: Is he really a menace to us? We will see \nunfold here in the days to come the story of how he can take the \nweapons of mass destruction, he can take some of that biological \nmaterial and put it in the hands of the worldwide terrorist \norganization, and we only need to look at 9/11 to know that \norganization existed then and still, to a lesser extent, to the credit \nof the initiatives of our President and the men and women in the Armed \nForces, it possibly is not as powerful, certainly, as al-Qaida, but it \nexists today. And if that technology manufactured by Saddam Hussein \ngets into the hands of those terrorists--and I say as strongly as we \ntry to protect the borders of this country, we put in a lot of measures \nto strengthen our borders, but it is not beyond risk that material \ncould be smuggled into this country and utilized in such a way as to \ncause incredible damage and destruction to human life and further \ncomplicate our ability to have a security umbrella in homeland defense \nto enable us to conduct our way of life, perform our work at our places \nof business, and to live our lives.\n  It is very serious. This man has that material. For example, open \nintelligence now shows, and the experts have discussed this in the \nopen, some of the manufacturing infrastructure of the biological and \npossibly chemical weapons are now on trucks, trucks of the proportions \nwe see on the highways throughout this country; three or four of those \nlarger trucks put together at\n\n[[Page S9948]]\n\none location, the manufacturing capability to build--manufacture \nperhaps is a better word--manufacture the biological and chemicals \nweapons. We know it is transportable because it can move about in those \ntrucks. He does that to provide deception and cover for his \nmanufacturing capability.\n  I will point out one other tragic fact. This very institution, the \nCongress of the United States, together with our postal system, \nsuffered through an anthrax--that is a biological weapon--attack. To \nthis day, no matter how hard our investigative infrastructure has \nworked--and they have worked hard--we do not have the full story of how \nthat was done.\n\n  The leadership of our Senate and the House of Representatives, \ntogether with our infrastructure--the Secretary of the Senate, the \nSergeant at Arms, the medical department, Admiral Eisold--worked to \nenable us to as quickly as possible resume the use of the Hart Building \nwhich was closed down and took precautions in the Congress of the \nUnited States, most particularly the Senate, to carry on our business.\n  Think of the disruption we experienced. That is the type of threat we \nare addressing in this resolution. That is the type of threat.\n  In the days to come, I will have more specifics to share with my \ncolleagues and with those who are following this debate.\n  None of us wants to see our men and women in uniform committed to \nforeign battlefields. None of us seeks a war with Saddam Hussein. Our \nPresident has reiterated that almost every time he has spoken. I was \nprivileged to be with him the other day on the steps of his office when \nhe addressed the Nation, and I had the privilege of saying a few words \nin support at the time this resolution was introduced.\n  He reminded the Nation and the world again: War, conflict is the last \nresort; that the strength and the resolve that we take now is the best \nway to avoid that conflict.\n  There are times, again, we must be prepared and willing to resort to \nthe use of force to protect our national security and the people of our \ngreat Nation and those of our allies. This is one of those times, \ncritical times, in the 200-plus years of our Republic.\n  The principal purpose of this resolution is to authorize our \nPresident to use military force if--if--he deems it necessary to remove \nthe threat to our Nation and the world possessed by Saddam Hussein and \nhis growing inventory of weapons of mass destruction--the chemical and \nbiological weapons this evil man already possesses and the nuclear \nweapons he is racing to acquire--I repeat, working to acquire.\n  My colleagues will recall in the early 1980s, Israel struck a bold \nmove to bomb the plant that Saddam Hussein was utilizing at that time \nto build his arsenal of nuclear weapons. That set him back. I often \nwonder: Could we have, as a member of a coalition of nations, prevailed \nin the gulf war of 1990 and 1991 had that plant finally, with other \nelements of infrastructure, produced a nuclear weapon?\n  Stop and think about it. That war, in terms of combat by the \ncoalition forces, was 100 hours of vigorous fighting to repel Saddam \nHussein's forces out of Kuwait and drive them across the border of \nIraq. Could we have done that war as successfully in the face of a \nnuclear weapon had he possessed it at that time?\n  I remember going with other Members several days after the conclusion \nof the final hours of that war, visiting the battlefield on the border \nof Iraq strewn for miles with abandoned and burning equipment, where \nthe Iraqi armed forces dropped their arms, fled to their homes, and the \nsafety they felt their borders provided. Had he had a nuclear weapon at \nthat time, they might not have turned, dropped their arms and ran.\n  We know he is working on it. There is unquestioned evidence to show \nhe is working to obtain that category of weapons. But the primary \nconcern we have at the moment is he actually possesses weapons of mass \ndestruction in the category of biological and chemical. That is \nirrefutable in fact.\n  The principal purposes resolution is to authorize our President to \nuse that force if, and I repeat, if he deems it necessary to remove the \nthreat of those weapons for the security of our Nation and other \nnations.\n  As recently as September 19 of this year, a week after President Bush \naddressed the United Nations, Saddam Hussein denied he has such \nweapons. It was clear in 1984, when Saddam Hussein used chemical \nweapons against Iran, that he had such weapons. It was clear in 1987, \nwhen Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons against his own citizens in \nthe Kurdish areas, that he had such weapons. It was clear in 1994, \nafter UNSCOM--those are the first inspectors--had uncovered enormous \nstockpiles, that he had such weapons. It was clear in 1998, when Saddam \nHussein expelled UNSCOM inspectors from Iraq that he had such weapons. \nIt is clear in 2002, after 4 years without the international United \nNations inspectors being able to perform their duties, that Saddam \nHussein has such weapons and is urgently attempting to manufacture and \nacquire more, most particularly the nuclear capability of weapons.\n  This resolution also authorizes the President to use all necessary \nmeans to ensure that Saddam Hussein complies with the U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions which prohibit Iraqi support for terrorism and \nterrorist organizations, prohibits Saddam Hussein's repression of \nminorities within his country, require repatriation and accounting for \nprisoners of war--that is the 1990 war--which he was required to do but \nhas defied the resolution; and return of such other property as owing \nto Kuwait, that small little country he so devastated in 1990-1991.\n  Why now, is the question we hear in this debate? And I pay respect to \nthose who raise questions because I think it is important that the \ntoughest of questions are raised.\n  The answer is simple. Enough is enough. In this post-9/11 world, we \nas a nation cannot afford to wait while this evil dictator, who \nterrorizes his own people and shelters those who terrorize others--just \nthink, al-Qaida elements are now known to be within Iraq--acquires even \nmore destructive capabilities to attack and terrorize our Nation, \npossibly his neighbors in the region and the entire world.\n  Saddam Hussein brutally invaded Kuwait in August of 1990. In the \nensuing Persian Gulf war, he was decisively defeated on the battlefield \nby the coalition of forces in that heroic battle of roughly 100 hours.\n  In the aftermath, Saddam Hussein agreed--and the pictures are there \nof his representatives meeting in the desert to sign these agreements--\nto comply with a number of U.N. Security Council resolutions. He was \ndefeated. The coalition forces made a decision not to pursue the \nremnants of his bedraggled fleeing army into Iraq, but they decided to \nimpose upon Saddam Hussein and his regime a very strict set of \nresolutions in order to prevent any comparable use of aggression by his \nforces beyond his borders.\n\n  Almost 12 years later, we are still waiting for Iraq to comply with \nthose international mandates. Saddam Hussein has defied the \ninternational community for far too long. Diplomatic efforts have not \nworked. Economic sanctions have not worked. He has skillfully figured \nout how to evade those sanctions, to sell on the world oil market.\n  His nation has the second largest known reserves of petroleum, second \nonly to Saudi Arabia, from which he can generate considerable oil \nrevenues--and that he has done in the ensuing years, skillfully evading \nthe United Nations clear restrictions on the use of oil revenues; \ndiverted it away from his people, let them starve; diverted it away \nfrom food and medicine to care for his people; diverted those funds \ninto building weapons of mass destruction.\n  The time is running late. That is why now. The time is now for Saddam \nHussein to live up to the 16 U.N. resolutions he has defied.\n  In my public life, I have had the privilege of working with two very \nwell-respected Secretaries of State, and I want to take a moment to \nquote these two Secretaries, George Schultz and Henry Kissinger. These \nare men who have dominated the international scene and worked with \nworld leaders for many years. I know them both very well, I am \nprivileged to say. This has nothing to do with politics, nothing to do \nwith Republican versus Democrat. These are their views as the elder \nstatesmen. They are still both very active in international discourse, \nstill\n\n[[Page S9949]]\n\nvery active in trying to achieve peace in the world. Extraordinary. \nThey have not rested on their laurels and slipped back into blissful \nretirement. They still remain on the cutting edge of diplomacy the \nworld over.\n  Secretary of State George Schultz recently stated:\n\n       The danger is immediate. The making of weapons of mass \n     destruction grows increasingly difficult to counter with each \n     passing day. The moment is racing toward us when Hussein's \n     possession of nuclear weapons could transform the regional \n     and international situation into what in the Cold War we \n     called a balance of terror.\n\n\n  He is referring to that period when our Nation and other nations were \nfaced with an awesome inventory of nuclear weapons possessed then by \nthe Soviet Union.\n  Strong determination in the Western World--and led in the final days \nby a very courageous President, Ronald Reagan, who said, tear down that \nwall, Mr. Gorbachev, referring to the Berlin wall. Because of the \ndetermination of the free nations and because of the voice of \nexpression of so many people who had been repressed in the Soviet \nUnion, that wall did come down. Today we see a revived and \nstrengthening nation of Russia. There is a clear example of when forces \nof freedom gathered against the forces of oppression and were \nsuccessful.\n  I remember going to that wall with Senator Moynihan, a wonderful, \nmarvelous friend of mine from New York, as it was being torn down. We \nwere part of a delegation. We actually went out with people who were \ngathered there who picked up their own hammers and chipped off pieces \nof the wall. The chip is on my mantle in the Senate. That little chip \nreminds me of the symbolism and the importance of nations resolving to \nhave the strength to overcome oppression.\n  Shultz said the moment is racing toward us when Saddam Hussein's \npossession of nuclear weapon could transform the regional and \ninternational situation into what in the cold war we called the balance \nof terror. Some argue that to act now might trigger Hussein's use of \nthe worst weapons. We must have that in mind. Such self-imposed \nblackmail presumes easier judgments when he is even better equipped \nthan now. ``Time is his ally,'' concluded Secretary Shultz, ``not \nours.'' Ours, being the United States, Great Britain, whose Prime \nMinister has stood steadfast with President Bush in the resolve to \nalert the people of both of our Nations to the potential dangers.\n  (Mr. DAYTON assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Prime Minister Tony Blair, whom I have been privileged to \nbe with on several occasions, has shown enormous courage, in the face \nof dissension among his own political party, dissension of the people \nin Great Britain who marched in the streets, 100,000, but that is the \nburden put on leadership, be it in Great Britain, America, or \nelsewhere, to go and explain.\n  As George Shultz said, time is Saddam Hussein's ally, not ours. We \nmust join our arms in a solid phalanx to repel the threats of the \nweapons of mass destruction possessed by Saddam Hussein.\n  Continuing in the testimony before the Senate Foreign Affairs \nCommittee last week, Dr. Kissinger testified. I talked to Dr. Kissinger \nby phone. I do it occasionally, as do other Members of the Senate. He \nis always available, no matter how busy or where he is in the world, to \ntake the calls from the Senate Members from both sides of the aisle.\n  I was engaging with Senator Levin in an effort to have him testify \nbefore our committee, but travel commitments prevented that. He wanted \nto do it, but said he would testify, if not before our committee, \nbefore the Foreign Affairs Committee. I commend Senator Biden and \nSenator Helms, Senator Lugar, and others who persuaded him to come \ndown.\n  In his testimony before the Foreign Affairs Committee, he said:\n\n       Unlike previous centuries, when the movement of armies \n     foreshadowed threat, modern technology in the service of \n     terror gives no warning, and its perpetrators vanish with the \n     act of commission. Cold war principles of deterrence are \n     almost impossible to implement when there is a multiplicity \n     of states, some of them harboring terrorists in position to \n     wreak havoc. The concern that war with Iraq could unleash \n     Iraqi weapons of mass destruction on Israel and Saudi \n     Arabia is a demonstration of how even existing stockpiles \n     of weapons turn into instruments of blackmail and self-\n     deterrence. Procrastination is bound to magnify such \n     possibilities.\n\n  Both Secretaries join in concluding in these remarks that time is \nSaddam Hussein's ally. Time is not ours.\n  Again, I commend our president, President Bush, for the leadership he \nhas shown on this issue. Saddam Hussein is a threat, not just to the \nUnited States but to the world, with his relentless drive to \nmanufacture and acquire weapons of mass destruction. We would not be \nhaving this debate in the U.S. Senate had not our president focused the \nattention of the world on this threat to freedom.\n  Time and time again, abroad, at home, wherever he is, he stops to \npoints out this threat. We would not have in the United Nations at this \nvery hour the consideration of a new and strong resolution, we would \nnot be having this debate in the United States at this very hour, had \nnot this courageous President of ours for months and months brought to \nthe attention of this Nation that time is not on our side.\n  President Clinton, to his credit, in 1998, brought this to the \nattention of the Congress, sought and received a resolution from the \nCongress which in many respects is parallel to this. But then again, \nand I do not criticize the President; I simply point out the fact of \nhistory, Clinton felt the United Nations would step in and pick up \ntheir responsibility as required by their charter. President Clinton \ndirected and utilized force in December of that period, had a bombing \nof Iraq when the inspectors were driven out. But again, the United \nNations began to go through its motions and this Nation and other \nnations felt we could entrust them with addressing that serious problem \nrecognized by President Clinton in 1998. But they failed. They failed. \nThe U.N. failed.\n  Let us hope they do not fail today or tomorrow or in the weeks to \ncome in devising a resolution, the four corners of which I think this \nNation has outlined to the Security Council, which if it is a decision \nthat inspectors once again go back, then and only then they go back if \nit is a new regime with teeth in it, backed up by the clear expression \nof the use of force if, in fact, Saddam Hussein does not cooperate, \nSaddam Hussein does not allow them to perform their duties consistent \nwith such new directives as the United Nations may lay down. That \nprocess is now on hold.\n  Members of the Senate have had available to them extensive briefings \nfrom senior administration, national security, and intelligence \nofficials on the situation in Iraq. We are continuing with that \nconsultation. These are sobering, thorough assessments that have been \ngiven to Members. A common base of knowledge of these facts is being \ngathered and presented to the Senate--much classified but an increasing \namount unclassified. But that adds up to a clear threat that Saddam \nHussein poses to the United States, to the region in which his nation \nis situated, and to elsewhere in the world. In particular, Saddam \nHussein's relentless pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and the \nmeans to deliver these weapons represents a present threat and an \nimmediate challenge to the international community.\n  That is the basic framework in which our President went to the United \nNations and gave his historic speech. I think there is not one on \neither side of the aisle who does not respect that moment in the United \nNations when our President stood up and challenged them to live up to \ntheir charter.\n  I remind my colleagues that the Iraqis agreed in writing on April 6, \n1991, just weeks after the 100-hour war had concluded, in a letter to \nthe U.N. Secretary General from the Iraqi Foreign Minister--Iraq as a \nnation accepted the cease-fire conditions as embodied in U.N. Security \nCouncil Resolution 687. It is very clear. It is all a matter of record. \nNot today, but next week I will put that resolution and its full text \nin the Record.\n  Prior to that, we all watched as Iraqi generals, at the direction of \nSaddam Hussein, met in a tent. I remember the pictures very well. It \nwas a tent in the middle of the desert, at the Safwah Airfield in Iraq, \nwith Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf. What an American hero he was. I had the \nprivilege, together\n\n[[Page S9950]]\n\nwith many of my colleagues, to visit him on several occasions. As a \nmatter of fact, I remember one time on our fourth trip over there, he \nsaid to us--and he was a man who had a good sense of humor--if I see \nany of you back here again, I am going to put you in khakis and send \nyou out into the battlefield.\n  I remember that. He had a good sense of humor. But he used to brief \nus thoroughly and carefully. What a magnificent individual: The right \nman at the right place at the right time.\n  Anyway, at that airfield, General Schwarzkopf, the commander who had \nled the forces of the coalition in that 100-hour engagement, discussed \nthe conditions of a cease-fire. He witnessed the signing of the papers. \nHe transmitted those papers to the United Nations. Colleagues, those \nconditions have never been met by Saddam Hussein and his regime. That \nis why we are gathered here today for this debate.\n  Last month, our President gave an historic speech, as I said, at the \nUnited Nations, challenging the U.N. to live up to its responsibility \nas stated in article I of the United Nations Charter, and I quote his \nremarks:\n\n       . . . to take effective collective measures for the \n     prevention and removal of threats to the peace.\n\n  In my view, President Bush was clearly there not to seek a \ndeclaration of war but to challenge this important organization to live \nup to the terms of the charter. That speech was one of the finest and \nmost important speeches ever given by a head of state of any nation to \nthe United Nations. The speech dramatically elevated the level of \ndebate and the attention of the world's leaders on Iraq's conduct and \ncontinued defiance of the U.N. It further challenged the nations of the \nworld to think long and hard about what they could expect from the \nUnited Nations: Is it to be effective and relevant--their actions \ntoday, tomorrow, and in the weeks to come--and live up to its charter, \nover 50 years old? Or is it to be irrelevant and fall into the dustbin \nof history, as did the League of Nations, as the world descended into \nthe darkness in the years following World War I and on the eve of World \nWar II?\n\n  There are among us Senators, and I hope one who will soon speak who \nhas spent much of his life studying diplomatic history. I will not take \nfurther time, but I do want to bring to the attention of Senators a \nlittle bit of history about the League of Nations. It was put together \nin the aftermath of World War I to prevent further conflict. I \nremembered, as I spoke about my father who served in World War I, our \nlibrary that was filled with books about the history of that conflict. \nI remember one book was entitled ``The Last Great War.'' There it is. I \nstill have that book, ``The Last Great War.'' And the world reposed \ntrust and confidence in the League of Nations, to ensure that war \nwouldn't happen.\n  I learned so much of my history from my father because when I was \nyoung, he would have me read the newspapers with him. I remember the \nworld was shocked in the 1930s, the late 1930s, when Mussolini, in a \nbolt out of the blue, invaded Abyssinia--a small nation presided over \nby a world-renowned statesman and President, Haile Selassie.\n  I remember when I first came to the Senate, he came to Washington and \na group of us went down and had breakfast with him. I will put in the \nRecord at another time the quotes of Haile Selassie, pleading with the \nLeague of Nations to come and rescue his tiny little nation from, in \nthose times, the high-tech Italian Army decimating his country.\n  What did the League do? It debated, it debated, it debated, it \ndebated. It did nothing.\n  I remember there was one press report. The reporters covered these \ndebates, covered what the League was discussing. One day, finally, the \nLeague decided to issue a press release. It said something to the \neffect that: There is a hope that we can make a little progress.\n  That reporter said: I don't know how I can report in truthfulness \nthat press release when in fact I am privy to being in closed session, \nbehind closed doors, and seeing that the League is doing nothing--\nnothing to resolve that conflict. And nothing they did. They limped on \nas an irrelevant international body throughout much of World War II and \nfinally packed up their remnants of files and furniture and office \nspaces, and I think they are in the archives of the U.N. somewhere.\n  Perhaps my colleague would be interested in probing, as I have, and \nwill in the days to come, that bit of history. We are on that threshold \nnow, when this organization can become irrelevant, as did the League, \nand go into the dustbin of history. That is the challenge this \nPresident has placed at the doorstep of the U.N. today.\n  Of equal importance, the President's U.N. speech articulated a clear, \ndecisive, and timely United States policy on Iraq; that is, to remove \nthe threat before Iraq is able to use its weapons of mass destruction. \nThe United States is now firmly on a course to accomplish this policy \nand invites the nations of the world to join.\n  Prior to his U.N. speech, this body, Members, challenged the \nPresident to do exactly what he did, go to the U.N. As our President \nbuilds this international coalition, it is vital that he do so with the \nstrong bipartisan support of the Congress. That is the purpose of this \nresolution. Over the summer, many Members of Congress and many American \ncitizens expressed the hope for meaningful consultations between \nCongress and the President, as well as consultations with our allies in \nthe United Nations. Our President has done exactly that.\n  It is now time for Congress, in accordance with his expressed request \nto the Congress, to express to the people of our Nation and to the \nworld its support of our President, squarely and overwhelmingly--with \nno daylight whatsoever--between how we stand firmly behind our \nPresident. That is the purpose of this resolution.\n  I say this as my own view: To the extent that Congress joins and \nsupports our President and sends that message unambiguously to the \ninternational community--most particularly to the United Nations and to \nSaddam Hussein with this resolution as now drafted--is to the extent to \nwhich we will be able to get a strong and decisive action from the \nUnited Nations.\n  We are making success. The reports are this morning that Hans Blix--\nwho has been deputized here in the past years to begin to work out \nplans for such further inspections in Iraq--when Hans Blix came back he \nwas ordered to the Security Council. The thought this morning was that \nhe believes before he goes back that he wants to see what actions the \nSecurity Council will take to enable a new regimen of inspection to be \neffective and not to be thwarted by Saddam Hussein.\n  We are, at this hour, at a very important juncture. I hope this body, \nas well as the House of Representatives, will send a resolution that \nwill have no daylight that could be exploited most certainly by some of \nthose nations that do not share the threat now that we know exists and \nthat could be used not only against us but against them, possibly.\n  It is my firm conviction that diplomatic efforts to achieve Iraqi \ncompliance with all applicable United Nations Security Council \nresolutions--16 so far--will fail unless the Iraqi dictator, Saddam \nHussein, clearly understands that swift and decisive force will be the \nautomatic consequence of any additional thwarting of such inspections \nas may be agreed upon.\n  Clearly, there are risks associated with confronting Iraq. I have \nenumerated those in some detail. But the risks associated with \ninaction, to me and to our President, are far greater if we fail to \nconfront this danger now--not tomorrow; now.\n  Some argue that a war with Iraq would distract our attention from the \nglobal war on terrorism. I disagree, and that disagreement is \npredicated on the testimony of not only administration officials but, \nmost particularly, the leadership of the Armed Forces of the United \nStates. They can handle both situations. That remains clear, certainly \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Confronting Saddam Hussein now is a logical step, a necessary step, \nand a mandatory step to rid the world of his potential.\n  As President Bush reminded us a few days ago when I was privileged to \njoin him on the steps of his office:\n\n       We must confront both terrorist cells and terrorist states \n     because they are different faces of the same evil.\n\n  How will we explain to the American people--in the wake of a possible \nfuture\n\n[[Page S9951]]\n\nattack on the United States or U.S. interests, directly by Saddam \nHussein, or indirectly through surrogate terrorists equipped and \ndirected by him--that we, the Congress, knew Saddam Hussein had weapons \nof mass destruction, that we knew from history that he did use them \nagainst others, and that he intended to manufacture and acquire even \nmore and to use these weapons possibly against us and others, and yet \nthe world failed to act timely?\n  Now, more than ever, the Congress, as a coequal branch of government, \nmust join our President and support the course that he has set. We have \nto demonstrate a resolve within our Nation and internationally that \ncommunicates to Saddam Hussein a clear message that enough is enough. \nYou are to be held accountable to the world law and order as enunciated \nin 16 resolutions--and possibly a 17th--of the United Nations. He has \nto be convinced that America and international resolve is real, \nunshakable, and enforceable if there is to be a peaceful resolution. \nBut, if diplomacy fails, we must be prepared to act.\n\n  I was never more proud of an American President than Wednesday--\nagain, on the steps of his office, joined by many of us here in this \nChamber--when he said:\n\n       We will not leave the future of peace and the security of \n     America in the hands of this cruel and dangerous man. None of \n     us here today desires to see military conflict because we \n     know the awful nature of war. Our country values life and \n     never seeks war unless it is essential to security and to \n     justice. America's leadership and willingness to use force, \n     confirmed by the Congress, is the best way to ensure \n     compliance and avoid conflict.\n\n  I support our President's call to duty. I urge my colleagues to \nlikewise join.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nallowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Election Reform\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I know the debate is about Iraq and the \npending resolutions. At an appropriate time, I would like to address \nthat subject matter. But I want to take the floor briefly this \nafternoon to announce some good news. Early this morning, at around 2 \na.m., we were able to reach an agreement on the election reform bill \nbetween the House and the Senate.\n  Earlier today, I held a press conference with the leadership on this \nbill in the House, including Congressman Bob Ney from Ohio, the \nchairman of the House Administration Committee; Congressman Steny Hoyer \nfrom Maryland, and Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson from Texas, who \nis the chairperson of the Congressional Black Caucus; as well as my \ncolleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, and my colleague from \nMissouri, Senator Bond; with statements from Corrine Brown from Florida \nand John Conyers from Michigan, my original cosponsor, who could not be \nthere but wanted to be heard on this issue.\n  This has been a long and arduous trail over the last two years, as I \nknow the Presiding Officer is aware. I believe the Presiding Officer \nwas in the Chair about a year-and-a-half ago when we announced on the \nfloor that we had an agreement, at least in the Senate anyway, on this \nissue.\n  So it is a historic day. If we are able to adopt this conference \nreport in the coming days before adjournment, it will be the first time \nin over 200 years--since the founding of this Republic--when the \nFederal Government becomes a partner with the States and localities in \nthe conduct of Federal elections.\n  None of us have to be reminded of the tragic events that occurred \nalmost 2 years ago in Florida and many other places around the country. \nThey showed that the condition of our democracy was deteriorating \nbecause the quality of our elections was falling apart.\n  Trying to reform the electoral process was critically important for \nall of us. We needed to provide adequate resources--the change of \noutdated equipment. In my own State of Connecticut, we have used the \nsame voting machines for 40 or 50 years now. The company that made them \nhas long since gone out of business. In light of the constitutional \ncrisis that plagued our nation two years ago, I believe it would have \nbeen a great shortcoming not to pass this legislation before the end of \nthis session of Congress.\n  There has been a lot of talk about whether or not we would get this \ndone. Obviously, when you talk about election reform, unlike other \nsubject matters where people will likely defer to someone who may know \nmore about the subject matter, every one of us in this Chamber is an \nexpert because we got here through the electoral process.\n  For too many years, there has been a Republican suspicion, as my \ncolleague from Kentucky likes to point out, that Democrats were \ninterested in having everyone vote, no matter if they had a right to or \nnot; and Democrats were suspicious of Republicans that they too often \nwanted to deny people a right to vote or to make it difficult.\n\n  It is very difficult to craft a piece of legislation when people have \nsuch reluctance and hesitation. However, we were able to break down all \nof that, and what we did is come up with a bill that has new \nresponsibilities, new rights, and new resources for the first time in \nour country.\n  It is a civil rights act in many ways. The rights here will say: The \nvoter gets to cast a provisional ballot; and the voter has a right to \nsee your ballot and correct your ballot. In addition, the bill gives \nthe voter a right to redress grievances through a remedy process, if, \nin fact, a voter is denied these rights.\n  I will quickly say, a remedy process that isn't everything I would \nlike it to be, but the bill that came out of the Senate had very little \nremedy in it while the House had none. We fashioned a remedy in \nconference which, as you know, is very difficult when there are strong \nvoices in opposition to doing anything.\n  We did not roll back in any way the motor voter legislation. The \nDepartment of Justice is involved, obviously, to enforce the provisions \nof this act.\n  The responsibilities are also here on the part of voters. Senator \nBond felt very strongly about having some requirements that a person \nwho is registered by mail or voted by mail would in some way identify \nthemselves.\n  I know there are those who are concerned that having some form of \nidentification could be problematic for the first-time voter, for the \nfirst-time registrant. Those provisions are in the bill.\n  If you are a first-time voter or registrant, then you have to provide \nsome identification. There is no requirement in this bill that mandates \nany specific form of identification. Can you use a photo ID? Yes, you \ncan. It must be current and valid. That is all we say. Can there some \nother forms of identification? Yes, there can be.\n  We also provide that States must check the last four digits of a \nvoter's Social Security number or driver's license. If the voter has \nneither, he or she will be given a four-digit number. It is a simpler \nway and less intrusive for people to become registrants.\n  You would have statewide voter registration for the first time. So if \nyou move around in your State, from one town to the next, you do not \nhave to register again every time you move. But if you move to another \nState, you will have to register in that new State. We think that this \nis going to help a great deal toward eliminating some of the fraud \nissues because people won't be able to jump around from one local \njurisdiction to another local jurisdiction in the same State and vote \nin different places. And with high-technology, we will be able to \nmonitor the process much more effectively.\n  These are the rights and responsibilities in this bill. The resources \nare $3.8 billion over the next several years. The administration had \nalready agreed, with Speaker Hastert and others, to commit more than \n$400 million in fiscal year 2002-2003. Obviously, as part of the \nsupplemental, that money got vetoed by the President, but not because \nof election reform. We are very confident, based on conversations the \nHouse leadership has had and the discussions we have had here, that \nthere\n\n[[Page S9952]]\n\nwill be something in the neighborhood of $750 million included right \naway, so antiquated equipment in the States with levers or punch-card \nsystems can be replaced.\n  Now, do I have an absolute guarantee for all of that? Obviously, no, \nbecause we have to vote on the appropriations. Did I condition these \nrequirements on it? No. Are there requirements here? Yes. But this is \nan authorization bill. Obviously, if you do not have it as a \nrequirement that had to be met, and you left it to the vagaries of \nwhether or not the appropriations would be made, then these \nrequirements would only be voluntary, and all we would be doing is \nsubsidizing the status quo.\n  For those who are concerned we have no ironclad commitment on this, \nthat is difficult to get in any area of our budget. But I am convinced, \ngiven the bipartisan nature of the support for this bill, the bicameral \nsupport for it, knowing how strongly the State and local officials feel \nabout it, that we will be able to achieve the necessary funding \nrequirements in the coming years.\n  There are staggering provisions in the bill where various points \nbecome operative. If we had passed this bill a year ago, we might have \nbeen able to move up these dates. In light of the fact we are passing \nthe bill in the very last days of the 107th Congress, it is going to be \nmore difficult to effectuate some of these changes in the shorter term.\n  We all witnessed what happened recently in Florida with new equipment \nand new requirements down as a result of legislation passed at the \nState level. There was a lot of misinformation, a lot of confusion. We \nwant to be careful not to do that here. We have new requirements. We \nhave new responsibilities in this bill. We want to give people an \nadequate time to become familiar with them.\n  We have provisions that will assist communities to educate poll \nworkers. We encourage young people to become involved as poll workers \nand poll watchers and to encourage their participation. We establish a \npermanent commission. For the first time, the Federal Government will \nhave a place where people can comment on an ongoing basis on how we can \nimprove the right to vote and to have the vote count. Despite the fact \nthe Constitution speaks clearly about a Federal role and a State role \nin the conduct of elections, we have never done this before.\n  For most of the last 200 years, the Federal Government has honored \nits Constitutional commitment. Except for the Voting Rights Act in \n1965, the Federal Government largely has stayed out of the States' role \nto conduct elections. We are not becoming overly intrusive. It is still \na local matter. It is still a State matter. But we have become, with \nthis legislation, a partner where we say to our local communities and \nStates, in the conduct of Federal elections, your government wants to \nhelp, wants to be involved through resources. By creating some \nrequirements, by creating some responsibilities, we think we can vastly \nimprove the process.\n  For 20 million Americans who are disabled, who are either blind or \nmanually disabled, if we pass this legislation, for the first time \nthere must be voting equipment mandated by law that will allow a blind \nperson or a manually disabled person to cast a ballot privately and \nindependently. Presently, there are no ballots written in braille, or \nan audio system--except for one jurisdiction.\n  If you go into any building in this city, there are requirements that \nan elevator be in braille so you know what floor you are going to. The \nday has arrived when a person, regardless of their ability to see or \nnot, should be able to walk into a polling place and read a ballot in \nbraille. This is not the 18th or 19th century. It is the 21st century. \nI am proud to say, on a strong bipartisan basis, with little or no \ndebate or argument, we have included in these provisions a requirement \nthat people who are disabled, particularly those who are blind, will \nfor the first time be able to walk into a polling place and not have to \nrely on a stranger to go in and help them cast a ballot.\n  I have a sister who has been blind since birth. She is a teacher. I \nam very proud of her. She is a remarkable woman. I would like to know \nthat my sister, as she reaches retirement age as a teacher, will, as a \nresult of her brother's work on a bill, be able to cast a ballot \nwithout having to rely on someone telling her how to vote. So for \nmillions of disabled Americans, this legislation is a major \nbreakthrough for them as well.\n  I do not intend to go through all the details. If there are people \nhere demanding perfection, I will have to disappoint them. If I could \nhave written it myself, it would have been different. But, \nunfortunately, there are people who gather in a conference who have \ndiffering opinions. I wish they didn't, but they do. When they do, you \nhave to compromise. That is not an ugly word. As long as you are not \ncompromising your principles, that, in a legislative context of working \nout arrangements, where there are people who hold strong views, is the \nonly way we get anything done.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of the staff people in my office \nand that of Senators Bond and McConnell, Congressman Hoyer, Congressman \nNey, and others be printed in the Record. We don't give these people \nenough credit. They were up all night last night scrubbing through this \nbill. After we quit about 2:00 or 2:30 in the morning, they stayed at \nit all night. I wish the American people, when they talk about faceless \nbureaucrats, sometimes could peer down and see on how many nights and \nhow many days, long after the Members have argued their points in broad \nterms, these fine staff people of ours, who work on behalf of \ntaxpayers, stay on countless nights, through weekends, to hammer out \ndetails, to see to it we produce the products we can. I am deeply \ngrateful to all of them.\n  They include:\n\n       Kennie Gill, Ronnie Gillespie, and Shawn Maher.\n       Chairman Ney's staff: Paul Vinovich, Chet Kalis, Roman \n     Buhler, Matt Peterson, and Pat Leahy.\n       Senator McConnell's staff: Brian Lewis and Leon Sequeira.\n       Senator Bond's staff: Julie Damann and Jack Bartling.\n       Senator Hoyer's staff: Bill Kable, Keith Abovchar, and Len \n     Shanbon.\n       Senator Schumer's staff: Polly Trottenberg.\n       Senator Durbin's staff: Bill Weber.\n       Eddie Bernice Johnson's staff: Paul Braithwaite.\n\n  I thank Congressman Ney. I didn't know him very well before. He is \nfrom Ohio, worked in the State legislature of that State, and is \nchairman of the House Administration Committee. I have developed a \nstrong affinity for him. He is a fine person, a fine man. He fought \nvery hard for what he believed in, defended the other body's positions. \nBecause of the many nights and weekends, we have gotten to know each \nother.\n  I thank Congressman Steny Hoyer. Many of us know and served with him \nover the years, from Maryland, a remarkably fine individual who did a \ngreat job with Congressman Ney in producing the House bill. He has been \nthe leader in the House on so many occasions dealing with disability \nissues. From his staff, Bill Cable, and others did a wonderful job. I \nthank him.\n  My colleagues over here, I mentioned Senator Bond and Senator \nMcConnell. I thank Senators Schumer and Durbin, who worked very hard. \nBob Torricelli worked on an early bill with Senator McConnell, did a \ngreat job trying to bring this matter to our attention. There are so \nmany people here. I am afraid I will leave people out.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include statements by Congresswoman Eddie \nBernice Johnson, Congressman John Conyers, and Congresswoman Corrine \nBrown be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to the printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement by CBC Chair Eddie Bernice Johnson on the Proposed Election \n          Reform Conference Committee Agreement (as Prepared)\n\n       Thank you. I am pleased to join Members of the Election \n     Reform Conference Committee today as we announce this \n     historic agreement.\n       Our democracy begins and ends with the fundamental right to \n     vote. Truly, today we have taken an important step forward \n     towards our goal of making sure every vote cast is counted.\n       It has now been six hundred and ninety six (696) days since \n     the 2000 elections revealed a pattern of voter intimidation, \n     inaccurate voter registration, arbitrary ballot counting \n     standards and antiquated machinery that deprived millions of \n     citizens of their right to vote.\n\n[[Page S9953]]\n\n       We have certainly waited long enough for election reform \n     legislation.\n       I must thank Representative Steny Hoyer, who has been \n     battling every day since the 2000 elections to extend these \n     important protections to our nation's voters. His leadership \n     in getting us where we are today on this legislation has been \n     limitless, and I thank him for everything that he has done.\n       In the same spirit, I must also thank Representative Bob \n     Ney for his hard work in helping us bridge the differences \n     between these two bills.\n       The CBC has had terrific support from our colleagues from \n     the other chamber, and I would like to especially commend the \n     efforts of Senator Christopher Dodd, who has worked alongside \n     the Caucus and the civil rights community to ensure that the \n     issues we care about most deeply are being addressed in the \n     final bill.\n       I would also like to thank Senate Majority Leader Daschle \n     for his leadership on bringing this bill to the Senate floor \n     earlier this year.\n       Finally, I must thank the 38 Members of the Congressional \n     Black Caucus, and in particular, the gentleman from Michigan, \n     Representative John Conyers for working tirelessly. I'm so \n     sorry that he could not be here today, but he is speaking to \n     the NAACP in Florida, and I know that he will be bringing \n     this important message to voters in the state who sparked \n     this drive for election reform.\n       As many of you know following the 2000 elections, the \n     Congressional Black Caucus pledged to make election reform \n     our number one priority. We said that we would not rest until \n     Congress enacted reform legislation that would protect the \n     right to vote for all Americans. And I am proud to say that \n     we are very closer to delivering on our word.\n       We all know that the conference agreement is likely to be \n     far from perfect, but there is no such thing as perfect \n     legislation. However, it is time that we take a FIRST step \n     toward meaningful reform.\n       We must improve our elections system so that all Americans \n     can register to vote, remain on the rolls once registered and \n     vote free from harassment. We must act before another day has \n     passed.\n       I call upon my colleagues to bring this legislation forward \n     for debate, pass this bill, and we must sent it to the \n     President for his signature before another day passes. We \n     cannot wait another day. Thank you.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        Congresswoman Brown Announces Election Reform Agreement!\n\n       Washington, DC.--Congresswoman Corrine Brown is elated to \n     announce a monumental agreement made today in Washington on \n     the election reform bill. This agreement will bring millions \n     of dollars in federal assistance to the state of Florida for \n     election reform.\n       Since the 2000 presidential election debacle, Congresswoman \n     Brown has been a leading voice on the issue of election \n     reform in Congress, and has worked arduously on the issue of \n     election reform since the Supreme Court selected the \n     President of the United States nearly two years ago.\n       With respect to the agreement, Congresswoman Brown made the \n     following statement:\n       I am thrilled to see this agreement finally come to \n     fruition. I have worked hours and hours with Members on both \n     sides of the political aisle, in the House of \n     Representatives, and the Senate. This agreement, which gives \n     the states $3.9 billion for election reform, and requires \n     them to replace outdated punch-card voting machines, train \n     poll workers, educate voters, upgrade voter lists, and make \n     polling places more accessible for the disabled, and other \n     logistical assistance measures, is long, long overdue.\n       Although Florida spent $32 million to overhaul our voting \n     system, the governor did not allow enough time to hold mock \n     elections to educate voters and poll workers prior to the \n     primaries to work out the inevitable kinks. Moreover, this \n     $32 million in funding is relatively low, given that Florida, \n     with 16 million people, spent $32 million, and Georgia, with \n     only 8 million, spent $54 million on election reform. This \n     agreement however, will funnel more desperately needed \n     federal funding into our state for future elections.\n       Even though this compromise will allow Congress to pass a \n     bill before mid-term elections, I am disappointed that the \n     provisions will not take place until the 2004 elections. The \n     bill is however, perhaps the greatest accomplishment of the \n     107th Congress.\n       During the 2000 elections, in my district alone, Duval \n     County, there were approximately 27,000 ballots that were \n     tossed out. A disproportionately large percentage of these \n     votes came from City Council Districts 7, 8, 9 and 10, \n     primarily African American residential areas. Even more \n     disturbing to me is that the Supervisor of Elections' office \n     didn't release these figures to local officials until after \n     the deadline had passed. As a result, we were unable to \n     demand a recount.\n       Even more disturbing is the often unpublished fact that the \n     Governor of Florida spent $4 million dollars of taxpayer \n     money to purge a list of suspected felons from the rolls \n     across the state: but whether or not this list of felons was \n     accurate was of little importance to the Governor. \n     Apparently, it was the responsibility of the accused citizen \n     to correct his or her status.\n       One of the worst problems that occurred during the 2000 \n     election had to do with motor voter registration. As part of \n     a grassroots effort to encourage voters, particularly \n     minorities, to get out to the polls, I organize motor voter \n     drives. However, during the last election, many voters, \n     especially African Americans, were erroneously purged from \n     registration lists, and many, who had signed up at state \n     motor voter vehicle offices, never had their voter \n     registration fully processed. As a result all of these voters \n     became disenfranchised. It is for this reason that it is of \n     utmost importance to include a provisional balloting \n     provision (wherein if a voter has not re-registered after \n     moving within the same county, he or she may cast a \n     provisional ballot at the polling place of their current \n     residence).\n       Although there are not any perfect election reform bills, I \n     think this one is a good start. The agreement today gives the \n     individual states millions of dollars over three years to \n     upgrade voter equipment, improve the accuracy of voter \n     registration lists, recruit and train poll workers and \n     enhance accessibility to polling places for people with \n     disabilities. It would also include a one-time payment of \n     perhaps as much as $850 million to states and counties to \n     replace punch card voting systems, which were used by more \n     than one-third of the voters last year. This bill sets out on \n     the right foot towards guaranteeing voters their fundamental \n     right: the right to vote and have it counted.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  Statement of Representative Conyers\n\n       Nearly two years after the wholesale disenfranchisement of \n     the elderly, people of color and individuals with \n     disabilities, we have at last passed legislation which will \n     help to place in the dustbin of history the butterfly \n     ballots, punchcard voting machines and discriminatory \n     practices of Florida. This bill bears name and gives tribute \n     to his vision and dream of a world without barriers to the \n     exercise of the most basic right of citizenship, the right to \n     vote.\n       Because of this bill, every American will be closer to \n     living in a democracy where every vote that is cast is \n     counted and where the legitimacy of our democacy is no longer \n     placed in doubt. Because of this bill, voting machines will \n     help voters instead of hindering them.\n       There were naysayers in the Congress and on some of the \n     editorial pages who claimed that Senator Chris Dodd and I \n     were unrealistic and that our vision of minimum federal \n     voting rights standards for machines would never come to \n     pass. The fact that it did is a tribute to our vision that \n     voting rights should not be left to anyone's whims, and it is \n     a tribute to Senator Dodd's tireless efforts to pass this \n     bill and Majority Leader Daschle's rock solid faith in the \n     legislation. My colleagues in the House, Steny Hoyer and Bob \n     Ney deserve tremendous praise for their role in this \n     agreement as well.\n       The Voter I.D. provisions contained in this bill is not a \n     provision I would have wanted. That being said, its inclusion \n     in this agreement cannot possibly overshadow the tremendous \n     step forward the bill represents. We live in a democracy \n     where the essence of accomplishment is compromise and \n     yielding in part to different points of view.\n       At the end of the day and this long struggle, we have a \n     bill that represents a tremendous advance of civil rights and \n     for our democracy.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I also thank the leadership, Senator Daschle and Senator \nLott, for their support. When they asked me how long it would take to \ndebate the election reform bill on the floor, I said I thought I could \ndo it in 24 to 48 hours. About 12 days later, I was still here. Their \npatience was almost unlimited.\n  We were able to get it done, and I am proud we were able to do so. I \nknow there were editorial comments over the last number of weeks and \nmonths, saying where are these people, why can't they get this done? We \ndid something you are probably not supposed to do. We did it quietly. \nIt was not quiet inside the room, but we didn't announce every day to \nthe press what we were doing because I felt if we did, we would never \nget anything done. I have been up almost every night until 2 or 3 in \nthe morning. I have spent almost every weekend involved in this \nlegislation over the last several weeks and months.\n  I thank colleagues who managed to keep this relatively quiet so we \ncould get the job done. Had we not done it, we would not be standing \nhere recommending this product to our colleagues for their \nconsideration, when the other body and the Senate votes on this bill.\n  I will have more to say about it when the bill comes to the floor. I \nwanted to bring my colleagues the good news that we were able to come \nto agreement on this election reform bill before this Congress, the \n107th Congress, became a record of history.\n  Let me also say, since I am still in morning business, to my \ncolleague from Virginia who was here, and my colleague and friend from \nWest Virginia, on the matter before us, I have great respect for both \nof them. This is a weighty and important matter. I didn't want to take \ntime away from that discussion today, but I would like to be heard on \nthe subject matter at the appropriate time.\n\n[[Page S9954]]\n\n  I know my colleague from West Virginia has some strong feelings. I \nwant to say to him and in the presence of my good friend from Virginia, \nI have known these two individuals for many years. They have great \nreverence for this institution, great reverence for the legislative \nbody. I carry very proudly in my pocket every single day of my life, 7 \ndays a week, a copy of the United States Constitution. It was given to \nme years ago by the Senator I sit next to, Robert C. Byrd. I walk \naround with it on weekends, evenings, wherever I am. I carry it.\n  I hope in this discussion, not just this one but others, people will \nlisten to what he has to say about this document and our obligations to \nit as a coequal branch of government. The Founders did not envision \nthis particular debate. Probably the name Iraq didn't exist at the time \nthe Constitution was ratified or written. They envisioned circumstances \nlike this. They wanted to make sure there would be a sense of weight \nand counterweight without giving one side an advantage, necessarily, \nbut that we would deliberate very seriously about matters such as this, \ncertainly the matter of going to war.\n  I have great reverence for this document and great reverence for \npeople who embrace it and cherish it, knowing it is only as good as \neach generation's willingness to defend it, and that our obligation to \ncoming generations is to give them the tools to appreciate what it \nmeans. It is a subtle document. This is not a document an ignorant \nnation would be willing to fight for and sustain. The right to say what \nyou want and have people stand up even when they vehemently disagree \nwith what you are saying takes an educated, sophisticated population to \nappreciate.\n  Certainly the rights of a Congress, a legislative branch to \nappropriate, the right to declare war, the right of a Commander in \nChief to lead during difficult times, these are not notions that can be \neasily understood if you are not well educated and prepared. And it \nbecomes incumbent upon us, in this particular moment, to serve not only \nas a source to resolve the matter before us, but to educate our \nconstituents and the people of this country about why this document is \nimportant, particularly in moments like this, where none of us are ever \nasked to cast a more significant vote. It is not a vote on a Supreme \nCourt justice, or not even amending the Constitution, but the decision \nis whether or not young men and women will go into battle and lay down \ntheir lives for us.\n\n  Both of these individuals understand this better than I--John Warner, \nparticularly, because he has donned that uniform. I served in the \nmilitary briefly, but I never had to face an enemy across the firing \nzone, and I respect somebody who has. Those who have engaged in battle \nseem far more cautious about committing this Nation to conflict. Those \nwho have not, seem, on many occasions, to fail to understand the \nsignificance of what we may be asking people to endure.\n  I will have more to say about this specific matter. I didn't want \nthis moment to pass. I wanted to express my deep thanks to my \ncolleagues. We have closed caucuses every week to discuss the matters \nbefore us, political and otherwise. I have watched over the last \nseveral weeks, and it is not well known--maybe there is a historic \nrecord kept somewhere, but I wish every person in America could have \nbeen at the caucus luncheons to listen to our colleague from West \nVirginia passionately defend the Constitution of the United States. \nThere is no press release, and there is no television show afterwards. \nIt is just one person standing up defending the very document that gave \nrise to this institution and the rights all of us enjoy as Americans. I \nthank him immensely for having the courage of his convictions, the \nstrong legs, the good set of lungs, and the determination to be heard.\n  I thank my colleague from Virginia for all he does every day to see \nthe ideals and values of the Constitution are carried out by his \nMembers. He does that whenever I have been with him in the Chamber and \nin committees. He is a person who deeply cherishes this Constitution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to my colleague, \nand I share his sentiments with regard to our magnificent colleague, \nSenator Byrd. We are privileged to have adjoining States, with a small \nboundary between them, that was inserted at one point in history during \nthe historic Civil War period. But we cross that boundary together \nbecause we love those people--particularly the people of Appalachia.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments about me. I receive them with \ngreat humility. I served in uniform, but I was always a communications \nofficer in Korea, the First Marines Airwings, and a staff officer. In \nthe field of battle, I shared the bunks and tents with others, but I \ndon't put myself in the combat arms category. I served with others who \ndid. Yes, perhaps I have some thoughts and views emanating from those \nperiods I was privileged to serve in uniform. But I think every Member \nof the Chamber has equal conscience and the strength of his or her own \nconvictions to make the tough decisions we have to make in the days \ncoming with regard to Iraq. I look forward to engaging the Senator from \nConnecticut. Yes, we have been good friends, but let me tell you, no \nSenator should ever think they have been tested in the field of oratory \nuntil they tangle with that Senator from Connecticut or the awesome \nSenator from West Virginia. There is just not as much of the great \noratory that this Chamber has enjoyed in the 24 years I've been here. \nThere seemed to be more when I came than we have now. My gracious, \nI was in awe of the senior Members of this Chamber when I first came \nhere and sat and listened intently. But I say to the Senator from \nConnecticut, I am ready for this debate he and I will have one day. I \nonly wish it were this afternoon in the presence of our senior Member \nof this body. But if it is to be another day, I will await it. I hope \nhe will some day debate me on the League of Nations. He is a student of \nAmerican foreign policy as a senior Member of the committee, following \nin the footsteps of his proud father who served in this institution. \nSome day let us talk about the fate of the League of Nations. As our \nPresident challenges the U.N. today, I challenge the Senator to that \ndebate some day.\n\n  Also, serving on the Rules Committee, we are very proud of what you \nhave done, together with Senators Bond, McConnell, and others, to bring \nabout this bill--particularly as this Nation stands somewhat in awe--I \nam not going to take sides on what is happening in New Jersey regarding \nthe complexity of the election laws, the problems encountered for a \nsecond time, most unfortunately, in Florida. Let us hope this \nlegislation can improve that system and serve as a means to inspire \nmore of our citizens to participate in the electoral process, whether \nit is for county commissioner, sheriff, or for the Presidency and the \nMembers of Congress. All too often, less than half of the people who \nare eligible vote or take the trouble to exercise the right given to \nthem under the Constitution, to which the Senator so reverently \nreferred. I thank my colleague.\n  (Ms. STABENOW assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, if the distinguished Senator will yield.\n  Mr. DODD. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, as a member of the Rules Committee on \nwhich sit the distinguished Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, and our \nchairman, Mr. Dodd from Connecticut, I have asked the chairman to yield \nto compliment him. I want to compliment him, and I do compliment the \nchairman for his patience, for his dogged determination, and for his \nfar-seeing vision in pursuing and pressing on to the end this cause for \nwhich he has been studying, speaking, and fighting for so long. It has \nan importance that goes far beyond the surface. This, we often hear, is \na democracy. It is a Republic. We say that clearly each time we \n``pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to \nthe Republic for which it stands.'' We have democratic principles under \na republican form of government. There you are. It is a republican form \nof government.\n  The importance of encouraging and persuading and leading the citizens \nof the country to vote--what a great duty it is of each citizen to vote \nhis or her sentiments. And what a sad commentary on this Republic, \nwhose people have been so far blessed beyond the\n\n[[Page S9955]]\n\npeoples of any other nation, and then to think that so few, relatively \nspeaking, of the American people bother--bother--to go to the polls and \nexercise their duty at the polls. It is a sad commentary on the \nAmerican people. We take this duty loosely, and we take advantage of \nthis right in a very cavalier fashion.\n  The Senator from Connecticut has performed an extremely important \nservice to the people of this country today and to future generations, \nby his stick-to-itiveness, by his incessant application of his enormous \ntalents to bring to fruition the completion of this work on which he \nhas been engaged for so long. It is not the kind of work such as the \nwork we do on some other measures. It is kind of a dry subject when one \nstops to think about it. It is kind of like the rules of the Senate. \nThey are dry, there are no headlines in them, but how important the \nrules of the Senate are.\n  It is that way with this piece of legislation that our dear friend \nhas so long labored in the vineyard to bring to fruition. I compliment \nhim. I salute him. He has performed an immeasurable service to the \npeople of this country; whatever we can do to bring about a greater \nfocus and a greater application of the people's views when it is \nelection time because, after all, that helps to mold the character of \nthis country and to present the image of this country as a nation.\n  I wish it were possible to say that 80 or 85 or 90 percent of the \npeople in this country turn out and vote. What a great victory that \nwould be for this Republic and for the principles of democracy.\n  I not only salute this man, I say thank you to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Connecticut. He is my candidate for President. \nThrow your hat in the ring.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I am going to leave now.\n  Mr. BYRD. Hold on a minute. Madam President, there has to be a little \nlevity. Even the wisest will stop for a moment to smile, laugh a \nlittle, be a little jovial. But this is a tremendous victory; as a \nmember of the committee on which this great man serves, I am proud to \nserve on that committee.\n  On another subject which has been injected here, no Senator should \nhave to stand in a party caucus and defend this Constitution. No \nSenator should have to stand in a party caucus and refer to this \ndocument.\n  This is a time when we must return to the language and the spirit of \nthis Constitution. All too often I hear the leaders of this Nation in \nboth parties refer to this document or that document or what this \nperson said or that person said, but very seldom do I hear on the \ntelevision talk shows on Sundays and other days of the week, seldom, \nrelatively speaking, do I hear them base their position on the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  As I have witnessed the tides that ebb and flow on the world stage \nover these 50 years, all the more have I come to believe that the \nConstitution is the principal mast to which we should rope ourselves in \norder to put wax in our ears to the siren calls that will lead us \nastray from what the Constitution says.\n  The Constitution very clearly says in a nonambiguous sentence, the \nCongress shall have power to declare war. I am very pained to see a \nCongress, most of the leaders of which say we should pass this \nresolution, meaning S.J. Res. 46. We should pass it now, pass it here, \nget it behind us before the election. Get it behind us.\n  Madam President, if the Senator will further yield without losing his \nright to the floor, permit me to say we are not going to get this issue \nbehind us. Say what you will. It is front and center. Why? Because the \nBush administration has made this issue front and center in these last \nfew days before the election.\n  Why did they not make homeland security front and center? Because \nthat would not have shifted the national perspective and focus away \nfrom the domestic issues which also are important. But to turn the \nemphasis to Iraq shifts the emphasis of the debate away from homeland \nsecurity, shifts the emphasis of debate away from domestic issues, \nshifts it to a foreign scene and a foreign stage and a foreign field of \naction. So our eyes have been averted from what we should be watching, \nand that is homeland security, the defense of this country. Homeland \nsecurity, protecting this country right here against attack, subtle \nattacks--it may be individual attacks, it may come in the form of an \nattack by one person or two or a group of six, as we saw in New York \nrecently when the FBI arrested a cell of six individuals who were from \nYemen. They are American citizens, but they were originally from Yemen. \nThe FBI arrested them. The FBI did not have to have any Department of \nHomeland Security to bring that about.\n\n  The people who are on the front line securing this country, securing \nyou and me, securing the people of this country every day, every night, \nevery hour of every day, every hour of every night are on the line now. \nThey are out there on the borders. They are out there in the ports of \nentry. They are out there working day and night as we saw when the FBI \ndid its work.\n  Here just before an election, our eyes taken away from the education \nneeds of this country, away from the security needs of this country, \naway from the questions that involve the health of our citizens, away \nfrom the veterans of this country. This issue has been shifted away so \nthat our eyes temporarily are distracted and we are looking in another \ndirection.\n  Where are we looking? We are looking at Iraq. Yet, Madam President, \nthere is nothing new in the evidence.\n  I have asked the Director of the CIA on two different occasions: What \nis different? Do not tell me anything about policy; we will make the \npolicy. But tell me what there is by way of intelligence where you are \nthe expert? What is there that is new today, that you know today that \nyou did not know 3 months ago or 6 months ago? What is it that is so \nnew, so compelling that all of a sudden, after we heard all this \nbusiness to the effect there is no plan on the President's desk? I \nasked that question of the Secretary of State: What is it that is new? \nI have asked that question of the Secretary of Defense. What does he \nsay? The thing that is new is September 11. That is not so new; that is \nover 365 days old. So what is there that is new that requires us to \nmake this fateful, far-reaching decision before the election?\n  There is nothing new. They have known it for 3 months, 6 months. A \nlot of it they have known for years.\n  This is a fateful decision, and the decision ought to be made here, \nand this Congress ought not turn this fateful determination, this \ndecision, over to any President, any one man, because, as James Madison \nsaid, the trust and the temptation are too great for any one man.\n  Oh, that Madison were here today. Oh, that Madison could speak today. \nWe would hear him say: The trust and the temptation are too great for \nany one man. Hear his voice as it rolls across the decades of history.\n  Here we are today; we have rubber spines, rubber legs, and we do not \nhave backbones. This branch of Government, under the Constitution, is \nthe branch consisting of the immediately-elected representatives of the \npeople, and under the Constitution it is to declare war.\n  The Framers were very wise when they determined that these two \nmatters--the decision to go to war and the making of war--should be in \ntwo different places. The decision, the determination to declare war, \nshould flow from this branch, the people's branch, and the matter of \nmaking war should be in the hands of a unified commander, the Commander \nin Chief.\n  What are we doing? In my view, if we accept this resolution as it is \nwritten, we are saying both of these vital functions would be placed in \nthe hands of one man. And what did Madison say? He said: The trust and \nthe temptation are too great for any one man.\n  So in closing, if the Senator will further yield----\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to.\n  Mr. BYRD. I say to those people out there who are watching through \nthe electric lenses, let the leadership of this Congress know, tell the \nleadership of this Congress, urge the leadership of this Congress, to \nput aside this fateful decision which may affect the blood and the \nlives of our sons and daughters, put it aside until after the election \nso that our representatives in both Houses can make a determination in \nan atmosphere that is not so supercharged with politics. Let them come \nback\n\n[[Page S9956]]\n\nafter the election. They are getting paid for all the days of the year. \nBring them back then. Let them make a decision when they are not \ndistracted by politics, by an election. Tell the leadership of this \nCongress. Let them hear you.\n  You do not have to worry where I stand. I am telling you now. I am \nstating my position now. Tell the leadership of this country, both \nHouses: Hold up, wait, listen, ask questions, debate, and wait until \npolitics can be shoved aside. Wait until after the election. Tell the \nleadership this affects your blood, your treasury, your son, your \ndaughter, your grandson. Let them know in no uncertain terms. Tell \nthem. They will hear you.\n  I am proud to say that our leader on this side of the aisle has not \nyet made a final determination, I do not think. He has not joined with \nthe leadership in the other body that went like lambs to the slaughter \nfollowing after the President.\n  I respect the President of the United States. We should work with \nhim, and we should support him when we can. But remember what Madison \nsaid: The trust and the temptation are too great for any one man.\n  We elected representatives of the people are not supposed to follow \nany President, whether he is a Democrat or Republican, meekly and \nwithout question. I do not believe there is a Republican in this body \nwho knows me well who would believe for a moment, if we had a \nDemocratic President today, I would not be saying exactly what I am \nsaying right now.\n\n  I took the position against our President on the line item veto. I \ndid not go along with President Clinton because he supported the line \nitem veto. Nor would I go with any President in this more fateful \nmatter, this question of peace or war, if they were a Democrat. I am \nstanding where the Constitution says I should stand.\n  There is no king in the American scheme of things. There is no place \nfor kings in our constitutional system. But there is a place for men. \nWhen I say ``men,'' of course, I am speaking of men and women, but when \nthe Constitution was written it was only men.\n  There is no place for weakness. There is no place for wishy-\nwashiness. There is only a place for steadfastness and a place for \nsupreme dedication to the Constitution of the United States, for every \nword that is in it, and to stand by the spirit with which it speaks. We \ncannot stand by that spirit and just go along. The people want a \npolitical party that stands for something. They want men and women in \noffice who stand for them. They do not want men and women in office who \njust go along because their party goes along or because the President \ngoes along. They want men and women who think for themselves and who \nkeep in mind that they are sent here by the people who cannot speak on \nthis floor but who expect us to speak.\n  That is where I stand. That is where I am going to stand always and \nforever. As long as I live and have the privilege of representing the \npeople of the State of West Virginia, that is exactly where I am going \nto be, regardless of where any President is. If I differ with him, I \nwill say so, and I differ with this President on this issue.\n  I do not think there is any new evidence that compels us to vote on \nthis resolution before we go home. Oh, they say we need to get it \nbehind us. We cannot get this issue behind us. We can vote for this \nresolution, but that will not get the issue behind us. The President \nwill have us back on that question every day until the election is \nover, and he can do that. He has the bully pulpit. Do not think for a \nmoment this issue is going to be put behind us before this election is \nover.\n  Another thing we will not get behind us is the record of where we \nstand, the record of where I stand, the record of where he or she \nstands. We will not get that behind us. That will be there engraved in \nstone, in marble, and in bronze, until the Lord comes home. Until \nkingdom come, it will be there. You cannot efface it. You cannot erase \nit. It is there.\n  I intend to let my record stand. I do not intend to put a blemish on \nit by walking away from the Constitution in this fateful hour.\n  There are questions to be asked. What is going to happen to Israel? \nWhat is going to happen to the people of Israel? What is going to \nhappen to the Palestinians? What are the ramifications of going to war \nin a preemptive strike, which this Constitution does not represent and \ndoes not allow? What are the ramifications around the globe? What is \nthe image of the United States then going to be: A nation that is a \nrogue nation, that is determined to wipe out other nations with a \npreemptive strike? And what will happen if we deliver a preemptive \nstrike? Will other nations be encouraged to do the same? What will be \nthe cost? How many men and women do we expect will become casualties if \nthis country goes to war in a preemptive strike against Iraq? What is \ngoing to be the cost in dollars?\n\n  The President's economic advisor says: Oh, $100 billion or $200 \nbillion. He says that is nothing, $100 billion. That is nothing. Even \n$9 billion has been a stumbling block and a bone in the craw of this \nadministration when it comes to appropriations bills. All that has kept \nus from having agreements on appropriations bills is $9 billion.\n  What is going to be the price tag? What is it going to cost in terms \nof homeland security? Might we expect other terroristic acts if we \nlaunch a preemptive strike? How can we be sure we will not be subject \nto preemptive strikes of terrorists? What will be the cost? What is \nlikely to happen on our borders? Are we going to have to maintain \ngreater vigilance in our ports? What is going to happen to the needs of \nveterans? What is going to happen to the needs of education? What is \nthis going to do to the American pocketbook? What is it going to do to \nthe deficits?\n  There are these and many more questions. They ought to be questioned. \nIt is not unpatriotic to ask.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding. I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia. I hope I have not tried the \npatience of these two Senators too much.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I have had the privilege of sharing \nthese floor debates with my distinguished colleague from West Virginia \nmany times. If he would allow me, I will make some observations about \nthe comments just delivered by this esteemed Member of the Senate.\n  I fear no question that would be asked. I have the privilege of being \ndesignated by our Republican leader to be one of the managers of the \ndebate today, tomorrow, and the days to come, since I am proud to have \nmy name on this resolution which is before the Senate. I will be \nprepared, as best I can, to respond to my colleagues because I speak \nfrom my own personal convictions, which are equally as strong as those \nof my dear friend from West Virginia.\n  But the Senator said the President is not king, and the Senator is \nright. There is no one who understands this Constitution better. The \nking is not mentioned, as far as I can recall, in the Constitution \nanywhere. But what is in the Constitution is the President should be \nCommander in Chief of the Army and Navy and, indeed, the Air Force and \nthe Marines.\n  At this very moment, while we are in this Chamber, Saddam Hussein is \nfiring on our airplanes over Iraq, which have been operating for over a \ndecade, trying to enforce at least one of the resolutions, 688, which \nprecluded him from using force, such as poison gas and biological \nweapons against his own people.\n  Just in the month of September, 60 times have our airplanes and those \nof Great Britain and at one time France experienced that hostile fire \nagainst American and British aviators. Therein is the constitutional \nresponsibility of our President to fire back.\n  A very good question which my good friend raises, What is new? I am \nurging the administration to try and share more information with the \nCongress this week and to perhaps declassify information, but I can \nonly speak for myself as to what is new, and that is the biological \nweaponry. It is an open fact now.\n  It has been expressed by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Secretary \nRumsfeld, that Saddam Hussein is manufacturing this biological agent by \nusing trucks. Three or four trucks constitute a small industrial plant, \nand they can be moved around. It can be containerized. It could be put \nin a bottle or can of baby powder and smuggled into the United States. \nThere are means, and all of us know how that\n\n[[Page S9957]]\n\ncould be distributed in a harmful way against our people.\n  That is the new information that compels me to take the actions I am \ntaking with others. I will, in the days to come, give other bits of \ninformation that compel me to take this position behind this \nresolution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. He speaks of biological weapons in the hands of Saddam \nHussein as being something new. That is not new. That is not new.\n  This Nation itself helped to build, helped to create the building \nblocks of biological weaponry years ago when we sent to Saddam Hussein, \nthis country made available to Iraq, back in the days when we thought \nthat Saddam Hussein would be our friend. A few years later, after we \nprovided Iraq help in making biological weapons, today we find he is \nour enemy.\n  This is the way it is. Yesterday's friend is today's enemy. We have \nknown about the biological weapons for years. We helped Iraq to have \nthe building blocks. Now we have claimed this is something new. This is \nnot new. This is not a new pretext. We have known this all along. The \nIsraelis knew these things. They knew what was happening in Iraq with \nrespect to nuclear weapons. These things are not new, but they are new \njust before this election. That is what I am saying. Let us come back \nafter the election and then debate, and then, who knows? I might join \nwith the distinguished Senator in promoting a resolution to declare \nwar, Congress declare war.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I might say to my good friend, I think it is helpful \nSenators engage as you and I are, and I hope throughout this debate \nthere is a great deal of that, Senator to Senator, eye to eye, to talk \nabout these issues.\n  But this biological weaponry, the ability to manufacture it and move \nthose sites around to conceal his industrial base, the ability to \npackage it in such a way that it now can be transported long distances, \nI think that is new technology, which is troublesome to me. We know \nfull well of the willingness and capability of terrorists to hit us as \nthey did on 9/11. We saw them attack the USS Cole. What is to prevent \nthose biological weapons being placed into the hands of this growing \nnetwork of terrorists, people who hate the United States, and bring it \nto our shores and distribute it?\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, it was not more than 6 weeks ago when this \nPresident, this administration, expressed concern at the ``frenzy'' \nthat people were being wrapped into. This administration tried to cool \nit 6 weeks ago, talking about the frenzy.\n  We have heard this administration's Cabinet Members out on the trail \nsay time and again, there is no plan, no plan on the President's desk. \nThat is what Secretary of State Powell said to me when I asked, What is \nnew? What about these plans? Oh, there is no plan on the President's \ndesk. Even the President himself has said there is no plan. Even as \nlate as October 1, just a few day ago, 3 days ago, 4 days ago, the \nPresident himself said he has not made a decision to go to war.\n  So what is new? That is what I am saying to my distinguished friend. \nWe knew about their packaging. Why didn't the CIA Director say it to me \nwhen I asked him twice, once up in 407 and once in my own office, What \nis there that is new from your standpoint of intelligence that we did \nnot know 3 months ago, 6 months ago? He has not been able to come up \nwith anything.\n  So I say to my distinguished friend from Virginia, yes, I am \nconcerned about packaging and all that. But that is not new. That \nshould not make it all-compelling that we vote on this matter of peace \nor war, or preemptive strike, before we go home. The people out there \nwant us to come home. Let's go home to the people who send us here; \nlet's talk with them in town meetings; let's tell them what we know. \nThey have questions they want answered. Let's go to our people, our \nbosses, the people whom we represent. Let's go back to them before we \nmake this fateful decision once and for all, which involves so much of \nthe treasure and blood of the people who sent us here. Let's go back to \nthem; let's get their feelings; and then we can come back and make this \ndecision.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I will walk out of this Chamber after we \ncomplete our debate to go to my State, as others have gone to theirs, \nto listen to my citizens. But I say to them, the timing of the work we \nare doing on this resolution is important now, for many reasons. But I \ndraw to the attention of my colleague that the United Nations is now \ndeliberating, at this very moment, on the possibility of another \nresolution providing for yet another attempt for an inspection regime.\n  If we show our strength and we show our resolve as a unified \nCongress, behind the President, to the extent we do that, it is to that \nextent that resolution could be meaningful and have teeth in it and \nenforceability in such a way that we can avoid the conflict of war to \nresolve this question of weapons of mass destruction, about which I \nknow my good friend may have a view different from mine.\n  We know now he possibly does not have an operative nuclear weapon, \nbut he is doing everything he can to get the materials to construct one \nor the materials to incorporate in such technology as he has in place \nnow.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield? Will the Senator \nyield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Oh, yes, of course, Madam President.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, may I say to my friend, he is getting the \ncart--I say most respectfully, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, \nfor whom I have tremendous respect--he has been chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee on which I sit--is getting the cart before the \nhorse. Let's let the United Nations, that forum of world opinion, \nspeak. Let it make its decision; let's see where those people stand; \nlet's see where those other nations stand, and then come back to this \nbody and the body across the Capitol and let the Congress make its \ndecision after the United Nations has taken a position; otherwise, we \nget the cart before the horse. Let's wait and see what that world \nopinion says. Let's wait and see where they stand, the United Nations, \nand then we will be in a better position to make our decision.\n  What we are doing here--if the distinguished Senator will yield \nfurther?\n  Mr. WARNER. Oh, yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. We are voting on this new Bush doctrine of preventive \nstrikes--preemptive strikes. There is nothing in this Constitution \nabout preemptive strikes. Yet in this rag here, this resolution, S.J. \nRes. 46, we are about to vote to put the imprimatur of the Congress on \nthat doctrine. That is what the Bush administration wants us to do. \nThey want Congress to put its stamp of approval on that Bush doctrine \nof preemptive strikes.\n  That is a mistake. That is a mistake. Are we going to present the \nface of America as the face of a bully that is ready to go out at high \nnoon with both guns blazing or are we going to maintain the face of \nAmerica as a country which believes in justice, the rule of law, \nfreedom and liberty and the rights of all people to work out their \nultimate destiny?\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if I could turn to the reference to the \nUnited Nations and the timing, I wish I were the student of history \nthat my good friend Robert Byrd is.\n  I remember when you took me, hand in hand, to Rome and we went to the \nvery site of the Roman Senate. Do you remember that day? You stood \nthere, amidst the falling rubble of that historic building--if only \nthey would restore it to its original integrity as ever more a reminder \nof the strength of the Senate as a body, in State legislatures or \nwherever--but at any rate, what was the quote of a Frenchman who said \none time: Oh, tell me in which direction the crowd is surging so I can \nrun out and get in front and lead?\n  Do you remember that quote?\n  Mr. BYRD. No, but I remember Caesar, when he saw one of the Roman \nsoldiers running away from the battle, he took that Roman soldier and \nturned him around. He said: You are running in the wrong direction.\n  That is what I am afraid we are doing. We are running in the wrong \ndirection.\n  Mr. WARNER. No, but what I say is, what our President has done, to \nhope that the United Nations will move in the right direction, is to go \nthere and speak to them and to lead, together with others--the Prime \nMinister of\n\n[[Page S9958]]\n\nGreat Britain and others--lead, not wait and see in what direction they \ngo. No, that is the reason for the timing of this resolution.\n  I would like to ask most respectfully----\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Oh, yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I think the President would be in a much better position \nwith the United Nations to leave the case as he had made it. He made a \nfine case. He made a case in which there was no room for water or air. \nHe placed it right in front of the United Nations, the fact that that \nbody has been recreant in its duty and its responsibility. It passed \nresolution after resolution after resolution, and has done very little.\n  I think the President is in a much better position, ultimately, if we \nlet the United Nations speak first and not go to the United Nations and \nsay: Now, we would love to hear what you have to say, but regardless of \nwhat you have to say, we have made up our minds, and if you don't do \nit, we are going to do it.\n  Well, why not let him do it?\n  I think this responsibility should be left clearly in the lap of the \nUnited Nations. We will make our decision later, when the President \ncomes back to this institution which, under this Constitution, has the \npower--not any President--the power to declare war.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I draw to the attention of my colleague \nthat it has been over a decade since hostilities were concluded in the \nsigning of those documents in the desert by Saddam Hussein's Foreign \nMinister on April 6, 1991. Sixteen resolutions which have been passed \nby this body have been ignored. Only one of them is receiving any \ndegree of enforcement through the bravery of our airmen.\n  I say, what is the record of the U.N., having sat there and let 16 \nresolutions be ignored, allowing the inspectors to be driven out? And \nPresident Clinton made his effort to get this Chamber to pass a \nresolution for regime change, to send the inspectors back. What \nfragment of knowledge do you have about the U.N. that I do not possess, \nthat they have sat there 16 times and said do this--did not enforce it, \nallowed for a 4-year lapse in the inspection team to be there--and are \nnow considering at this very moment sending another team back? What is \nit about this institution that instills in you the confidence that \nthis, the 17th resolution, if they adopt it, will have more force and \nteeth and resolve and conviction than did the previous 16?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, what were we doing in those 4 years? What \nwere we doing? What were we failing to do that now comes to mind that \nmakes us so determined and so hell-bent to vote on this rag, S.J. Res. \n46, before this election? We knew all this for 4 years. Where were we?\n  Why did we wait until this particular moment?\n  That is one answer.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if I interject, we were flying those \nmissions. Our airmen were risking their lives. That is what we did.\n  Mr. BYRD. We were doing that, but we ought to have been doing more. \nWhy wait until an election and then come up all of a sudden and say, \nOh, we have got to have this S.J. Res., we have got to put into the \nhands of one man the trust and the temptation, which Madison so well \nspoke against because it was too much, too great for any one man?\n  The gulf war, does the Senator remember the total cost of that war?\n  Mr. WARNER. No, I do not recall, but I know it was shared.\n  Mr. BYRD. It was $61.1 billion.\n  Does the Senator recall how much the U.S. had to pay?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, it seems to me a smaller fraction of it \nbecause our allies contributed a considerable number.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is right. We ended with the United States being left \nholding the bag for about $7.5 billion.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is my recollection.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is a little over $7 billion. That is what we ought to \nbe doing now. We ought to get these other countries to belly up to the \nbar and help to bear the cost of this war. We are not doing that, \nthough. We are having an administration that says, Give it to me, give \nme the authorization to go, and if you, the U.N., don't do it, I will.\n  Who is ``I''? ``I will.'' ``We will.'' Who is ``we''?\n  We are committing the American people, we are committing the blood \nand the treasure of the American people to do what the United Nations \nwon't do. I say, do what the President has done thus far. Put it in the \nlap of the United Nations and expect them to give us an answer. Then \ncome back to the people's representatives and let them make a \ndetermination as to whether or not at that point we should strike. \nMaybe we shouldn't.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, let's stop and think. We are not in this \nalone. Great Britain--I know of no Senator who has a greater respect \nfor England's participation as our ally in World War I, World War II. I \nhave had the privilege of going with my good friend to Great Britain \nand sitting in the Houses of Parliament.\n  Mr. BYRD. That Anglo-Saxon blood flows through the veins of the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. My mother's great-great-great-grandfather built Balmore \nCastle, which the Queen uses as her home.\n  But let us get back to this. Great Britain has helped us. I know \nSpain and Portugal expressed an interest.\n  I ask my good friend--I have seen him on this floor defending the \ncourage of Turkey and its leaders--am I not correct that Turkey has \nbeen a valiant partner in war in the area?\n  Mr. BYRD. Does the Senator know how many times Turkey has violated \nthe U.N. Security Council resolutions? More than 40 times.\n  I am a friend of Turkey.\n  Mr. WARNER. I know the Senator is.\n  Mr. BYRD. I say to my dear friend, point to Iraq, for which I have no \ngrievance, and talk about Iraq's violations of United Nations Security \nCouncil resolutions. Turkey has violated those resolutions; and that \nain't all. Israel has violated those resolutions. Israel has violated \nthose Security Council resolutions. So don't put it all on the basis of \nviolations of Security Council resolutions.\n\n  I am simply saying--and the distinguished Senator can stay with me \nhere until the Moon is up and full at midnight and until that Moon \nchanges.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am prepared to do so.\n  Mr. BYRD. He can stay with me until the cows come home, and I will \nalways lead him right back to this foundation, my rock on which I \nstand. And it says: Congress shall have the power to declare war.\n  The administration can say all it wants. It can bring all of its \nCabinet heads up and have them on television on Sunday. It can bring \nDr. Rice, it can bring Secretary Powell, it can bring the secretary of \nwar, it can bring the Vice President of the United States, the \nPresident of this body, and they can say whatever they want until they \nare completely out of breath. And I guarantee you they will not once \nmention the Constitution of the United States. They haven't thus far. \nBut they are going to be brought right back every time to face this \nConstitution which I hold in my hand, which says Congress shall have \nthe power to declare war.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I wish to ask one more question. I see \nother colleagues seeking the floor. Could I wrap up on one point in my \ncolloquy with the Senator?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Will the Senator allow me one thing? Then he has the \nfloor and he can wrap up.\n  Madam President, today--just today--I say this at 15 minutes until 3 \np.m. on this day, the 4th day of October in the year of our Lord 2002--\nmy office has received 1,400 telephone calls--just today. And almost \nevery single caller has said: Wait. Slow down. Don't rush this through.\n  If the Senator will allow me 1 more minute, I plead with those people \nout there, I plead with the American people, let your voice be heard. \nYou need to be heard. You have a right to be heard. You have questions \nthat should be asked and answered. Let the leadership of this Congress \nknow that you don't want this resolution rammed through this Congress \nbefore the election. The life of your son may depend upon it. The life \nof your daughter may\n\n[[Page S9959]]\n\ndepend upon it. Get out there and let this leadership know that we \nshould stay on our jobs--or that we should come home and talk with the \npeople back home and put off this fateful decision which cannot be \nretracted except through another piece of legislation.\n  Let the people back there speak to us and then come back after the \nelection and make this decision so we will not be hearing the \ntelevision ads and reading the newspaper ads with respect to politics \nwhile we have to make this decision.\n  I hope the people will speak out. Let the hills and the mountains and \nthe valleys reverberate with the sound of your voices. It is your \ncountry. Stand for it now. People out there, speak out, write, use the \ntelephones, use the mail, and let the leadership of this Congress hear \nyou. Tell them to wait.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for his kindness.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if I could ask one further question of \nmy good colleague, first, I join with the Senator in encouraging the \npeople to speak out, write, and call. I welcome those who disagree with \nmy views, or those who might wish to associate with my views and those \nof others who have written this resolution.\n  But I say to my good friend that it is always a learning experience \nto join him on this historic floor of this great Chamber of this \nSenate, which he has referred to with the deepest of affection for so \nmany years as the greatest deliberative body on Earth.\n  The Senator mentioned Madison. By coincidence, my itinerary this \nweekend will take me to Madison County, VA, where there is a little \nmuseum that has some of the fragments and memorabilia of that great \nstatement.\n  I ask this one last question: This document will rest on every \nSenator's desk. S.J. Res. 46 was introduced by our colleague who sits \nright here, Joseph Lieberman, for himself and Mr. Warner of Virginia, \nand others. I wrote the resolution with others in 1991. It was then the \nWarner-Lieberman resolution. Now I think, appropriately with the \nmajority resting on that side, it is the Lieberman-Warner resolution.\n  But I ask my good friend: Is there a word in this resolution--and I \nhold myself responsible for the words in this resolution. Is there any \nword, is there any sentence, is there any paragraph that exceeds the \nauthority given to the President of the United States in the \nConstitution which you love and defend so dearly?\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely. Absolutely. This whole piece, this great \nexpenditure of paper, is nothing more than a blank check given to the \nPresident of the United States to use the forces of this country, the \nmilitary forces, in whatever way he determines, whenever he determines, \nand where he determines to use those forces to ``defend the national \nsecurity interests of the United States against the threat posed by \nIraq, and restore international peace and security in the region.''\n\n  Now, Madam President, you don't need all this paper. You have a vast \nwaste of verbiage here. Just make it one sentence. Make it one \nsentence, may I say to my friend from Virginia, one sentence. If we are \ngoing to make it a blank check, let's make it a blank check right \nupfront, without all of these flowery figleaves of ``whereas'' clauses, \nand simply say that the President has this power. Give it to him and we \nwill put up a sign on the top of this Capitol: ``Out of business.'' \nGone home. ``Gone fishing.'' Put up a sign: ``We are out of it. We are \nout of business. We, here in the Congress, are out of business,'' may I \nsay to my friend.\n  Now, I know his intentions are the best. I believe that. I respect \nhim. I have served with him. He is a reasonable man. I consider it an \nhonor to be a Member of the same body. He is always a man with whom one \ncan debate, disagree, agree, and he does not carry it out of this \nChamber. He is a good man at heart. He loves his country. He has served \nhis country. He is loyal to his country, sometimes too loyal to his \nparty, may I say, which cannot be said of this Senator from West \nVirginia. Party is important, but not all that important.\n  But I say, instead of just passing this resolution, why don't we say \nupfront: Let's give this man downtown a blank check. Leave it all to \nhim. Give it to him lock, stock, and barrel. We'll go home. Put a sign \non the Capitol: ``Out of business until we are called back by the \nPresident under the Constitution.'' We will go home. We will go \nfishing, play golf, study, read, write our memoirs--``out of \nbusiness.''\n  Why don't we just do that, instead of going through this kind of \nblank check, and covering it over with figleaves and ``whereases'' that \nare flowery--flowery--beautiful? Oh, they are pretty figleaves, they \nare pretty ``whereases.'' But that is what this all amounts to: \nNothing; a poison pill covered with sugar. That is all we are doing.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I say to my friend, the President of the \nUnited States, as I read the Constitution, has the authority, at this \nvery moment, to employ the men and women of our Armed Forces in the \ndefense of our Nation.\n  Mr. BYRD. No. That Constitution does not say that. No, no, no.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think it is implied in there.\n  Mr. BYRD. Oh, no, no.\n  Mr. WARNER. As Commander in Chief, if he believes an attack has been \nmade on this country, or that an attack is imminent which he believes \nhe has to preempt, he has the authority to use those forces, and we \ndon't have to pass this.\n  Mr. BYRD. No. Wait a minute. The Senator is saying two different \nthings now. I say that under this Constitution, this President--any \nPresident--as Commander in Chief of our country, and as the chief \nexecutive officer of this country, has the inherent power to repel any \nsudden, unforeseen attack upon this Nation, its territories, its \npeople. He has that because Congress may not even be in session. \nCongress may be out for the August recess.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Framers foresaw there might be that situation where \nCongress might not be here and the President would have to take action. \nBut this resolution is saying something far different. That is not what \nthis resolution says.\n\n  Read it. It does not say that the President has the inherent power to \nrepel an instant, an unforeseen attack on this Nation. It does not say \nthat. Now, I go along with that. But I do not go along with this. This \nsays:\n\n       The President is authorized--\n\n  We are handing it right over, right now, if we pass this. We are not \nsaying come back tomorrow or next week or next month or next year.\n\n       The President is authorized--\n\n  That means here and now, as soon as he signs his name on this piece \nof paper.\n\n       The President is authorized to use all means that he \n     determines--\n\n  He determines--\n\n       to be appropriate.\n\n  What ``he determines to be appropriate.'' The Senator from Virginia \nmay not determine that to be appropriate. What ``he determines to be \nappropriate, including force. . . .'' That means the Army, the Navy, \nthe airplanes, everything--``including force. . . .''\n  In order to do what?\n\n       in order to enforce the United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions referenced above--\n\n  Well, what is that: ``referenced above''? You have to go through all \nthese beautiful figleaves to find out what resolutions are referenced. \nAnd even some of those resolutions have long gone out of existence. \nThey no longer exist. And yet are we going to raise from the dead, like \nLazarus, U.N. resolutions that have long ago gone out of existence, \nthat no longer have life in their bodies?\n  No. We say we are going to revive them. Like the Shulamite woman in \nthe Bible, we are going to revive her son.\n\n       . . . referenced above--\n\n  ``Referenced above''? They do not tell you specifically what \nresolutions.\n\n       defend the national security interests of the United States \n     against the threat--\n\n  What threat? Is it a direct, immediate, imminent attack on this \ncountry? Then, that is one thing. But ``against the threat posed by \nIraq. . . .''\n  A threat determined by whom? Who determines what the threat is?\n\n       against the threat posed by Iraq, and restore international \n     peace and security in the region.\n\n  What a broad grant of naked power. To whom? One person, the President \nof\n\n[[Page S9960]]\n\nthe United States. This Constitution itself refutes--it refutes--this \nresolution right on its face.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if I could say to my dear friend, on the \ndesk are two resolutions. The one that was originally introduced by Mr. \nDaschle and Mr. Lott--\n  Mr. BYRD. All right.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to you, sir, that is the one to which you referred.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me look at that one.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me read from it.\n  Mr. WARNER. But the one I drew your attention to, I say to my good \nfriend, is the one drawn by Mr. Lieberman and myself, which language is \nsomewhat changed. This is the one that is presently the subject of this \ndebate.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Let me read it.\n  I am sorry Mr. Lieberman has joined in this resolution, but he is a \nSenator, and he has the perfect right to join any resolution he wants \nto join.\n  But I think the American people want somebody who stands for \nsomething. They are tired of this wishy-washy going along and saying: \nWe have to get it over, and we have to put it behind us.\n  We are not going to put this thing behind us. The President has \nchosen to make this the battlefield. Iraq: He has chosen to make that \nthe battlefield. His administration has chosen to do that. His chief \npolitical adviser, Karl Rove, advised the Republican members of the \nNational Committee in January to do that, make that the battlefield. So \nthey have chosen to do it. And you will find a way to get away from it. \nYou can't do it.\n  So let's fight that battle on that battlefield, and in so doing, \nlet's draw attention to the shortcomings of this administration when it \ncomes to the domestic issues and the problems facing this Nation: \nhealth issues, the issues of homeland security. That is where the \nbattle ought to be fought. But if it were fought on that battleground, \nthe eyes of the people would not be deflected during an election.\n  Well, here is what the verbiage says:\n\n       The President is authorized to use the Armed Forces of the \n     United States as he determines--\n\n  ``He.'' Madison said that was too much, too much trust, too much \ntemptation, too great to be turned over to any one man. And that is \nprecisely what we are doing here.\n\n       The President is authorized to use the Armed Forces of the \n     United States as he determines to be necessary and \n     appropriate in order to--\n       (1) defend the national security of the United States \n     against the continuing threat posed by Iraq--\n\n  Why, Iraq has posed a threat for decades now. But how imminent and \nhow much is it directed toward the heart of America?\n  He can do anything he wants and say: Well, Congress said I could \ndefend the national security of the United States against the \ncontinuing threat posed by Iraq, and Congress also included the \nlanguage ``and enforce all relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions \nregarding Iraq.'' How much looser can that be, ``enforce all \nrelevant''? What do we mean by ``relevant U.N. Security Council \nresolutions''?\n  A resolution may have long ago expired, gone out of existence by \nvirtue of the happening of some circumstance. Yet like Lazarus, we are \ngoing to say: Lazarus, come forth, and Lazarus came forth when Jesus \ncalled him to come forth. He came forth wrapped in his grave clothes. \nAnd Jesus said: Loose him and let him go.\n  We can't say that about U.N. Security Council resolutions. We can't \nsay ``resolutions come forth; come forth in your grave clothes. Loose \nthat resolution and let it go.'' We can't say that. That is what we are \nsaying here, ``enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council \nresolutions regarding Iraq.''\n  This is, plain and simple, a blank check given to the President of \nthe United States. I won't touch it. With all respect to those Senators \nwho believe in what they are doing, they believe in it as sincerely as \nI believe they are wrong, but they believe they are right. I don't say \nanything with respect to their integrity. I don't challenge their \nhonor. I don't challenge for a moment their dedication to their \ncountry. I say it is wrong.\n  We are giving to the President of the United States a blank check, \nand Congress cannot do that. Congress should not do that. Where is the \ntermination? Where is the deadline? Where is the sunset language that \nsays after this happens, this resolution shall no longer exist, this \nresolution we are over and done with? There is nothing. This goes on to \nthe next President of the United States.\n  Show me if I am wrong. It goes on to the next President of the United \nStates, and the next one. We are going to have a Democratic President \nat some point in this country. Then where will my friends on the other \nside of the aisle be? I know where they will find me. They will find me \nright where I am now, if God lets me live. But that is what we are \ndoing. We are unwittingly passing a blank check, not just to this \nPresident but to any future President, until such time as the Congress \nacts to repeal or amend this resolution.\n  I am not willing to do it. Put a sunset provision in it. That would \nhelp some.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my colleague. I thank him for \nrecognizing what he was reading from previously is separate from the \nresolution which I coauthored with Senator Lieberman which he now has \nread. That is the subject. I say most respectfully to my colleague, I \nfirmly say there is nothing in this resolution, of which I was \nprivileged to be a coauthor with others, which in any way transcends \nthe authority given to the President of the United States by this \nConstitution. We have a disagreement on that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator join his friend from across the mountains, \nacross the Alleghenies, in putting language into this resolution which \nhe advocates here, would he join me in putting language in here which \nindubitably states, unquestionably states the authority of the \nConstitution, which requires that Congress declare war, not be impinged \nupon by this resolution in any way?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, that is a challenge. I will consider \nthat. But let me just say, earlier today I recounted how this body has \nonly used that power to declare war five times. Yet we have sent \nforward men and women of the Armed Forces into harm's way upwards of \n200 times. I say to my friend, that is a challenge.\n\n  I assert very firmly, there is nothing in this resolution that goes \nbeyond the authority the President has. This President, as well as any \nother President, could act tomorrow without the specific authority of \nCongress, if he felt it was necessary to use the troops to defend the \nsecurity interests of this country.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Constitution does not say that. That is exactly what my \nfriend is wanting to read into this Constitution. I don't mean just my \nfriend, I mean the others who support his view.\n  Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. He has said this Nation has issued a declaration of war but \nfive times. That is right. There have been 12 major wars in which this \ncountry has participated. We have had five declarations of war by this \nCongress out of those 12 wars. But out of six of the remaining seven, \nthe President acted on authorizations by statutes. They were not \ndeclarations of war as such, but they were statutes from which the \nauthorization could be drawn. So that is 11 of the 12. The 12th was in \nKorea, and Congress did not declare war. Congress did not authorize the \nforces of this country being injected into that conflict. That was done \nby Harry Truman, and he is my favorite Democratic President during my \ncareer, not my favorite all-time Democratic President.\n  By the way, Eisenhower is my favorite Republican President during \nthis time.\n  Back on the subject, there were 12 major wars. The distinguished \nSenator from Virginia has mentioned the number 200. He has said we have \nhad military forces involved in over 200 conflicts. Yes, in over 200, \nbut they were not major conflicts. They were minor skirmishes having to \ndo with cattle rustlers, having to do with pirates, having to do with \nminor engagements. No, they were not major conflicts.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the war in Vietnam did not have a \ndeclaration. That was not minor, and you know that well. There were \nover 50,000\n\n[[Page S9961]]\n\ncasualties. The war in Korea, in which I had a very modest role in the \nMarine Corps, was not modest. There were over 50,000 casualties.\n  Mr. BYRD. I said for the war in Korea, we did not have a declaration. \nMr. Truman put our troops there, and we didn't have a declaration.\n  Let's go back to the war in Vietnam. I was here. I was one of the \nSenators who voted for the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. Yes, I voted for \nthe Gulf of Tonkin resolution. I am sorry for that. I am guilty of \ndoing that. I should have been one of the two, or at least I should \nhave made it three, Senators who voted against that Gulf of Tonkin \nresolution. But I am not wanting to commit that sin twice, and that is \nexactly what we are doing here. This is another Gulf of Tonkin \nresolution. I am not going to vote for that this time. No. Don't count \nme in on that.\n  I see my friend, the Senator from Massachusetts. I join with the \nSenator from Virginia in wanting to hear what that Senator has to say. \nThat is my answer to the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. I respect this. We just have strong differences. I think \nwe have stated them.\n  I would like to read this bit of history. I was going to save this \nfor next week. You have raised properly the classification of this \ncurrent set of facts as presenting the preemptive issue. But let me \nread you--I will hand this to you, but it will be in the Record--use of \nthe military forces of the United States in engagements which have the \nfacts that could be judged as preemptive action by our Presidents: In \n1901, in the Colombia-Panama engagement; 1904, 1914, and 1965, the \nDominican Republic; 1912, Honduras; 1926, Nicaragua; 1958, Lebanon; \n1962, naval quarantine of Cuba; 1983, Grenada; 1986, Libya; 1989, \nPanama, Just Cause; 1992, Somalia; 1998, Sudan; 1998, Iraq, Desert Fox, \nwhen President Clinton ordered that; 1999, Kosovo. You and I had that \nresolution together, brother Senators, on Kosovo. We did the right \nthing.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. We may have been brother Senators on the resolution which \nbrought us out of Somalia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I remember that well.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. He has been very \nliberal----\n  Mr. WARNER. Not liberal but prepared.\n  Mr. BYRD. He was gracious in his yielding to me. The Senator from \nMassachusetts is going to address the Senate at 2:30.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will have more on this floor in the days to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rockefeller). The Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my two colleagues and friends \nfor framing this issue as it has been framed over the period of these \nlast hours, and I appreciate the nature of the discussion. I say to my \nfriend from West Virginia and my friend from Virginia, I hope over the \nperiod of these next several days as we contemplate this issue, going \ninto next week, the American people will take the time to follow not \nonly the debate here but to understand what is at stake with the \nvarious resolutions that are going to be coming before us.\n  I was going to inquire of the Senator from West Virginia. As I \nunderstand previous resolutions which have been considered by the \nSecurity Council, the only resolution that provided for the use of \nforce was the 1990 resolution, and it was pursuant to that resolution \nthat passed the Security Council where the President then came to the \nCongress and asked for the Congress' authorization to go to war. I \nbelieve when we are talking about resolutions, which was one of the \nmany valid points the Senator was making, on that particular occasion \nthe Security Council authorized the use of force, and then the \nPresident came to the Congress to ask for the authorization, and was \nable to gain the authorization, and the American forces were committed. \nBut that is an entirely different situation, as the Senator pointed out \nduring his exchange with my friend from Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I intend to oppose the Lieberman-Warner resolution \nauthorizing the use of force against Iraq. America should not go to war \nagainst Iraq unless and until all other reasonable alternatives are \nexhausted.\n  Just a year ago, the American people and the Congress rallied behind \nthe President and our Armed Forces as we went to war in Afghanistan. \nAl-Qaida posed a clear, present and continuing danger. The need to \ndestroy al-Qaida was urgent and undeniable.\n  In the months that followed September 11, the Bush administration \nmarshaled an impressive international coalition. Today, 90 countries \nare enlisted in the effort, from providing troops to providing law \nenforcement, intelligence, and other critical support.\n  I am concerned that going to war against Iraq before other means are \ntried will jeopardize the war against terrorism. One year into the \nbattle against al-Qaida, the administration is shifting focus, \nresources, and energy to Iraq. The change in priority is coming before \nwe have eliminated the threat from al-Qaida, before we know whether \nOsama bin Laden is dead or alive, and before we know whether the \nfragile post-Taliban government in Afghanistan will succeed.\n  No one disputes that America has lasting and important interests in \nthe Persian Gulf, or that Iraq poses a significant challenge to U.S. \ninterests. There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein's regime is a serious \ndanger, that he is a tyrant, and that his pursuit of lethal weapons of \nmass destruction cannot be tolerated. He must be disarmed.\n  Our goal is to achieve this objective in a way that minimizes the \nrisks to our country. We cannot ignore the danger to our young men and \nwomen in uniform, to our ally Israel, to regional stability, the \ninternational community, and victory against terrorism.\n  There is clearly a threat from Iraq, and there is clearly a danger, \nbut the administration has not made a convincing case that we face such \nan imminent threat to our national security that a unilateral, pre-\nemptive American strike and an immediate war are necessary. Nor has the \nadministration laid out the cost in blood and treasure of this \noperation.\n  With all the talk of war, the administration has not explicitly \nacknowledged, let alone explained to the American people, the immense \npost-war commitment that will be required to create a stable Iraq.\n  The President's challenge to the United Nations requires a renewed \neffort to enforce the will of the international community to disarm \nSaddam. Resorting to war is not America's only or best course at this \njuncture. There are realistic alternatives between doing nothing and \ndeclaring unilateral or immediate war. War should be a last resort, not \nthe first response.\n  The Bush administration says America can fight a war in Iraq without \nundermining our most pressing national security priority--the war \nagainst al-Qaida. But I believe it is inevitable that a war in Iraq \nwithout serious international support will weaken our effort to ensure \nthat al-Qaida terrorists can never, never, never threaten American \nlives again.\n  Unfortunately, the threat from al-Qaida is still imminent. The \nNation's armed forces and law enforcement are on constant high alert. \nAmerica may have broken up the network in Afghanistan and scattered its \noperatives across many lands. But we have not broken its will to kill \nAmericans. We know that al-Qaida is still there, and still here in \nAmerica--and will do all it can to strike at America's heart and \nheartland again. But we don't know when, where, or how this may happen.\n  On March 12, CIA Director Tenet testified before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee that al-Qaida remains ``the most immediate and \nserious threat'' to our country, ``despite the progress we have made in \nAfghanistan and in disrupting the network elsewhere.''\n  Even with the Taliban out of power, Afghanistan remains fragile. \nSecurity remains tenuous. Warlords still dominate many regions, and 17 \npeople were recently killed in fighting between rival warlords in the \nnorthern mountains.\n  Our reconstruction efforts, which is vital to long-term stability and \nsecurity, is in doubt and is cause for continuing concern. Some al-\nQaida operatives--no one knows how many--have faded into the general \npopulation.\n  Terrorist attacks are on the rise. A bomb exploded near the U.S. \nEmbassy in Kabul last week. A car bomb took 26 lives in that city \nearlier in September.\n\n[[Page S9962]]\n\nThe U.S. military base in Bagram is under periodic fire.\n  President Karzai, who has already survived one assassination attempt, \nis still struggling to solidify his hold on power. And although \nneighboring Pakistan has been our ally, its stability is far from \ncertain.\n  It is an open secret in Washington that the Nation's uniformed \nmilitary leadership is skeptical about the wisdom of war with Iraq. \nThey share the concern that it may adversely affect the ongoing war \nagainst al-Qaida and the continuing effort in Afghanistan by draining \nresources and armed forces already stretched so thin that many \nReservists have been called for a second year of duty, and record \nnumbers of service members have been kept on active duty beyond their \nobligated service.\n  To succeed in our global war against al-Qaida and terrorism, the \nUnited States depends on military, law enforcement, and intelligence \nsupport from many other nations. We depend on Russia and countries in \nthe former Soviet Union that border Afghanistan for military \ncooperation. We depend on countries from Portugal to Pakistan to the \nPhilippines for information about al-Qaida's plans and intentions.\n  Because of these relationships, terrorist plots are being foiled and \nal-Qaida operatives are being arrested. It is far from clear that these \nessential relationships will be able to survive the strain of a war \nwith Iraq that comes before the alternatives are tried--or comes \nwithout the support of an international coalition.\n  A largely unilateral American war that is widely perceived in the \nMuslim world as untimely or unjust could worsen, not lessen, the threat \nof terrorism. It could strengthen the ranks of al-Qaida sympathizers \nand trigger an escalation in terrorist acts. As General Wesley Clark, \nthe former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, told the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, that kind of war against Iraq, would ``super-charge \nrecruiting for al-Qaida.''\n  In a September 10 article, General Clark wrote:\n\n       Unilateral U.S. action today would disrupt the war against \n     al-Qaida.\n\n  We ignore such wisdom and advice from many of the best of our \nmilitary at our own peril.\n  General Joseph Hoar, the former Commander of the Central Command, \nadvised the Armed Services Committee on September 23 that America's \nfirst and primary effort should be to defeat al-Qaida.\n  We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and \ndeveloping weapons of mass destruction. Our intelligence community is \nalso deeply concerned about the acquisition of such weapons by Iran, \nNorth Korea, Libya, Syria and other nations. But information from the \nintelligence community over the past 6 months does not point to Iraq as \nan imminent threat to the United States or a major proliferator of \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  In public hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee in \nMarch, CIA Director George Tenet described Iraq as a threat but not as \nproliferator, saying that Saddam Hussein ``is determined to thwart U.N. \nsanctions, press ahead with weapons of mass destruction, and resurrect \nthe military force he had before the Gulf War.'' That is unacceptable, \nbut it is also possible that it could be stopped short of war.\n  In recent weeks, in briefings and in hearings in the Armed Services \nCommittee, I have seen no persuasive evidence that Saddam could not be \ndeterred from attacking U.S. interests by America's overwhelming \nmilitary superiority.\n  I have heard no persuasive evidence that Saddam is on the threshold \nof acquiring the nuclear weapons he has sought for more than 20 years.\n  The administration has offered no persuasive evidence that Saddam \nwould transfer chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction to \nal-Qaida or any other terrorist organization. As General Hoar told the \nmembers of the Armed Services Committee, a case has not been made to \nconnect al-Qaida and Iraq.\n  To the contrary, there is no clear and convincing pattern of Iraqi \nrelations with either al-Qaida or the Taliban.\n  General Clark testified before the Armed Services Committee on \nSeptember 23 that Iran has had closer ties to terrorism than Iraq. Iran \nhas a nuclear weapons development program, and it already has a missile \nthat can reach Israel.\n  In August, former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft wrote \nthat there is ``scant evidence'' linking Saddam Hussein to terrorist \norganizations, and ``even less to the September 11 attacks.'' He \nconcluded that Saddam would not regard it as in his interest to risk \nhis country or his investment in weapons of mass destruction by \ntransferring them to terrorists who would use them and ``leave Baghdad \nas the return address.''\n  At the present time, we do face a pressing risk of proliferation--\nfrom Russia's stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. America spends \nonly $1 billion a year to safeguard those weapons. Yet the \nadministration is preparing to spend between $100 billion and $200 \nbillion on a war with Iraq.\n  I do not accept the idea that trying other alternatives is either \nfutile or perilous--that the risks of waiting are greater than the \nrisks of war. Indeed, by launching a war against Iraq now, before other \nalternatives are tried in good faith, the United States may well \nprecipitate the very threat that we are intent on preventing--weapons \nof mass destruction in the hands of terrorists. If Saddam's regime and \nhis very survival are threatened, then his view of his interests may be \nprofoundly altered. He may decide he has nothing to lose by using \nweapons of mass destruction himself or by sharing them with terrorists.\n  Such a war would also pose great risks to our armed forces. Some who \nadvocate military action against Iraq assert that air strikes will do \nthe job quickly and decisively, and that the operation will be complete \nin 72 hours. But there is no persuasive evidence that air strikes alone \nover the course of several days will incapacitate Saddam and destroy \nhis weapons of mass destruction. Experts have informed us that we do \nnot have sufficient intelligence about military targets in Iraq. Saddam \nmay well hide his most lethal weapons in mosques, schools and \nhospitals. If our forces attempt to strike such targets, untold number \nof Iraqi civilians could be killed.\n  In the gulf war, many of Saddam's soldiers quickly retreated because \nthey did not believe the invasion of Kuwait was justified. But when \nIraq's survival is at stake, it is more likely that they will fight to \nthe end. Saddam and his military may well abandon the desert, retreat \nto Baghdad, and engage in urban, guerrilla warfare.\n  In our September 23 hearing, General Clark told the Armed Services \nCommittee that we would need a large military force and a plan for \nurban warfare. General Hoar said that our military would have to be \nprepared to fight block by block in Baghdad, and that we could lose a \nbattalion of soldiers a day in casualties. Urban fighting would, he \nsaid, look like the last brutal 15 minutes of the movie ``Saving \nPrivate Ryan.''\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have listened with great interest to what he is saying. \nDoes the Senator know--he is on the Armed Services Committee of the \nSenate as I am--does he know of any plan the administration has in \nreadiness to deal with any one of these several possible contingencies \nin which we may find ourselves if we attempt to launch a unilateral \nstrike, a unilateral invasion? Does he know of any plan that the \nadministration has?\n  I have heard time and again the administration's surrogates say that \nthe President has no plan on his desk. The distinguished Senator has \nmade reference to a plan. Does he know of any plan that the \nadministration has ready today and, if so, does he not believe the \nAmerican people ought to know something about that plan? Does he \nbelieve the Congress ought to be informed of that plan?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has asked the right question. The answer is \nthat the best information we have is the President has been given \nalternatives, but the Armed Services Committee has not been given those \nalternatives, those estimates, the different possibilities that might \noccur should forces be engaged. No one is looking at a particular kind \nof military operation, but people want to gather information\n\n[[Page S9963]]\n\nof the totality of what might be necessary and what might be expected. \nThat certainly has not been shared with the Armed Services Committee.\n  I repeat, no one has been asking for the details of a military \noperation. We would not expect it. But the type of issues--the \nmagnitude, what can be expected within the country, what will be \nexpected from our allies, what will be the reaction from many of those \ncountries that are on the front line of helping the United States in \nthe fight against terrorism and deal with the challenges of al-Qaida--\nwe have not seen any of those estimates, nor have we seen what the \nburden would be on the United States in a postwar situation.\n  We know of the difficulties and challenges in Afghanistan.\n  We see the tenuousness of that whole regime, the difficulties that we \nare facing in terms of Pakistan, in terms of its various challenges \neconomic-wise, but we have not received any kind of information about \nwhat would be the burden upon the Americans in terms of a postwar \nperiod. That is something that should certainly be explained, other \nthan the general figure that it will cost somewhere between $100 \nbillion and $200 billion.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, could I just add a fact here? In August, I \nbecame so concerned about the national dialogue on this issue that I \ntook it upon myself to write the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Levin, urging that promptly upon the Congress \nreturning from its August recess period we initiate hearings.\n  Senator Levin and I worked together on the scheduling of hearings. We \ntalked before the August recess and in due course a hearing schedule \nwas put together. Regrettably, the timing of those hearings has been \nsuch that our committee apparently will not have its hearing with the \nfour Chiefs of Services who were to come before the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  A second hearing we had tentatively agreed on was having General \nFranks, the commander in chief of the particular area of operation that \nis involved, to come before the committee.\n  So I say to my friend, regrettably, we have not had the opportunity--\nI tried in August to get these started, but we just did not complete \nthat hearing schedule.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for his comments, which I think make \nthe point that Senator Byrd and I would make, and that is that we ought \nto have those hearings prior to the time we give the authorization to \ngo to war. I cannot believe that Senator Levin would not welcome the \nopportunity to have those hearings mentioned by the Senator before the \ntime we would have the vote on it. The Senator from Virginia makes an \nexcellent point. This Congress has not heard from those who are in the \nauthority. It certainly is not because Senator Levin, who has had a \nseries of hearings, is not willing to have them. I would welcome the \nfact that we have those hearings, and I am going to suggest it to the \nchairman of that committee that we do that prior to the time we vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we were to have the hearing on General \nFranks today. Now, the reason it was not held, I leave that to my \ncolleague from Massachusetts to consult with the chairman.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We do not need the hearing to have the administration \nspell out to the American people what will be involved in this whole \nundertaking. The President can do this. The Secretary of Defense can do \nit. The general can do it at any time. We do not need the hearing.\n  These are the questions that the Senator from West Virginia and \nothers have asked on this. We still have not gotten it. The American \npeople have not gotten it. We do not need the hearings just to satisfy \nourselves. The American people are entitled to this information \ncertainly if we are going to be going to war.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield for \nanother question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I understand it is possible the United \nStates could be lucky if the United States made a unilateral decision \nto invade Iraq. We could be lucky, but we might not be.\n  Does the Senator have any idea, based on his having information from \nthe administration, what is the likelihood we might find ourselves \nbogged down in the hot sands of the Middle East and our men and women \nmay have to fight a house-to-house, apartment-to-apartment battle in \nany one of the cities of Iraq? What would be the cost in terms of human \nlife, not only of Iraqis but of our own men and women, if we were faced \nwith a war in which we have to go street by street, avenue by avenue, \nhouse by house, floor to floor, to root out the snipers? What would be \nthe cost in American lives?\n\n  The distinguished Senator has stated that in this war, Saddam may \nbelieve he has nothing to lose by pushing the button and going the \nfinal mile, the last way, and making whatever expenditure in human life \nthat flows from that decision. I wonder if the administration, in its \nplanning, has determined at any point that we may be faced with that \nkind of situation.\n  I wonder this further, if the Senator will allow me: Have the \nAmerican people been asked to face up to that possibility? And, no, the \nadministration will not make its military officers available for one \nreason or another to accommodate the Senate Armed Forces hearings, but \nwhy then do we have to rush in and make a decision before an election \nthat is only 30 days away? Why should the leadership of this Congress \nnot say we are going to go home, we are going to talk to the people, we \nare going to listen to what they have to say? After all, they are the \nones who are going to have to pay the price. We will go home and we \nwill await this fateful, momentous, all-important, vital decision until \nafter the election, and we will come back.\n  When I was the majority leader of this Senate, I, from time to time, \nincluded in the adjournment resolution a provision that allowed me to \ncall the Senate back after discussing it with the minority leader. I \nwas able to call it back. Why should we go home? What is there about \nthis that says we need to make this decision now and go home? I have \nonly heard the feeble excuse: Oh, we have to put it behind us.\n  Does the Senator believe, with me, that we are not going to put this \nbehind us, even though we vote on this resolution? If we are weak \nenough to support this resolution, with all due respect to the authors \nthereof, this is a blank check to the President of the United States, \ndressed up in the glittering figleaves of ``whereases,'' beautifully \nflowered whereases. They are pretty, but this is nothing but a blank \ncheck. There could be a saving in paper if we wrote it in one sentence, \njust turn it over lock, stock, and barrel, give it to the President of \nthe United States--not only this one but also the next one. It is so \nbroad in scope and there is no end to it. It is just open ended.\n  May I ask my friend from Massachusetts, why shouldn't the leadership \nof this Congress say that the concerns are so great, the potential is \nso weighty, that we, the people's representatives, ought to go back and \ntalk to the American people about this? Let's hear from them before we \nmake this final decision.\n  Why should we have to have our thoughts cluttered up with an \nelection, with the supercharged politics of this atmosphere in which we \nvote? Why should we be forced to make this decision now? Does the \nSenator agree with me?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct in terms of his whole \nanalysis, I believe, of the underlying resolutions that are before the \nSenate and the fact that we were effectively yielding the \ndecisionmaking power of making war or peace--effectively unilaterally \nturning that over just to the decision of the President of the United \nStates, as the Senator pointed out.\n  The Gephardt-Lieberman-Warner language says they can take unilateral \naction without a Security Council mandate to defend against a threat \nposed by Iraq. It talks about the test to defend against the continuing \nthreat from Iraq.\n\n  The Senator, in his earlier exchange, points out that language is \ncertainly not even implied in terms of whatever authority the President \nhas to provide for the security of the United States. It would have to \nbe an imminent threat. The Senator had a very strong exchange and made \nthat case effectively.\n  The test in the Gephardt-Lieberman-Warner Resolution says to defend\n\n[[Page S9964]]\n\nagainst the continuing threat from Iraq--that is the operative word. \nAnd in Biden-Lugar it talks about dealing with the threat of Iraq is \n``so grave'' that force should be used. New words, ``so grave.'' The \nPresident already said it was a grave situation.\n  In effect, if that was to be accepted--the President already said it \nwas a grave situation. It would, in effect, grant unilaterally, without \nany involvement in the international community, any effort whatsoever \nto try and bring allies into this, give the authority for the President \nto go ahead with war, as the President has indicated he may very well \ndo.\n  Back to the Senator's other question about what the general said \nSeptember 23. General McInerney believed that 72 hours of bombing would \neffectively break the spirit and the military capability of Iraq. I \nwill let him speak in his own words, and I ask unanimous consent to \nhave pertinent statements printed after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The conclusion I drew was it would be basically a \ncleanup operation.\n  That was not what GEN Wesley Clark or General Hoar stated. Wesley \nClark, the general in Kosovo, and General Hoar, the distinguished \nmarine and central commander in Europe, two very prominent, \ndistinguished, extraordinary military officials worth listening to--\nGeneral Clark on that day told the Armed Services Committee that we \nwould need a large military force and a plan for urban warfare.\n  Those are not my words, not my conclusions. That is what General \nClark said would be his estimate of what would be needed. General Hoar \nsaid our military would have to be prepared to fight block by block in \nBaghdad, and we could lose a battalion of soldiers a day in casualties. \nThat is the testimony of General Hoar before the Armed Services \nCommittee. He concluded: The urban fighting would look like the last \nbrutal 15 minutes of the movie ``Saving Private Ryan.''\n  One of my colleagues said you can find generals who will say just \nabout anything you want. That is certainly an insult to two of the \nfinest military leaders we have had in recent times, one in the Marine \nCorps, and the other a very distinguished Army officer.\n  I agree with what the Senator said. Maybe we will get lucky. If this \ngoes ahead we hope that is the outcome. But the Senator reminds us \nthere are too many instances in the past we have not been lucky; the \nevents went against us and we experienced the loss of enormous numbers \nof young Americans. We ought to be cautious and guarded, as the Senator \nhas spelled out.\n  I have a few more minutes, and I will conclude.\n  A decade ago, before the Gulf War in 1991, Secretary of State James \nBaker met with the Iraqis and threatened Hussein with catastrophe if he \nused weapons of mass destruction. In that war, although Saddam launched \n39 Scud missiles at Israel, he did not use the chemical or biological \nweapons he had.\n  If Saddam's regime and survival are threatened today, he will have \nnothing to lose, and may use everything at his disposal. Israeli Prime \nMinister Ariel Sharon has announced that instead of its forbearance in \nthe 1991 Gulf War, this time Israel will respond if attacked. If \nweapons of mass destruction land on Israeli soil, killing innocent \ncivilians, the experts I have consulted believe Israel will retaliate, \nand possibly with nuclear weapons.\n  This escalation, spiraling out of control, could draw the Arab world \ninto a regional war in which our Arab allies side with Iraq, against \nthe United States and against Israel. And that would represent a \nfundamental threat to Israel, to the region, and to the world \ncommunity.\n  Nor can we rule out the possibility that Saddam would assault \nAmerican forces with chemical or biological weapons. Despite advances \nin protecting our troops, we do not yet have the capability to \nsafeguard all of them.\n  The members of our armed forces are serving our country with great \ndistinction. Nearly 70,000 Reservists and National Guardsmen have been \nmobilized for the war against terrorism. The Pentagon has also been \nforced to retain 22,000 service members involuntarily, due to critical \nshortages of pilots, intelligence specialists, and security personnel. \nThis number is almost as high as in the Gulf War, in which 29,000 \nservice members were involuntarily retained.\n  In the Gulf War, no service members were recalled for longer than a \nyear. Today, an additional 11,000 Reservists have been mobilized for a \nsecond year--that is today.\n  If we embark upon a premature or unilateral military campaign against \nIraq, or a campaign only with Britain, our forces will have to serve in \neven greater numbers, for longer periods, and with graver risks. Our \nfores will be stretched even thinner.\n  War should be the last resort. If in the end we have to take that \ncourse, the burden should be shared with allies--and that is less \nlikely if war becomes an immediate response.\n  Even with the major technological gains demonstrated in Afghanistan, \nthe logistics of such a war would be extraordinarily challenging if we \ncould not marshal a genuine coalition of regional and international \nallies.\n  President Bush made the right decision on September 12 when he \nexpressed America's willingness to work with the United Nations to \nprevent Iraq from using chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. The \nPresident's address to the General Assembly challenging the United \nNations to enforce its long list of Security Council resolutions on \nIraq was powerful--and for many of us, it was persuasive.\n  But to maintain the credibility he built when he went to the U.N., \nthe President must follow the logic of his own argument.\n  Before we go to war, we should give the international community a \ncredible opportunity to meet the President's challenge--to renew its \nresolve to disarm Saddam Hussein completely and effectively. This makes \nthe resumption of inspections more imperative and perhaps more likely \nthan at any time since they ended in 1998.\n  So this should be the first aim of our policy--to get U.N. inspectors \nback into Iraq without conditions. I hope the Security Council will \napprove a new resolution requiring the Government of Iraq to accept \nunlimited and unconditional inspections and the destruction of any \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  The Security Council resolution should set a short timetable for the \nresumption of inspections. It should also require the head of the UN \ninspection team to report to the Security Council at frequent \nintervals. No delaying tactics should be tolerated--and if they occur, \nSaddam should know that he will lose his last chance to avoid war.\n  The Security Council Resolution should authorize the use of force, if \nthe inspection process in unsatisfactory. And there should be no doubt \nin Baghdad that the United States Congress will strongly support the \ndetermination of the international community and President Bush to \ndisarm Saddam.\n  The return of inspectors with unfettered access and the ability to \ndestroy what they find not only could remove any weapons of mass \ndestruction from Saddam's arsenal. They could also be more effective \nthan an immediate or unilateral war in ensuring that these deadly \nweapons would not fall into the hands of terrorists.\n  The 7 years of inspections that took place until 1998 succeeded in \nvirtually eliminating Saddam's ability to develop a nuclear weapon in \nIraq during that period. Even with Iraq's obstructions, those \ninspections resulted in the demolition of large quantities of chemical \nand biological weapons. By the time the inspectors were forced out of \nthe country in 1998, they had accomplished far more disarmament than \nthe Gulf War achieved. Before going to war again, we should do all we \ncan, to resume the inspections now--and set a non-negotiable demand of \nno obstruction, no delay, no more weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\n  What can be gained here is success--and in the event of failure, \ngreater credibility for an armed response, greater international \nsupport, and the prospect of victory with less loss of American life.\n  So what is to be lost by pursuing this policy before Congress \nauthorizes sending young Americans into another and in this case \nperhaps unnecessary war?\n  Even the case against Saddam is, in important respects, a case \nagainst immediate or unilateral war. If Prime\n\n[[Page S9965]]\n\nMinister Blair is correct in saying that Iraq can launch chemical or \nbiological warheads in 45 minutes, what kind of sense does it make to \nput our soldiers in the path of that danger without exhausting every \nreasonable means to disarm Iraq through the United Nations?\n  Clearly, we must halt Saddam Hussein's quest for weapons of mass \ndestruction. Yes, we may reach the point where our only choice is \nconflict--with like-minded allies at our side, if not, in a \nmultilateral action authorized by the Security Council. But we are not \nthere yet.\n  The stakes are too high if we do the wrong thing. We have the \nopportunity now, in Congress, to do the right thing, and it is our \nresponsibility to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                             Urban Warfare\n\n       ``In urban warfare, you could run through battalions a day \n     at a time.

Clark, \n     USA (Ret.), Former Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, \n     September 23, 2002.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I ask my distinguished colleague and \nvery good friend of many, many years just a question or two? I listened \nvery carefully to his remarks. I just wish to observe that, on the \npoint about----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I yielded the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think he yielded, and I asked if I could engage in a \ncolloquy.\n  The Senator mentioned the case has not been made to connect al-Qaida \nto Iraq, but I think the Senator is aware of the fact that the \nSecretary of Defense has now revealed what was intelligence prior \nthereto, the fact that al-Qaida has now established some training \ncamps, and so forth, within the sovereign boundaries of Iraq. That, to \nme, is a very important bit of intelligence that has come to the \nforefront.\n  Senator Byrd keeps saying, What is new? To me, that is very new. It \nis now out in the open.\n  While I am not suggesting there has been an absolute, airtight, \ndirect connection between 9/11, 2001, it is clear that Iraq sponsors \nand shelters terrorists, including al-Qaida.\n  On the point about the generals who appeared before the Armed \nServices Committee, the Senator referred to portions of their \ntestimony. But I have the very clear recollection--I sat with Chairman \nLevin throughout every minute of that hearing. These generals also, \nwhen pressed by myself and others, said there are times when the U.S. \nhas to act alone, if necessary, to defend ourselves and protect our \nnational interests.\n  That is the point, time and time again, that I debated with our \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Byrd, in which we have, I suppose, \nfrom his perspective, different opinions.\n  The Senator in his remarks just now indirectly suggests that we \nshould wait on the U.N. Perhaps there will be a new inspection regime. \nI know Secretary of State Powell has brilliantly and courageously \nworked up there to develop a strong United Nations resolution. We will \nhave to await judgment until that resolution is forthcoming. But I \nthink we cannot leave in the minds of the American people that, in any \nway, our Nation must relinquish the authority, under the Constitution, \nto protect our own national interests--relinquish it in any way or \npredicate it on action of the United Nations. We cannot do that. We \ncannot let the United Nations think in any way they could veto the \nauthority of this President or the ability of this Nation to defend \nitself. I hope the Senator was not suggesting that in any way by his \nremarks.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, General Scowcroft, who is a distinguished \nretired general and arms control expert, the head of a Presidential \nintelligence board, was the one who indicated that he did not believe \nthere had been a connection; that you might have had contact, but by \ndefinition, as the Senator has pointed out, the connection with al-\nQaida did not in any way reflect on September 11. And Secretary Powell \nindicated that as well. The Director of the FBI said that this summer.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I agree with that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could just finish now, I was at the last \nintelligence briefing. I will not characterize it as to what new \ninformation came out as a result of interviewing detainees in the past \nfew days or weeks, but, very clearly, the statements that I said in \ncharacterizing the contacts between al-Qaida and Iraq, by Mr. \nScowcroft, by Secretary Powell, by Director Mueller, would indicate \nthat this had not been a contact that was meaningful and significant in \nterms of a threat to the United States.\n\n  They also pointed out that, in terms of a country that was providing \naid and assistance to terrorists such as Hamas and Hezbollah, it was \nmuch higher in terms of Iran than it was in terms of Iraq.\n  Those references--I included two in my statement. I will include the \nthird.\n  The other point I mention is, as the Senator remembers, Secretary of \nDefense Rumsfeld and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Richard \nMyers, testified before the committee on September 19, 2002 that they \nwould not talk about planning, would not talk about casualties, would \nnot talk about operational issues. Even in the closed session, \nSecretary Rumsfeld refused to address the issues.\n  So I think it is important to understand that type of information, as \nwas raised, has been denied both to the members of the committee and, \nmost importantly, to the public.\n  Again, I say no one is asking for the military operations, but what \nwe are asking for is basic assessments in terms of the numbers of \npersonnel, their best estimates in terms of the length and what would \nbe involved, in terms of the conflict.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, it had been my \nhope--\n\n[[Page S9966]]\n\nand there was planning in place--that our committee, the Armed Services \nCommittee, was to have had hearings this week with the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, and most specifically with General Franks, who has been \nentrusted with much of the planning. I leave it to our chairman to give \nthe responses to why that did not occur, but that is a fact that we had \nplanned to do it.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld declassified information recently and said that \nal-Qaida has camps existing now within the sovereign boundaries of \nIraq, and senior al-Qaida leaders have had sanctuaries in Iraq. While \nthe link, as I pointed out, between 9/11 has yet to be established, \nthere is information of the linkage.\n  I am more concerned with the question I posed to the Senator. In any \nway does his remark suggest we should abrogate our right to act when it \nis in our security interest because of action or inaction, as the case \nmay be, of the United Nations on the resolution now being formed while \nour Secretary of State and others are working to establish the \nframework in such a way that it would meet the concerns that this \nNation has, and I believe Great Britain? It may not. And if it does not \nmeet them, does that action to put out a new inspection regime which \nfalls below the standards and requirements and goals that we think are \nnecessary, does that mean we do nothing? Does that mean our President's \nhands and the hands of the Prime Minister of Great Britain are tied?\n  What are we to do? Allow another ineffective inspection regime to \ntake place, which would possibly obviate the possibility of engaging \nIraq more forcibly, if it were necessary to stop the spread of weapons \nof mass destruction?\n  Would you clarify the position you have taken?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I certainly will. If there is a clear and present danger \nto the United States and an immediate threat, obviously the President \nhas the right to act and should act. But that is not what we have here. \nThat is not the case that has been made by the Secretary of Defense or \nthe President or the Senator from Virginia, that there is a clear and \npresent danger to the security of the American people, and that it is \nimminent. That case has not been made. When that case has been made, \nput me down in terms of being in favor of taking immediate action.\n  If the President of the United States makes that determination, fine. \nBut we have been asking: Where is this evidence? In 1962, President \nKennedy took it to the United Nations and showed the world what was out \nthere. Every American understood what was at risk. Do you have the \ninformation or don't you have the information? Is the information \ndifferent today than it was a year ago when we never had this proposal? \nIf it is, let's see it. Let's hear about it. We have not seen it in the \nArmed Services Committee. I haven't attended all the meetings, but I \nhave attended just about all of them, the recent ones that we have had \non Iraq. If there is any information there, I would welcome the Senator \nfrom Virginia telling me, pointing that out. But we haven't got it.\n  The Secretary of Defense says he does not have to make the case \nanymore. We ought to know that Saddam is a tyrant. We all agree.\n  The best question is: How are we going to best defend the security of \nthe United States? I maintain that the security of the United States \ntoday is threatened as much by al-Qaida as by anything that is \nimmediate now in terms of Iraq. We do not hear anything more about al-\nQaida. We don't understand what the threat is. That was all we heard \nabout.\n  The Senator hasn't said anything about that. Yet we find an unsettled \nsituation in Afghanistan with the blowing up of cars, the warlords \ncoming back, and the fact that they are trying to a get a 60,000- or \n70,000-man army and they have 1,600 recruits. They want a national \narmy. They have virtually nothing there.\n  We have to ask ourselves: If this doesn't go away--as General \nMcInerney says--in 72 hours, what is going to happen in terms of all of \nthose countries that are helping the United States deal with al-Qaida \nthat was a threat to the United States, and, according to the head of \nthe Central Intelligence Agency, continued to be the principal threat \nto the security of the United States just 4 months ago? You wouldn't \nknow that. I do not know what has changed. Neither do the American \npeople. That is what they want to hear. They hope they will hear that \nduring this debate. But we haven't.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in reply to my colleague's observations, \nin no way has this Nation lessened the intensity or commitment to the \nwar on international terrorism in Afghanistan or elsewhere. It may not \nbe the featured article in the press today, but I assure the Senator \nthat the men and women of our Armed Forces, together with those of many \nother nations, are pressing unrelentlessly against the spread of \nterrorism, be it in Afghanistan or elsewhere in this world.\n  Again, I bring my colleague back to this question of the United \nNations. A quote appears in today's newspaper.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record following our \ncolloquy an article from today's Washington Post.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it quotes our distinguished colleague, \nSenator Edward Kennedy, as saying: I am waiting for the final \nrecommendation of the Security Council before I am going to say how I \nam going to vote.\n  I would like to give the Senator an opportunity to clarify.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I called him and asked him for the context. We have not \nreceived that yet.\n  Mr. WARNER. Certainly, Mr. President, I in no way attack \nauthenticity, and I am glad that the Senator has clarified that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is quite clear what I have said; that is, I think it \nis a mistake for us to go it alone, unless there is the kind of threat \nthat I have just described--a clear and present danger and an imminent \nthreat to the United States. Then we have to take action. That power is \nreserved for the President. We had that discussion earlier in the \nafternoon between the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from \nVirginia. That happens to be the case. But that has not been the case, \nand the case has not been made.\n  It seems to me that we are much better off going internationally and \nnot saying that our first choice ought to be war, the first choice \nought to be battle, and the first choice ought to be conflict. I think \nwe ought to try to build a coalition of the United Nations and take \nconcerted action with an inspection regime that does authorize force, \nthat does permit unfettered inspections, that includes the reporting \nback to the Security Council of the progress that has been made.\n  I outlined that in my speech. That is our position. That is what I \nthought the President was saying when he went to the United Nations \ninitially. That is what I thought he was saying. That is the course of \naction that we ought follow, and we ought to hear certainly from the \nUnited Nations Security Council on that recommendation and on that \nchallenge.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let us be clear. I assure my colleague \nthat I agree that our President states almost daily when he addresses \nthis issue, as he did on the steps of the White House just a day or two \nago when I was right there, that his first priority is to pursue a \ncoalition. His first priority is to pursue in the United Nations the \nenforcement of the resolutions passed and perhaps one in the future. He \nhas repeatedly said war is the last--I repeat--the last option. He is \nfulfilling, in my judgment, his responsibility as President under our \nConstitution. And I commend him for doing so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope he will go to the United Nations \nand that he will go to the Security Council. Then, if he finds out they \nwill not take the steps, and that we have a clear, present, and \nimmediate danger to the United States, I hope he will come back and \nthat we can debate and pass a resolution so we can take the steps \nnecessary to secure this country.\n  But that isn't what the resolution says. We have been through that. \nBasically, it doesn't deal with the Security Council of the United \nNations. It doesn't deal with that. It says it permits unilateral \naction without the Security Council taking any steps at all.\n  We want to follow what the Senator from Virginia says. The President \nhas gone to the Security Council. Challenge it, get an international \ncoalition,\n\n[[Page S9967]]\n\ngo for that and challenge with inspections. If that is not successful, \ncome back here to the Senate. And I bet you that Senator Byrd will be \nthe first name that will be on a resolution to take the action and mine \nwill be the second. But that is not where we are now. That isn't what \nthis resolution is all about. It effectively is granting the President \nthe authority to go to war unilaterally if he concludes there is a \ncontinuing threat from Iraq--not an immediate, not a clear and present \ndanger--if there is a continuing threat from Iraq. I think he has \nconcluded that today.\n  If you pass this resolution, you are saying, Why even bother with the \nSecurity Council? If I were a member of the Security Council, I would \nsay, Why are you even taking the time to talk to us? You have already \nmade up your mind. You are going to war.\n  That is effectively what that resolution says. That is the problem \nsome of us have with the construct and why we are here.\n  I thank the Senator. I appreciate it very much. I am sure we will \nhave more opportunity to talk.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts made \nreference to the Cuban missile crisis and the extraordinary courage \nthat his brother, the late President, showed in his leadership. There \nagain, as the Senator points out, there was clear evidence of a \nthreat--the ``smoking gun,'' as someone said--that famous picture of \nthe missile. But I say to my good friend, in the days to come on this \ndebate I will go into greater detail on the changes in technology since \n1961. And here we are in 2002 with changes in technology which present \na whole new framework of threats that this Nation has never experienced \nbefore--to use the words of Secretary Kissinger in his testimony to the \nForeign Relations Committee--``modern technology in the service of \nterror gives no warning.''\n  Those are the words that say to me the doctrine of preemption, which \nI recited, and which has been followed for many years by this country \nin times of need, is one that bears careful reexamination in the light \nof the technology possessed by Saddam Hussein. He has far more weapons \nthan were ever presented by Adolf Hitler--far more weapons in terms of \nweapons of mass destruction and the technology that exists today that \ndidn't exist in 1961 and that didn't exist in 1941.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I, for one, am not prepared to sign up \nfor the change in foreign policy where we have one person making a \ndecision to go to war. Today, it is Iraq because we have Saddam \nHussein. Khomeini was in Iran. We were going to that country as well. \nWhat about Qadhafi? I heard from families in my State of Massachusetts \nwho lost members of their family. Sixty-seven members of the Armed \nForces lost their lives in the war against Qadhafi. Why aren't we going \nafter Qadhafi?\n  What about North Korea? They may have murdered millions of their own \npeople. They may have nuclear weapons.\n  Where are we stopping on this? The idea that you had a great deal \nmore time--in the Cuban missile crisis, had the weapons come from Cuba, \nwe had about 11 minutes. You are saying there is no more of a dangerous \ntime now than we had with 11 minutes?\n  I am not prepared to say we are going to turn over to a single \nindividual in our democracy the authority to go to war at any time when \na President believes there is a ``continuing threat'' from--you fill in \nthe name of the country. You fill in the name of the country. A \n``continuing threat'' from where?--fill in the name of the country--\nauthorizing the President to go to war.\n  That is not, I think, what our Founding Fathers intended.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  We will conclude this debate. Indeed, policies of containment have \nworked in the past, but with the spread of modern technology, and the \nclear documentation that this particular evil dictator, Saddam Hussein, \nhas used these weapons against his own people and his adversaries, it \nis clear and convincing proof to this Senator that there is a threat \nthat must be dealt with now--not tomorrow, now.\n  Hopefully, the United Nations will devise a resolution and live up to \nits responsibilities. But if it does not, let there be no doubt in the \nminds of anyone that our Nation will act in its own interests to \nprotect its own people and, hopefully, will act with a coalition of \nallies.\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n                        The Myth of U.N. Support\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       ``This nation is prepared to present its case against the \n     Soviet threat to peace, and our own proposals for a peaceful \n     world, at any time and in any forum--in the Organization of \n     American States, in the United Nations, of in any other \n     meeting that could be useful--without limiting our freedom of \n     action.''--President John F. Kennedy, Cuban missile crisis, \n     address to the nation, Oct. 22, 1962\n\n       ``I'm waiting for the final recommendation of the Security \n     Council before I'm going to say how I'm going to vote.''--\n     Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, Iraq crisis, address to the Johns \n     Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, Sept. 27, \n     2002\n\n       How far the Democrats have come. Forty years ago to the \n     month, President Kennedy asserts his willingness to present \n     his case to the United Nations, but also his determination \n     not to allow the United Nations to constrain America's \n     freedom of action. Today his brother, a leader of the same \n     party, awaits the guidance of the United Nations before he \n     will declare himself on how America should respond to another \n     nation threatening the United States with weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       Ted Kennedy is not alone. Much of the leadership of the \n     Democratic Party is in the thrall of the United Nations. War \n     and peace hang in the balance. The world awaits to see what \n     the American people, in Congress assembled, will say. These \n     Democrats say: wait, we must find out what the United Nations \n     says first.\n       The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Carl \n     Levin, would enshrine such lunacy in legislation, no less. He \n     would not even authorize the use of force without prior U.N. \n     approval. Why? What exactly does U.N. approval mean?\n       It cannot mean the U.N. General Assembly, which is an empty \n     debatable society. It means the Security Council. Now, the \n     Security Council has five permanent members and 10 rotating \n     member. Among the rotating members is Syria. How can any \n     senator stand up and tell the American people that before \n     deciding whether America goes to war against a rogue state as \n     Iraq, it needs to hear the ``final recommendation'' of Syria, \n     a regime on the State Department's official terrorist list?\n       Or maybe these senators are awaiting the wisdom of some of \n     the other nonpermanent members. Cameroon? Mauritius? Guinea? \n     Certainly Kennedy and Levin cannot be saying that we must not \n     decide whether to go to war until we have heard the \n     considered opinion of countries that none of their colleagues \n     can find on a map.\n       Okay. So we are not talking about these dots on the map. We \n     must be talking about the five permanent members. The United \n     states is one. Another is Britain, which support us. That \n     leaves three. So when you hear senators grandly demand the \n     support of the ``international community,'' this is what they \n     mean: France, Russia and China.\n       As I recently asked in this space, by what logic does the \n     blessing of these countries bestow moral legitimacy on \n     American action? China's leaders are the butchers of \n     Tiananmen Square. France and Russia will decide the Iraq \n     question based on the coldest calculation of their own \n     national interest, meaning money and oil.\n       Everyone in the Senate wants a new and tough inspection \n     regime in Iraq: anytime, anywhere, unannounced. Yet these \n     three countries, whose approval the Democrats crave, are \n     responsible for the hopelessly diluted and useless inspection \n     regime that now exists.\n       They spent the 1990s doing everything they could to \n     dismantle the Gulf War mandate to disarm Saddam Hussein. The \n     Clinton administration helplessly acquiesced, finally \n     approving a new Security Council resolution in 1999 that gave \n     us the current toothless inspections regime. France, Russia \n     and China, mind you, refused to support even that resolution; \n     they all abstained because it did not make yet more \n     concessions to Saddam Hussein.\n       After a decade of acting as Saddam Hussein's lawyers on the \n     Security Council, these countries are now to be the arbiters \n     of America's new and deadly serious effort to ensure Iraqi \n     disarmament.\n       So insist leading Democrats. Why? It has no moral logic. It \n     has no strategic logic. Forty years ago, we had a Democratic \n     president who declared that he would not allow the United \n     Nations or any others to tell the United States how it would \n     defend itself. Would that JFK's party had an ounce of his \n     confidence in the wisdom and judgment of America, deciding \n     its own fate by its own lights, regardless of the wishes of \n     France.\n       Or Cameroon.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S9968]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, Senator Murkowski be recognized to speak and that Senator \nStabenow be recognized after Senator Murkowski.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today not in opposition to the \nresolutions before us but, rather, to ask my colleagues to carefully \nconsider our national priorities as we debate our course of action \nagainst Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq.\n  Congress is preparing to consider a series of resolutions authorizing \nthe President to initiate options against Iraq, including the use of \nforce. If there is one matter upon which there would be unanimity of \nagreement, it is that Saddam Hussein is an evil man, an evil man in a \nregion of evil men. He is a tyrant who has used chemical and biological \nweapons on his own people. He has flouted U.N. resolutions calling for \ninspections of his arms capabilities. His forces regularly fire on \nAmerican and British jet pilots who are enforcing the no-fly zones in \nthe north and south of his country, and he has the potential to develop \nand deploy nuclear weapons, a potential we need to monitor closely.\n  The resolutions before us mean we as Members of Congress, acting on \nbehalf of the American people, are investing our collective trust in \nthe judgment of the President of the United States, because it will be \nhis decision as to whether, when, and under what ultimate circumstances \nto utilize whatever authority we might grant.\n  We are in a very similar position to where we were immediately after \nSeptember 11, 2001, when the President asked for an authorization, and \nwe gave him the power to launch a war against al-Qaida and the Taliban \nregime in Afghanistan.\n  The latest White House draft of the resolution before us today \nattempts to link two challenges to our Nation's security: terrorism and \nSaddam Hussein. I am not certain it does so in the most coherent and \neffective way. Frankly, I fear elevating Saddam Hussein to our Nation's \nNo. 1 enemy poses risks that have not been fully considered.\n  In the constellation of threats to the American homeland, as well as \nto our interests abroad, in my judgment, terrorism represents the \ngreatest and most urgent security threat to the American people. Saddam \nHussein cannot be viewed in isolation. The region of the Middle East to \nCentral Asia is a very tough neighborhood, and we have many threats and \ncommitments in that neighborhood. We have commenced a war against \nterror in Afghanistan--not yet complete. We know that, as we leave \nAfghanistan, there will be other chapters in the war on terror, and it \nis quite probable that those future chapters will be more difficult \nthan the one we have already experienced in Afghanistan.\n  In addition to that, we have a tense, continuing standoff between \nIndia and Pakistan, two nuclear powers at virtual sword's point. We \nhave a continuing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, and we \nhave other countries in the region that have a substantial--in several \ninstances greater capacity for weapons of mass destruction than does \nIraq. So we must decide what our priorities are.\n  In my opinion, our first priority must be the successful completion \nof the war on terrorism. When President Bush spoke before a joint \nsession of Congress on September 20, 2001, just 9 days after the \nattacks, he declared:\n\n       Our war on terror begins with al-Qaida, but it does not end \n     there. It will not end until every terrorist group of global \n     reach has been found, stopped, and defeated.\n\n  That is the challenge the United States of America undertook in the \nwar on terror. In his State of the Union speech on January 29, 2002, \nPresident Bush again, standing in the House Chamber before a joint \nsession of Congress, set this agenda:\n\n       Our Nation will continue to be steadfast and patient and \n     persistent in the pursuit of two great objectives: First, we \n     will shut down terrorist camps, disrupt terrorist plans, and \n     bring terrorists to justice. Second, we must prevent the \n     terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or \n     nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the \n     world.\n\n  Mr. President, I concur with President Bush's ranking of our priority \ntargets: First, to shut down terrorist camps, disrupt terrorist plans, \nand to bring terrorists to justice; and, second, to go after regimes \nthat seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons.\n  Clearly, terrorists pose the most immediate threat to America. They \nhave, as their avowed goal, to kill Americans. They have the capability \nof recruiting and training in the skills of terrorism, in those \ntraining camps to which the President referred, waves of terrorists. \nAnd they have the capability to strike within our homeland, as was \ndemonstrated again today by the arrest of six alleged terrorist cell \nmembers, four of whom were in Oregon and one in Michigan.\n  There is no question that our national security paradigm changed with \nthe events of September 11. We used to think about national security in \nterms such as ``balance of power''--particularly, the United States and \nthe Soviet Union. Our concerns centered on big-picture questions, such \nas whether an adversary had the capability to launch nuclear missiles \nthat could reach our homeland or how a dispute in a far-off region, in \nSoutheast Asia, or the Persian Gulf, might affect our interests. We did \nnot have to worry much about whether an adversary had the ability to \nexecute a terrorist attack against Americans here at home.\n  That changed on September 11. Our most dangerous adversaries are no \nlonger nation-states but shadowy organizations with operations \nscattered around the world. They are not interested in the traditional \nprizes of power, such as geography or wealth. They are not deterred by \nthe traditional means by which nations are constrained to operate \nwithin their borders and within some set of international standards. \nTheir ambition is to win a trip to paradise by killing infidels--\nkilling Americans.\n  On September 11, we learned how little these new adversaries need to \nlaunch a terrorist strike within our homeland. A terrorist organization \nrequires only the ability to recruit people motivated by zealotry, \ngenerally religious fervor. They need someone trained in the particular \nskills of a specific method of attack, such as detonating a truck bomb \nor hijacking a commercial jetliner. They need a relatively small amount \nof financial support from internal or external sources. They need the \nability to place operatives around the world, including in the United \nStates of America. And they need a command-and-control system capable \nof developing the plot and then sending the signal for its initiation.\n  Our efforts against al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan have been \nexemplary. But the United States today faces more deadly battles in the \nfuture as we move to the next phase of the war on terror. For the last \nmonth, we have been debating--and I hope it will shortly pass--\nlegislation to create a new Department of Homeland Security. That is a \ngood thing. But the creation of that new Department will not guarantee \nthe security of the American people.\n  The most effective defense against terrorism is not to be found on \nthe defense, as we attempt to protect our vulnerabilities but, rather, \nan aggressive offense against terrorist organizations abroad, taking \nthe fight to them where they live. We must chop the head off the snake \nbefore it has a chance to strike us.\n  As we move beyond al-Qaida and the Taliban, the terrorist \norganizations that we must target are more mature, better organized, \nand more competent. The most prominent example is Hezbollah, the Party \nof God. Hezbollah has been described as the A-team of international \nterrorists--more dangerous than even al-Qaida.\n  Prior to September 11, Hezbollah, through its terrorist wing, the \nIslamic Jihad Organization, had killed more Americans, by far, than any \nother terrorist organization in the world. The bombing of U.S. Marine \nCorps barracks in Beirut, the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, \nthe hijacking of TWA flight 847, numerous other brutal kidnappings and \nmurders of Americans, all were the work of Hezbollah's Islamic Jihad \nOrganization, as were other acts of terrorism where the link to \nHezbollah remains classified.\n  On July 4 of this year, with Senators DeWine and Bayh, I stood on the \nfront\n\n[[Page S9969]]\n\nlawn of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut. We laid a wreath on a newly \nconstructed plat. That plat contained the names of hundreds of \nAmericans who have died in Lebanon at the hands of Hezbollah.\n  Hezbollah is vehemently opposed to United States policy in the Middle \nEast, and it is allied with the most extreme anti-American elements in \nIran and Syria. Iran and Syria provide support, training, and weapons \nto Hezbollah, and both of these countries have weapons of mass \ndestruction that they could provide to Hezbollah.\n  Hezbollah also operates terrorist training camps in Iran, Syria, and \nSyrian-controlled parts of Lebanon that are preparing the next \ngeneration of terrorists.\n  If there is one lesson we have learned from Afghanistan, it is the \ngrave mistake we committed in allowing Osama bin Laden's terrorist \ntraining camps to operate for years, preparing thousands of terrorists, \nmany of whom carried out the attacks against Americans, including the \ntragedy of September 11.\n  What is it going to take to achieve victory in the war on terrorism? \nIt is going to require a united and sustained effort that is based on a \nrealistic understanding of the scale and capability of our terrorist \nadversaries such as Hezbollah. It is going to require the active \nsupport, or at least the avoidance of active hostility, in those \ncountries in which the war is going to be waged.\n  Just as we needed Pakistan's cooperation to fight al-Qaida and the \nTaliban in Afghanistan, we will need the assistance of other nations, \nmany of them predominantly Muslim nations, as we move against these \nadditional targets. And it is going to take action by Congress, action \nto authorize the President to use all necessary force against \ninternational terrorists.\n  One might ask: Haven't we already done that? Didn't we do that on \nSeptember 18, 2001? We did, in fact, pass a joint resolution that day. \nWe gave the President this authority:\n\n       . . . to use all necessary and appropriate force against \n     those nations, organizations, or persons he determines \n     planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist \n     attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such \n     organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts \n     of international terrorism against the United States by such \n     nations, organizations, or persons.\n\n  That is the authority that we have granted to the President. What we \nhave not granted to the President is the full authority which he sought \non September 18, which was the authority to go not only after those \norganizations, nations, and persons who had been directly linked to the \nevents of September 11, but also against other international terrorist \ngroups which, in his words, ``required action to deter and preempt any \nfuture acts of terrorism or aggression against the United States.''\n  In my judgment--and I am pleased to say I am joined by Senator \nRockefeller in this determination--now is the time to extend the \nauthority of the President to go after all terrorist groups, those that \nwere linked specifically to the actions of September 11, such as al-\nQaida, and those that, in my judgment, represent an equally or possibly \ngreater threat to the United States, such as Hezbollah, which were not \ninvolved in the events of September 11.\n  The State Department has identified 34 groups on its list of foreign \nterrorist organizations. Two-thirds of those 34 groups have their \nheadquarters in the Middle East or central Asia. The State Department \nhas also listed seven countries as state sponsors of terrorism. Five of \nthose seven--Iraq, Iran, Libya, Sudan, and Syria--are in this same \nregion.\n  What the President is proposing today might be called an Iraq-first \npolicy. I am concerned that a war with Saddam Hussein would be waged to \nthe exclusion of or possibly to the detriment of the war on terrorism. \nThere are indications that there has been a shift of focus already \noccurring.\n  There have been reports of reduction in our intensity of efforts in \nAfghanistan as intelligence and military resources, particularly the \nattention of the leadership of the intelligence community and the \nDefense Department, have turned to Iraq.\n  A Washington Post story in late August has an anecdote on this and \nquoted Chief Warrant Officer Mike Smith complaining of inactivity in \nAfghanistan:\n\n       It's so boring. We're trying to figure out what we're still \n     doing here.\n\n  A second concern is that as a consequence of the threat to take \nunilateral action against Iraq, we have seen a hardening of anti-\nAmerican sentiment in the Middle East, which puts U.S. persons and \ninterests in the region at greater jeopardy.\n\n  Finally, with the significant capacity that groups such as Hezbollah \nhave within our country, within our borders, war with Iraq increases \nthe chances that they will strike in our homeland. Like al-Qaida, \nHezbollah has active cells within our borders, only more so. I cannot \ndiscuss the numbers and locations, but I can tell you, Mr. President, \nthey have significant numbers and substantial capabilities. Therefore, \nwe need to prepare not just for a war with Iraq, but for a broader war \non international terrorism.\n  Let me be clear, the proposal that Senator Rockefeller and I will \noffer next week at the appropriate time is not a reduction of the \nPresident's authority. To the contrary. It represents an expansion. It \nwill authorize all necessary action against those international \nterrorist organizations which represent a threat to kill Americans. \nThis is what the President had requested on September 12, 2001. This, \nin my judgment, is what we should give to the President. It will then \nbe the judgment of the President to determine which of the authorities \nhe will utilize--the resolution of September 18 that gave him the \nauthority to move with necessary force against those responsible for \nSeptember 11; the resolution that I hope we will adopt through this \namendment to extend that to other international terrorist groups which \nthreaten the people of the United States but were not part of the \nSeptember 11 plot; as well as whatever resolution we may adopt--and I \nam confident we will adopt one--relative to Iraq.\n  Then it will be the responsibility of the President to exercise his \njudgment as to which of these authorities he wishes to use, in what \nsequence, in what relative level of commitment, and he will be \naccountable for his judgment.\n  At a minimum, we need the President to initiate actions that prepare \nus to respond to those who would use a war with Iraq as a justification \nto escalate their attacks on Americans here at home and abroad.\n  As the President begins to exercise his judgment with these expanded \nauthorities, I want him to have the capability to wage war as he sees \nmost appropriate to give to the American people the greatest degree of \nprotection that they can have in these days of threat.\n  Of all the terrorist organizations and their sponsors, as well as the \nregime that now controls Iraq, there should be a single message: \nAmerica is resolute; America is united; America is prepared to do what \nis required to assure the safety and security of its people. I thank \nthe Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wish the occupant of the Chair a good afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I wish to call my colleagues' attention to a situation \nassociated with our increasing dependence on Iraq. Let me share with \nyou a picture of Saddam Hussein, who is no stranger to this body. The \ntitle is: ``Oil as a Weapon.''\n  As we address the disposition of the resolution which the President \nhas sent up to this body for action, we should recognize a few hard \nrealities, and that is oil is funding terrorism, oil is funding the \neconomy of Iraq, in spite of the efforts through the United Nations to \ntry and control that funding, and the inconsistency of our policy where \nwe are increasing our dependence on Iraqi oil, even at a time when we \nare contemplating going to war with Iraq, is indeed an inconsistency of \na magnitude to which I think more Members should relate.\n  If one reflects on the number of sorties we have flown over a period \nof time starting in 2000, even though we have been enforcing the no-fly \nzone since about 1992, Iraqi forces fired at Allied forces 642 \nengagements in 2000; 647 in 2001; and 480 times so far this year.\n  What is happening is we are enforcing the no-fly zone. Allied forces \nreturned fire 46 times so far this year. In the last weekend alone, \nIraqi forces\n\n[[Page S9970]]\n\nshot at allied forces 14 times. Iraqi forces have fired anti-aircraft \nartillery over 1,100 times, 600-some-odd rockets, fired nearly 60 \nsurface-to-air missiles. This is not a game we are playing. We are \nbasically in a limited war.\n  To administer the no-fly zone, more than 6,400 personnel and almost \n200 aircraft from the United States and Great Britain are involved in \nOperation Northern and Southern Watch. As Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld \nsaid, with each missile launched at our aircrews, Iraq expresses its \ncontempt for the U.N. resolutions, a fact that must be kept in mind as \ntheir latest inspection offers are evaluated.\n  I cannot begin to reflect on how many times we have heard the promise \nfrom the Iraqis and Saddam that he was going to allow inspectors to \ncome in. Prior to the Persian Gulf war, I was over there with a number \nof Senators. Senator Dole was with us. We had an opportunity to have a \nshort meeting with Saddam Hussein. It was clear then that he was a very \nruthless, unpredictable, dangerous individual. At that time, he was \nattempting to ship in a very large cannon from the docks of London into \nIraq with the capability of launching a long-range projectile.\n  In the meeting, he dismissed that. He said it was parts for his \nrefineries. The triggering mechanism was dismissed.\n  I recall Senator Metzenbaum was talking to him about some of the \nhuman rights issues going on in Iraq. He took us out on the balcony and \nsaid: There are five of you and there are five helicopters. Go anywhere \nyou want in Iraq. We happened to be up in Mousala at that time. \nObviously, we declined.\n  We have been dealing with this despot for an extended period of time. \nIn the meantime, he has been developing weapons of mass destruction, as \nevidenced by another chart. It indicates the manner in which he \ngenerates this cashflow because without the cashflow, we all know his \ncountry cannot exist. This is the importation from Iraq during the \nfirst half of the year 2002, 600,000 barrels a day. That is an average \nprice of $20. We know he is getting nearly $28 now.\n  The point is, the U.S. is spending about $12.5 million each day by \nbuying Iraqi oil; total U.S. dollars on oil from Iraq is $2.3 billion. \nThose reflect, on the average price, a little over $20. The source of \nthis is from the Energy Information Administration.\n  The occupant of the chair and I have some knowledge of finance. Cut \noff the cashflow of a country or an individual and you bring them to \ntheir knees. When you continue to buy their product, why obviously they \ncontinue to prosper.\n  There is another chart that shows basically how American families are \ncounting on energy from Saddam Hussein. This is a list of the Persian \nGulf countries that are producing oil. Iraq's production is a little \nover 1 million barrels a day, but it is the fastest growing source, at \nleast it has been up until a short time ago, of U.S. oil imports.\n  The reason I go into some length on this is to again draw the \nattention of the inconsistency while we enforce no-fly zones, we buy \nhis oil. We take the oil and put it in our airplanes. We bomb his \ntargets. My colleagues have heard me time and again draw this \ncomparison. He takes our money that we pay him for the oil, develops \nweapons of mass destruction, chemical weapons, biological weapons, \nnuclear capabilities, that he is developing obviously, and he is \nspending funds on developing a delivery capability that aims at our \nally, Israel. That is an oversimplification, perhaps, but nevertheless \none can draw that general conclusion.\n\n  Today, we are beginning a very important debate on a resolution that \nwe give our President whatever means are necessary to combat this \nthreat to world peace and bring terrorists to their knees. I think \nthere are going to be a couple of proposals that we are going to \nevaluate, but I am personally quite satisfied with the President's \nproposal.\n  As we address this growing threat, we have to recognize we are \ndealing with an individual who simply cannot afford to step down \nvoluntarily and depart the scene. We are dealing with an individual who \nhas been around for a while. He is tough. He has taken out his family. \nHe has taken out his own people. One can almost conclude that to some \nextent he is prepared to continue what was started on September 11 in \nthis country.\n  Now, we can wait. We can react after the fact. Had we known what al-\nQaida was up to, clearly we would have initiated an action prior to the \ntragic event of the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, and the tragedy in \nPennsylvania. We would have initiated an action. We did not know. We \ndid not have the intelligence. Now we are reflecting on what is going \nto cause us to act. Is it going to be a recognition that he is a \nthreat, that he does train the al-Qaida, that he does fund the \nterrorists?\n  At a certain point in time we have to face the reality: How would we \nfeel leaving this session of the Congress without an action, and then \nfind that he initiated an action and took lives? We would feel we had \nbeen derelict in our obligation.\n  I think we have learned that Saddam has developed more capabilities. \nHe has pilotless drones capable of spreading chemical weapons. We have \nlearned that Saddam sends young men and women, as young as 13, to boot \ncamp to learn to be soldiers under the guise of a program to keep the \nkids supposedly off the streets.\n  Now, if we look back, In June of 1981, and this is going to be said \nmany times on this floor, Israel's Prime Minister Begin observed Saddam \nbuilding a military reactor with the help of the French. It was called \nthe Osiraq reactor, a reactor capable of producing nuclear weapons. \nFour Israeli aircraft launched a surprise, preemptive attack, \ndestroying the reactor and obviously setting back the Iraqi weapons \nprogram for many years.\n  There was criticism from the world, but a decade later, during the \ngulf war, allied forces did not face a nuclear weapon capability from \nIraq.\n  The ways of addressing Saddam Hussein, I think, are the firmness of \nthe President in his communication that we demand unlimited access \nthroughout Iraq to our total satisfaction. I do not think Saddam \nHussein is going to give it to us. On the other hand, I do not think \nSaddam Hussein is going to step down.\n  We can try to develop an area of insecurity surrounding Saddam \nHussein, but we have tried that time and again and he has been quite \nresponsive in taking out those who he believed are not responsive to \nhis whims or his demands.\n  I suggest one of the first things we should do is not only initiate \nthis particular action that has been set up by our President, but we \nshould simply cut off the purchase of oil from Saddam Hussein. Some \nwill argue that means somebody else is going to buy Saddam Hussein's \noil and we are going to have to buy somebody else's, but there is a \nprinciple.\n  I have an amendment that is part of the energy bill which I think \nshould be passed by this body and that is simply to terminate oil \nimports into the United States from Saddam Hussein.\n  Where does this oil go? This chart shows, Washington, California, \nTexas; a fair smattering of the country. It moves around because there \nis a market for it. No one cares whose oil is in their furnace or whose \noil is refined into gasoline and propels their automobile. It is not \nmuch of a concern. Minnesota, New Jersey, name it, those are particular \nStates that are getting oil from Iraq.\n  As we address a situation relative to what we know about Saddam \nHussein today, we have to develop from this knowledge a certain \nrecognition that if he is not going to use the capabilities he has \ndeveloped, then why is he developing them? Who is at risk from the \nstandpoint of the 22,500 gallons of anthrax? We have had experience \nwith anthrax around here. Or 100,000 gallons of toxin that causes \nbotulism. Or 200 tons of VX nerve gas. Or 350 tons of sarin gas. Or 800 \ntons of mustard gas. Those are weapons of mass destruction. They are \nweapons of terror. They cause agonizing death.\n  Are these the weapons a country would use to defend itself? Are these \nthe weapons of an aggressor that would go to whatever means is \nnecessary to prevail or fund the developing aspects of world terrorism? \nThe answer is very clear. Saddam Hussein is our enemy. The world must \nisolate him, cut him off, and hopefully coax his regime to an end.\n\n[[Page S9971]]\n\n  The battlefield is one option. Diplomacy is another. We have had \nexperience with both. We should be setting an example. The first thing \nwe should do as the United States--the world leader everyone is looking \ntoward to accomplish a regime change in Saddam Hussein and resolve our \nconcern over the development of his weapons of mass destruction--is to \ncut off his cash flow. The fact we continue to engage in the \nimportation of oil from Iraq is a grave mistake. It is a great \ninconsistency of foreign policy. I hope as we address the disposition \nof the energy bill, the first thing we will do will be to terminate our \npurchases from Saddam Hussein.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will make a few remarks on the status \nof the energy bill. As we know, our President earlier stated one of his \npriorities was Congress should pass an energy bill. The House of \nRepresentatives has done its job. It passed a bill. The bill has been \nsent over to the Senate. We have been to conference, and had a number \nof meetings associated with the items in that bill. Many of those items \nare contentious. On the other hand, that is what a conference is all \nabout: Solving, compromising, whether it is electricity or renewable \nportfolio standards, climate change, producing more oil from my State \nof Alaska by opening up ANWR, or whether it is stimulating the \nagricultural industry and the farm industry of this State through the \nethanol. We need a substantial mandate to increase the use of ethanol.\n  It is important to recognize one specific offer that was made. That I \nwill go into some detail. It reflects as much of an inconsistency \nregarding our dependence on imported oil and an opportunity we have in \nthe United States to develop a significant potential of oil on U.S. \nland known as ANWR.\n  This chart shows in some detail a couple of realities. One is the \nlarge area called the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. That is the ANWR \narea. It is 19 million acres, about the size of the State of South \nCarolina. There is ANWR in relationship to the State of Alaska. On the \nleft is the TransAlaska pipeline, 800 miles long, from Prudhoe Bay to \nValdez, carrying about 17 to 20 to 23 percent of the total crude oil \nproduced in this Nation for the last roughly 23 years. That pipeline \nwas designed to flow at about 2 million barrels a day. It is flowing a \nlittle over 1 million barrels a day. So there is additional capacity.\n  In the green area, the area that is proposed for any development, \nwhich is called the coastal plain, the estimated reserves there are \nsomewhere between 5.6 and 16 billion barrels. If it were half that, if \nit were 10 billion barrels, it would be equal to what we import \ncurrently from Iraq in a period of 40 years, or equal to what we import \nfrom Saudi Arabia in 30 years. We do not know if it is there. But this \nis Federal land, and we have an opportunity to make a decision because \nthere is an offer that has been made by the House to the Senate. The \noffer has been specifically to take the whole area colored in the buff \nand put it into a wilderness. This would be the largest wilderness ever \ncreated in the United States. Currently, the area of wilderness colored \nlight buff on the chart is approximately 9 million acres. The area \ncolored darker buff is a refuge. The proposal is to take that refuge of \n10 million acres, add it to the wilderness, and then there will be a \nwilderness area of almost 17 million acres. That would again be the \nlargest wilderness area in the United States.\n  It is hard to make a comparison. We currently have 57 million acres \nof wilderness in our State, and we would be adding another 10 million \nacres of wilderness.\n  The point is this is an offer that is pending. I cannot help but \nreflect on periodicals addressing what else is going on in the energy \nworld. A release indicates our Department of Energy and the President \nissued a special Presidential permit for energy plants powered by \nnatural gas piped from Texas, cooled with Mexican sewage, and linked to \nCalifornia's energy grid next year. The plants will be built in Mexico.\n  A New York Times article called ``Japan Looks to Eastern Russia for \nRelief of Oil.'' The last paragraph says there is expended a commitment \nto expend about $13 billion that ordinarily would go into Alaska.\n\n       With about $2 billion scheduled to be spent on development \n     on this island every year until the end of the decade, \n     Sakhalin's 591,000 residents are bracing for a major boom.\n       \"Come next summer, and we are going to hit a logjam of--\n     cargo, airplanes, hotels, you name it,'' predicted James R. \n     Sexton, an American business consultant who has worked here \n     for the last decade.\n\n  It's exciting times, just like Alaska was decades ago.''\n  As one of the settlers of Alaska, I have a particular sensitivity to \nthat because what the American oil industry is doing is simply moving \noffshore. If we have the infrastructure but we can't open the area, \nclearly we will go offshore.\n  The irony here--and it is very apparent--is just what constitutes \nthis offer and why there is a lack of consideration for the merits of \nthe offer. This would create the largest wilderness area in the United \nStates. The amendment by the House, sent to the Senate conferees, would \nincrease the total wilderness in ANWR to 17.4 million acres, the \nlargest in the United States. The designated area is in the southern \nportion of the refuge, which actually has more species than the Coastal \nPlain, and the area is not as barren as the Coastal Plain.\n  Basically, the proponents argue that for a couple of thousand acres \nof surface disturbance, the Greenies, so to speak, are getting 10.2 \nmillion acres of additional wilderness. This is an offer of 10.2 \nmillion acres for 2,000 acres because that is the footprint allowed in \nthe House bill. The House bill says, out of that green area of 1.5 \nmillion acres, there can only be 2,000 acres dedicated to the footprint \nof developing the oil.\n  So what the tradeoff is, is 10.2 million acres of additional \nwilderness, this whole thing, for the authority to go in and initiate \nan exploration in ANWR. It would have a mandate of only 2,000 acres. \nThat is a pretty good trade, if you are trading acres for acres.\n  On the other hand, it is my understanding the environmental community \nis not buying. Why are they not buying? Some might say they have an \nissue. Some might say that once they concede to this offer, it would \nshow that their effort to stop any development in the Arctic would be \nterminated and development could go ahead. But if you recognize in \nexchange for 2,000 acres of surface disturbance you are adding 10.2 \nmillion acres to the wilderness areas--this happens to be the Mollie \nBeattie Wilderness Area in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve--\nclearly you have to look at just what you are getting for that.\n  This area is distinctly different from the area along the barren \ncoastal plains, with high mountains, with headwaters, valleys, \nglaciers. There is more of an abundance of species--moose, caribou, \nsnow geese, ducks, woodpeckers, all kinds of activities given the \nvarious species.\n  From a strictly regional point of view, in 1980, when they divided up \nAlaska's lands and designated Federal land areas, Congress established \nat that time 13 new national parks, 16 wildlife refuges, and 2 national \nforests in Alaska as part of the 56 million acres of wilderness that \nwas designated. As a matter of fact, the State of Alaska has currently \n16 percent of the landmass of our State as a wilderness. This is well \nover half of the Nation's entire wilderness area, we are talking about, \nif they accept the offer of that 810 million acres. We already have the \nlargest park, 9.7 million acres.\n  But here we are today, talking about war with Iraq, war over oil. We \nare talking about sending our corporations to Russia, to Sakhalin, to \nMexico, to develop the oil we need. And right here at home we have an \nopportunity to stimulate the economy with U.S. jobs, somewhere between \n200,000 and 500,000 jobs according the unions, building 19 new \nsupertankers in U.S. shipyards that employ U.S. trades and U.S. skills, \nbecause the carriage of this oil has to move in U.S. flag vessels as it \nmoves down from Alaska to the west coast of the United States.\n  I am deeply disappointed that the Senate conferees, the majority on \nthe other side, are not taking this offer seriously, of 10.2 million \nacres of additional wilderness for the rights to go in and initiate a \ndrilling program to see if, indeed, there is oil of the abundance there \nwould have to be there to go over and fill that pipeline that is \nalready there.\n\n[[Page S9972]]\n\n  I want to walk you briefly through a couple of things that a lot of \npeople do not understand; that is, the implication of what refuges are. \nRefuges, as evidenced by the charts we have here, indicate activity. \nThese are refuges in Alabama, California, Louisiana, Oklahoma. These \nare areas in national wildlife refuges, in wetland management districts \nwhere oil and gas are currently being produced.\n  In North Dakota, Montana, California, and specifically this map shows \nthe States and the number of refuges where oil production takes place: \nCalifornia, Texas--we have one in Alaska, I might add.\n  The point is, what we have in ANWR is a refuge. Congress has the \nauthority to open it, just like it is opened in other areas. So we are \nnot breaking any commitments here or setting any new precedents. It is \nsimply a matter about which the House has made a proposal.\n  I might add, there are other limitations in the authorization that \nwould require that the Secretary can close down any exploration if, \nindeed, there is any disturbance associated with the calving of the \ncaribou. The development activity would occur only in the wintertime. \nAnd the safeguards that are taken in the authorization proposed by the \nHouse are more stringent than exist in any other part of the world.\n  I am going to go through a few other charts. I want to give you some \nidea of what we have done to this country and, in effect, to our \nnational security.\n  If you look at the west coast--Washington, Oregon, California, that \ngray area--that is estimated to hold 21 trillion cubic feet of gas \noffshore. We have taken this and put it off limits. We have taken the \neast coast, from Maine to Florida, 31 trillion cubic feet as evidenced \nby the dark blue, and said no oil and gas activity off the east coast.\n  In the Gulf of Florida, we have taken that away on the lease sale. In \nthe overthrust belt of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, we have taken that \nout because we require roadless areas in the parks.\n  Where is the energy going to come from? Is it going to come from the \nMideast where they have what we cannot have in this country, and that \nis a cartel? What do you think OPEC is? Most Members recognize it is a \ncartel. A cartel sets a price; they set a floor and set a ceiling; it \nis $22 to $28; today it is a little over $28. Our antitrust laws would \nnot allow it.\n  But what is the largest consumer of oil in the word? The United \nStates. And we import most of it from the OPEC countries, and, as a \nconsequence, we are becoming more and more beholden to them. We are \ncurrently importing about 55, 56 percent of our oil from overseas. Yet \nwe have the opportunity to develop that right here at home.\n  There are some people who assume this area in ANWR is an untouched \narea. There is the picture of the community that is there. That is a \npicture of Kaktovik. It is a very small Native community, Eskimo \ncommunity, on the shores of the Arctic Ocean. You can see the ice out \nthere. There are a couple of radar towers, a school, small stores. \nThere is a landing facility. Real people live there. There are some of \nthe kids. This is one of the community halls. They have the same dreams \nand aspirations. They are on a snow machine. There are a couple of kids \ngoing to school.\n  My point is to suggest that somehow this is a untapped, unspoiled \narea--it is an extraordinarily hostile area. Joe is going to take a \nchart and turn it around and show you what it looks like in the \nwintertime. This is what it looks like in the wintertime. I am not \nexaggerating, it could be 40 or 50 below and you have what you call a \nwhiteout condition. This is what it looks like.\n  Here is some of the harsh tundra in the wintertime. It is tough--\ntough. Temperatures are 40 or 50 below zero.\n  Let me show you the technology that has been developed by the \nindustry in this particular area of North America.\n  There is an oil exploration program going on. You notice there are no \ngravel pits. There are no ordinary roads going in because what we have \nis technology that has been developed particularly for the Arctic where \nwe can directionally drill. You don't just drill one hole with a rig \nlike that. This was in the science portion of the New York Times. We \ndirectionally drill. We have 3-d sysmics that allow us to make visual \ncuts, if you will, through a technology to see these small pockets. You \nsee these directional drills coming down in the black pockets. In \nordinary times, you would drill straight down and hope to hit \nsomething.\n  This technology has been compared to drilling a well here on the \nCapitol grounds and come up at gate 7 at Reagan National Airport. That \nkind of technology is what is used.\n  I want to show you some more pictures of the Arctic and the ice \nroads. This is an ice road. An ice road is simply a situation where the \nsnow is removed from the surface, and water is put down to make a hard-\npacked road.\n  I cite that because this is the kind of activity that we are seeing \nmove from the United States and move over to the Soviet Union. There is \nno reason why, since we have the likelihood of these discoveries being \nmade here in the United States--for the life of me--we shouldn't \nconsider the merits offered by the conferees of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  There are a couple of others that I want to show you. This one shows \nanother resource that we have a great abundance of; that is, corn. The \nreference to corn and energy is ethanol. It takes roughly 2,000 acres \nof a corn-producing farm to produce the equivalent of 25 barrels of oil \na day. If we look at the footprint, we are talking about a significant \nfootprint. Two-thousand acres of ANWR can produce a million barrels of \noil in a day. I just offer that comparison.\n  I am going to conclude with some charts that we have seen from time \nto time because people are concerned about the wildlife in the area. \nThis happens to be Prudhoe Bay. There is a rig. You see the caribou. \nThey are not stuffed. They are real. They are there because they are \nnot threatened. They are not harmed or run down with snow machines. As \nlong as they have that security from any predators--which are, of \ncourse, naturally the wolves--they feel quite comfortable in their \nnative surroundings as they pass through in a migratory manner.\n  Here are a few pictures we have seen from time to time. These are \nthree bears walking on the pipeline because it is much better than \nwalking in the snow.\n  It is beyond my comprehension why we are allowing ourselves to simply \npass over what the House of Representatives has proposed; that is, a \n2,000-acre limitation proposed in allowing exploration in ANWR.\n  In addition, there is a proposal to add 10 million acres to the \nwilderness. It has received virtually no consideration by America's \nenvironmental community. They evidently aren't interested in more \nwilderness. They only seem to be interested in killing an opportunity \nto develop this reserve which would reduce our dependence on imported \nenergy.\n  Some say, well, it is going to take several years. I remind my \ncolleagues that in 1995 this body passed out a bill in the Omnibus Act \nthat authorized the opening of ANWR. It was vetoed by our President at \nthat time. We would know today. We would have production today. When we \ntalk about a timeframe, it is all relative to when you start.\n  The fact that we have the infrastructure in the pipeline, and the \npipeline is half full, and we have the prospects here of a major \ndiscovery, we could stimulate the American economy with new jobs more \nthan any other single action that could be contemplated because this is \na big jobs issues. It is steel, it is valves, and it is the things that \nare produced all over the United States. It takes the technical skill \nof U.S. labor and U.S. wherewithal and knowhow to do it. The industry \nstands ready. Only Congress can make the decision. The time to make \nthat decision is clearly now while we have the opportunity. There is no \nlogical reason to suggest that this isn't a good proposal and it \nshouldn't be considered. I am just fearful that it will be ignored. \nThat would, indeed, be tragic.\n\n  I encourage my colleagues and those listening to this debate to \nreflect a little bit on this opportunity. If we go out of session and \ndon't take advantage of this opportunity and continue to import oil \nfrom Iraq at a time when we are contemplating going into a conflict \nwith Iraq, I think future historians will\n\n[[Page S9973]]\n\nregard this as a very irresponsible action by the Senate--because, \nsomeday, we all know we will go in there. It is just a question of \ntime. Clearly, this is an appropriate time when we are contemplating \naction.\n  I remind my colleagues, in conclusion, of one thought that I think \ncaptures the realization that we are going to continue to use a great \nabundance of oil. While we have other means of power generation, \nwhether it be nuclear, hydro, natural gas, or coal, the world moves on \noil. We don't move in and out of here on hot air. Something has to go \nin there to fuel the trucks and to fuel the trains. It is just not the \ngrowth in the United States. It is the growth of the world and the \nThird World nations. As they become more and more advanced, they are \ngoing to use more and more oil.\n  We are cutting ourselves short from the standpoint of our national \nsecurity, if, indeed, we pass up this opportunity to add an additional \n10 million acres to the wilderness associated with ANWR with the \ntradeoff. We are only opening 2,000 acres. I think any one of us could \ntake this on a bet. But for some reason or another, there is not enough \npressure on America's environmental community to consider this proposal \non the merits.\n  I hope that our friends in the Israeli lobby will reflect a little \nbit on this because the threat to Israel is directly related to the \ncashflow associated with oil production from the OPEC nations, and \nparticularly Iraq.\n  I thank the President for his attention. I wish him a very pleasant \nweekend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I would like to say at the end of \na long day on a Friday that I thank the Chair. I know he has been doing \ndouble duty today. My good friend is someone who I know has been very \ndiligent in his responsibilities. We appreciate the fact that the \nSenator from Minnesota has been willing to serve his duty today; and to \nall of the staff. I appreciate your attention at the end of a long day.\n  Mr. President, I rise to address the issue of importance of the day--\nI think it is important to all of us and to our country--the issue of \ntaking military action against Iraq.\n  As Members of Congress, the most important vote that we cast is one \nthat will place American troops in harm's way. The issue of war and \npeace is a burden of responsibility that lies heavy upon me, as well as \neach and every one of my esteemed colleagues.\n  This is a vote of conscience, and also a vote of historic \nconsequence because what we debate and decide here will not only \nsignificantly affect this great Nation but will immediately influence \nglobal events for years to come.\n\n  No matter how difficult the decision may be, it is one that each of \nus must make for the sake of our country. We have an obligation and \nduty to carefully weigh the demands and the consequences of a \npreemptive attack. Before we engage in war, we must understand the \nresults of war are irrevocable, and peaceful solutions should always be \nour first choice.\n  I have carefully listened to the President and key members of his \nadministration. I have asked many questions. I have read extensive \ninformation and listened to the people in my own great State of \nMichigan.\n  Just as important, I have had many conversations with men and women \nof our armed services who, as we speak, are gallantly serving to \nprotect and defend our American way of life.\n  The issue before the Senate is not whether the regime of Saddam \nHussein is good or evil. We know, in fact, that he is a despicable \ndictator. He has gassed and poisoned thousands of his own people. He \nrules not by choice but by decree, backed by brutal force, and he \nblatantly defies United Nations resolutions by his continual \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction. I strongly oppose his \nregime. He is a growing threat to the United States and our allies, and \nhis policies have devastated the lives of his own Iraqi people.\n  I am convinced that the United States and the world would be safer if \nthis regime were replaced with a democratic form of government that \nwould work in a constructive manner with the world community and focus \non bringing peace and prosperity to millions of Iraqi citizens.\n  The question--the question--before the Senate is not whether or not \nwe support or trust the regime of the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, \nbut how the United States will counter the threat, how we will counter \nthe threat of Saddam Hussein to our citizens and the citizens of his \nown country.\n  The questions that must be asked are: Does the Congress stand ready \nto alter the historic precedents that have guided our Nation for over \n200 years? Is it in our national interest to change our policy of \ndeterrence and arms control to a policy that accepts a preemptive \nstrike on another country as a legitimate way to defend ourselves \nagainst regimes suspected of having weapons of mass destruction? And, \nunder what circumstances should such a preemptive strike against \nanother country be authorized?\n  These are serious, grave questions.\n  In mapping out our course of action against Iraq, it is essential \nthat we draw on lessons and successes of the past.\n  Our response to the September 11 attacks united our Nation. We \nachieved the support of our allies and the backing of the United \nNations in our retaliatory attacks on al-Qaida forces and the Taliban. \nIn a short time, our Armed Forces, working with our allies, toppled the \nTaliban and sent al-Qaida fleeing from their training camps.\n  Iraq, in many ways, is different. Nonetheless, it serves as an \nimportant model for proceeding with effective military action when it \nis required.\n  Before we invaded Afghanistan, we put together a worldwide effort to \neffectively prosecute the war on terrorism.\n  Consider all that we were able to do to put together a partnership \nagainst terrorism.\n  Mr. President, 136 countries offered the United States a range of \nmilitary assistance. The U.N. has received 46 multilateral declarations \nof support from organizations. The U.N. General Assembly and Security \nCouncil condemned the attacks on September 12, just the day after. \nNATO, OAS, and ANZUS--the Australian, New Zealand, and U.S. \ncoalitions--quickly invoked their treaty obligations to support the \nUnited States. Our NATO allies are assisting directly in the defense of \nAmerican territory. Also, 142 countries have issued orders freezing the \nassets of suspected terrorists and organizations. Mr. President, 89 \ncountries have granted overflight authority for U.S. military aircraft. \nIn addition, 76 countries have granted landing rights for U.S. military \naircraft. And 23 countries have agreed to host U.S. forces involved in \noffensive operations.\n\n  This is impressive work. I congratulate President Bush and his \nadministration for their efforts in putting together this impressive \ncoalition.\n  In addition to this most recent success in Afghanistan, any planned \naction against Iraq has an excellent model in the alliance we formed \nagainst Saddam Hussein after his invasion of Kuwait in 1990.\n  In the Persian Gulf war, former President Bush worked arduously to \nassemble a large coalition of countries to support our efforts to oust \nthe Iraqi army from Kuwait. Consider all of the countries which \nsupported us in 1990 and 1991: Afghanistan, Argentina, Australia, \nBahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Egypt, \nFrance, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Honduras, Italy, Kuwait, Morocco, the \nNetherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, \nPortugal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Korea, Spain, Syria, \nTurkey, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.\n  A myriad of nations, each different in their own way, separated by \nreligion, political system, economics and culture, but united in common \ncause at the same time. This coalition was critical to our success. The \nground war was over in 3 days. Our coalition stayed together after the \ngulf war to try to keep a check on Saddam Hussein, and the United \nNations passed resolutions prohibiting him from developing weapons of \nmass destruction, oppressing his own people, and beginning another \nmilitary and terrorist buildup.\n  Unfortunately, Saddam Hussein did not adhere to these resolutions, \nand the inspectors left Iraq 4 years ago.\n\n[[Page S9974]]\n\nHowever, we have contained him, which is no small achievement.\n  Now we must confront his failure to live up to these U.N. \nresolutions. I congratulate President Bush for going to the United \nNations and speaking out on September 12. As a result, the U.N. and \nnegotiators are now working on a new resolution, a stronger resolution, \nto enforce the existing U.N. resolutions against Iraq.\n  We should adopt the same approach for dealing with the threats of \nSaddam Hussein's evil regime as we did during the Persian Gulf war and \nthe war on terrorism, which is still ongoing. It worked, and we need to \ndo it again. It only makes sense to build upon the successes learned \nduring past military campaigns. There are many nations that equally \nrevile Saddam Hussein's regime and all he represents.\n  I firmly believe the United States has ample will and strength to \nform a similar coalition. Unfortunately, the administration seems to be \nheaded in the exact opposite direction. President Bush has expressed \nhis desire to take unilateral, preemptive action against Iraq, in sharp \ncontrast to the manner in which his father led us into the Persian Gulf \nwar.\n  The President proposes to change a policy that has been in place \nsince the founding of our country, that we do not invade sovereign \ncountries without direct provocation. I have grave concern the \nadministration's resolution authorizes the use of preemptive, \nunilateral U.S. force without the participation of partners in the war \nagainst terrorism. If we do authorize preemptive, unilateral force, \nthere could be grave consequences for our actions.\n  First, we could lose much, if not all, of the support of our partners \nin the war against terrorism. We could lose access to military \nfacilities in and around Afghanistan. We could lose the support of \nPakistan, which recently helped us arrest some leaders of al-Qaida. In \nall, Pakistani authorities have detained 402 al-Qaida members. We are \nalso receiving military and intelligence support in the war on \nterrorism from many other Muslim countries. Obviously, a unilateral \nattack on Iraq could sour, if not ruin, all of these relationships and \nundermine our efforts in the war on terrorism.\n  Furthermore, such an attack would likely reenergize al-Qaida \nsympathizers across the globe. According to former NATO General Wesley \nClark, a military strike of this nature would ``supercharge recruiting \nfor al-Qaida.''\n  In more ways than one, a unilateral attack could weaken our chances \nto continue to dismantle al-Qaida's network and bring Osama bin Laden \nto justice. There are many other critical questions that need to be \nanswered. Given the widely supported belief that Saddam Hussein has \nbiological and chemical weapons, how do we assure he will not use them \nagainst us when we attack him first?\n  There is also more than a great possibility this would have to be a \nground war. Would our soldiers be attacked with these weapons? Would \nIsrael be attacked with chemical weapons? Would Saddam give his \nstockpile to terrorists? Will an attack by the United States against \nIraq prevent Saddam from using weapons of mass destruction, or will it \nultimately become a self-fulfilling prophecy?\n  In other words, if we attack Saddam, and he is headed for certain \ndeath, he will have nothing to lose. What will stop him from launching \na chemical or biological attack against Americans or against Israel?\n  A unilateral, preemptive invasion of Iraq could set a dangerous long-\nterm precedent for us and the rest of the world. If we take such an \naction against Iraq for trying to develop nuclear weapons, should not \nother countries also have the same right against any other hostile \ncountry that is exploring nuclear weapons or already has them? Would \nthis justify a preemptive strike by Pakistan against India or vice \nversa? Heaven help us.\n  Furthermore, if we attack unilaterally, who would help us keep the \npeace in Iraq while trying to set up a democratic government to replace \nSaddam Hussein?\n  Let me be clear, if the United States is in imminent danger of being \nattacked by Saddam Hussein, we should take immediate, unilateral \nmilitary action. However, it seems clear he does not have this capacity \nat this time. I don't believe the administration has made the case. I \nhave listened very closely and seriously. They have not made the case \nfor a preemptive, unilateral strike against Iraq that would justify the \nrisks to our people or such a historic change in American policy. We \nhave time to build the coalitions. We need to be effective and minimize \nour own risks.\n  Another serious question: Is the President going to ask Congress to \nsupport the same unilateral action against other countries, such as \nIran, which has ballistic missiles and close ties to terrorist groups? \nWhy aren't they proposing action there, where the threat is much more \nimminent and real?\n\n  We should not be reluctant to use military force when there is a \nserious threat to the American people, but we should only go to war as \na last resort. Peace should always be our goal.\n  I believe we should work with our partners in the war against \nterrorism and get the U.N. inspectors back into Iraq as soon as \npossible. We should give Saddam Hussein real deadlines. And if they are \nnot met satisfactorily, then we should use force in partnership along \nwith our allies, appropriate force in partnership along with our \nallies.\n  I am not the only one who believes this is the best way to proceed \ntoward Iraq. Brent Scowcroft, President George H.W. Bush's national \nsecurity adviser, wrote in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Don't attack Saddam. An attack on Iraq at this time would \n     seriously jeopardize, if not destroy, the global \n     counterterrorist campaign we have undertaken. . . . Ignoring \n     that clear [world] sentiment [against an attack] would result \n     in a serious degradation in international cooperation with us \n     against terrorism. And make no mistake, we simply cannot win \n     that war without enthusiastic international cooperation, \n     especially on intelligence.\n\n  We also must remember any war comes with a terrible price. In a war \nwith Iraq, many of our own service men and women will be wounded or \nkilled. Many innocent civilians will die. We should remember what the \ndistinguished Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, recently said on this \nfloor. He reminded us when he served in the armed services, as my \nfather did, only 5 percent of the soldiers had spouses and children. \nToday over 77 percent of our service members have spouses and children. \nIf we go to war, there will be a lot of empty chairs at kitchen tables \nall across America, a lot of children growing up without their parents. \nThe possibility of this alone should force us to make sure we have \nexhausted all diplomatic efforts first before we go to war.\n  We should not have any illusion this war will be easy. It will not be \nan antiseptic war. It will not be won through air power alone. Military \ncommanders have told us this will be an urban war with thousands of \ntroops engaged in vicious house-to-house fighting. Knowing Saddam \nHussein's tactics, he will likely hide his weapons in mosques and \nschools and hospitals, making it more difficult for us to get to them, \nand guaranteeing more loss of life.\n  In closing, I want to make sure my voice and my view are not \ndistorted. I believe we, the American people, have the right to defend \nourselves from an imminent attack. If we are seriously threatened, we \ndon't need the permission of the United Nations or even our NATO allies \nto attack Iraq or any other nation, for that matter.\n  In this case, I believe the United Nations and our allies can be \nhelpful in our part. Every attempt should be made to work with our \npartners in the war against terrorism. If we have to use military \nforce, our battle against Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction \nwill be more effective.\n  Clearly, the United States must once again take the leadership role. \nWe must insist that renewed inspections take place immediately, without \ndelay or obfuscation. And it must be made clear to Iraq that \nenforcement by a unified world coalition is not a threat but a promise.\n  I believe the President's approach takes us down the path that poses \nthe most risk for the people of our country and the world. I truly \nbelieve that a better approach is the alternative I am supporting \nauthored by my colleague from Michigan, Carl Levin.\n  The President's approach is entirely too broad. This resolution says \nthat the Congress authorizes force, including unilateral, preemptive \nstrikes, for broad national security reasons and for\n\n[[Page S9975]]\n\nthe enforcement of a broad range of U.N. resolutions that may have \nnothing to do with weapons of mass destruction. For the reasons I have \nmentioned, I will oppose this resolution.\n  In contrast, the Levin resolution strikes the right balance. This \napproach focuses on what matters most--destroying Saddam Hussein's \nweapons of mass destruction. And it calls on us to work with our allies \nto effectively accomplish this task. It gets us behind the U.N.'s \nefforts to get the weapons inspectors back into Iraq to do their job as \nsoon as possible.\n  It also authorizes the use of force, with our allies, to get rid of \nSaddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction if all diplomatic efforts \nfail.\n  Senator Levin's approach will also shake up the U.N. and force our \nallies to participate in a coalition to rid Saddam Hussein of his \nweapons of mass destruction. If we do not engage the U.N. and we decide \nto go it alone, the U.N. and our other key allies will likely sit on \nthe sidelines while we confront Saddam Hussein and try to build a new \ncountry on our own. This is not in our best interest.\n  Finally, the Levin approach specifically affirms our right to self-\ndefense. There is nothing in this approach that takes away our right to \nself-defense and to attack Iraq unilaterally to do so.\n  Therefore, no one should be confused about the Levin proposal. It \ndoes not take away our right to make our own decisions about our own \nactions or to defend ourselves. I believe this is the proper approach.\n  If we do this right, Mr. President, we will truly make the world \nsafer for our families. If we choose the wrong approach, I am deeply \nconcerned that we will start down a road that could ultimately create a \nmore unstable and a more dangerous world for our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  There is no doubt that we can defeat Saddam Hussein in battle. The \ntest of our strength is not in our ability to marshal our Armed Forces \nbut our willingness to adhere to that which has made us great.\n  We are a strong and powerful nation, made that way by our willingness \nto go that extra mile in the name of liberty and peace. The time is now \nfor us to work together in the name of the American people and get it \nright.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, this week Republican critics, for whom we \nexpedited hearings and committee votes on a number of judicial nominees \nin their home States, spoke on the floor about their frustration that \nnot all the President's judicial nominees have yet been confirmed. They \ncomplain about a handful of judicial nominees. The fact is that the \nhearing I will chair next week will include the 100th judicial nominee \nto receive a hearing since the Democrats became the majority party in \nthe Senate less than 15 months ago. Had the Senate been more productive \nin 1999 and 2000 and the first months of 2001, when a Republican \nmajority was not holding hearings and votes on judicial nominees, we \nwould be farther along. Since the shift in majority, we have been \nproceeding dramatically faster than the Republicans. It took \nRepublicans 33 months, almost 3 full years, to hold hearings for 100 of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees when they were in the majority, \nwe will exceed that mark next week, in less than 15 months.\n  Republican critics who now come to the floor of the Senate expressing \noutrage that a handful of judicial nominees have not had a hearing in \nthe past year, were deafeningly silent when scores of President \nClinton's judicial nominees never received hearings after many months \nand years. For example, Judge Helene White of Michigan, nominated to \nthe Sixth Circuit, waited in vain for over 4 years, 1,454 days, for a \nhearing and never had a hearing or a vote. James Beaty of North \nCarolina, nominated to the Fourth Circuit, waited in vain for almost 3 \nyears, 1,033 days, and never got a hearing. H. Alston Johnson of \nLouisiana, nominated to the Fifth Circuit, waited in vain for over 600 \ndays and never got a hearing. Others, such as Allen Snyder and Bonnie \nCampbell who were nominated to the D.C. Circuit and Eighth Circuit, \nreceived hearings but no committee vote. Likewise, Clarence Sundram, \nnominated to the Northern District of New York, waited 19 months for a \nhearing and then languished in committee without the committee vote for \n18 months before his nomination was returned, after pending before the \nSenate for 1,119 days. There were others, too many others, who waited \nin vain for a hearing or after a hearing for committee consideration.\n  In addition, it often took months and sometimes years for those who \nwere ultimately confirmed to be acted upon by the Republican-controlled \nSenate. For example, Judge Richard Paez, nominated to the 9th Circuit, \nwas finally confirmed after four years, 1,520 days; Judge William \nFletcher, also nominated to the 9th Circuit, was finally confirmed \nafter 1,264 days; Judge Hilda Tagle, nominated to the District Court in \nTexas, waited 943 days to be confirmed; Judge Susan Molloway, nominated \nto the District Court in Hawaii, waited 913 days to be confirmed, Judge \nAnn Aiken, nominated to the District Court in Oregon, waited 791 days \nto be confirmed; Judge Timothy Dyk, nominated to the Federal Circuit, \nwaited 785 days to be confirmed; Judge Marsha Berzon, nominated to the \n9th Circuit, waited 772 days to be confirmed; Ronald Gould, nominated \nto the 9th Circuit, waited 739 days to be confirmed; Margaret McKeown, \nnominated to the 9th Circuit, waited 728 days to be confirmed; and \nMargaret Morrow, nominated to the California District Court, waited \nalmost 2 years to be confirmed. Many others took more than 1 year.\n  I understand how difficult the confirmation process can be. During \nthe 6\\1/2\\ years Republicans controlled the Senate only 39 judicial \nnominees, including seven circuit court nominees, were confirmed per \nyear on average. In contrast, in less than 15 months, the Democratic \nmajority has already confirmed 80 judicial nominees.\n  The confirmation process can be frustrating at times, but it is also \nimportant work by which we implement our constitutionally-mandated \nadvise and consent role for these lifetime appointments. It is a role \nthat I do not take lightly and the other Members of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee do not take lightly. Accordingly, it is distressing \nto hear unintentionally inaccurate portrayals of the progress we have \nmade in the less 15 months of Democratic control of the Senate. It is \ntrue that we have not been able to confirm every single judicial \nnominee proposed by this President, but we have worked at a \nhistorically fast pace to address the vacancy crisis by moving \nconsensus nominees first and working our way through the more \ncontroversial and divisive nominees.\n  Since the summer of 2001, we have held more hearings for more \njudicial nominees and more hearings for circuit court nominees than in \nany comparable 15-month period of the 6\\1/2\\ years in which Republicans \nlast controlled the committee. With our hearing last week, the \nDemocratic-led Judiciary Committee has now held 25 hearings for 96 \ndistrict and circuit court nominees. This is twice the pace at which \nthe Republican majority considered President Clinton's judicial \nnominees. The Judiciary Committee has likewise voted on more judicial \nnominees, 83, and on more circuit court nominees, 17, than in any \ncomparable 15-month period of prior Republican\n\n[[Page S9976]]\n\ncontrol. In fact, Democrats have given votes to more judicial nominees \nthan in 1996 and 1997 combined as well as in 1999 and 2000 combined.\n  During their 6\\1/2\\ years of control, Republicans allowed only 39 \njudicial nominees to be confirmed per year, on average, 39, and only \nseven circuit court nominees to be confirmed per year on average. In \ncontrast, in little more than a year, Democrats have already confirmed \n80 of this Republican President's judicial nominees, including 14 \ncircuit court nominees. We have done twice as much as their average, \nand yet they still complain.\n  Rather than compare the improvements we are making over the way they \ntreated the judicial nominees of the last President when they were \nrecently in the Senate majority, they would pick other times when the \nSenate and executive branch were headed by those of the same party. \nThis reveals how embarrassed they must be about their own record. That \nmust be why they ignore their own record and refuse to acknowledge the \nimprovements we have made, the hard work we have done, and all that we \nhave accomplished.\n  This past week, Republicans reiterated their claim that other \nPresidents had 80 or 90 percent of their circuit court nominees \nconfirmed. This ignores entirely the efforts of these same Republicans \nto block President Clinton's circuit court nominees. For example, in \n1996, Republicans allowed none, zero percent and the absolute number of \nzero circuit court nominees to be confirmed. In 1997, Republicans \nallowed only 7 of President Clinton's 21 circuit court nominees to be \nconfirmed, about one-third. Only 5 of President Clinton's first 11 \ncircuit court nominees that year were confirmed that same year. In \n1998, Republicans allowed 13 of the 23 pending circuit court nominees \nto be confirmed, which was 56 percent for the year, their best year for \ncircuit court confirmations in their 6\\1/2\\ years of control of the \nSenate. In 1999, Republicans were back down to 28 percent, when they \nallowed only seven of the 25 circuit court nominations made to be \nconfirmed, or about one of every four. Four of President Clinton's \nfirst 11 circuit court nominees that year were not confirmed. In 2000, \nRepublicans allowed only 8 of the 26 circuit court nominees pending to \nbe confirmed, or 31 percent. All but one of the circuit court \ncandidates initially nominated that year, were returned to President \nClinton without confirmation.\n\n  Republicans simply have no standing to complain that 100 percent of \nPresident George W. Bush's circuit court nominees have not been \nconfirmed. Recent history makes their complaints on this point ring \nhollow. Democrats have been better by far to this President's judicial \nnominees than Republicans were to the last President's. For example, at \nthe most recent judicial nominations hearing held last week, Democrats \nhad already given hearings to 96 of the 105 eligible judicial nominees \nwith complete files, the remaining two dozen nominees did not have \ncompleted files. Thus, 91 percent of judicial nominees who had \ncompleted files were given a hearing. This remarkable achievement is \nirrefutable evidence that we are not blocking this administration's \njudicial nominees.\n  I am certain that President Clinton would have been overcome with \ngratitude if the Republicans ever gave 91 percent of his judicial \nnominees hearings in the years Republicans controlled the confirmation \nprocess during his administration. They never did. Instead, almost half \nthe time his judicial nominees never got hearings or votes. Indeed, \nonly 49 percent of President Clinton's circuit court nominations were \nconfirmed, 46 out of 93 nominations during the period of Republican \ncontrol. How dare they complain that 100 percent or 90 percent of \nPresident Bush's circuit court or district court nominees have not been \nconfirmed in our first 14\\1/2\\ months of control.\n  The real reason there are so many circuit vacancies is because \nRepublicans blocked so many of President Clinton's judicial nominees. \nDuring the 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control, the number of circuit \nvacancies more than doubled from 16 to 33, and the total number of \nvacancies increased from 65 to 110 by the time of the reorganization of \nthe committee in the summer of 2001. If Republicans had not blocked the \nconfirmation of almost two dozen, 22, circuit court nominees and many \nmore district court nominees, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee \nwould have begun with 11 circuit court vacancies, instead of the 33 we \ninherited. With the 10 new circuit court vacancies that arose over \nthese past 14\\1/2\\ months, there would have been a total of 22 circuit \ncourt vacancies for this President to fill. At the Democratic pace of \nconsidering circuit court nominees, almost of all of them would have \nhad hearings by now, and 14 of them would have already been confirmed, \nwith our pace of confirmation. That would have left only 6 vacancies on \nthe circuit courts today. That is what might have been, but for the \ndetermined, strategic blocking of so many circuit court nominees during \nthe 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control of the Senate.\n  Instead, even after 14 circuit confirmations, there are 27 circuit \ncourt vacancies. This number is still fewer than at the start of this \nCongress and fewer than the 33 vacancies we inherited. We have \noutstripped attrition and are making progress. We cannot undo the \ndamage done between 1995 and 2001 overnight, but we have held hearings \nfor 96 of this President's judicial nominees, which is more circuit and \ndistrict court nominees in less than 15 months than they held when they \nfirst took over the Senate or in their subsequent years. It is more in \nraw numbers and in percentages. We have made real progress to fix the \nproblems that we inherited from the period of Republican control of the \nprocess.\n  The Judiciary Committee has focused on consensus nominees. This \nprioritization will help end the crisis caused by Republican delay and \nobstruction by confirming as many of the President's judicial nominees \nas quickly as possible. Most Senators understand that the more \ncontroversial nominees require greater review. This process of careful \nreview is part of our democratic process. It is a critical part of the \nchecks and balances of our system of government that does not give the \npower to make lifetime appointments to one person alone to remake the \ncourts along narrow ideological lines, to pack the courts with judges \nwhose views are outside of the mainstream of legal thought, and whose \ndecisions would further divide our nation. The Senate should not and \nwill not rubber stamp nominees who would undermine the independence and \nfairness of our federal courts. It is our responsibility to preserve a \nfair, impartial and independent judiciary for all Americans, of all \nraces, all religions, whether rich or poor, whether Democrat or \nRepublican.\n  The committee continues to try to accommodate Senators from both \nsides of the aisle. Virtually all of the Court of Appeals nominees \nincluded at hearings so far this year have been at the request of \nRepublican Senators, including Senator Grassley, Senator Lott, Senator \nSpecter, Senator Enzi, Senator Smith, and Senator Thompson, Republican \nSenators who each sought a prompt hearing on a Court of Appeals nominee \nand who was accommodated.\n  However, the whipsawing by Republicans has been truly remarkable. \nWhen we proceed on nominees that they support and on whom they seek \naction, we are criticized for not acting on others. When we direct our \neffort to trying to solve problems in one Circuit, they complain that \nwe are not acting in another. Since these multiple problems arose on \ntheir watch while they were in the majority, it is a bit like the \narsonist who complains that the local fire department is not responding \nfast enough to all of his destructive antics.\n  This week the Senate confirmed its 79th and 80th judicial nominees \nsince the change in Senate majority and reorganization of the Judiciary \nCommittee less than 15 months ago. In so doing, we have confirmed more \njudicial nominees than were confirmed in the first 15 months of any of \nthe past three Presidents and more judicial nominees than were \nconfirmed in the last 30 months that a Republican majority controlled \nthe Senate. Simply put, we have done more in half the time. We have \nachieved what we said we would by treating President Bush's nominees \nmore fairly and more expeditiously than President Clinton's nominees \nwere treated. Partisan critics of these accomplishments ignore the \nfacts. The facts are that we are confirming President Bush's nominees \nat a faster pace\n\n[[Page S9977]]\n\nthan the nominees of prior presidents, including those who worked \nclosely with a Senate majority of the same political party.\n  At this important time in our Nation's history we can all appreciate \nthe need for a sound judiciary. Under the Democratic majority, we will \ncontinue to review nominees' files expeditiously and grant hearings \nregularly to candidates with complete paperwork and home State consent. \nOur record breaking efforts in the past 14\\1/2\\ months have left us \nwith few remaining nominees who are ready to appear before the \nCommittee. Of the circuit court nominees who have not yet received a \nhearing, half of them, 6, are without home State consent. Only 3 remain \nfrom the initial 11 circuit court nominees who have not had a hearing \nand have home State Senator support. Of the 17 district court nominees \nwho have not yet received a hearing, more than half of them 9 have \nincomplete paperwork, including six of them without home State consent. \nMoreover, 9 out of 17 district court nominees are without ABA ratings.\n  Despite the partisan din about blockades and obstructionism, \nDemocrats are actually achieving almost twice as much as our Republican \ncounterparts did to staff the Federal courts. The Democratic Senate has \nshown its resolve to work in a bipartisan way to fill judicial \nvacancies. That is what the confirmation of 80 judges in less than 15 \nmonths demonstrates.\n  But let me be clear. Our judiciary would be in even better shape if \nso many judicial nominees of the prior administration had not been \npurposely blocked and defeated, if we received more timely reviews from \nthe ABA, and even a little cooperation from this administration by \nnominating more moderate, mainstream judicial nominees. I, again, \ninvite the President and all Republicans to join with us and work with \nus to fill the remaining judicial vacancies as quickly as possible with \nqualified, consensus nominees chosen from the mainstream and not for \ntheir ideological orientation, nominees who will be fair and impartial \njudges and will ensure that an independent judiciary is the people's \nbulwark against a loss of their freedoms and rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/04/senate-section/article/S9977-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SENATOR STROM THURMOND: STATESMAN, PATRIOT, LEADER\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, last week, several Senators spoke during \nmorning business one day about our distinguished colleague from South \nCarolina, Senator Thurmond. Long before I came to the Senate, I myself \nspoke many times on television editorials commending Senator Thurmond.\n  He was then, and is today, even more of a genuine American patriot \nthan when I was in Raleigh never dreaming that I would one day be a \ncolleague to Senator Thurmond in the Senate.\n  Trying to capture the essence of Strom Thurmond in a relatively few \nwords of tribute is impossible. Who can adequately describe his firm \nhandshake, his unmistakable South Carolina cadence, or his almost \nsuperhuman capacity for work? How to convey the explosive energy Strom \nThurmond has carried anytime he walks into a room?\n  The sheer breadth of experience Strom Thurmond brings to the Senate \nboggles the mind: Born in 1902, he served South Carolina as State \nSenator, as a Circuit Judge, as Governor and as U.S. Senator.\n  He voted for Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932, and more than fifty \nyears later, voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984. He ran for President \nagainst Harry Truman in 1948 and actively participated in Bill \nClinton's impeachment trial in 1999.\n  When the Army told him he was too old to fight in World War II, he \nmanaged to obtain an age waiver, an age waiver, to participate in the \nfighting. Then, in typical Strom Thurmond fashion, he landed with the \n82nd Airborne Division in Normandy on D-Day. Small wonder that Fort \nBragg recently honored him by christening its newest building the Major \nGeneral Strom Thurmond Strategic Deployment Facility.\n  My simple references to Strom Thurmond's accomplishments fail to \nconvey the historic legacy he will leave in the Senate. In 1997, Strom \nbecame the longest serving Senator in the history of the institution, \nbut he was the quintessential Senator long before he officially assumed \nthat honor.\n  Senator Thurmond had great influence on my decision in 1972 to become \na candidate for the Senate from North Carolina. He came to Raleigh many \ntimes urging me to run, and countless others to support me.\n  Every time he came, he told me again that if I would just run for the \nSenate, he would come to North Carolina frequently to campaign for me.\n  I decided to run because thanks to Senator Thurmond, there were many \nurging me to do it. And, sure enough, there he came, down from \nWashington to Raleigh, to help me. Again and again he came.\n  He was a fellow Southerner, and like me, he was a Democrat who had \nconverted to the Republican Party. In those days, there were not a lot \nof Republicans in North and South Carolina, but Strom was determined to \nchange that. And I might add, parenthetically, that no single \nindividual, with the possible exception of Ronald Reagan, has done more \nto build the Republican Party in the South than Strom Thurmond.\n  Senator Thurmond knows how much I admire and respect him. He knows \nhow grateful I am for his enormously helpful trips to North Carolina \nwhere we stood together, day after day, night after night, urging the \npeople of North Carolina to send Helms to Washington to help Strom \nThurmond.\n  I am proud to say, that Strom Thurmond became one of the best friends \nI have ever had, and one of the finest men I have ever known. He \ntutored me in the intricacies of the Senate and its traditions, the \npersonal dedication the job requires, and the genuine commitment \nSenators owe to their constituents.\n  Some years ago, Strom paid me the ultimate honor of asking me to \nserve as godfather to his newborn daughter. Today, Julie Thurmond \nWhitmer is a beautiful young woman, and the pride I take in her is \nexceeded only by her father.\n  One final note, I owe Senator Thurmond my eternal gratitude for a \nfavor he did for me.\n  When I arrived in the Senate, I was searching for young people to \nhelp me with my Senate responsibilities. Senator Thurmond referred a \nwonderfully smart, principled, and competent young lady for my staff.\n  After 30 years of working with, and for, the irreplaceable Mrs. Pat \nDevine, I can genuinely say that her presence among the ``Helms Senate \nFamily'' is the finest helping hand Strom Thurmond could possibly \nextend to me.\n  Senator Thurmond watched over her protectively, and he often jokingly \nneedled me about how I had ``stolen away his red-head''.\n  The Senate simply will never be the same without Senator Thurmond \nsitting tall and straight at his desk, serving the people of South \nCarolina and the country he loves.\n  He is a true friend, a great statesman, and a blessing to all who \ncherish the strength of statesmen like J. Strom Thurmond. He is a great \npatriot. He is my friend and I am his. This is a stronger and greater \ncountry because of his service and his dedication to the principles \nthat made America great from the beginning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/04/senate-section/article/S9977-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9977-S9978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        WHEN MEN MURDER WOMEN: AN ANALYSIS OF 2000 HOMICIDE DATA\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this week the Violence Policy \nCenter released its annual review examining the role of firearms in \nmurders involving one female victim and one male offender. The analysis \nfound that in 2000, the most recent data available, a majority of women \nwho were murdered were killed with firearms. Seventy-six percent of all \nfirearm homicides of women were committed with handguns. The report is \nsobering in demonstrating how easily a domestic violence dispute can \nturn into domestic homicide.\n  According to the VPC's review, in 2000, there were 1,805 women \nmurdered by males in single victim/single offender incidents reported \nto the FBI. Of the more 1,800 women murdered, 963 of the victims were \nwives or intimate acquaintances of their killers and 331 were murdered \nduring the course of an argument. In my home State of Michigan, 82 \nwomen were murdered. For\n\n[[Page S9978]]\n\nhomicides in which police could identify the weapon, 41 were shot and \nkilled with guns. Of these, 22 victims were killed with handguns.\n  In 1996, Congress passed legislation to deny firearms purchases to \nindividuals who were under a domestic violence restraining order or \nconvicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor. Despite the passage of \nthis law, many people are slipping through the system. I supported that \nlegislation because of evidence that people who had committed acts of \ndomestic violence were buying guns and using them. I also support \nclosing the gun show loophole, which requires background checks for \npeople who purchase guns at gun shows. The lack of background checks at \ngun shows leaves battered women and their children more vulnerable to \nviolence.\n  October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. The VPC's report \nhighlights how much we still have to do to protect women from becoming \nvictims of domestic violence, and I urge my colleagues to support \nsensible gun safety legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/04/senate-section/article/S9978-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9978-S9979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TAX RELIEF FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senators Baucus and \nGrassley for introducing the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act, and for \nincluding a very important provision within it. I, along with Senators \nLincoln and McCain, am proud to cosponsor a specific provision that \nprovides tax relief for members of the military and foreign service \nofficers serving on assignment abroad. This provision provides tax \nrelief on the profit generated by the sale of a primary residence--\nallowing those who serve our country the ability to exclude their time \nliving abroad from the calculation of total years living in their \nprimary residence.\n  This provision does not create a new tax benefit, it merely modifies \ncurrent law. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 gave taxpayers who sell \ntheir principal residence a much-needed tax break. Prior to the 1997 \nact, taxpayers received a one-time exclusion on the profit they made \nwhen they sold their principal residence, but the taxpayer had to live \nin the residence for two of the five years preceding the sale and be at \nleast 55 years old. This policy provided no tax relief to younger \ntaxpayers and their families.\n  The 1997 act corrected this flaw. Now, a taxpayer who sells his or \nher principal residence is not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit \nfrom the sale. Joint filers are not taxed on their first $500,000 of \nprofit. To qualify for this tax relief, the taxpayer must meet two \nrequirements: No. 1, they must own the home for at least two of the \nfive years preceding the sale; and No. 2, they must live in the home as \ntheir primary residence for at least two of the last five years.\n  Unfortunately, this second requirement unintentionally and unfairly \nprohibits men and women in the armed services and foreign service from \nqualifying for this beneficial tax relief when their service mandates \nthat they live abroad for longer periods of time.\n  The bill being considered today remedies the inequality in the \nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997. While military and foreign service \nprofessionals working abroad would still be required to own and live in \ntheir home for at least 2 years, the Internal Revenue Code would be \namended to suspend the five-year determination period--when members of \nthe military and foreign service are away from home.\n  The 1997 home sale provision was bad fiscal policy because as it \nunintentionally discouraged government personnel from owning their own \nhomes. We all know that home ownership has numerous benefits. It \nprovides Americans with a valuable sense of community. It adds \nstability to our Nation's neighborhoods, and generates valuable \nproperty taxes for our Nation's communities. Home ownership should be \ncommended and encouraged, and members of the military and foreign \nservice should not be penalized with higher taxes simply because they \nare on extended assignment abroad. Enacting this remedy will grant \nequal and fair tax relief to those U.S. citizens who serve our country \naway from home.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I want to commend the chairman and \nranking member of the Finance Committee for bringing the Armed Forces \nTax Fairness Act of 2002 to the floor and winning Senate passage of \nthis important legislation. This bill contains some valuable tax \nbenefits for the men and women who defend out country, fighting the war \nagainst terrorism.\n  I am very pleased that this bill contains provisions based on a bill \nI introduced, S. 2807, to clarify that dependent care benefits paid to \nour armed forces are excluded from their gross incomes. S. 2807 fixes \nwhat I believe was an oversight in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. That Act \nconsolidated the laws regarding the tax treatment of certain military \nbenefits. The conference report to the 1986 Act contained a long list \nof benefits to be excluded from the gross incomes of military \npersonnel. According to the report, this list was to be exhaustive. The \nproblem was that dependent and child care benefits were not included on \nthe list.\n  The Treasury Secretary does have the authority to expand the list of \nbenefits in the 1986 Act, but so far no Treasury Secretary has chosen \nto expand the list. As a matter of practice, we do not tax these \nbenefits, but the Department of Defense is concerned that this may \nchange without greater clarification. The Defense Department came to us \nto clarify the tax treatment of dependent and child care benefits once \nand for all. I was proud to help them. I thank Senator Baucus, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member, Senator \nGrassley, for including my legislation in this package.\n  Throughout our history, in times of war and in times of peace we have \nworked to make sure that our armed forces have everything they need and \nwe have spared no expense in this regard. The Armed Forces Tax Fairness \nAct of 2002 is another symbol of this support. I hope the House of \nRepresentatives will pass this bill as well and move it on to the \nPresident's desk for passage into law before we adjourn this session of \nCongress. The men and women of our armed forces and their families \ndeserve this legislation.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, last night the Senate acted to \ndemonstrate our support and gratitude for those brave men and women who \nare fighting to protect our freedom and our Nation's interests abroad. \nI am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Armed Forces Tax Fairness \nAct. These common sense tax cuts rectify injustices in our tax code \nthat punish those who serve in our military.\n  Even in times of peace, extraordinary demands are placed on our \ntroops. They are separated from their families. They endure physically \ngrueling training. And most important, they commit to put their own \nlives at risk for the sake of this country. Since last year's attacks, \nwe have become even more dependent on the dedication of our armed \nforces.\n  This reality makes it all the more important that we ensure our tax \nlaws are fair to those who serve in our military. In August, I \nintroduced the Honoring Our Heroes Act. Under my bill, families of \nsoldiers who lose their lives while serving their country do not have \nto pay income taxes on the death benefit payment the federal government \nprovides. Under current law the government provides $6,000 to families \nof servicemen and women who die. However, families are required to pay \nincome tax on half of that benefit. My legislation enables a family to \nuse the entire death benefit to cover funeral or other expenses they \nface after losing their loved one.\n  The bill passed by the Senate last night includes my bill, and other \nimprovements to our tax code. Reservists and members of the National \nGuard will be pleased to know that this bill enables them to deduct \ntheir service-related travel expenses even if they do not itemize their \ntax deductions. This bill also ensures that service members will not be \npenalized when they sell their houses after a period of service away \nfrom home. In addition, this legislation provides automatic filing \nextensions to military personnel who are assigned to contingency \noperations and would naturally have trouble meeting the regular IRS \ndeadlines.\n  These and other tax cuts for our service members are paid for by \nclosing a horrible loophole in our tax code. Currently wealthy \nindividuals can escape paying taxes by renouncing their U.S. \ncitizenship. This is unconscionable. Citizens who have benefited from \nthe freedom and opportunity provided by\n\n[[Page S9979]]\n\nthis country should not be allowed to avoid paying income tax by \nrenouncing their citizenship. I believe we owe it to those fighting for \nour country's freedom to close this loophole.\n  I am pleased to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nmake our tax code more fair. The United States is extremely grateful \nfor the hard work and dedication of our armed forces. And the bill we \npassed last night will ensure that our tax code reflects this \ngratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/04/senate-section/article/S9979-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TIMOTHY WHITE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I regret that a family emergency in Utah \nkept me from the Senate yesterday. Had I been present, I would have \nvoted in favor of the motion to proceed on S.J. Res. 45, the resolution \nauthorizing the use of force in Iraq.\n  The President and his administration have been actively consulting \nwith the Congress on the language of this resolution over the past days \nand weeks. Our committees have heard many testimonies from the \nadministration and other experts. And, for many years now, we have been \napprised of the threat of Saddam Hussein and his outlaw regime. It is \ntime for the Congress to come together, to hold a public debate, and to \nvote on a critical request made by this Administration.\n  This administration has worked closely, and will continue to work \nclosely, with our allies and the United Nations. The challenge posed to \nthe U.N. by President Bush in his historic speech before the General \nAssembly last month demonstrated the dedication that the U.S. wishes to \nkeep the U.N. relevant, while plainly stating that our national \ninterest cannot and will not be subjugated to Saddam's willful \ndeceptions and manipulations before that body.\n  The world is looking to the United States to see our resolve. It is \ntime for the world to see the American Congress debate whether we will \nsupport our Administration. I believe that we will show the world that \nthis Congress, and the American people, overwhelmingly supports our \nPresident.\n  It is not preordained the resolve we will show the world will lead to \nwar. I believe that the resolve we show will demonstrate the U.S. will \nunite to confront the dangers that lie ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/04/senate-section/article/S9979-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in November \n2000 in Shawano, WI. Two men tried to run an Asian couple off a road \nwith a pickup truck. The men pulled up behind the victims' car at a \nhigh speed and forced the couple's car to swerve onto the shoulder. \nThey then continued to chase the couple and buzzed close to the \nvehicle. The driver, Grant Heim, 19, used racial slurs when referring \nto the victims and was charged with a hate crime in connection to the \nincident.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/04/senate-section/article/S9979-4", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FALLEN FIREFIGHTERS FOUNDATION MEMORIAL WEEKEND 2002\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this weekend firefighters from across the \ncountry are coming to Washington, DC, to honor the lives of their \nfamily, friends, and colleagues during the 2002 Fallen Firefighters \nFoundation Memorial Weekend. Since 1981, the names of America's fallen \nfire heroes have been memorialized at the official National Fallen \nFirefighters Memorial. Sadly, this year the names of 446 brave and \nheroic men and women of the fire service will be added to the Roll of \nHonor in Emmitsburg, MD.\n  Last year, 442 firefighters from 34 States lost their lives while \nserving their communities. 2001 was the deadliest year in the history \nof America's fire service. New York leads the list with 359 \nfirefighters killed, including the 347 World Trade Center heroes. Also, \nfour firefighters who died before 2001 but whose names had not been \nincluded on the national memorial will be added. Three individuals from \nmy home State of Michigan will also be added to Roll of Honor.\n  James Pelton joined the City of Mason Volunteer Fire Department in \nMay of 1964. He received his training the old fashioned way, on the \njob. Jim worked his way up through the ranks from First Lieutenant to \nChief of the department. He always looked for ways to educate people \nabout the importance of fire safety. Jim helped implement a variety of \ntraining programs, including ice rescue, hazardous materials handling, \nand vehicle extrication training.\n  In April 1972, James Rupkey became a charter member of Station Five \nof the Troy Fire Department. He served the department for more than 30 \nyears. As Troy's volunteer assistant fire chief, he designed software \nto help the fire department respond run more efficiently. According to \nhis colleagues, no matter what rank he held, he was always a leader at \nthe fire department. In 2000, the department named him Firefighter of \nthe Year.\n  Christopher Towne, Engine Company 5 of the Detroit Fire Department, \njoined the fire department in 1972. Christopher was a courageous \nfireman, in 1991, he received a department citation for helping save \nanother firefighter from being overcome by smoke when the firefighter's \nequipment malfunctioned. Christopher's job often took him out of the \nfirehouse to the Children's Hospital Burn Unit where he worked as a \nfundraiser activist.\n  These are just three of the 442 firefighters that lost their lives \nlast year. The Fallen Firefighters Foundation Memorial offers family, \nfriends, and loved ones an opportunity to grieve, honor, and bring \nclosure to the loss of their loved ones. However, I hope that over the \ncoming weekend, people across the country will take a moment to thank \nand honor their firefighters for their service, and I know my \ncolleagues will join me in honoring the lives of these courageous \npublic servants.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/04/senate-section/article/S9979-5", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9979-S9980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATION LEE C.

Mr. President, at a time when many Americans have \nwitnessed the loss of their life savings and millions of others face \ndifficult decisions regarding their personal finances, the need for \ncompetent, ethical financial planning is greater than ever. It is with \ngreat pride that I rise today to recognize Certified Financial Planner \nBoard of Standards Inc. As of today, CFP Board has announced that \n40,000 financial planners now hold the CFP  certification.\n  This outstanding, Colorado-based, nonprofit regulatory organization \nhas been working since 1985 to foster professional standards so that \nthe public values, has access to, and benefits from, competent, ethical \nfinancial planning. The organization also works closely with 17 \naffiliates of the International CFP Council, whose nearly 31,000 \nadditional certificants are helping to elevate standards for the \nfinancial planning professional globally.\n  The CFP certification is based on the 4 E's: Education, Examination, \nExperience and Ethics. CFP Board has registered 234 education programs \nat 151 accredited U.S. colleges and universities to help CFP \ncertification candidates develop competency in financial planning. CFP \nBoard administers a comprehensive, 2-day, 10-hour examination and \nrequires certificants to meet rigorous standards for continuing \neducation developed by its subsidiary board of examiners. Every \ncandidate must demonstrate at least three years of relevant experience. \nThose individuals who then qualify for certification must agree to \nabide by CFP Board's Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility, as \nwell as the Financial Planning Practice Standards. Among the many \nprovisions contained in these documents is the overriding principle of \nplacing the client's interests first. CFP Board's subsidiary Board of \nProfessional Review strictly enforces ethical compliance.\n  To fulfill its mission to the public, CFP Board publishes extensive \nprinted and online materials to educate consumers regarding topics such \nas the financial planning process, selecting financial planning \nprofessionals and the rights of financial planning clients. Several of \nthese publications have been reviewed by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and are available through the Federal Consumer Information \nCenter. Through the Web site www.CFP.net, consumers can quickly and \neasily determine whether financial planners hold the CFP certification \nand have been subject to public disciplinary action by CFP Board.\n  Earlier this year, CFP Board completed implementation of the \nFinancial Planning Practice Standards, establishing what clients are \nreasonably entitled to expect during financial planning engagements and \nproviding a blueprint for recently deregulated and other financial \nservices firms that wish to offer their clients comprehensive financial \nplanning. CFP Board continues to proactively address public concerns \nsuch as disclosure of compensation and possible conflicts of interest \non the part of financial planners. CFP Board's continued efforts to \nprotect and educate our nation's citizens should not go unnoticed. For \nthat, we owe CFP Board our recognition, gratitude, and congratulations. \nI urge my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute to Certified \nFinancial Planner Board of Standards Inc. for 17 years of protecting \nthe public.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/04/senate-section/article/S9980-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMEMORATION OF JAMES MARTIN\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sorrow \nat the untimely and tragic death of a talented and dedicated public \nservant, James Martin. On the evening of Wednesday, October 2, Jim \nMartin became the first homicide victim in this week's violent and \nsenseless string of shootings in suburban Maryland.\n  Jim was an outstanding civilian employee of the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, NOAA, Office of Marine and Aviation \nOperations, OMAO, the branch of NOAA that operates the agency's \nscientific ocean research vessels and the famous P-3 ``Hurricane \nHunter'' aircraft. Jim served as a program analyst in the Resource \nManagement Division of OMAO.\n  For 16 years, first with the Office of the Comptroller, then with \nOMAO, Jim used his talents as a program analyst to advance NOAA's \nmission and core values. Jim was credited with single-handedly \norchestrating and implementing OMAO's program to improve NOAA employee \nsatisfaction, and with becoming a Diversity Coordinator not because he \nwas asked to, but because he believed in the principles and in \nimproving representation of diversity in the sciences. Jim began his \ncommitment to diversity issues long ago, when he worked here in the \nU.S. Senate on Native American affairs as a legislative assistant for \nSenator Lee Metcalf of Montana.\n  At NOAA, Jim also was instrumental in OMAO's adoption of a \nWashington, DC, elementary school and worked to get NOAA pilots and \nship captains to talk to youth about our sea and skies. When the school \nneeded computers, Jim quickly came up with 10 surplus ones for \nstudents. He was in the process of arranging a ``tour'' for the kids on \na NOAA research vessel. Jim's demonstrated commitment to inspire \nminority youth to become future scientists sets a standard for us all \nto follow.\n  Jim's colleagues say that he was always a gentleman, that he listened \nfirst, and talked second. With his subtle sense of humor, and ready \nwillingness to help, Jim is already sorely missed by his colleagues \nthroughout the NOAA community. Our deep condolences go out to Jim's \nwife Billie and their 11-year old son Ben in this very difficult \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/04/senate-section/article/S9980-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9980-S9981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING BILL HOLMBERG FOR HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO ENERGY AND THE \n                              ENVIRONMENT\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.

Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the \nShannon Rovers Irish Pipe Band for providing 75 years of entertainment. \nMore than 500 individuals have played the pipes and drums of the \nShannon Rovers Band. Currently, the band is made up of over 75 pipers, \ndrummers and color guard members, and includes a student program with \nover 20 individuals actively learning the pipes and drums.\n  The band was organized in 1926 by a group of Irish immigrants, and \nwas originally named the Shannon Rovers Fife and Drum Corps. The group \nwas directed by Dan Hennessy and played for every Irish gathering in \nChicago during the late 1920's and early 1930's. In 1932 the decision \nwas made to switch from fife and drums to the ``Irish Warpipe'' or \nbagpipe. Thus, the Shannon Rovers Irish Pipe Band was introduced.\n  In the 1930's the band performed for Presidential candidate Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt and has continued to play for Presidents and \ndistinguished guests to this day, including Presidents Harry S. Truman, \nJohn F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, and Pope John \nPaul II.\n  The band's popularity has grown immensely over the years. The demand \nfor them to play continues to grow in the Chicago land area, as well as \nacross the Nation, and around the world. The Rovers continue to excite \nChicagoans with performances at halftime of Bears games, leading the \npre-race ceremonies at Chicago Motor Speedway, performing at the Celtic \nFest, and at the Irish Heritage Center. They make an annual trip to \nSpringfield, IL, for the Illinois State Fair and they also perform at \ncountless rallies and dinners. The members of this group freely \nvolunteer their time for all types of civic and charitable events.\n  Internationally, the band is a perennial contender in Ireland's \nFleadh Cheoil, a world-class traditional Irish music event. The Rovers \nhave placed first, second, and third in this prestigious competition.\n  The Shannon Rovers Irish Pipe Band has accomplished much in the 75 \nyears since its founding. It is my pleasure to extend my \ncongratulations and thanks to this group for their decades of service \nand dedication to their music and to the people of Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/04/senate-section/article/S9981-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/04/senate-section/article/S9981-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/04/senate-section/article/S9981-4", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9981-S9983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-9221.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nprovide for the protection and enhancement of the environmental \nintegrity and the social and economic benefits of the Finger Lakes \nRegion in the State of New York; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, it is an honor to introduce the \nFinger Lakes Initiative Act of 2002. The Finger Lakes are the heart of \nNew York. They stretch across most of the State and nurture an endless \nsupply of natural and economic resources. They attract visitors from \nacross the country, and they deserve our support to maintain and \nstrengthen the quality of life in the entire region.\n  The Finger Lakes Region of New York State is a land of rolling hills, \nbeautiful lakes, pastoral firms, and incomparable fish and wildlife \nresources. A critical environmental resource, the Lakes are also vital \nto the region's economy, generating a tremendous amount of tourism and \ncommerce. Fishing, boating, hunting, wineries, farmers markets and the \narts attract visitors from around the nation to the Finger Lakes \nregion. The Finger Lakes region also includes some of the Northeast's \nmost productive agricultural lands.\n  While Central New York is truly blessed with the environmental, \neconomic, and cultural benefits that the Finger Lakes provide, the \nhealth of the Finger Lakes can no longer be taken for granted. Recent \nreports have confirmed what many residents in New York already know, \nthe Finger Lakes are under environmental stress. In many of the lakes, \nwater quality has suffered. Fluctuating water levels and flooding north \nof the lakes has also increased. In addition, a significant amount of \nfish and wildlife habitat is being lost and threats are being posed by \nthe introduction of invasive species.\n  Local, State, and Federal officials have recognized the seriousness \nof these threats, and have worked to address these concerns. Local \nstakeholders have joined forces and are working to protect the lakes, \ndeveloping management plans, implementing best management practices, \nand doing what they can to protect the resource that is truly their \nbackyard. Yet there is still no comprehensive, regional action plan to \naddress collective environmental protection and economic development \ngoals for the region.\n  In recent years, Congress has recognized that our Nation's \nenvironmental resources are best protected on an ecosystem or watershed \nbasis, with the federal government providing funds and expertise to \nassist with protection efforts that are shaped by State and local \ninterests. This approach has been taken with great success in \nChesapeake Bay, the Great Lakes, the Long Island Sound, and the \nCalifornia Bay Delta, just to name a few.\n  Just as the Federal Government has supported these national \ntreasures, it is time for the Finger Lakes to be recognized as a region \nto be protected and enhanced for the economic and environmental benefit \nof all who live, work, farm, play, and visit the Finger Lakes.\n  Under the Finger Lakes Initiative Act of 2002, which I am introducing \ntoday with Senator Schumer, a new program will be established within \nthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to protect and enhance the \nenvironmental integrity and cultural and economic benefits of the \nFinger Lakes. The Initiative will assist Finger Lakes stakeholders in \nachieving their goals for the region through technical, scientific, and \nfinancial assistance and coordination of relevant Federal programs.\n  To best serve the interests of the region and build upon the \nknowledge, expertise, and ongoing efforts of local stakeholders, the \nlegislation establishes an official stakeholder group to aid in \ndeveloping and implementing\n\n[[Page S9985]]\n\nthe Initiative. The stakeholder group will be comprised of \nrepresentatives from local businesses, regional planning agencies, \nacademic institutions, homeowners associations, environmental \norganizations, agricultural interests, economic development interests, \nthe tourism industry, and tribes, as well as representatives of \nFederal, State, and local governments.\n  This stakeholder group will have three years to develop a \ncomprehensive plan to provide for the protection and enhancement of the \nenvironmental integrity and the social and economic benefits of the \nFinger Lakes. The plan will be made available for public review and \ncomment, including a number of public meetings throughout the Finger \nLakes region. Once approved by the EPA Administrator, with the \nconcurrence of the Governor, the plan will become the blueprint for \nfederally supported activities in the region.\n  Furthermore, there will be an interdisciplinary research and \neducation program established as part of the Finger Lakes Initiative, \nincluding $5 million in federal support authorized for a Finger Lakes \nInstitute, such as the Institute that was recently announced at the \nHobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, NY.\n  Overall, the bill authorizes $50 million in federal support over five \nyears for efforts to protect and enhance the environmental, economic \nand cultural benefits of the Finger Lakes. And to ensure proper \ninvolvement and coordination among all federal agencies in addressing \nthe needs and challenges in the Finger Lakes, appropriate financial, \ntechnical, and scientific assistance will be provided for the Finger \nLakes Initiative by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. \nGeological Survey, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National \nPark Service, the U.S. Department of Agricultural, the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration, the Economic Development \nAdministration, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n  For decades, the Finger Lakes region has held its own in the world. \nThe lakes, the farms, the towns, the wildlife, and the recreational \nopportunities have all pulled people toward this part of the State. I, \nmyself, was drawn there in August and spent time in Auburn, Seneca \nFalls, Hammondsport, and Geneva. Seeing the potential of this region, I \ncan just imagine the possibilities when we finally reach out to the \nFinger Lakes Region--when we finally provide this region with the \nresources and the attention and the planning it deserves. The \npossibilities are endless.\n  There is room in our Nation for another natural wonder, the Finger \nLakes Region of New York State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/04/senate-section/article/S9985-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9985-S9995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Bayh):\n  S. 3057. A bill to support the establishment or expansion and \noperation of programs using a network of public and private community \nentities to provide mentoring for children in foster care; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, in 1999, several of us, including the \nlate John Chafee and former First Lady, Hillary Clinton, took a long \nhard look at our Nation's foster care system and in particular those \nwhom the system failed. Each year 25,000 young people leave our foster \ncare system without ever finding a permanent family. Too many of these \nyoung people have been in this system for the majority of their lives, \nmoved from home to home to home, school to school, with no one to count \non or turn to for guidance and no where to call ``home.''\n  Studies show that within two to four years of leaving foster care, \nonly half have completed high school, fewer than half are employed, \none-fourth have been homeless for at least one night, 30 percent did \nnot have access to needed health care, 60 percent of the young women \nhave given birth, and less than one-in-five are completely self-\nsupporting. In addition, many States report that the overwhelming \nmajority of youth offenders housed in their State prisons were once a \npart of our Nation's foster care system.\n  While these statistics are, in and of themselves. disturbing, as \nauthor, Ruth Sidel, once said, ``statistics are people with the tears \nwiped away.'' It is easier for us to think of the almost 600,000 \nchildren making their way through our foster care system as numbers, \nbut they are not. They are children. And like every child, they are \nborn with a need to belong, to be loved, to feel protected and \nsheltered. When we were working on the John Chafee Foster Care \nIndependence Act of 1999, a young woman named Lisa, who had spent her \nlife in foster care explained this concept better than I ever could. \nShe said, ``even at 21, I dream about having someone to call when I am \nnot sure whether you wash whites in warm or cold water, someone to tell \nme that they are proud that I got an A on my Biology test, and most \nimportantly someone who will love me no matter what. Other kids have \nthat and they are lucky.''\n  One of my goals as United States Senator is to change our foster care \nsystem so children like Lisa do not fall through it's cracks. When you \nstop and think about it, there is no such thing as a foster care \n``system'', its just people, and these children do not fall through \n``cracks'', they fall through our fingers. I, for one, intend to do \nwhat I can to ensure that each and every child in the world goes to bed \nat night blanketed with the security that only a family of their own \ncan provide. The legislation that I am here to introduce today by no \nmeans solves the many problems facing our kids in care, but it will go \na long way toward ensuring that they do not fall through our fingers.\n  The Foster Care Mentoring Act of 2002 authorizes $15 million a year \nto be used by States to create a statewide foster care mentor program \nthat aims to match a trained, responsible adult with each and every \nchild in care. Last week, I had the chance to sit down with an \norganization, Children Uniting Nations and the First Lady of \nCalifornia, Sharon Davis, and they shared with me the enormous success \nthey have had in California with a program like this. The mentors \nprovide friendship, guidance, academic tutoring and most importantly \nconsistency to children who are in desperate need of such things. In \naddition, this legislation provides Federal student loan forgiveness \nfor each mentor that contributes at least 200 hours a year to a child \nin need.\n  Although a mentor can never take the place of a permanent family, \nthey can make sure these children do not get lost in a system designed \nto protect them. Mentors can give these children the tools they need to \nsurvive and help guide and protect them as they wait for the permanent \nhome they need and deserve. I hope that my colleagues will join me in \nsupport of this legislation.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nlegislation I have been working on with Senator Landrieu to ensure our \nfoster care youth are provided every opportunity to develop into \nbright, capable adults and become productive and valuable members of \nour society. The Foster Care Mentoring Act will help provide a foster \ncare child with a role model, tutor and friend.\n  Although there are several concerns with the administration of our \nchild welfare system, this bill is one way we can immediately provide \nnecessary relief and guidance to children who have been the victims of \nabuse and neglect. This legislation takes a necessary step toward \nproviding these children with a healthy stable environment. There are \nover half a million children in the nation's foster care system, 7,482 \nchildren in Indiana alone. As the guardian of these children, the \ngovernment should take all possible steps to help them overcome their \nbarriers.\n  As a result of the abuse foster care children have experienced, they \nare less likely to trust adults, create healthy relationships, and \nperform academically. Mentors will help them establish trusting \nrelationships, assist them with their school work, and develop \nemotionally. Mentors will remind foster care youth that they are wanted \nmembers of our society who deserve every opportunity to achieve their \ndreams.\n  Mentors have proven to have positive impacts on the youth they \nmentor. Children that have mentors have better relationships with \nadults, fewer disciplinary referrals, and more confidence to achieve \ntheir goals. Research shows that caring adults can make a difference in \nchildren's lives: 46 percent of mentored teens are less likely to use \ndrugs; 59 percent of mentored\n\n[[Page S9986]]\n\nteens have better academic performance; 73 percent of mentored teens \nachieve higher goals generally.\n  The Foster Care Mentoring Act authorizes $15 million a year to ensure \nthat each mentor receives the appropriate training, makes a long-term \ncommitment to the program, and fulfills educational requirements to \nmentor foster care youth. Mentoring foster care youth is another way \nyoung citizens can serve their country. This bill would reward those \nwho take time to assist those in need. Each college-bound individual \nwill have $2,000 forgiven from their student loans for every 200 hours \nthey serve as a mentor to a foster care child. States will have the \nflexibility to coordinate with already existing programs to create \nmentor-child partnerships. In addition, the legislation would provide \n$4 million a year for the creation and administration of a national \nhotline and website to coordinate mentoring efforts.\n  Although we should work together to ensure each child in the foster \ncare system is placed in a loving, stable, safe, and permanent home, in \nthe meantime we can at least provide them with a guiding friend. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to implement this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Allard, Mr. Reid, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 3058. A bill to amend the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \nCompensation Program Act of 2000 to provide benefits for contractor \nemployees of the Department of Energy who were exposed to toxic \nsubstances at Department of Energy facilities, to provide coverage \nunder subtitle B of that Act for certain additional individuals, to \nestablish an ombudsman and otherwise reform the assistance provided to \nclaimants under that Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, two years ago we enacted the Energy \nEmployees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act, EEOICPA. This \nimportant legislation was intended to give timely, uniform and \nreasonable compensation to Department of Energy employees suffering \ninjury and disease resulting from working in the nuclear weapons \nprogram.\n  The program has two parts: a Federal component for certain diseases, \nand, for all others, an assistance program for the filing of State \nworkers' compensation claims. The Federal component, for workers made \nill by exposure to substances unique to DOE facilities, gives a one-\ntime $150,000 payment and covers medical payments for illnesses like \nberyllium disease, certain cancers and silicosis.\n  Since the passage of the original act in October 2000 a number of \nadditional issues, complicating factors and implementation barriers \nhave emerged. Recently I held a public meeting in Espanola, New Mexico \nwith Representative Tom Udall, to review the performance of the \nprogram. The gathering, attending by over 300 present and former \nworkers, focused on three broad issues: delays in processing claims, \nmissing radiation exposure records and difficulty gaining compensation \nfor exposure to toxic substances, like mercury.\n  Upon my return I continued to investigate the implementation barriers \nfacing the program. Meetings with Department of Energy, Labor and HHS \nofficials as well as experts in occupational health and workers \ncompensation revealed further flaws. Let me describe some of the \nproblems this legislation is intended to address based on what I have \nrecently learned.\n  First, with regard to subtitle D, the program relies on an \namalgamation of private insurance, state workers compensation programs \nand DOE contractor self-insurance for the timely and fair payment of \nmedical costs and lost wages. Unfortunately, Department of Energy \nofficials recently stated that up to 50 percent of all eligible \nbeneficiaries would not have access to a willing payor. Assistant \nSecretary of Energy Beverly Cook in a June 7, 2002 letter noted DOE \ncannot give directives to ``persons who are not DOE contractors, such \nas insurers or lessees of DOE facilities.'' In short, workers found to \nhave a meritorious claim under the program may not have a payor. The \nlegislation introduced today would address this problem by making DOE \nthe defacto for all claims.\n  Further, the Department of Energy failed, for nearly two years \nfollowing the passage of the legislation, to publish a rule crucial for \nthe submission of subtitle D claims. The physician panel rule is a \ncritical component allowing injury claims to be adjudicated by a panel \nof physicians specializing in occupational medicine. Since the \ninception of the program and because of delays like the one described \nabove, only four claims have been sent to the physician panel for \nreview. Clearly, we must do better. My legislation simplifies the \nprocess to allow the expeditious handling of claims.\n  The dangers faced by these workers is only now being fully \nunderstood. In addition to certain cancers, silicosis and beryllium \ndisease, increased risk for other maladies are now being discovered. In \nmy own State of New Mexico I have workers suffering from mercury \npoisoning, once known as ``Mad Hatters'' disease. Mr. Alex Smith of \nEspanola operated a mercury still for many years at the Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory. At one point Mr. Smith displayed all the signs of \nboth acute and chronic mercury poisoning. He approached LANL's medical \nclinic seeking treatment only to be told he was not suffering from \nmercury poisoning. Documentation later revealed a different story. In \nfact, the physician did suspect Mr. Smith suffered from mercury \ntoxicity but, for reasons we can only speculate on now, failed to act. \nAccording to the Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance, during the \n1950's a majority of the world's mercury was used in the production of \nnuclear weapons. Although mercury usage is not unique to DOE \nfacilities, the volumes utilized in these facilities, at one point 70 \npercent of the world's supply, set mercury toxicity in this setting \napart from other exposures.\n\n  Recent data has revealed an increased risk of chronic renal disease \nand lung cancer from exposure to uranium and beryllium, respectively. \nAlthough lung cancer can arise from many causes, clear scientific data \npoints to beryllium disease as a precursor for this devastating \nillness. As well, chronic renal disease has many etiologies with \nuranium among them. Like mercury, these exposures and the consequent \nillnesses are unique to the environment workers found themselves in and \nshould be recognized.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, along with Senators Bunning, \nHarkin, Allard and Reid, entitled the Energy Workers Compensation Act \nof 2002 is intended to fulfill the original legislative objectives of \nCongress, address unforeseen obstacles and assure just compensation for \nour Nation's energy workers.\n  The Energy Workers Compensation Act of 2002 addresses and improves \nthe shortcomings of the original legislation by: Establishing the \nDepartment of Labor as the willing payor of benefits for claimants \napproved by the Department of Energy under Subtitle D. Benefit payments \nare authorized from the previously established EEOICPA fund. Setting \ntime limits for DOE to make determinations regarding claimant's \nemployment records. Setting at 150 days the time limit for the \nreconstruction of worker's radiation dosages. Adding lung cancer to a \nlist of covered beryllium related diseases. Adding chronic renal \ndisease as a covered illness for uranium workers. Adding mercury \ndisease as a covered illness for workers employed at facilities \nutilizing more than 100 kilograms of mercury. Establishing an ombudsman \nto help claimants with administration of claims. Allowing individuals \notherwise eligible for compensation under EEOICPA, but who previously \nreceived Radiation Exposure Compensation Act awards, to be compensated \nat levels equal to EEOICPA.\n  It is imperative we protect those who helped America win the cold \nwar. Members of the House of Representatives have come to similar \nconclusion. Representatives Whitfield and Strickland have recently \nintroduced legislation similar to ours. They too realize that promises \nmade to cold war era workers and families must be kept. A debt of \ngratitude to these workers, who became sick through no fault of their \nown, must be paid.\n  I request unanimous consent that the bill and selected testimony be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S9987]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3058\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Workers Compensation \n     Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \n     Program Act of 2000 (the ``Act'') was intended to ensure \n     timely, uniform, and adequate compensation of covered \n     employees (and, where applicable, survivors of such \n     employees) suffering from illnesses incurred by such \n     employees in the performance of duty for the Department of \n     Energy and certain of its contractors, subcontractors, and \n     vendors, and to provide parity for uranium miners under the \n     Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (42 U.S.C. 2210 note).\n       (2) Four Federal agencies, the Departments of Labor, Health \n     and Human Services, Energy, and Justice, have been assigned \n     responsibilities under the Act pursuant to Executive Order \n     No. 13179, dated December 7, 2000 (42 U.S.C. 7384 note).\n       (3) The Department of Labor began accepting claims July 31, \n     2001, and the Department of Health and Human Services, \n     through the National Institute for Occupational Safety and \n     Health, will perform radiation dose reconstruction for cancer \n     claims and evaluate petitions for Special Exposure Cohorts.\n       (4) The Department of Energy finalized its regulations \n     governing claims under Subtitle D of the Act on August 14, \n     2002. Those regulations require claimants to use a State \n     workers' compensation system to secure benefits after \n     receiving a positive findings from a Department of Energy \n     physicians panel. The Department of Energy has conceded, \n     however, that it will not have a willing payor for as many as \n     50 percent of the claims that are meritorious. As a \n     consequence, many deserving claimants with a positive \n     determination from a Department of Energy physicians panel \n     will nonetheless be denied benefits.\n       (5) The Department of Energy's regulations (at 10 C.F.R. \n     Part 852) direct contractors of the Department to adopt a \n     non-adversarial posture in state workers' compensation \n     proceedings, which are structured as an adversarial forum. \n     The policy of inserting a non-adversarial respondent in an \n     adversarial system should be remedied by utilizing a non-\n     adversarial dispute resolution system. Taxpayers would also \n     benefit from placing claimants in a non-adversarial system, \n     such as the type of systems administered by the Department of \n     Labor under subtitle B of the Act or under chapter 81 of \n     title 5, United States Code (known as the Federal Employees \n     Compensation Act), as doing so would assure that disabilities \n     related to occupational illnesses would be compensated \n     proportional to the degree of injury.\n       (6) In order to assure that congressional intent is honored \n     with respect to the Department of Energy's program of worker \n     assistance with state worker compensation for occupational \n     illnesses that arose out of the course of employment from \n     exposure to toxic substances at Department of Energy \n     facilities, the Department of Energy's implementation of \n     subtitle D of the Act requires reform, refinement, and \n     clarification.\n       (7) Certain renal diseases related to uranium exposure and \n     cancers related to employment by beryllium vendors should be \n     added to coverage under subtitle B.\n       (8) Congress intended that follow-up implementing \n     legislation would be required when it passed the Act and, in \n     section 3613 of the Act, directed the administration to \n     provide such legislation. Although such legislation was \n     forwarded on January 15, 2001, and Congress adopted technical \n     amendments to the Act in 2001, significant shortcomings in \n     the Act have been identified as the Act has been implemented.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to amend the \n     Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program \n     Act of 2000 to--\n       (1) ensure that meritorious claims for exposure to toxic \n     substances at Department of Energy facilities are compensated \n     under subtitle D of the Act;\n       (2) enhance assistance to claimants at the Department of \n     Labor;\n       (3) ensure that there is parity in treatment of chronic \n     renal disease between uranium-exposed Department of Energy \n     employees (including employees of contractors, \n     subcontractors, and atomic weapons employer facilities) and \n     the uranium-exposed workers under the Radiation Exposure \n     Compensation Act;\n       (4) provide coverage of lung cancer for covered beryllium \n     workers; and\n       (5) make administrative improvements and technical \n     corrections.\n\n TITLE I--WORKERS' COMPENSATION BENEFITS FOR DOE CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEES \n                      EXPOSED TO TOXIC SUBSTANCES\n\n     SEC. 101.

And after 9/11, \n     when there's been so much talk about patriotism and doing the \n     right thing by people who helped their country, on behalf of \n     Levi and others similarly situated, I would just ask the \n     Congress and the Administration to remember those words and \n     not let them be hollow, empty phrases. Thank you very much. \n     (Applause.)\n       Mr. Smith: My name is Alex Smith. I'm a 33-year employee \n     with the Lab. I testified before Tom and Senator Bingaman and \n     David Michaels the last time. I went to work for the Lab in \n     1947 in the chemical warehouse. Tom and Bingaman already know \n     and I've been doing this for your benefit.\n       I went to work for the chemical warehouse there at the Lab \n     in the old TA 1. My duties\n\n[[Page S9992]]\n\n     were clerk and to issue laboratory chemicals and laboratory \n     glassware, and when we had time, I'd run a mercury, still, me \n     and another fellow named Lewis Devetima.\n       In 1948, early in 1948, I started having trouble. My face \n     would swell up, and my gums were bleeding. And I would go \n     down to Q Building to see Dr. Whipple, and he would send me \n     home. He said, ``You're allergic to something,'' and that was \n     it.\n       And when my face went back down, I'd come back to work and \n     it would happen all over again. About the fourth time, I got \n     to see Dr. Harriet Harding, who was a consultant there, and \n     she interviewed me. Luckily, I got to see her. And she asked \n     me where I worked, and I told her. She asked me what my \n     duties were, and I told her that I run a mercury still when I \n     didn't issue chemicals.\n       She said, ``You're operating what?''\n       I said, ``I operate a mercury still.''\n       She said, ``Take me up there and show it to me.''\n       So I did. She shut it down. And so we were full, me and \n     Lewis Devetima were full of mercury. We used to heat it, and \n     it had a still, like it was made out of glassware. It would \n     go through this, heat it, and form a gas, go through that, \n     come out condensed on that end, pure mercury. And we would \n     breathe in vapors, and it was in a small 10 x 10. The old \n     warehouse there in TA 1 was a shed. It was formerly the \n     stable for the school that was there before the Lab took \n     over, and they converted it into a chemical shop.\n       Anyway, when I retired in 1982--prior to 1982, I suffered \n     from depression, bleeding gums, and so I went to the doctor \n     there at the Lab. I was in very bad shape, and she sent me to \n     a sanitarium in Albuquerque, and I spent some time there, \n     about two or three weeks. I then was on an outpatient to Dr. \n     Kenneth Poole there in Albuquerque for about three years.\n       And then I came back and was under the tutelage of Dr. \n     William Oakes who worked for the H Division, and then he \n     retired. And I saw Dr. Charles Shafer, and then he retired. \n     And then I saw Dr. Ralph Greer. And anyway, when I retired, I \n     noticed that there was no record of this sickness on my \n     medical records.\n       And I asked Dr. Greer why. And he said they searched and \n     they searched and they searched and they even went back into \n     the microfilms, and they could find no evidence of anything \n     to do with a mercury still or anything. So I retired thinking \n     that.\n       When I testified before Mr. Bingaman and Mr. Udall and Mr. \n     Michaels, I didn't have any evidence. It was my story against \n     theirs. And I have met a fellow named Ken Silver. He found \n     these letters from Dr. Harding telling the whole story in six \n     letters, and the DOE database of historical documents, it \n     tells the whole story about me and Devetima's sickness, about \n     the mercury still, their shutting it down.\n       These are all H Division letters to our division leader, \n     Van Gammer, Assistant Property Division leader. Yet they \n     couldn't find them. There was no evidence. They're here, \n     right here. Everything I have reverts back to those six \n     letters. In one of them, she refers to a fellow name Carl \n     Butler. I happen to know Carl Butler, so I wrote him a \n     letter telling him what was happening. He wrote me back a \n     five-page handwritten letter confirming everything that I \n     said when I testified, everything, even to closing down \n     and admitted that nobody in 1947 and 1948 in H Division \n     knew anything about mercury until an industrial engineer \n     named Harold Sheeton--Harry Sheeton--came on board, and \n     this was months later.\n       And after I got that letter from Butler, I wrote a letter \n     to Mr. Udall and Mr. Bingaman, asking him--I sent them a copy \n     of those six letters. I didn't give them a copy of this, but \n     I did take it to Mr. Udall's office, everything I had, when \n     you were in Federal Place over there, and I gave it to Raul \n     and he made copies of it. He said he would forward it on to \n     you, your office.\n       And this is my letter to Senator Bingaman asking that you \n     amend that Act to include mercury. I don't know what happened \n     there. I got a letter from Mr. Udall there, and he asked that \n     I get documentation. So I've got it. Don't you think I have \n     it? And you asked for names and addresses of people that are \n     working. I can give you names, Mr. Udall, but they all got \n     one address: Cemetery. There's no--me and Mr. Butler are the \n     only ones alive that I know that knew about that mercury \n     still, and why I'm still around, I don't know.\n       After that, Mr. Silver came up with a couple more \n     publications by Dr. Harriet Potter on mercury poisoning. \n     Anybody that knows anything about mercury should read it. She \n     even enlightened me. I guess she really dug in to her \n     research. And in this--the other one is Challenging Manmade \n     Decisions by Harriet Potter. I'll read you just one paragraph \n     here.\n       On page 54 it tells about the year 1948 in Los Alamos, \n     nonradioactive acting hazard material in use in Los Alamos. \n     ``An example will make this clear. Very soon after I began \n     active duty, a worker came to the nurse in H-2 complaining \n     with bleeding gums and skin rash.'' That's me. ``In taking \n     his job history, I found he and three other men were engaged \n     in cleaning dirty mercury, an element widely used.\n       ``Next, I visited the job site. And even though I had no \n     engineering skill, I knew from my Massachusetts Department of \n     Occupational Hygiene experience that the mercury hazard was \n     great in this dirty, shed-like building.''\n       I could go on, but I haven't got time, but you get the \n     drift. And I don't know where to go from here. I know mercury \n     is not covered in the Act. Like I say, I'm asking you to \n     amend it to include mercury. Thank you very much for \n     listening to me. I'm probably out of time. (Applause.)\n       Mr. Leyba: The next person will be Phil Schofield.\n       Mr. Schofield: Thank you for coming, Beverly Cook and \n     Congressman Udall, Senator Bingaman, Mr. Turcic, Mr. Elliot. \n     I'll try to keep my time short here.\n       I worked for Los Alamos National Lab for 2 years. I suffer \n     from several severe health problems, multiple chemical \n     sensitivities, HO cervical syndrome, respiratory problems, \n     severe dermatology problems, swelling of my extremities. I \n     have short-term memory and concentration deficits, and plus I \n     lost almost half my hearing.\n       Mainly what I would like to address is some problems with \n     the reconstruction of people's dosages. I can give you two \n     quick examples where personnel worked in the same room. One \n     was a--it depended on your job. You * * *\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the Energy \nWorkers Compensation Act of 2002, EWCA.\n  During the Cold War, workers employed at the Department of Energy \nsites across the country served our country by helping to make nuclear \nweapons. But, for over 50 years of manufacturing these weapons, we now \nknow that the Department of Energy consistently sacrificed health and \nsafety of the workers and placed them in harm's way without their \nknowledge. Many of these workers subsequently became ill due to their \nwork with radioactive and toxic substances at the sites.\n  In 2000, Congress passed legislation, the Energy Employees \nOccupational Illness Compensation Program Act, EEOICPA, to establish \ncompensation programs for Department of Energy workers who became sick \nas a result of their work. The bill addressed compensation for \nillnesses caused by the workers' exposure to radiation, beryllium, and \nnumerous toxic substances. EEOICPA created two separate programs: \nSubtitle B of the law provided a program administered by the Department \nof Labor that would give a lump sum $150,000 payment to workers exposed \nto radiation and beryllium; and, subtitle D of the law provided a \nprogram administered by the Department of Energy that relied on State \nworker compensation programs to make compensation payments to workers \nexposed to toxic substances. Subtitle D is what the EWCA legislation \naddresses.\n  Currently, under subtitle D the Department of Energy uses a \nphysician's panel to review workers' claims and determine whether a \nworker's illness is related to work at a Department of Energy site. \nUpon a positive finding, the panel relies upon individual State worker \ncompensation programs to make payments for wage loss and medical \nbenefits. The Department of Energy, however, has admitted that nearly \nhalf of the claimants will not be able to pinpoint a responsible payor \nwho will be able to honor the Department of Energy Physician Panel \nfinding because many contractors no longer are associated with DoE.\n  Congress intended a uniform and equitable Federal compensation \nprogram for these employees who worked to serve our country. The \nGovernment should not sit idly by and let this problem fester knowing \nthat so many claimants will not receive any compensation.\n  Introduction of the Energy Workers Compensation Act of 2002 will \nfulfill the original legislative objectives of Congress to assure \ncompensation to all of our country's energy workers who were made ill \ndue to their work with toxic substances. The legislation would correct \nsubtitle D by making the Department of Labor responsible for paying \nthose sick workers who are determined eligible to receive compensation.\n  We are only now beginning to realize the dangers that the energy \nworkers faced. These workers thought they were serving our country and \nwere unaware of the risks they took to win the Cold War. We must do all \nwe can to protect the energy workers to make sure they receive just \ncompensation for the illnesses and disabilities they incurred from \ntheir jobs at the Department of Energy nuclear weapons sites.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n\n[[Page S9993]]\n\n  S. 3059. A bill to provide for the distribution of judgment funds to \nthe Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nprovide for the use and distribution of judgment funds awarded to the \nAssiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation in northeast \nMontana.\n  In 1987, the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck \nReservation brought suit against the United States to recover interest \nearned on their trust funds while those funds were in Special Deposit \nand IMPL-Agency accounts. The case was filed in the United States \nClaims court, and docketed as No. 773-87-L.\n  After the Court ruled that the United States was liable to the Fort \nPeck Tribes and individual Indians for interest on those funds, the \nTribes and the United States reached an agreement for settling claims \nin the case, for the sum of $4,522,551.84. The court approved the \nsettlement agreement.\n  The settlement agreement further provided that the judgment be \ndivided between the Fort Peck Tribes and those individual Indians who \nare found to be eligible to share in the judgment. On January 31, 2001, \nthe court approved a stipulation between the parties that defined the \nprocedures by which the Fort Peck Tribes' and individual Indians' \nrespective shares in the judgment would be determined and distributed \nto them.\n  Pursuant to the Court-approved stipulation in the case, on February \n14, 2001, a portion of the Tribe's share of the judgment was deposited \ninto an account in Treasury for the use of the Fort Peck Tribes. As \nprovided by the Court-approved stipulation, those funds are to be \navailable for immediate use by the Tribe pursuant to a plan adopted \nunder the Indian Tribal Judgment Funds Use or Distribution Act, 25 \nU.S.C. 1401 et seq. The Court-approved stipulation further recognized \nthat the Tribe will most likely receive additional payments from this \nsettlement once the work identifying all individuals eligible to share \nin the judgment is completed and the pro rata shares are finally \ncomputed. Those funds, too, are to be available for use by the Tribe in \naccord with a plan adopted under the Tribal Judgment Funds Use or \nDistribution Act.\n  As required by the stipulation and the Tribal Judgment Funds Use or \nDistribution Act, the Tribe developed a plan for the use of the Tribe's \nshare of the settlement. Under the plan, the Tribe's share of the \njudgment will be used for tribal health, education, housing and social \nservices program.\n  The Tribe submitted its plan to the Department of the Interior for \nreview and approval. Public hearings were held during which the views \nand recommendations of Tribal members were heard regarding the plan. \nThe Tribe has been advised that the Department of Interior has no \nobjection to the Tribe's plan and can approve it. However, although the \nplan was developed and public hearing held during 2001, the Interior \nDepartment did not complete its review of the plan, nor submit the \napproved plan to Congress within the one-year deadline imposed by the \nTribal Judgment Funds Use or Distribution Act. As a result, in order \nfor the Fort Peck Tribe to make use of the judgment awarded to the \nTribe, it is necessary for Congress to formally adopt legislation \napproving the Tribe's plan. The proposed bill language, would serve \nthis purpose.\n  This judgment is based on money that rightfully belongs to the Fort \nPeck tribes and should be moved expeditiously through Congress. I look \nforward to working with the Committee on Indian Affairs to move this \nlegislation forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 3060. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nprotections for human participants in research; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nachieve reforms in our system of oversight for protecting the safety of \nhuman subjects in research. As the Institute of Medicine report \nreleased today again demonstrates, reforms are long overdue. The moment \nhas come to take action to restore the trust and confidence of those \nwho serve as subjects in clinical trials and other forms of research.\n  We passed the National Research Act over twenty years ago as an \nimportant step toward protecting against inhuman research experiments \nand conditions. We have developed guidelines to ensure that people \nparticipating in medical research have clearly agreed to be a part of \nthe study and will be treated humanely during the study.\n  These protections benefit the people participating as subjects in \nmedical research, but they also help those conducting the research. If \npatients fear that they will not be protected or that the researchers \ndo not have their best interests in mind, patients will not volunteer \nto take part in these needed tests.\n  As we all know, a revolution is taking place in medicine today. \nScientists have mapped the human genome. They have made incredible \nbreakthroughs in treatments for cancer and AIDS. It is not unreasonable \nto expect that we will see cancer cured, a quadriplegic stand up and \nwalk, new drugs that prevent Alzheimer's and AIDS, and other advances \nwe cannot even begin to imagine. But for all these advances to take \nplace, new treatments will first have to be tested on human subjects. \nFor these studies to succeed, patients must have confidence in our \nsystem and must be willing to participate in medical research. We must \nprotect patients when they volunteer for these tests. To do otherwise \nwould jeopardize this very hopeful future.\n  Many of those who participate in these studies are the most \nvulnerable members of our society and are the most in need of our \nprotection. We are now benefiting from drugs that have been developed \nand tested outside the United States. Our country is based on the \npremise that all people are created equal. Basic protections that are \ngood enough for research subjects in the United States should be good \nenough for research subjects in other nations who volunteer for tests \nthat will benefit all of us.\n  We also must face the fact that medical research is constantly \nchanging. Protections that were put in place 20 years ago no longer \ncover all human research projects. New studies in areas such as gene \ntherapy have raised safety and ethical concerns requiring special \nscrutiny.\n  Institutional Review Boards, which review the safety and ethical \nacceptability of research involving human subjects, are overworked and \nunderfunded. Loopholes in the system allow researchers who have had \nproposals rejected by one Board to reapply to a second Board in the \nhope of obtaining a more lenient review--all without notifying the \nsecond Board of the decision of the first. We do little to train \nresearchers about methods for protecting human subjects. Many \nresearchers with the best intentions are not knowledgeable of the \nlatest changes to regulations.\n  These shortcomings cry out for a response, especially at this moment \nin history that holds so much promise for future medical research. The \nlegislation I am introducing addresses these issues by expanding \nresearch subject protections and strengthening the review and oversight \nmechanisms to ensure that all human subjects are properly protected.\n  The legislation will, for the first time, ensure that all \nparticipants in such research are protected by a comprehensive and \nstrong set of safeguards. The legislation provides clear statutory \nauthorization for these protections and establishes a central office to \nreview and amend current rules for the protections.\n  The legislation will improve Institutional Review Boards by \nstrengthening firewalls against conflicts of interest and enhancing \ntraining for Board members. The bill will provide the Boards with the \nfunding they need to be effective, by allowing human subject protection \ncosts to be charged as direct costs on federal grants. The bill will \nend ``IRB shopping'', the practice in which a proposal rejected by one \nBoard for ethical reasons is submitted to a second Board in the hope of \nobtaining a more lenient review. The legislation will require that \nevery Board receives accreditation to assure that it is carrying out \nits duties effectively and rigorously.\n  The legislation will assist researchers in learning more about the \nbest practices for protecting human subjects, by creating programs to \nimprove\n\n[[Page S9994]]\n\ntraining for researchers in good research practices. The bill \nstrengthens the firewalls against financial conflicts of interest for \nresearchers, and will require the establishment of regulations to \ngovern payment of research subjects.\n  The legislation will also enhance the ethical review of clinical \ntrials conducted overseas with federal funding or submitted to FDA for \nreview, by requiring that research conducted overseas that falls within \nU.S. regulatory jurisdiction must be reviewed and approved by a U.S. \nInstitutional Review Board. The bill enhances the review of areas of \nresearch that raise special safety concerns, such as gene therapy and \nxenotransplantation.\n  We must act now to improve our protections for human research \nsubjects, so that patients will feel confident enough to volunteer for \nthe many vital research projects that will be developed in coming \nyears. These reforms will have a significant role in improving medical \ncare. But even more important, these safeguards will protect our fellow \nhuman beings. The people this bill protects are not numbers of \nstatistics. They are someone's mother, daughter, or spouse. Mistakes \nand abuses that hurt them affect their families, friends, and \ncommunities.\n  We are a great people and a great nation. We are a moral people and \nan ethical nation. We must do all we can to see that our great medical \nadvances of the future do not come at an unnecessary cost of death and \nsuffering by patients who first volunteered to test these new medical \ntreatments. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact these \nneeded reforms as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the analysis was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    The Research Revitalization Act\n\n       The current oversight system for protecting human subjects \n     is overdue for reform. Rules for research subject protection \n     do not cover all research. Protections for research subjects \n     are largely based on regulation rather than statute. There is \n     no Federal lead agency charged with amending and issuing \n     guidance on the rules for research subject protections, \n     resulting in an often confusing set of divergent regulations \n     across different Federal research agencies. In addition, \n     since no single agency can amend the research rules, the \n     rules themselves have not been updated in years and have not \n     kept pace with the changing nature of research. To address \n     these problems, the bill will: 1. Ensure that all human \n     subjects in all research are covered by strong protections. \n     2. Provide a clear statutory authorization for research \n     subject protections. 3. Establish a central office to amend \n     the rules for research subject protection.\n       Institutional Review Boards, IRBs are committees at \n     universities and hospitals that review the safety and ethical \n     acceptability of research involving human subjects. The IRB \n     system is under severe strain for several reasons. First, \n     IRBs are overworked and underfunded. Second, IRBs vary widely \n     in their training and effectiveness. Third, conflicts of \n     interest threaten the integrity or research. Fourth, \n     investigators can engage in ``IRB shopping'' whereby a \n     proposal rejected by one IRB for ethical reasons can be \n     submitted to a second board in the hope of a more lenient \n     review all without notifying the second IRB of the decision \n     of the first. To address these problems the bill will: 1. \n     Require accreditation of all IRBs to ensure that they do \n     their jobs adequately. To be accredited, IRBs would not only \n     have to review proposals to conduct research, but also \n     monitor such research once it is initiated. 2. End ``IRB \n     shopping'' by requiring notification of previous proposal \n     rejection. 3. Establish rules for financial conflict of \n     interest for IRB members. 4. Allow IRB expenses to be charged \n     as direct costs on Federal grants, so that universities can \n     give IRBs the resources they need to do their job. 5. Allow, \n     on a voluntary basis, a central IRB to review projects \n     conducted a multiple local research sites to provide for more \n     effective and efficient review.\n       Investigators conducting human subject research are often \n     poorly trained in protecting human subjects. As revealed by \n     the controversies surrounding gene therapy, financial \n     conflicts of interest can often compromise the objectivity or \n     researchers. Finally, payment of research subjects is \n     becoming common, but few standards have been established to \n     govern when and how a subject can or should be compensated. \n     To address these problems, the bill will: 1. Require HHS to \n     establish a model program to train researchers in good \n     research practices and then provide grants to allow \n     universities to establish similar programs. 2. Strengthen \n     current rules on financial conflict of interest for \n     researchers. Numerous studies have shown that the existing \n     system does a poor job in protecting against conflict of \n     interest. The proposal follows recent recommendations by the \n     AAMC. 3. Establish standards to govern payments to research \n     subjects.\n       Research projects involving human subjects that use federal \n     funds or support a submission to the FDA are subject to US \n     regulations even when conducted overseas. When conducted on \n     poorly educated and/or impoverished populations in nations \n     with weak local oversight, such research raises special \n     ethical concerns. First, subjects may not be adequately \n     protected when an ethical review is conduced in a country \n     without a strong infrastructure for research subject \n     protection. Second, there are significant ethical concerns \n     about conducting high-risk research on local populations who \n     will never receive the benefits of the products being tested \n     on them. Third, some subjects receive placebos or non-\n     treatment, even when effective treatments are available and \n     could be given to patients. The bill will: 1. Require review \n     by a US-accredited IRB of all human subject research \n     conducted overseas that falls within US regulatory \n     jurisdiction. This requirement would be waived where \n     standards of review are equivalent to those in the US, e.g. \n     EU, Australia, Canada. 2. Require rules governing the use of \n     placebos or non-treatment when effective therapies could be \n     administered to research subjects.\n       Certain areas of research, such as gene therapy or \n     xenotransplantation, raise unusual safety concerns. NBAC has \n     recommended special scrutiny for such areas, beyond simple \n     IRB review. The bill will require special monitoring of \n     adverse events in clinical trials of such research so that \n     threats to patient safety can be identified.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT:\n  S. 3061. A bill to impose greater accountability on the Tennessee \nValley Authority with respect to capital investment decisions and \nfinancing operations by increasing Congressional and Executive Branch \noversight; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Tennessee Valley Authority has long \nserved as an engine for economic development in my part of the country \nand has enjoyed widespread support for its efforts to provide power \nthat is needed to fuel the economy and enhance the quality of life of \nthose it serves. It is my desire to assist the TVA in continuing its \nlegacy and carrying out its mission. To provide that assistance, the \nCongress, the Administration, and the TVA itself must determine whether \nTVA's policies, practices, and long-term strategies are consistent with \nthe realities of today's marketplace.\n  The TVA is at a crossroads in its illustrious history. The United \nStates taxpayer and the power consumers in the TVA service area have \nprovided the capital necessary to develop, finance, and operate one of \nthe largest, if not the largest, public power systems in history. The \nTVA is now facing a number of challenges with respect to its existing \ngenerating system in the form of environmental compliance, aging and \nobsolete plants, and the urgent need to provide additional generating \ncapacity to meet the demands of the future. It is my belief that the \nUnited States taxpayer is unwilling and unable to continue to bear the \nfinancial burden and risks associated with addressing these challenges.\n  The reality of the marketplace for energy and the political \nimperatives with which we are confronted mandate that any new financing \nstrategies and supplemental sources of capital be considered and \nutilized by the TVA. Likewise, we need to review and analyze the short-\nterm and long-term financing and risk management strategies employed by \nthe TVA with respect to its almost $26 billion of debt.\n  During 2002, we have witnessed the results of risky and sometimes \ncorrupt corporate financing and management practices. Although I have \nno reason to believe that TVA has been involved in any such practices, \nI believe we have a responsibility to the taxpayers to examine the \nfinancing and disclosure practices of the TVA to ensure that their \ninvestment is being protected. I note that TVA has utilized short-term \nfinancing facilities and derivative securities as hedging and interest \nrate management techniques. We need to better understand the risks and \nrewards associated with these strategies.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would require that the \nTVA provide the Congress and the Administration with a 10-year business \noutlook and strategic plan with respect to its development and \nfinancing needs, as well as an analysis of its ongoing financing and \nrisk management strategies. During the period in which the\n\n[[Page S9995]]\n\nTVA is responding to this Congressional mandate, the TVA would be \nrequired to cease and desist from incurring new obligations or entering \ninto any arrangements for the development or financing of new, \nadditional, or replacement plant, equipment, or capacity. Likewise, \nduring this period the TVA would be required to gain the concurrence of \nthe Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the appropriate \nSenate and House Committee leaders before undertaking any additional \nfinancing or refinancing activities. The legislation specifically \nprovides for the necessary flexibility for the TVA to continue normal \noperations and fund necessary maintenance activities while complying \nwith this Congressional mandate.\n  I strongly support the TVA and I recognize its importance to the \neconomic health of several states in the southeastern United States, \nincluding my own. Indeed, the TVA is a critical component of the \ninfrastructure that supports the economy of the entire United States. \nIt is my desire in introducing this legislation that the TVA be \npositioned to meet the challenges of the 21st Century. Introduction of \nthis legislation is the first step to help the TVA achieve that goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG\n  S. 3062. A bill to direct the Secretary of agriculture to conduct a \nstudy of the effectiveness of silver-based biocides as an alternative \ntreatment to preserve wood; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Wood \nPreservation Safety Act of 2002. If enacted, this legislation would \nauthorize the Forest Products Laboratory of the U.S. Forest Service to \nstudy the effectiveness of silver-based biocides as a wood preservative \ntreatment.\n  According to silver experts and academics, silver biocides could \nserve as a viable, safe and cost effective alternative wood \npreservative. Given silver's long-standing role as an effective \nbiocide, testing should be undertaken to determine silver's suitability \nas a wood preservative. Thus, I feel it is important to study and fully \nexplore the potential of silver as a wood preservative.\n  Mining has been an important part of Idaho's history since the late \n1800s. It became Idaho's first industry and remains a critical part of \nIdaho and the nation's economy. Mining in Idaho has supplied the nation \nwith minerals necessary for today's modern lifestyle which many of us \ntake for granted. In 1985, the mines of Idaho's Coeur d'Alene mining \ndistrict produced their one billionth ounce of silver. The Sunshine \nMine was America's richest silver mine, producing over 300 million \nounces of silver, more than the entire output of Nevada's famous \nComstock Lode. Silver contributes to our quality of life in many ways, \nand its use as a biocide in wood products is an important application \nthat must be explored.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass legislation that \nwould create a comprehensive research program to test the viability of \nsilver-based biocides for the treatment of wood products.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/04/senate-section/article/S9995-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9995-S9996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 333--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE RELATING TO A \nDISPUTE BETWEEN THE PACIFIC MARITIME ASSOCIATION AND THE INTERNATIONAL \n                     LONGSHORE AND WAREHOUSE UNION\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Helms, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \nBurns, Mr. Craig, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Allard, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Crapo, \nMr. Ensign, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Bond, Mr. Frist, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Hatch) \nsubmitted the following resolution, which was referred to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 333\n\n       Whereas the ongoing dispute between the Pacific Maritime \n     Association and the International Longshore and Warehouse \n     Union, relating to a collective bargaining agreement, has \n     shut down 29 West Coast ports;\n       Whereas this dispute has sent harmful economic \n     reverberations far beyond the shipping industry, the West \n     Coast, or even the borders of the United States;\n       Whereas 7 percent of the Nation's gross domestic product \n     travels through those ports and the flow of goods in and out \n     of those ports is critical to the operation of businesses, \n     farms, and factories, and the business of retailers and \n     consumers, all across the United States;\n       Whereas the stay of all West Coast transport by sea has \n     already prevented farmers from selling their crops, shut down \n     manufacturing plants, idled trucks and trains, and precluded \n     consumers from purchasing goods;\n       Whereas, due to the interruption of the flow of commerce \n     caused by the dispute, thousands of persons in the United \n     States have been laid off and are living without a paycheck \n     through no fault of their own;\n       Whereas the United States is already enduring an economic \n     recession and high unemployment; and\n       Whereas if the shutdown of those ports continues, the \n     shutdown will present a serious threat to the Nation's safety \n     and health: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Pacific Maritime Association and the International \n     Longshore and Warehouse Union should enter into mediation to \n     resolve the dispute, adopt 24-hour extensions of the expired \n     collective bargaining agreement, and end the current lockout; \n     and\n       (2) if the Pacific Maritime Association and the \n     International Longshore and Warehouse Union do not reach a \n     settlement or reopen the ports through that mediation during \n     a reasonable period (as determined by the President), the \n     President should appoint a board of inquiry, to begin the \n     emergency dispute-settling procedure under the Labor-\n     Management Relations Act, 1947.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, today, many of my colleagues have \njoined me in submitting a resolution urging the President to invoke the \nTaft Hartley emergency dispute resolution procedures in response to the \ncomplete shutdown of twenty-nine West Coast ports due to a labor \ndispute. I deeply regret that this legislation is necessary, but the \ngrave economic consequences of the shutdown and the serious \nramifications on our country's ability to improve homeland security \nhave made it so.\n  It is estimated that 7 percent of our Nation's gross domestic product \nflow through these ports. However, that does not begin to calculate the \ncost to the workers and families who are and will be affected by this \nimpasse. Transportation of products to West Coast ports has been shut \ndown. The jobs of railroad employees, barge employees, and independent \ntruck drivers, whose livelihoods all depend upon the flow of goods in \nand out these ports, are being endangered by this dispute. In addition, \nmanufacturers who are unable to move products are facing unexpected \nstorage costs that have already resulted in thousands of layoffs.\n  In the agriculture sector, the inability to ship grains, vegetables, \nlivestock, and other perishables is having a catastrophic effect on \nfarmers and ranchers, many of whom are already facing consecutive years \nof drought and economic hardship. The ability to move agricultural \nproducts and sell them to foreign markets when prices are best is \nessential to the health of rural communities across our country. In \naddition, the inability to move these products off our own domestic \nmarket threatens to push commodity and livestock prices even lower. \nAgricultural producers and marketers have spent millions of dollars to \nopen and develop Asian markets amidst heavy competition from Canada, \nAustralia, and many other countries vying for access. This dispute is \nthreatening thousands of jobs and years of work to increase trade with \nthese emerging markets.\n  At a time when the country is already experiencing economic \nhardships, this shutdown is jeopardizing the jobs and livelihoods of \nthousands of citizens across our country. From auto-workers in Michigan \nand Missouri to rice and wheat farmers in Arkansas and Kansas, the \nhuman cost of this dispute far exceeds the financial and technical \nissues that have provoked it.\n  This resolution calls on the Pacific Maritime Association and the \nInternational Longshore and Warehouse Union to adopt 24-hour extensions \nof the expired collective bargaining agreement and end the current \nlockout while they go through mediation.\n  It also urges the President to appoint a board of inquiry and begin \nthe emergency dispute settling procedures called for under the Taft \nHartley Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, if he determines that \nmediation has failed.\n  My colleagues and I have taken this action out of concern for our \nhome states and the safety and health of the\n\n[[Page S9996]]\n\nnation. Much of the industry in my home state of Arkansas relies on \nproduct import and export, and much of it travels through west coast \ndocks. Arkansas is already feeling the effect of the shutdown, and it \nis critical that labor dispute be solved before even more damage is \ndone.\n  Mr. Craig. Mr. President, I rise to commend my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, Mr. Hutchinson, and an happy to join him as an original \ncosponsor, upon his submission of a resolution expressing the sense of \nthe Senate about the recent shutdown of shipping that has occurred on \nthe West Coast.\n  We are at war with terrorism. The Senate is now debating action on \nanother front in that war. We are at a critical moment in our economic \nrecovery, when we are eager for that economy to continue to grow, and \nwe want to protect and resume creating good jobs for American workers.\n  At such a time, frankly, I am at a loss to understand how such a \ndispute has ever come about in these 29 ports on the West Coast. I \nwould hope the partied involved understand that they risk strangling an \nestimated 7 percent of our Nation's economy. I would hope they realize \nthe implications a prolonged dispute would have for millions of workers \nand their families, as well as for our Nation's health and safety.\n  This shutdown already is hurting agriculture, one of the largest \nsectors of Idaho's economy. I have been in touch with farmers and \nranchers in Idaho. The impact of this shutdown has been immediate and \nit threatens to be devastating. I know it is affecting other industries \nas well. We have all heard the estimates that it will cost the Nation's \neconomy $1 billion a day, but I understand that is the cost in the \nearly days of the shutdown. The harm will grown, and it is something \nthat workers, families, farmers, and employers in Idaho and across the \nNation should not be forced to bear.\n  So, I commend Senator Hutchinson for his leadership in the submission \nof this resolution. I join him in imploring the disputing parties to \nwork with urgency to resolve differences and reach a settlement, while \nadopting twenty-four extensions of the expired collective bargaining \nagreement, allowing the ports to reopen, and restoring the full, brisk, \nefficient flow of American goods to markets overseas.\n  I also appreciate the fact that the adminsitraiton already is working \nto resolve this problem. A Federal mediator has gotten engaged. Now it \nis time for the Senate to add its voice to the constructive efforts of \nthe administration.\n  With my colleagues, I call on the disputing parties to consider the \ngood of the country at a critical time; to recognize the \nresponsibilities of a good neighbor to employers and labor across our \nland; and to come back to the table and come back to work.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 334--RECOGNIZING THE ELLIS ISLAND MEDAL OF HONOR\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for Mrs. Clinton) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 334\n\n       Whereas the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, established by the \n     National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations in 1986, pays \n     tribute to individuals of various ethnic origins who have \n     distinguished themselves through their contributions to the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the Ellis Island Medal of Honor has been awarded on \n     a bipartisan basis to 6 Presidents and numerous \n     Representatives and Senators;\n       Whereas the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations is \n     the largest organization of its kind in the United States, \n     representing more than 5,000,000 family members and serving \n     as an umbrella group for more than 250 organizations that \n     span the spectrum of ethnic heritage, culture, and religion;\n       Whereas the mandate of the National Ethnic Coalition of \n     Organizations is to preserve ethnic diversity, promote \n     equality and tolerance, combat injustice, and bring about \n     harmony and unity among all peoples;\n       Whereas the Ellis Island Medal of Honor is named for the \n     gateway through which more than 12,000,000 immigrants passed \n     in their quest for freedom of speech, freedom of religion, \n     and economic opportunity;\n       Whereas the Ellis Island Medal of Honor celebrates the \n     richness and diversity of American life by honoring not only \n     individuals, but the pluralism and democracy that have \n     enabled the Nation's ethnic groups to maintain their \n     identities while becoming integral parts of the American way \n     of life;\n       Whereas during the 15-year history of the Ellis Island \n     Medal of Honor, more than 1,500 individuals from scores of \n     different ethnic groups have received the Medal, and more \n     than 5,000 individuals are nominated each year for the Medal; \n     and\n       Whereas at the 2002 Ellis Island Medal of Honor ceremony in \n     New York City, individuals from different ethnic groups will \n     be honored for their contributions to the rescue and recovery \n     efforts of September 11, 2001, the war against terrorism, and \n     the enhancement of the Nation's homeland security: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the Ellis Island Medal \n     of Honor for acknowledging individuals who live exemplary \n     lives as Americans while preserving the values of their \n     particular ethnic heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/04/senate-section/article/S9996-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n            committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

BLACK MOLD INFESTATION STUDY.\n\n       Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall--\n       (1) complete a study on the extent of black mold \n     infestation of Native American housing in the United States; \n     and\n       (2) submit to Congress a report that describes \n     recommendations of the Secretary for means by which to \n     address the infestation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, on September 12, 2002, the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs reported out favorably S. 1210, the \nNative American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination \nReauthorization Act, NAHASDA. The Indian Affairs Committee referred \nNAHASDA to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on \nAugust 28, 2002. According to the Senate Rules, all legislation \naffecting HUD's Indian Housing programs must be considered in the \nBanking Committee. This is bipartisan legislation that has the support \nof the National American Indian Housing Council, NAIHC.\n  The NAHASDA Reauthorization Act extends the program originally \ncreated in 1996. The bill makes very modest changes to update the \nlegislation, including asking HUD to explore ways to increase tribal \nself-determination with regards to the NAHASDA block grant. It also \nasks HUD to do a study of black mold, which is apparently is a growing \nproblem on reservations.\n  In 1996, Congress passed NAHASDA in order to strengthen federal \nhousing assistance for tribal communities. NAHASDA provides block \ngrants to Indian tribes or their tribally designated housing entities, \nTDHEs, for affordable housing activities that were previously under \ngeneral housing programs, including public housing, section 8, \nYouthbuild, and homeless programs. Consolidating these funds into a \nblock grant helps to meet the goal of self-determination for Indian \ntribes.\n  Since its passage, NAHASDA has achieved many successes. HUD reports \nthat through NAHASDA, 25,000 new units of housing has been produced in \nIndian communities. In spite of NAHASDA's successes, many of the people \nin these communities still live in severely substandard housing. \nAccording to the NAIHC, Native American housing is said to be six to \neight times more crowded than the national average. Furthermore, it is \nestimated that 1 out of every 5 Indian homes lacks complete plumbing; \nand 40 percent of homes on Indian lands are overcrowded. These figures \ndemonstrate the need for affordable housing programs, like NAHASDA, \nthat benefit Native American communities.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill \nto reauthorize the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-\nDetermination Act which is an important step in strengthening Federal \nhousing assistance for tribal authorities. I urge prompt consideration \nof this legislation by the full Congress. I wish to thank Senators \nInouye and Campbell for their work on this bill during deliberations in \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs. Also, I wish to thank Senator Sarbanes \nfor his leadership in moving this bill quickly through the Banking \nCommittee.\n  Throughout my 16 years in Congress, I have been dismayed by the \nliving conditions of Native Americans. On numerous occasions, it has \nbeen documented that Native Americans have the worst housing conditions \nin the United States. Rampant overcrowding, homelessness, and a \ncrumbling housing stock plague our tribal communities, and South Dakota \nhas seen some of the worst conditions overall. Our tribes suffer from \nanywhere between 50 to 80 percent unemployment on Native American \nreservations. According to the Housing Assistance Council, South Dakota \ncontains 10 counties that are inhabited by 30 to 65 percent of persons \nbelow poverty.\n  NAHASDA was originally passed in 1996 to strengthen Federal housing \nassistance to tribal communities. NAHASDA provides block grants to \nIndian tribes for affordable housing activities that were previously \nunder general housing programs, including public housing, section 8, \nYouthbuild, and homeless programs. I believe that consolidating these \nfunds in a block grant to tribes helps meet the goal of self-\ndetermination for Indian tribes.\n  NAHASDA has proven to be a vast improvement over the previous way \nthat housing assistance was provided to tribes. The Federal Government \nmust end the practice of treating our first Americans as third class \ncitizens. As this bill is considered by the full Senate, I will \ncontinue to press my colleagues for their full support.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Banking \nCommittee substitute amendment be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, \nbe read the third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate; and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1210), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/04/senate-section/article/S9998-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, 2002\n\n  Mr. REID.
