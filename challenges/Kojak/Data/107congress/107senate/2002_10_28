Mr. President, I ask that the Senate observe a moment of \nsilence in tribute to Senator Wellstone and his family.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, it is with a profoundly heavy heart that I \nrise today to present this resolution honoring my colleague, Paul \nWellstone. This is not the occasion in this brief session for eulogies. \nThere will be other opportunities on the Senate floor for all of us to \nshare our memories and our perspectives.\n  For myself, I cannot begin to do Paul justice in a few minutes or \neven a few hours. He was such an extraordinary, such a remarkable man, \nand he brought so much life and enthusiasm and passion and commitment \nto the public life he lived, and he touched so many thousands of \nMinnesotans and others across this country who mourn his loss as we do \nhere today.\n  He died fearlessly, as he lived his life. In the resolution that was \njust read, the words ``never wavered from the principles'' will be \nwords that I will always associate with Paul Wellstone. He never ever \nblinked in the face of adversity. Courageous, difficult, perhaps at \ntimes unpopular positions were articles of faith for Paul because he \nbelieved in them.\n  It was not about polls. It was not about pundits. It was about the \nconviction he had about what was right for people, for his fellow \ncitizens.\n  He was unpretentious, unassuming, just himself. He was no different \nas a Senator than as a man, than as a political activist all in one, he \nwas extraordinary and he will never be replaced. In the hearts and \nminds of Minnesotans, he will never be forgotten.\n  Yet, Mr. President, he loved this institution. He respected \nenormously the traditions, the men and women who served here. They came \nto respect him for the courage of his convictions. I could see in the \ncourse of the 2 years I have shared with him in the Senate that he was \nrespected by people who did not agree with him because they knew he was \nspeaking from his heart, that he was speaking from his soul, that he \nwas speaking what he truly believed.\n  One could ask for no more, no less from any of us than the strength \nof our convictions and our willingness to speak out about them \nregardless of political cost.\n  Paul and his wife, Sheila, at his side for 39 years, died last Friday \ntogether, as they would have wanted it to be, not with their daughter \nMarcia who also was on that flight and three of their devoted aides and \ntwo pilots. It is an unspeakable tragedy and horror for all of us in \nMinnesota, but it will be for all of us, on behalf of Paul, to take a \ndeep breath and carry on in behalf of our convictions and our causes--\nas he would want us to do.\n  I thank the Senate for this resolution on behalf of Paul. And for his \ntwo surviving sons, David and Mark, and their families I know it will \nbe of solace to them in their hours of terrible grief.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague, the Senator from California.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Senator Dayton, your remarks were beautiful and Paul would have been \nso pleased to hear your tone and your spirit. And I can tell you, \nSenator Dayton, how much he loved you, how proud he was to have you \nhere by his side.\n  Mr. President, I have flown in from California to be here on the \nSenate floor today to make just a few remarks about our dear friend and \ncolleague, Senator Paul Wellstone. I want to start by reading two \nparagraphs written by his loyal and hardworking staff. After his plane \nwent down, and they learned the worst, they wrote the following:\n\n       Paul Wellstone was one of a kind. He was a man of principle \n     and conviction, in a world that has too little of either. He \n     was dedicated to helping the little guy, in a business \n     dominated by the big guys. We who had the privilege of \n     working with him hope that he will be remembered as he lived \n     every day: as a champion for people.\n       His family was the center of his life and it breaks our \n     hearts that his wife of 39 years and his daughter Marcia were \n     with him. Our prayers are with Mark and David and the \n     grandchildren he and Sheila cherished so much.\n\n  That was posted on the Wellstone Web site by Senator Wellstone's \nstaff.\n  Mr. President, Senator Dayton, for me, the loss of Paul Wellstone \ncuts very deep. Kind, compassionate, self-deprecating, a passionate \nvoice for those without a voice, enthusiastic, a bundle of energy--this \nwas a unique man of the people.\n  When we learned that the tragedy of Paul's death was magnified by the \ndeath of the two women he cherished so much--his wife Sheila and his \ndaughter Marcia--the wounds in our hearts cut deeper still, plus the \nloss of three staffers--Tom Lapic, Will McLaughlin, and Mary McEvoy--\nand the two pilots--Captains Richard Conroy and Michael Guess.\n  Mr. President, no words--no words--can possibly ease the pain of all \nthe family members who were touched by this tragedy. No words can ease \nthe pain of David and Mark, Paul's two sons, and their families. All we \ncan do is let them know that we pray that they have the strength to \nendure this time for the sake of the Wellstone grandchildren: Cari, \nKeith, Joshua, Acacia, Sydney, and Matt. Let the record show that your \ngrandchildren brought endless joy to you. And we say to the \ngrandchildren, thank you for the joy that you gave to grandma and \ngrandpa.\n  I want to say to the people of Minnesota, thank you, thank you for \nsending Paul to us, for sharing Paul with us these past 12 years. He \nloved the people of his State: the farmers, the workers, the children, \nthe elderly, the sick, the disabled, the families. He fought for you \nall, so long and so hard, without stopping, in committees and \nsubcommittees, in the Democratic caucus meetings, when he would get up \nand say: Just give me 30 seconds--just 30 seconds--to make my point \nabout the people of Minnesota. He stood up at press conferences. He \nwould grab Senators, one by one, and fight for you, the people of \nMinnesota, who were always in his thoughts and on his mind. And I know \nhe is now in your thoughts and on your minds.\n  In my own State of California--so many thousands of miles away from \nMinnesota--there are memorial services being set up for Paul. You see, \nhis compassionate voice reached thousands of miles, and many people in \nmy State are sending me condolence notes and flowers because they know \nhow much I will miss working with Paul Wellstone, and so will all \nSenators on both sides of the aisle.\n\n  As Mark said, Paul was never afraid to speak out when it might be \nunpopular, nor was he afraid to be on the losing side of a Senate vote. \nHe had courage. And when you told him that, when you said: ``Paul, you \nhave courage,'' he shrugged it off. He would say something like: ``What \nelse could I do? It's just not right!'' He would say that--determined, \nbrave.\n  You see, Paul Wellstone could not vote against his conscience or for \nsomething he did not believe was in the best interest of the people he \nrepresented. He couldn't; he wouldn't--no matter what the consequences.\n  He cared about the underdog always. He cared about the victim always. \nHe cared about peace always. And Paul, blessed are the peacemakers. \nPaul, blessed are the peacemakers.\n  Paul was a humble man. When his longtime staffer, Mike Epstein, \ndied--and many of us knew Mike--Paul took to the Senate floor, and this \nis what he said, in part:\n\n       Mike, I know you will not like me saying this, but I'm \n     going to say it anyway because it's true. I believe from the \n     bottom of my heart that everything I've been able to do as a \n     Senator that has been good for Minnesota and the country is \n     because, Mike, you have been right by my side, 1 inch away \n     from me.\n\n  And he said:\n\n       Mike was my tutor. He was my teacher. He was teaching me.\n\n  That was Paul Wellstone. He never bragged about himself. He loved his\n\n[[Page S10793]]\n\nfamily so much. He loved his staff. He took time for all the Senate \nemployees: the young people who work with us, the officers who protect \nus, the food service people, the elevator operators--all the Senate \nfamily, no matter what their status.\n  Mr. President, he wanted to give everyone--everyone he touched--his \nsense of optimism, his energy, his strength.\n  When Paul learned he had multiple sclerosis, I worried and I said to \nhim: Are you OK? He said: I probably had it for a long time. I'm just \nnot going to think about it. And off he went in his usual rush. There \nwas so much to do. Off he went to his desk in the Senate, his desk now \nincredibly shrouded in black.\n  Paul loved that aisle desk. It gave him a bird's eye view of the \nSenate that he loved. And when he spoke from his desk, he could come \nout from behind it. He could leave his notes behind--arms gesturing, \nvoice determined--and talk from his heart. He would say something like: \nI don't represent big business or big anything. He would say: I \nrepresent the people of Minnesota. And that he did every minute of his \nall-too-short life.\n  As our session wound down, Paul wanted to finish our business and go \nhome. He told us all: I want to be with my people. I need to touch \nthem. I need to look them in the eye. I can't wait to get home.\n  Paul was a powerful man. His power did not come from his physical \nstature. He was strong but he was slight of build. His power did not \ncome from generations of family wealth. He was not a man of moneyed \nwealth. His parents were immigrants: Leon and Minnie Wellstone. His \npower did not come from political connections. His connections were \nwith regular people.\n  Let me tell you from where his power came. It came from a fierce \ndedication to justice and truth and honesty and righteousness. He gave \ncomfort and he gave hope to those he touched. And he gave them some of \nhis power--the power to see the possibilities of their own lives. Paul \ndied on his way to give comfort and hope to those facing death. He was \nflying to a funeral service.\n  Today we say to Paul: We will give comfort and hope to those you have \nleft behind by doing all that we can to continue your legacy and your \ndream. Together, we can build an America of fairness, of justice, of \nprosperity, a world of tolerance and a world of peace. And, Paul, may \nyou and yours rest in peace forever.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota and the \nSenator from California for their words. I know and respect both the \nSenator from Minnesota, Senator Dayton, and the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer. I know them well enough to know this was a \nvery painful moment for both of them--just as it is for the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer and as it is for the Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. President, you and I have been here a long time in the Senate. \nWith the Senator from Minnesota, who is now--not at his choice--the \nsenior Senator from Minnesota, and the Senator from California, I think \nwe can all say that there is no sadder sight than coming on the floor \nand seeing a black drape on a Senator's desk. The distinguished \nPresiding Officer and I have unfortunately seen that many times in our \ncareers, for Senators on both sides of the aisle. In every instance \nwhen we have entered the chamber and seen the black drape we know that \nthere has been a death in the family.\n  We are privileged in this body, 100 men and women--now 99 men and \nwomen--to represent the greatest nation on Earth, a nation of a quarter \nof a billion people. But because there are only 100 of us, no matter \nour political differences, when one is lost we all feel it. When I \nheard the news in Vermont, I was at a restaurant in Burlington with my \nson, Kevin. It was a small restaurant. There was a TV going but with no \nsound. My back was to it. I saw the look of shock on Kevin's face. He \nspun me around and I saw the news. We both left that restaurant in \ntears. The news spread quickly and as I walked down the street people--\nmany of them I never met before--just came up and hugged me, because \nthey, too, lost somebody.\n  Paul Wellstone had come to Vermont and was greeted with great warmth. \nI vividly remember the evening he came to speak. Everybody came up to \nhim. They didn't want him to leave. Paul Wellstone, like one of his \npredecessors, my dear friend, Hubert Humphrey, was a happy warrior. If \npeople wanted to talk with him he did not mind and would stay, the same \nway Hubert would have.\n  There is an affinity, I believe, between our State of Vermont and \nMinnesota. That is why there was a bond Vermonters felt with Paul \nWellstone. Paul could sense it. And, we worked on many important issues \nas a team. During the recent farm bill debate he met with Vermont \nfarmers and together we drafted a dairy provision that was beneficial \nto both of our States. I remember when he and Jim Jeffords and Bernie \nSanders and I joined together to have a milk toast. We were joking \naround. Paul was not a tall man. I playfully stood blocking him from \nthe cameras. And he said: ``Hey, remember, I'm a wrestler,'' at which \npoint I quickly moved aside. Of course Paul was far more than a \nwrestler--but it is easy to make the correlation to the way he wrestled \nwith issues here on the floor. He wrestled them down. I thought to \nmyself: What a man to have on your side. What a man to be a friend.\n  Paul Wellstone served with powerful people but he was not intimidated \nby that. And, he never took on the airs of one who was powerful. He \nwould introduce himself to people: Hi, I'm Paul Wellstone. And someone \nelse would have to say: That's a U.S. Senator.\n  I never went on an elevator with Paul without him calling the \nelevator operator by name. He would talk with the pages and give them \ntutorials. He knew everybody in the Senate and they knew and loved him.\n  It is impossible to talk about our colleague Paul Wellstone without \nmentioning Sheila Wellstone. They were inseparable. Whenever the Senate \nwould have a late night session Sheila would be in the galleries, \nwaiting for Paul to leave.\n  Of all my memories of Paul Wellstone, the one I may remember the most \nis the last time I saw the two of them. It was a late night session. \nYou know these gorgeous halls we have, with the chandeliers and \neverything else, and here is this couple walking hand in hand down one \nof the halls about midnight--Paul and Sheila Wellstone. I came around \nthe corner and I said: ``Hey, you teenagers,'' and they laughed and \nhugged each other. I saw them go out, down the steps into the night, \nhand in hand.\n  Let us hope that they have gone hand and hand into the light and that \nthey are now together.\n  Marcella and I also extend our thoughts and prayers to Marcia, Paul \nand Sheila's daughter, and her family. And, as the Senate noted in the \nresolution that was just passed a few moments ago, we all grieve for \nthe Wellstone staff who were on board the plane: Tom Lapic, Mary McEvoy \nand Will McLaughlin. Our thoughts and prayer are with their families in \nthese trying times. Our condolences also go out to the families of the \npilots on the plane, Richard Conry and Michael Guess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Boxer). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, first let me express my thanks to our \ncolleague from Minnesota, Senator Dayton, and express our sympathies to \nhim and through him to the people of Minnesota and to the Wellstone \nfamily, the extended family, for all that they are suffering in this \nparticular time, and to express my gratitude as well to my colleague \nfrom California, Senator Boxer, and my colleague from Vermont, Senator \nLeahy, for their very moving and emotional remarks. I think they \ncaptured to a large extent the sentiments of all of us.\n  This is a difficult time. I suppose the American people see we are in \nsession and wonder why only a few of us are here. Obviously, with a \nweek to go before the congressional elections, not many are here in \nWashington. But suffice it to say, were 96 or 97 other Senators here \ntoday, you would here much the same sentiments that have been expressed \nalready by the now-senior Senator from Minnesota, the Senator from \nCalifornia, and the Senator from Vermont.\n\n[[Page S10794]]\n\n  So I join my colleagues, and all Americans, in mourning the very \ntragic and sudden loss of our dear friend and colleague, Senator Paul \nWellstone, who will be forever remembered as a friend and patriot and \ntrue public servant, who fought each and every day of his public life--\nin fact, of his life--to the improve the lives of average Americans. We \ngot to know him here over the last 10 or 11 years as a Member of the \nU.S. Senate, but the people of Minnesota and the people of Carleton \nCollege, students who had him as a professor, people who knew him \nbeforehand, they knew that Paul Wellstone didn't just become a fighter \nwhen he arrived in the Senate of the United States. He dedicated his \nlife to it. It is what his parents taught him. It is what he believed \nin passionately as an American. We became witnesses to that sense of \npassion and outrage about wrongs in this country and around the world \nas we served with our colleague, Paul Wellstone, for the last decade.\n  So, like my colleagues, I was stunned and deeply saddened by the \nenormous scope and tragedy of this loss. Obviously, the entire \nWellstone family has suffered an unfathomable loss, as have the \nfamilies of other victims of this horrendous accident. His wife \nSheila--I join my colleagues in expressing our deep sense of loss. \nSometimes, although we get to know Members, we don't get to know the \nspouses of our colleagues very well, but Sheila Wellstone really became \na member of the Senate family aside from being a spouse. She was an \nunpaid volunteer in her husband's office.\n  If there are women today who are suffering less because of domestic \nviolence--and they are many who are not, but many who are--you can \nthank some colleagues here. But I suspect one of the reasons they \nbecame so motivated about the issue was because there was a person by \nthe name of Sheila Wellstone who arrived here a decade ago and wanted \nto make this a matter of the business of the U.S. Senate.\n  So they became partners, not just over the almost 40 years of love \nand affection for each other, but partners in their sense of idealism, \nsense of values, and sense of purpose.\n  Marcia I did not know very well but certainly heard Paul and Sheila \ntalk abut her with great admiration and affection. In the loss suffered \nby her family, with young children, it is just difficult to even come \nup with the words to express the sense of grief that I feel for her and \nher family. And obviously the staff: Will McLaughlin, Tom Lapic, and \nMary McEvoy, along with the pilots who have been mentioned already: \nRichard Conry and Michael Guess, we didn't know, but I suspect on that \nflight up there they had gotten to know the Wellstone family and the \nstaff. And so we want to express our deep sense of loss to their \nfamilies.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed at the end of my remarks a \nwonderful editorial by David Rosenbaum in the New York Times on \nSaturday which I thought captured perfectly the image of Paul \nWellstone, who he was and what he tried to do, better than any words I \ncould possibly express here today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DODD, Madam President, William Shakespeare once wrote, ``No \nlegacy is so rich as honesty.'' I have never met, let alone worked \nwith, a more honest or noble man than Paul Wellstone.\n  His rich, rich legacy will be that of an honest, passionate and \ntireless fighter on behalf of justice and fairness for all Americans, \nespecially those less fortunate than himself.\n  Paul suffered a lot. He had this bad back. He would hobble around. He \nhad this gait that if you didn't know he was hurting was almost an \naffectionate gait. He sort of limped around at various times; he would \nstand a lot at times in meetings because sitting would be so painful \nfor him as a result of injuries he suffered. He had MS which he sort of \nshrugged off, as my colleague from California said. He grew up in a \nsituation where his family were immigrants who came from Russia. They \ngrew up actually in Arlington, VA, a short distance from here. A former \nstaff member of mine was a neighbor of theirs. He knew Paul as a child \ngrowing up. They had their own burdens to bear aside from being \nimmigrants, problems of those newly arriving, with the language \nbarriers. Trying to get acclimated to a new society such as ours is not \neasy. So Paul understood the issues of those who suffered more than in \njust an intellectual effort. This was something he deeply felt and had \ngrown up with and appreciated immensely.\n\n  When he came to this body and we got to know him as someone who would \nfight tirelessly on behalf of those who did not have lawyers, \nlobbyists, and others to express their concerns, to bring their issues \nto the debate of the Senate, we found in this individual just a \nremarkable voice and a remarkable fight. Like many of my colleagues, I \nmight be home or completed the evening and turned on the television and \nthe Senate would still be in session, and there would be Paul \nWellstone, standing at that desk in the rear of this Chamber, speaking \nto an empty place except for the millions of Americans tuned in to C-\nSPAN who would hear someone talking about subjects that were affecting \ntheir lives.\n  Single moms, working families, children without health care, the \nhomeless, international victims of torture--these were among Senator \nPaul Wellstone's core constituencies, and they could not have had a \nbetter spokesperson.\n  A lot of times we spend days here talking about issues that might \nseem terribly arcane to the average citizen in this country, matters \nthat don't seem terribly relevant to their daily lives, and yet Paul \nWellstone never let a day go by that he didn't give voice to the \nconcerns of average Americans or those who are, as Hubert Humphrey \nwould talk about, in the shadows of life or the dawn of life or the \ndusk of life--Paul Wellstone giving voice, that great Minnesota voice \nto those who needed to have their concerns raised in chambers such as \nthis. And so for all of those people who are wondering today whether or \nnot their concerns, their hopes, their fears will find expression, it \nis hard to find any silver lining with the passage of someone you care \nabout so much, but I suspect as we reconvene here on November 12 and \nagain with a new Congress coming in in January we will hear the words \nof Paul Wellstone repeated quite frequently. We will hear the passion \nthat he brought to the issues raised maybe more frequently than they \notherwise might be. That's because we will remember an individual we \nhad the privilege and honor of serving with who reminded this \ninstitution of what its role ought to be, not just to those who are \nwell heeled, those who can afford to acquire the access, but those who \nneed to have their issues raised--that their concerns and their \nworries, their hopes, their dreams for this country and their own \nfamilies will be once again a part of the mainstream of debate in the \nSenate.\n\n  Paul Wellstone fought some awfully tough battles. He fought a tough \nbattle to get here, a man who was told he could not possibly get \nelected to the Senate, who was being outspent by overwhelming odds.\n  I rode with him in that bus--I am sure my colleague from Minnesota, \nmaybe my colleagues from California and Vermont remember--that rattly \nold green bus, in the freezing cold, bitter cold, cold months of \nMinnesota. I remember going with him to some big fair or festival that \nhe was holding on behalf of poor farmers and family farmers in \nMinnesota. Just a few weeks ago, Madam President, I campaigned with him \nin Minnesota, with some of the medical device companies around \nMinneapolis and St. Paul. This was supposed to be about a 20-minute \nmeeting we were going to have at one of these firms to talk about the \nmedical devices that Paul played a major role in working to see to it \nthat they were going to become a reality for people who would use them. \nWe were supposed to leave in 15 or 20 minutes but the room was packed; \nthe people wanted to talk about other things. And Paul Wellstone stayed \nfor about 1\\1/2\\ hours just engaging with the people in this room. They \nwent far beyond the medical device issues. The people in that room \nwanted to talk about health care; they wanted to talk about education; \nthey wanted to talk about the environment; they wanted to talk about \nprescription drugs and the elderly; they wanted to talk about issues \naffecting\n\n[[Page S10795]]\n\nNative Americans and minority groups; they wanted to talk about foreign \npolicy. And he engaged, engaged and engaged for an hour and a half. He \nwould have stayed longer. Staff had to almost drag him out of the room. \nBut it was so reflective, standing in the back of the room watching \nPaul Wellstone with great passion and clarity expressing where he \nstood.\n  He didn't sit there and try to figure out where the question was \ncoming from based on the tilt of their rhetoric. He answered them how \nhe felt as their Senator, their representative, so they would know \nwhere he stood.\n  Madam President, I apologize for sort of meandering here, but it is \nhow I feel. I have a great sense of loss and also a sense of joy. Paul \nWellstone had a great sense of humor. He cared deeply about issues but \nhe also had the wonderful ability to laugh at himself, to appreciate \nthe humor that only this institution can provide in some of the more \nbizarre moments, a wonderful relationship with virtually everyone here. \nIt didn't happen automatically or initially. Paul came here determined \nto change the world; if not the world, change the United States; if not \nthat, maybe his Minnesota. Along the way and in the process he probably \nrubbed some people the wrong way, but those very people became the \npeople who cared most about him in many ways in the final analysis \nbecause they realized that everything he said and everything he did was \nnot about himself but about the people he wanted to represent. And so I \nknow there are Members who are not here today because of other \nobligations, but who, when the opportunity comes, will express their \nown thoughts and feelings, but don't be surprised--Madam President, I \nknow you will not be, nor my colleagues from Minnesota or Vermont--that \nsome of the heartfelt remarks about Paul will come from people who \ndisagreed with him vehemently on substantive matters, but appreciated \nimmensely his sense of conviction, something we can do a lot more of in \npolitics in America today.\n  Frederick Douglass once said, ``The life of a nation is secure only \nwhile the nation is honest, truthful, and virtuous.'' For 58 years, \nPaul Wellstone lived a life that was honest, truthful, and virtuous. \nFor 12 years, he personally lent those characteristics to the heart of \nthe United States government.\n  America, Minnesota, and this institution have suffered a terrible \nloss at the death of Paul Wellstone but there is a silver lining in all \nof this; that as a result of his service this country is a better \nplace, there are people who are living better lives; this world with \nall of its difficulties has been a better world because Paul Wellstone \nwas a part of it.\n  I am confident as I stand before you today, Madam President, that in \nthe weeks, months, and years ahead, his memory and legacy will live on \nin the debates, the discussions, and actions we take in this body.\n  For that, Paul Wellstone, you ought to know that your service \ncontinues and your words and your actions will have a legacy borne out \nby those who come after you in the service of your State and the \nthousands of young people you motivated.\n  Madam President, if you could only see, as many have, the hundreds of \nyoung people throughout Minnesota who Paul Wellstone energized and \nbrought to the public life of this country, people who otherwise would \nnot have paid any attention. Paul Wellstone said: You ought to be \ninvolved; there is a reason to be involved.\n  His ability to attract people to come to a cause and to fight for the \ngood cause will live on. I suspect one day this Chamber will have \npeople who will serve in it who cut their teeth in politics working on \na Wellstone campaign.\n  Paul, the campaign goes on. Your battles will go on, and we are going \nto miss you. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 26, 2002]\n\nA Death in the Senate: Paul Wellstone, 58, Icon of Liberalism in Senate\n\n                        (By David E. Rosenbaum)\n\n       Washington, Oct. 25.--Paul Wellstone often seemed out of \n     step. He called himself a liberal when many used that word as \n     a slur. He voted against the Persian Gulf war in his first \n     year in the Senate, and this month opposed using force \n     against Iraq.\n       Senator Wellstone, 58, who died in a plane crash today \n     while campaigning for re-election, fought for bills favored \n     by unions and advocates of family farmers and the poor, and \n     against those favored by banks, agribusiness and large \n     corporations. This year he was the principal opponent of \n     legislation supported by large majorities of Democrats and \n     Republicans that would make it more difficult for people to \n     declare bankruptcy. He argued that the measure would enrich \n     creditors at the expense of people ``in brutal economic \n     circumstances.'' He advocated causes like national health \n     insurance that even many of his fellow liberals abandoned as \n     futile.\n       Mr. Wellstone was a rumpled, unfailingly modest man who, \n     unlike many of his colleagues, lived on his Senate salary. He \n     was married to the former Sheila Ison for 39 years, having \n     married at 19 when he was in college. His wife and their 33-\n     year-old daughter, Marcia, also died today in the crash.\n       When Mr. Wellstone arrived in the Senate in 1991, he was a \n     firebrand who thought little of breaking the Senate tradition \n     of comity and personally attacking his colleagues. He told an \n     interviewer soon after he was elected that Senator Jesse \n     Helms, the conservative North Carolina Republican, \n     ``represents everything to me that is ugly and wrong and \n     awful about politics.''\n       But as the years passed, Mr. Wellstone moderated his \n     personality if not his politics and became well liked by \n     Republicans as well as Democrats. Bob Dole, the former Senate \n     Republican leader who often tangled with Mr. Wellstone on \n     legislation, choked up today when he told a television \n     interviewer that Mr. Wellstone was ``a decent, genuine guy \n     who had a different philosophy from almost everyone else in \n     the Senate.''\n       Mr. Wellstone was also an accomplished campaigner. Though \n     he had never held elected office, he pulled off a major upset \n     in 1990 when, running on a shoestring budget, he defeated the \n     incumbent Republican senator, Rudy Boschwitz. He beat Mr. \n     Boschwitz in a rematch in 1996. This year, he reneged on a \n     promise to limit himself to two terms, ran for re-election \n     and seemed in the most recent public polls to have pulled \n     slightly ahead of his Republican challenger, former Mayor \n     Norm Coleman of St. Paul.\n       His opponents always portrayed him as a left-wing \n     extremist. Mr. Boschwitz's television commercials in 1996 \n     called Mr. Wellstone ``embarrassingly liberal and out of \n     touch.'' This year, Mr. Coleman said the senator was ``so far \n     out of the mainstream, so extreme, that he can't deliver for \n     Minnesotans.''\n       But on the campaign trail, Mr. Wellstone appeared to be so \n     happy, so comfortable, so unthreatening that he was able to \n     ward off the attacks.\n       For years, he had walked with a pronounced limp that he \n     attributed to an old wrestling injury. In February, he \n     announced at a news conference that he had learned he had \n     multiple sclerosis, but he said the illness would not affect \n     his campaigning or his ability to sit in the Senate. ``I have \n     a strong mind--although there are some that might disagree \n     about that--I have a strong body, I have a strong heart, I \n     have a strong soul,'' he told reporters.\n       Paul David Wellstone was born in Washington on July 21, \n     1944, and grew up in Arlington, Va. His father, Leon, left \n     Russia as a child to escape the persecution of Jews, and \n     worked as a writer for the United States Information Agency. \n     His mother, Minnie, the daughter of immigrants from Russia, \n     worked in a junior high school cafeteria.\n       Growing up, he was more interested in wrestling than \n     politics, and he had some difficulty in school because of \n     what he later found out was a learning disability. He scored \n     lower than 800, out of a total of 1,600, on his College \n     Boards, and this led him as a senator to oppose measures that \n     emphasized standardized test scores. In an interview, he once \n     said that even as an adult he had difficulty interpreting \n     charts and graphs quickly but that he had learned to overcome \n     his disability by studying harder and taking more time to \n     absorb information.\n       Partly because of his wrestling ability--he was a \n     conference champion at 126 pounds--he was admitted to the \n     University of North Carolina and, galvanized by the civil \n     rights movement, he turned from wrestling to politics. He \n     graduated in 1965 and stayed in Chapel Hill for a doctorate \n     in political science. He wrote his thesis on the roots of \n     black militancy.\n       Married with children, he once said he did not have time to \n     participate in the student uprisings in the 1960's. He is \n     survived by two grown sons, David and Mark, of St. Paul, and \n     six grandchildren.\n       But while he was not a student rebel, Mr. Wellstone did not \n     fit in from the day in 1969 when he began teaching political \n     science at Carleton College, a small liberal arts campus in \n     rural Northfield, Minn.\n       He was more interested in leading his students in protests \n     than he was in publishing in academic journals, and he was \n     often at odds with his colleagues and Carleton \n     administrators. He fought the college's investments in \n     companies doing business in South Africa, battled local banks \n     that foreclosed on farms, picketed with strikers at a meat-\n     packing plant and taught classes off campus rather than cross \n     a picket line when Carleton's custodians were on strike.\n       In 1974, the college told him his contract would not be \n     renewed. But with strong support from students, the student \n     newspaper and local activists, he appealed the dismissal, and \n     it was reversed.\n       In 1982, Mr. Wellstone dipped his toe into the political \n     waters for the first time and\n\n[[Page S10796]]\n\n     ran for state auditor. He lost. But he had made contacts in \n     the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, and he stayed \n     active in politics. In 1988, he was the state co-chairman of \n     the Rev. Jesse Jackson's campaign in the president primary, \n     and in the general election, he was co-chairman of the \n     campaign of Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic \n     presidential nominee.\n       Few thought he had a chance when he announced that he would \n     run for the Senate against Mr. Boschwitz, Russell D. \n     Feingold, now a like-minded liberal Democratic senator from \n     Wisconsin, today had this recollection of dropping by to meet \n     Mr. Wellstone in 1989:\n       ``He opened the door, and there he was with his socks off, \n     15 books open that he was reading, and he was on the phone \n     arguing with somebody about Cuba. He gave me coffee, and we \n     laughed uproariously at the idea that either of us would ever \n     be elected. But he pulled it off in 1990 and gave me the \n     heart to do it in Wisconsin.''\n       Mr. Feingold was elected in 1992, also with a tiny \n     treasury.\n       Mr. Boschwitz spent $7 million on his campaign, seven times \n     Mr. Wellstone's budget. To counteract the Boschwitz attacks, \n     Mr. Wellstone ran witty, even endearing television \n     commercials produced without charge by a group led by a \n     former student. In one ad, the video and audio were speeded \n     up, and Mr. Wellstone said he had to talk fast because ``I \n     don't have $6 million to spend.''\n       Mr. Wellstone toured the state in a battered green school \n     bus, and in the end, he won 50.4 percent of the vote and was \n     the only challenger in 1990 to defeat an incumbent senator.\n       He arrived in Washington as something of a rube. On one of \n     his first days in town before he was sworn in, he called a \n     reporter for the name of a restaurant where he could get a \n     cheap dinner. When the reporter replied that he knew a place \n     where a good meal was only $15, Mr. Wellstone said $15 was \n     many times what he was prepared to spend.\n       He also made what he later conceded were ``rookie \n     mistakes.'' At one point, for instance, he used the Vietnam \n     Veterans Memorial as a backdrop for a news conference to \n     oppose the war against Iraq. Veterans' groups denounced him, \n     and he later apologized.\n       But he soon warmed to the ways of the Senate and became \n     especially adept at the unusual custom of giving long \n     speeches to an empty chamber. Probably no one in the Senate \n     over the last dozen years gave more speeches at night after \n     nearly all the other senators had gone home.\n       His strength was not in getting legislation enacted. One \n     successful measure he sponsored in 1996 with Senator Pete V. \n     Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, requires insurance \n     companies in some circumstances to give coverage to people \n     with mental illness, but he failed this year in an effort to \n     strengthen the law.\n       In a book he published last year, ``The Conscience of a \n     Liberal'' (Random House), Mr. Wellstone wrote, ``I feel as if \n     80 percent of my work as a senator has been playing defense, \n     cutting the extremist enthusiasms of the conservative agenda \n     (much of which originates in the House) rather than moving \n     forward on a progressive agenda.''\n       In a speech in the Senate this month explaining his \n     opposition to the resolution authorizing the use of force in \n     Iraq, Mr. Wellstone stressed that Saddam Hussein was ``a \n     brutal, ruthless dictator who has repressed his own people.''\n       But Mr. Wellstone went on to say: ``Despite a desire to \n     support our president, I believe many Americans still have \n     profound questions about the wisdom of relying too heavily on \n     a preemptive go-it-alone military approach. Acting now on our \n     own might be a sign of our power. Acting sensibly and in a \n     measured way, in concert with our allies, with bipartisan \n     Congressional support, would be a sign of our strength.''\n       Later, Mr. Wellstone told a reporter that he did not \n     believe his stance would hurt him politically. ``What would \n     really hurt,'' he said, ``is if I was giving speeches and I \n     didn't even believe what I was saying. Probably what would \n     hurt is if people thought I was doing something just for \n     political reasons.''\n       Mr. Wellstone briefly considered running for president in \n     2000, but he called off the campaign because, he said, the \n     doctors who had been treating him for a ruptured disk told \n     him that his back could not stand the travel that would be \n     required.\n       Often, Mr. Wellstone was the only senator voting against a \n     measure, or one of only a few. He was, for instance, one of \n     three senators in 1999 to support compromise missile defense \n     legislation. He was the only one that year to vote against an \n     education bill involving standardized tests, and the only \n     Democrat who opposed his party's version of lowering the \n     estate tax.\n       Mr. Wellstone was one of the few senators who made the \n     effort to meet and remember the names of elevator operators, \n     waiters, police officers and other workers in the Capitol.\n       James W. Ziglar, a Republican who was sergeant at arms of \n     the Senate from 1998 to 2001 and who is now commissioner of \n     the Immigration and Naturalization Service, remembered today \n     ``the evening when he came back to the Capitol well past \n     midnight to visit with the cleaning staff and tell them how \n     much he appreciated their efforts.''\n       ``Most of the staff had never seen a senator and certainly \n     had never had one make such a meaningful effort to express \n     his or her appreciation,'' Mr. Ziglar said. ``That was the \n     measure of the man.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the resolution and preamble \nare agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 354) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/28/senate-section/article/S10796-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10796-S10797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                              PROTECT ACT\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I came to the Senate floor and \njoined Senator Hatch in introducing S. 2520, the PROTECT Act in April, \nafter the Supreme Court's decision in Ashcroft v. Free Speech \nCoalition, Free Speech. Although there were some others who raised \nconstitutional concerns about specific provisions in that bill, I \nbelieved--and still believe--that unlike the Administration proposal it \nwas a good faith effort to work within the First Amendment.\n  It is important that we respond to the Supreme Court decision but it \nis just as important that we avoid repeating our past mistakes. Unlike \nthe 1996 Child Pornography Prevention Act, CPPA, this time we should \nrespond with a law that passes constitutional muster. Our children \ndeserve more than a press conference in on this issue. They deserve a \nlaw that will stick.\n  After joining Senator Hatch in introducing the PROTECT Act, I \nconvened a Judiciary Committee hearing on the legislation. We heard \nfrom the Administration, from the Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren, CMEC, and from experts who came and told us that our bill, as \nintroduced, would pass constitutional muster, but the House-passed bill \nwould not.\n  I also placed S. 2520 on the Judiciary Committee's calendar for the \nOctober 8, 2002 business meeting. I continued to work with Senator \nHatch to improve the bill so that it could be quickly enacted. Senator \nHatch circulated a Hatch-Leahy proposed Judiciary Committee substitute \nthat improved the bill before our October 8 business meeting. \nUnfortunately, the committee was unable to consider it because of \nprocedural maneuvering that had nothing to do with this important \nlegislation, including the refusal of committee members on the other \nside of the aisle to consider any pending legislation on the \ncommittee's agenda.\n  I still wanted to get this bill done. That is why for a week I have \nbeen working to clear and have the Senate pass a substitute to S. 2520 \nthat tracks the Hatch-Leahy proposed committee substitute in every area \nbut also made one improvement to the affirmative defense. That one \nimprovement related to the ability of defendants to assert an \naffirmative defense to a charge of child pornography if they could \nactually prove that only adults, and no children--virtual or not--were \nused in making the material in question. Other than that, it was \nidentical to the Hatch-Leahy proposed committee substitute in every \nway. It did not change the definition of child pornography from the \nPROTECT Act and it also did not change the tools provided to \nprosecutors. All these provisions remained unchanged. Indeed, the \nsubstitute I offered even adopted parts of the House bill which would \nhelp the CMEC to work with local and state law enforcement on these \ncases.\n  As I stated many days ago on the Senate floor, every single \nDemocratic Senator cleared that measure. I then urged Republicans to \nwork on their side of the aisle to clear this measure--so similar to \nthe joint Hatch-Leahy substitute--so that we could swiftly enact a law \nthat would pass constitutional muster.\n  Instead of working to clear that bipartisan, constitutional measure, \nhowever, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have opted to use \nthis issue to play politics. They have redrafted the bill, changed \ncrucial definitions, and are now offering a totally new version. Worse \nyet, the new version is not likely to pass Constitutional muster. \nInstead, if passed, it will lead to six more years of appellate \nlitigation and yet another law struck down by the Supreme Court. That \nwill help no one and certainly not help the children that these laws \nare intended to help.\n  Senator Hatch is offering a new version of the bill that experts have \ntold us is plainly unconstitutional and does not respect or heed the \nparameters laid down by the Supreme Court\n\n[[Page S10797]]\n\nas does the original Hatch-Leahy bill and the Hatch-Leahy substitute \ncirculated to the Judiciary Committee.\n  First, the new Hatch proposal outlaws precisely the thing that \nJustice Kennedy and at least 5 other members of the Supreme Court said \ncould not be banned--wholly computer generated child pornography where \nno real children are involved in the making of the material. The Hatch \nproposal, in section 5, adds a totally new definition of ``child \npornography'' that covers non-obscene ``computer generated images'' not \nat all related to any real person, if they are ``virtually \nindistinguishable'' from an actual minor. That is the same approach as \nthe House bill, that we heard so roundly criticized both at our \nCommittee hearing and by other experts. At best, it addresses the \nconcerns of only Justice O'Connor--but she was not the deciding vote in \nthe Free Speech case.\n  Second, this new definition is particularly problematic because the \nbill does not allow any affirmative defense for defendants who can show \nthat no children at all were used in the making of the non-obscene \nimage. Thus, even a defendant who can produce an actual 25-year-old in \ncourt to prove that the material is not child pornography can be sent \nto jail under this new provision. So too can the person who can prove \nin court that the image did not involve real people at all, but only \ntotally computer generated images. Again, that is precisely the problem \nthat Justice Kennedy and even Justice Thomas expressed concern about in \nthe Free Speech case in considering the affirmative defense in the \nCPPA.\n  Third, the new Hatch proposal significantly changes the definition of \nthe new crime of ``pandering'' from the original version of S. 2520 \nthat Senator Hatch and I introduced. First, it removes the link to the \nlong-standing obscenity test despite the fact that constitutional \nexperts tell us that this link is necessary for the pandering crime to \nbe constitutional. This changed definition does not address Justice \nKennedy's concern that child pornography should be linked to obscenity. \nWe do not want a situation where people who present such movies as \nTraffic, American Beauty, and Romeo and Juliet could be subjected to \ncriminal prosecution, and this new pandering crime does that.\n  Second, the new provision compounds the constitutional problems by \nextending the provision to ``purported material'' in addition to actual \nmaterial. Thus, not only need the pandering not relate to ``obscene'' \nmaterial, it need not relate to any material at all.\n  From a provision that criminalized primarily commercial speech \nrelating to obscene material, the new proposal has changed to \ncriminalize pure ``chat,'' including over the Internet, about non-\nobscene child pornography. That is protected speech. I have a letter \nfrom Professor Fred Schauer, a nationally recognized First Amendment \nscholar who testified at our hearing, that I will place in the record \nthat confirms that this change would render the provision pandering \nunconstitutional.\n  These are only some of the problems with the new Hatch language. I am \ndisappointed that we could not work together to clear the prior \nsubstitute that I have been trying to clear through the Senate for \nalmost a week. That proposal was virtually identical to the proposed \nHatch-Leahy committee substitute, and was approved by every single \nDemocratic Senator. If my colleagues would have been willing to do \nthat, we would have had quick action on a law that would stick. \nInstead, we are being asked to consider a brand new version of S. 2520 \nwith considerable constitutional problems. That is not the way to pass \nlegislation quickly in the Senate.\n  Unlike Senator Hatch's prior proposals that I cosponsored, this \nprovision will only offer the illusion of action. We need a law with \nteeth, not one with false teeth. In the end, this provision will be \nstruck down just as was the 1996 CPPA and we will have wasted 6 more \nyears without providing prosecutors the tools they need to fight child \npornography and put in jeopardy any convictions obtained under a law \nthat in the end is struck down as unconstitutional. I had hoped that we \ncould work together to get a law that will clearly pass constitutional \nmuster. This issue is too important for politics.\n  I ask that a letter from Frederick Schauer, Frank Stanton Professor \nof the First Amendment, be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Harvard University,\n\n                                   Cambridge, MA, October 3, 2002.\n     Re S. 2520.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Following up on my written statement \n     and on my oral testimony before the Committee on Wednesday, \n     October 2, 2002, the staff of the committee has asked me to \n     comment on the constitutional implications of changing the \n     current version of S. 2520 to change the word ``material'' in \n     Section 2 of the bill (page 2, lines 17 and 19) to \n     ``purported material.''\n       In my opinion the change would push well over the \n     constitutional edge a provision that is now right up against \n     that edge, but probably barely on the constitutional side it.\n       As I explained in my statement and orally, the Supreme \n     Court has from the Ginzburg decision in 1966 to the Hamling \n     decision in 1973 to the Free Speech Coalition decision in \n     2002 consistently refused to accept that ``pandering'' may be \n     an independent offense, as opposed to being evidence of the \n     offense of obscenity (and, by implication, child \n     pornography). The basic premise of the pandering prohibition \n     S. 2520 is thus in some tension with more than thirty-five \n     years of Supreme Court doctrine. What may save the provision, \n     however, is the fact that pandering may also be seen as \n     commercial advertisement, and the commercial advertisement of \n     an unlawful product or service is not protected by the \n     Supreme Court's commercial speech doctrine, as the Court made \n     clear in both Virginia Pharmacy and also in Pittsburgh Press \n     v. Human Relations Commission, 413 U.S. 376 (1973). It is \n     important to recognize, however, that this feature of \n     commercial speech doctrine does not apply to non-commercial \n     speech, where the description or advocacy of illegal acts is \n     fully protected unless under the narrow circumstances, not \n     applicable here, of immediate incitement.\n       The implication of this is that moving away from \n     communication that could be described as an actual commercial \n     advertisement decreases the availability of this approach to \n     defending Section 2 of S. 2520. Although it may appear as if \n     advertising ``material'' that does not exist at all \n     (``purported material'') makes little difference, there is a \n     substantial risk that the change moves the entire section \n     away from the straight commercial speech category into more \n     general description, conversation, and perhaps even advocacy. \n     Because the existing arguments for the constitutionality of \n     this provision are already difficult ones after Free Speech \n     Coalition, anything that makes this provision less like a \n     straight offer to engage in a commercial transaction \n     increases the degree of constitutional jeopardy. By including \n     ``purported'' in the relevant section, the pandering locks \n     less commercial, and thus less like commercial speech, and \n     thus less open to the constitutional defense I outlines in my \n     written statement and oral testimony.\n       I hope that this is helpful.\n           Yours sincerely,\n\n                                            Frederick Schauer,\n\n                                           Frank Stanton Professor\n     of the First Amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/28/senate-section/article/S10797-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10797-S10798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  VETERANS LONG-TERM CARE AND MEDICAL PROGRAMS ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2002\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am sincerely disappointed \nabout the placing of an anonymous hold on S. 2043, the ``Veterans Long-\nTerm Care and Medical Programs Enhancement Act of 2002.''\n  There is no apparent reason why this important piece of legislation \nshould be held up at this time. It was developed in a bipartisan manner \nand encompasses many vital pieces of legislation from both sides of the \naisle. It is my sincere hope that the Senator responsible for this hold \nwill realize that this is certainly not the time to be playing politics \nwith legislation that affects our Nation's veterans.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues some of the key provisions \nof S. 2043 that seek to improve the accessibility and quality of the VA \nhealth care system.\n  The centerpiece of this bill is an effort to make VA's prescription \ndrug copayment policy a bit more equitable for lower-income veterans. \nMr. President, currently, veterans with incomes of less than $24,000 a \nyear are exempt from copayments for most VA health care services. \nHowever, when it comes to prescription drugs, the income threshold for \nexemption is about $9,000 a year. This bill would raise the exemption \nlevel for prescription copayments to make them the same as other VA \nhealth care copayments.\n\n[[Page S10798]]\n\n  Veterans earning just over $9,000--which is well below the poverty \nthreshold, are required to make prescription copayments. These \ncopayments place an enormous financial burden on our poorest veterans. \nTo compound this problem, earlier this year, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs increased the copayment for prescription drugs from $2 to $7 \nper 30-day prescription.\n  Most of the veterans who will benefit from this provision are older, \nare on fixed incomes, and are on many different medications, each \nrequiring a separate copayment. Most of them have no health insurance \nexcept for Medicare and so they must depend upon the VA for their \nmedications. With the lack of a Medicare drug benefit, these veterans \nare now faced with a 350 percent increase in what they must pay for \nlife-sustaining medications.\n  Imagine the situation of a veteran with an income of about $10,000 a \nyear who takes ten medications a month and it is not at all unusual for \nan elderly person to take that many medications. With the increase in \nthe prescription copayment rate, that veteran now has to allocate over \n8 percent of this annual income just to pay for prescription drugs. And \nalthough the $7 per prescription charge may seem like an insignificant \namount to some, I can assure my colleagues that to the veteran and his \nfamily living on a very limited income, it is quite significant.\n  Of particular note, S. 2043 also contains mental health care \nprovisions--a key element of caring for those who have served on the \nbattlefield--that would ensure currently successful programs across the \ncountry continue to get necessity funding. Congress previously enacted \na provision to designate $15 million in VA funding specifically to help \nmedical facilities improve care for veterans with substance abuse \ndisorders and PTSD. The funds for these mental health grant programs, \nmandated by the Veterans Millennium Benefits and Health Care Act of \n1999, will soon revert to a general fund.\n  Despite the slow start, this funding has already increased the PTSD \nand substance abuse disorder treatment programs available to veterans. \nMore than 100 staff have been hired in 18 of VA's 21 service networks \nto treat substance abuse disorders. Nine new programs--in Baltimore, \nMaryland; Atlanta, Georgia; San Francisco, California; and Dayton, Ohio \namong others--have initiated or intensified opioid substitution \nprograms for veterans who have not responded well to drug-free \ntreatment regimens. Other new programs, such as those in Tampa, FL; \nCincinnati, OH; Columbia, MO; and Loma Linda, CA put special emphasis \non treating veterans with more complex conditions that include PTSD and \nsubstance abuse. The additional funding has enabled VA to develop \nbetter outpatient substance abuse and PTSD treatment programs, \noutpatient dual-diagnosis programs, more PTSD community clinical teams, \nand more residential substance abuse disorder rehabilitation programs. \nThe legislation being blocked in the Senate would ensure that this \nfunding remained ``protected'' for three more years, and would increase \nthe total amount of funding identified specifically for treatment of \nsubstance abuse disorders and PTSD from $15 million to $25 million.\n  Additionally, the bill contains authorization for four construction \nprojects. Two of these projects are much-needed seismic corrections for \nVA Medical Centers in the state of California. I think all of my \ncolleagues would agree that no veteran should ever be endangered by \naging infrastructure while in the care of VA should a natural disaster, \nsuch as an earthquake, occur. I thank Senator Boxer for her leadership \non the construction issue. The remaining two construction projects in \nS. 2043 are for nursing homes. One of these homes is in Beckley, WV, of \nwhich the design plans have already been made. I am proud to be \ninvolved in helping to bring a long-term care facility to the veterans \nof my home State who have been in need of such a home for quite some \ntime now. The other nursing home project is in Lebanon, PA.\n  S. 2043 would also fix a longstanding problem faced by VA's retired \nnurses. Last December, Congress passed the Department of Veterans \nAffairs Health Care Programs Enhancement Act of 2001. Enacted as Public \nLaw 107-135, this legislation gave VA several tools to respond to the \nlooming nurse crisis. In addition, it altered how part-time service \nperformed by certain title 38 employees would be considered when \ngranting retirement credit.\n  Previously, the law required that title 38 employees' part-time \nservices prior to April 7, 1986, be prorated when calculating \nretirement annuities, resulting in lower annuities for these employees. \nSection 132 of the VA Health Programs Enhancement Act was intended to \nexempt all previously retired registered nurses, physician assistants, \nand expanded-function dental auxiliaries from this requirement. \nHowever, the Office of Personnel Management has interpreted this \nprovision to only apply to those health care professionals who retire \nafter its enactment date.\n  The legislation being blocked in the Senate would require OPM to \ncomply with the original intent of the VA Health Programs Enhancement \nAct, and therefore to recalculate the annuities for these retired \nhealth care professionals. This clarification would not extend \nretirement benefits retroactively to the date of retirement, but would \nensure that annuities are calculated fairly from now on for eligible \nemployees who retired between April 7, 1986, and January 23, 2002.\n  Mr. President, the legislation would also provide transfer rights for \nhourly rate Veterans Canteen Service, VCS, employees to title 5 VA \npositions through internal competitive procedures. VCS hourly employees \nare federal employees hired under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 7802. \nWhile this authority provides many of the same benefits that title 5 \nfederal employees enjoy, (i.e., workers compensation, health benefits, \nretirement, and veterans preference) there are benefits to which they \nare not entitled. For example, VCS hourly employees do not have the \nsame transfer rights to other VA positions that VCS managers have.\n  As a result, VCS hourly employees applying for VA food service \npositions, VA housekeeping positions, and other VA positions--positions \nfor which they are well qualified--are not treated as internal \ncompetitive service candidates. Their years of service are irrelevant, \nas they cannot easily transfer to another job at VA without first going \nthrough civil service competitions. This legislation would change that \nand allow them to compete equally with other VA candidates. I wish to \nthank the American Federation of Government Employees for bringing this \nissue to my attention and for the assistance and leadership that they \nprovided.\n  S. 2043 will help thousands of veterans across America, in a variety \nof ways. We cannot turn our backs on those who have sacrificed so much \nfor this country. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/28/senate-section/article/S10798-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10798-S10799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2001, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on October 23, 2002, during the recess of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1210.
