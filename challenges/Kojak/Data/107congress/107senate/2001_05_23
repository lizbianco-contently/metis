Mr. President, I know I speak for all of my colleagues \nin thanking His Holiness, Catholicos Karekin the Second, the Supreme \nPatriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians, for leading the Senate in \nprayer this morning. His prayer, I must say, was inspiring. I hope all \nof us took to heart particularly his admonition that we should show \nwisdom in our dealings with one another.\n  His Holiness is the world leader of the Armenian Church, which traces \nits roots to the first century preaching of Jesus' Apostles, Saint \nThaddeus and Saint Bartholomew. The Armenian Church is among the \nOrthodox churches, which, along with the Catholic and Protestant \nChurches, constitutes one of three branches of Christianity.\n  The Catholicos was elected democratically by an assembly of clergy \nand lay delegates from around the world in October 1999. He is the \n132nd in a continuous line of catholicoi. He sits in Armenia and \nadministers the Armenian Church from the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin \nand has authority over Dioceses on five continents.\n  In the United States, there are well over 1 million Armenian \nAmericans who live in all parts of our country. They have made very \nimportant contributions to all aspects of American life.\n  His Holiness is well known not only for his spiritual leadership but \nhis charitable works to help the needy, his educational programs, and \nhis management skills. He is also recognized in the international \nreligious community, where he sought to draw churches closer together. \nHe has met with John Paul II and will be meeting in September with Pope \nJohn Paul II when he comes to visit Armenia.\n  The Catholicos is visiting the United States to celebrate the 1700th \nanniversary of the conversion of Armenia to Christianity. He is meeting \nwith U.S. religious leaders and the Armenian-American communities. The \ntheme of his visit is ``Walking Together in the Light of the Lord.''\n  Mr. President, we are pleased and honored that he is here with us \ntoday.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/23/senate-section/article/S5490-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5490]]\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I thank my colleagues for their \nconsideration and cooperation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before we hear from our friend, I wish to \nindicate to the Senate that we have six amendments lined up. We are \nconfident that the two leaders can work something out during the day. \nWe hope maybe there can be some end to the debate on this bill, but \nthat will be up to the two leaders. We have shared the first amendment \nwith the majority. We have five others we will give to them briefly.\n  We are hopeful things will move along well today, and especially, if \nwe stick to our 10-minute voting, I think we can go through the first \nsix amendments at an accelerated rate.\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the modifications to \n  the child tax credit contained in section 201 should be part of the \n                           final tax package)\n\n       On page 18, between lines 14 and 15, insert:\n\n     SEC. 202. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE MODIFICATIONS TO THE \n                   CHILD TAX CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) There are over 12,000,000 children in poverty in the \n     United States--about 78 percent of these children live in \n     working families.\n       (2) The child tax credit was originally designed to benefit \n     families with children in recognition of the costs associated \n     with raising children.\n       (3) There are 15,400,000 children whose families would not \n     benefit from the doubling of the child tax credit unless it \n     is made refundable and another 7,000,000 children live in \n     families who will not receive an increased benefit under the \n     bill unless the credit is made refundable.\n       (4) A person who earns the Federal minimum wage and works \n     40 hours a week for 50 weeks a year earns approximately \n     $10,300.\n       (5) The provision included in section 201 would give \n     families with children the benefit of a partially refundable \n     child tax credit based on 15 cents of their income for every \n     dollar earned above $10,000.\n       (6) For a family earning $15,000 that is an additional $750 \n     to help make ends meet.\n       (7) Doubling the child tax credit to $1,000 and making it \n     partially refundable will benefit over 37,000,000 families \n     with dependent children.\n       (8) The expansion of the child tax credit included in \n     section 201 is a meaningful and a responsible effort on the \n     part of the Senate to address the needs of low income working \n     families to promote work and such an expansion would provide \n     the benefit of a child tax credit to 10,700,000 more children \n     than the provision passed by the House of Representatives.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the ``10-15'' child tax credit provision included in \n     section 201 is a worthy start, and should be maintained as \n     part of the final package.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a sense of the Senate \namendment in support of the provisions in the bill that expand and \nextend the child tax credit to millions of working families. I am \njoined in offering this amendment by Senators Lincoln, Jeffords, \nChafee, DeWine, Kerry, Dodd, Rockefeller, Collins, Domenici, Smith of \nOregon, and Wellstone.\n  The RELIEF Act doubles the maximum child tax credit from $500 to \n$1,000 per child and extends it by making it partially refundable for \n15 cents on every dollar earned above $10,000. These provisions were \nincorporated in the bill during the Senate Finance Committee markup on \na bipartisan basis and, together, these provisions will extend the \nbenefits of the child tax credit to more than 55 million children \nnationally, as well as 37 million families. Without refundability, \nalmost 16 million of these children would not be eligible for an \nincreased benefit. The overwhelming majority of these children--almost \ntwo-thirds--live in working families.\n  This amendment demonstrates our commitment to the child tax credit \nprovisions in this package. I urge support of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know of no opposition to this amendment. \nWe yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) \nand the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide a circuit breaker for tax cuts if debt levels are \n not reduced as provided in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2002)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . CIRCUIT BREAKER.\n\n       (a) In General.--In any fiscal year beginning with fiscal \n     year 2004, if the level of debt held by the public at the end \n     of that fiscal year (as projected by the Office of Management \n     and Budget sequestration update report on August 20th \n     preceding the beginning of that fiscal year) would exceed the \n     level of debt held by the public for that fiscal year set \n     forth in the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 2002 (H. Con. Res. 83, 107th Congress), any Member of \n     Congress may move to proceed to a bill that would make \n     changes in law to reduce discretionary spending and direct \n     spending (except for changes in Social Security, Medicare and \n     COLA's) and increase revenues in a manner that would reduce \n     the debt held by the public for the fiscal year to a level \n     not exceeding the level provided in that concurrent \n     resolution for that fiscal year.\n       (b) Consideration of Legislation.--A bill considered under \n     subsection (a) shall be considered as provided in section \n     310(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. \n     641(e)).\n       (c) Procedure.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to \n     consider any bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, or \n     conference report, pursuant to this section, that contains \n     any provisions other than those enumerated in section \n     310(a)(1) and 310(a)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974. This point of order may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative vote of three-\n     fifths of the Members duly chosen and sworn, shall be \n     required in the Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of \n     the Chair on a point of order raised under this paragraph.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. This amendment is a circuit breaker as \nopposed to a trigger. Nothing automatically kicks in as in the case of \nthe trigger amendments that have been offered in the past but it does, \nin fact, create an opportunity for a privileged motion that deals with \nspending or tax cuts in the event the debt reduction targets are not \nbeing met.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.  Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate will please \ncome to order.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, this circuit breaker does not \nspecify any action to be taken if the midcourse review legislation is \nnot enacted into law. What it does is it simply permits any Senator to \nbring up a privileged motion that deals with spending or tax cuts but \nexempts Social Security, Medicare, and COLA's from being subject to any \npotential spending cuts in the midcourse correction.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. I ask they do so.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am not going to use my 1 minute. With \nthis modification, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be agreed to; \nif not, then by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back his time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 769), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the list we gave to the majority lists \nSenator Durbin being next but we want to flip that and have Senator \nGraham's amendment be next in order.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 784\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 784 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself and Mr. \n     Johnson, proposes an amendment numbered 784.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide a deduction for unreimbursed expenses related to \n     certain public activities of emergency response professionals)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

First, I thank my colleagues, the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Grassley, and the ranking member, Senator Baucus, \nfor helping work out this amendment. They have done a great job. I \nreally appreciate it. But I also believe all of our policemen and our \nfirefighters and our volunteer firefighters are going to appreciate it \neven more because what happens right now is a lot of our law \nenforcement officers, firefighters, and volunteer firefighters spend a \nlot of money out of their own pockets for work-related expenses. This \namendment would help cover their out-of-pocket expenses for their guns, \nbulletproof vests, uniforms, some transportation costs, and equipment \nfor volunteer firefighters.\n  Just to give you an example of what I am talking about, police \nofficers in Altoona, IA, pay for their own guns, which can cost up to \n$800. In Des Moines, they have to pay for their guns, ammunition, shoes \nand boots, and part of the cost of their $600 bulletproof vests. For \nsome police, when they go to training, the training is paid for but the \ntransportation to get there is not paid for, so they have to pay for \nthat out of their own pocket.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent for just 30 seconds more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. For these men and women, who earn an average of $28,000 \nto $40,000 a year and have families to support, those expenses add up, \nespecially for new officers. This amendment would help provide a \ndeduction for these people when they pay for those expenses out of \ntheir own pocket.\n  Again, I thank Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus for being willing \nto work out this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment is similar to one we did \nin another profession on another amendment that is being worked out. We \naccept this amendment, look favorably on it. I ask if we can have a \nvoice vote.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question occurs on agreeing to amendment No. 784.\n  The amendment (No. 784) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I call up my motion at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan (Ms. Stabenow) moves to recommit \n     the bill H.R. 1836, as amended, to the Committee on Finance \n     with instructions to report the same back to the Senate \n     forthwith with an amendment that--\n       (1) ensures that the provisions of this bill do not result \n     in any fiscal year in an on-budget surplus for that fiscal \n     year that is less than the surplus for that year in the \n     Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund; and\n       (2) establishes a 60-vote point of order prohibiting any \n     bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report \n     that uses funds in such Trust Fund for any purpose other than \n     for providing part A benefits under the Medicare program.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in this \nmotion to recommit and to join with Senator Bob Graham, who has been \nsuch a leader in protecting Medicare, and my colleague from Minnesota, \nSenator Dayton, who has been such a champion on Medicare and \nprescription drugs.\n  This is a very simple, straightforward motion. No. 1, it says we will \nnot use the Medicare Part A trust funds in order to pay for this tax \ncut. We have seen in the numbers from the final conference committee on \nthe budget that every single year Medicare trust funds are used for \nthis tax cut. This says no to that practice. It puts into place a 60-\nvote point of order in the future for any other attempts to use the \nMedicare trust fund.\n  We believe strongly that we need to update Medicare. We need to \nprovide prescription drugs and strengthen Medicare. We ought not to be \nusing it for other purposes.\n  We ask colleagues to join us, to say strongly that when it comes to \nMedicare, we want to update it, not raid it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, everything the Senator from Michigan \nsaid, I agree with. I would just do it in a different way. I would do \nit according to the budget resolution that was adopted.\n  In that budget resolution, we fully protect Part A. It is a \ncommitment on the part of this party, this Congress, and the President \nof the United States to only use Medicare money for Medicare, nothing \nelse. That is what we will do.\n  This amendment is not needed because of the budget and the planning \non this tax bill. This issue comes up every time we are trying to \nspread out the tax reductions over the next 10 years. It is very basic \nto every decision we make that we not go into the Medicare trust fund.\n  I ask Members not to vote for the amendment because it is not needed.\n  I raise a point of order on germaneness. That point of order is based \nupon section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for consideration of the pending motion, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 46, nays 54, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 160 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--54\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote there are 46 yeas and 54 nays. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained and the motion falls.\n\n[[Page S5493]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 763\n\n(Purpose: To allow individuals a deduction for qualified long-term care \n  insurance premiums, use of such insurance under cafeteria plans and \nflexible spending arrangements, and a credit for individuals with long-\n                            term care needs)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 763.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 763.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is located in the Record of Tuesday, May \n22, 2001, under ``Amendments Submitted and Proposed.'')\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, one of the dramatic announcements of the \n2000 census was the fact that one of the fastest growing components of \nour population is Americans over the age of 80. This is just the first \nripple of what will be a tidal wave of Americans over the age of 80 as \nwe move into the 21st century.\n  This amendment goes to exactly that issue by first recognizing the \ncare that is currently being given to older Americans by caregivers by \nproviding a $3,000 tax credit to those persons who are tending to the \nneeds of a frail elderly member of their family, and second, to \nencourage Americans to purchase long-term care insurance for their own \nprotection when they might reach the point where they require \ninstitutional care.\n  This is an extremely important amendment for preparation of the \nfuture of millions of Americans. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we know of the need to recognize the \ncontribution of 22 million family caregivers in the United States. We \nknow the need to encourage people to save for long-term care through \ntax credits for long-term health care.\n  Following a hearing I held last month on long-term care, Senator \nGraham and I introduced legislation to do what this amendment creates. \nHe and I worked jointly on a similar bill last year and pressed hard \nfor its passage.\n  As I stated at the hearing, I am committed to addressing the pressing \nfinancial long-term care challenges that accompany the retirement of \nthe baby boom generation. However, I cannot support the inclusion of \nhis amendment in the bill since it raises taxes on people to pay for \nit.\n  I will be offering a second-degree amendment. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 786 to Amendment No. 763\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment at the \ndesk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 786 to amendment No. 763.\n       On page 1, line 2, strike all after the word ``strike'' \n     through the end of page 1, line 3.\n       On page 20, strike lines 14 and 15 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``This section shall apply to policies issued after January \n     1st 2006.''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment, rather than raise taxes, \nwill be paid for out of the budget surplus.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, what is the time limit for debate on \nsecond-degree amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute each. The Senator yielded back his \ntime. The Senator from Florida has 1 minute.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The amendment that is offered proposes to pay for this by \nmaking a 1-percent reduction in the marginal rate cut for the highest \nincome Americans. The second-degree amendment pays for it by blowing \nthe budget cap of $1.35 trillion and going above that for the purposes \nof this very important amendment.\n  I believe strongly in this amendment, but I also believe in fiscal \ndiscipline. I am afraid the course being suggested by the second-degree \namendment is the course that is going to be suggested for the remaining \nmonths of this session of Congress; that is, every time we have a new \ntax idea, let's do it by increasing the total amount of tax and not be \nfaithful to the commitment we have made to limit the total tax \nauthority to $1.35 trillion.\n  Mr. President, on policy grounds, I strongly oppose the second-degree \namendment. I raise a point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I raise the point of order that the \npending second-degree amendment violates section 311(a)(2)(B) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to waive the Budget Act and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote the yeas are 49, the nays are 51. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, am I correct the second-degree amendment \nhas failed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It failed.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. By virtue of the waiver of the point of order not having \nreceived 60 votes, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have a point of order that the pending \namendment is not germane to the provisions of the reconciliation bill. \nI make that under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask the budget point of order be waived. \nI will ask for the yeas and nays, but before doing so I would like to \nuse my 1 minute to speak against the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, what we have raised in this one amendment \nare two of the most basic questions that this overall tax bill raises. \nOne is fiscal discipline. We had a vote, and I am pleased more than a \nmajority of Senators voted not to break the $1.35 trillion cap. That \nwas what we were being asked to do, to add $50 billion beyond the \ncurrent tax cut authority through the amendment that was offered by the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  The second issue we are now facing is one of priorities. Upon which \ndo you\n\n[[Page S5494]]\n\nput the higher priority, assisting Americans prepare for their old age, \nhelping families who are providing care for a frail, elderly family \nmember through a $3,000 tax credit--is that a higher priority than \ndelaying the 1-percent decrease for the highest income-tax payers in \nAmerica, the rate reduction which is in this underlying bill? Those are \nthe choices. Which is more important to you? What are your priorities?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for equal time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to support my point of order and \nto say I agree on the need for long-term care insurance, a need to \nencourage family care giving through tax credits. The Senator and I \nhave introduced legislation to accomplish that. Also, people need to \nremember that senior citizens who pay income taxes are going to benefit \nfrom our tax reduction as well.\n  The second and last point I will make is: This, again, is one more \ntime of, I will bet, dozens of times over the last 4 days that we have \nhad amendments from the other side to break up the rate structure, the \nbipartisan compromise in this bill.

this section.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment. We have had \ntwo worries mainly about this tax bill. One is that the dollars go too \nmuch to the wealthiest people and not enough to the middle class, and \nwe have had a lot of amendments thereon. The second is that it breaks \nfiscal discipline. This amendment deals with that second category.\n  What is missing in this tax bill bothers me as much as what is in it, \nmaybe more. We do not do any of the tax extenders which we know we will \ndo later this year. We do not change the alternative minimum tax hardly \nat all, which will catch 39 million people by the time this 10-year \nbill is finished.\n  This amendment includes both of those so we do not have to come back \nand do them and break the $1.35 trillion that we said we will keep and \nlowers the top rate to make room for those.\n  It is a fiscally responsible amendment. I would challenge anyone who \nwants to vote against it to make a pledge that they will not vote at a \nlater time outside the budget cap for these two issues.\n  I thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this amendment raises the whole extender \nquestion, something the Finance Committee will be looking at later this \nyear. The bipartisan bill before us does not address this issue.\n  This amendment is nongermane to the bill, and I raise a point of \norder that it is nongermane.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

Mr. President, may I inquire of the distinguished floor \nleaders, the Collins-Warner amendment has been pending. We have been \nvery deferential to the leadership. Can we get an idea of when that \nmight be disposed?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Let me be perfectly candid with the Senator from \nVirginia. If the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Maine still \nwant a rollcall on their amendment, we will do that at 1:30.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have worked \nhard over here today with people wanting to offer amendments. Some have \nbeen on file since last week. I hope this doesn't start another string \nof amendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not hearing the soft, wonderful voice of my great \nfriend. Can he raise it a bit?\n  Mr. REID. We have about 40 amendments over here that have been filed. \nThrough various means, the amendments are not going to be brought up. I \nhope the managers can work something out as to the amendment of the \nSenator from Virginia without another rollcall vote. I am afraid this \nmay start a series of rollcall votes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, might I say to the distinguished \nDemocratic leader and the managers of the bill that there has been an \nongoing negotiation with regard to this amendment, and my distinguished \ncolleague from Maine and I have been very forthcoming with our \nmanagers. Our bill was up and we got the yeas and nays when this matter \nfirst hit the floor. We have acceded to their requests day after day to \ndelay it. We think the time has come now.\n  I assure the Senator we were in the front of the queue. Amendment \nafter amendment has been filed at the desk subsequent to ours. We were \nhere day 1, hour 1. We have cooperated with our distinguished managers \nto this point. I hope our distinguished Democratic whip will allow us \nto bring up this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Baucus and I will work to see that we have no more \nrollcall votes. If you have to have this one, I guess you do. But I \nhope we don't have to have another one also. We will do our best to see \nthat there will not be any more.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I point out to \nthe Senator that the yeas and nays were ordered on the Collins-Warner \namendment last Thursday night when it was first debated for a half hour \non the Senate floor. This isn't a new amendment or a new request. The \nyeas and nays were, in fact, ordered last week. I wanted to clarify \nthat for the record.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I advise our distinguished Democratic \nleader that Senators Mikulski, Dodd, and Harkin have worked with us \nright along, so it is a bipartisan effort. I am sure if they were \npresent, they would join us in this request.\n  Mr. REID. That is my point. It sounds as if you have a good \nbipartisan amendment. I can't understand why we need a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my good friend, I guess I reached down in the 23 \nyears of experience in managing many bills and being in many \nconferences. There is a certain feeling about this legislation. It is \nfor teachers. It is simple----\n\n[[Page S5496]]\n\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will withhold, if the managers will agree, \nwe will work to see what needs to be done.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I believe Senator Baucus would agree with me. I have \nbeen asked now if we can do it this way. We will recess until 1:30, but \nwe would vote on the amendment by the Senator from Virginia and the \nSenator from Maine just prior to final passage. So we would have this \nrollcall vote and then final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair asks the Senator from Iowa, is he \nmaking that part of his unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. WARNER. I so request, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I make that as part of my unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, will the Senator from Iowa \nallow the recess to end at 1:40?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I change my unanimous consent request \nthat the Senate stand in recess now until the hour of 1:40.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Thereupon, the Senate, at 12:38 p.m., recessed until 1:40 p.m. and \nreassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Ms. \nStabenow).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/23/senate-section/article/S5496-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5496-S5522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RESTORING EARNINGS TO LIFT INDIVIDUALS AND EMPOWER FAMILIES (RELIEF) \n                         ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 789\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

I ask unanimous \nconsent the amendment be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and any statements regarding these amendments be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted and Proposed.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am pleased the managers' amendment \nincludes language identical to S. 694, the Artist-Museum Partnership \nAct, I introduced with Senator Bennett earlier this year. I would like \nto thank Senator Bennett for his leadership on this issue and also \nwould like to thank Senators Bingaman, Cochran, Daschle, Dodd, \nDomenici, Jeffords, Johnson, Kennedy, Lieberman, Lincoln, Reid, and \nWarner for cosponsoring this bill.\n  This bipartisan legislation will enable our country to keep cherished \nart works in the United States and preserve them in our public \ninstitutions, while erasing an inequity in our Tax Code that currently \nserves as a disincentive for artists to donate their works to museums \nand libraries. Our bill would allow artists, writers and composers who \ndonate works to museums and libraries to take a tax deduction equal to \nthe fair market value of the work. This is something that collectors \nwho make similar donations are already able to do.\n  There is an inequality in the current tax law where artists who \ndonate self-created works are only able to deduct the cost of supplies \nsuch as canvas, pen, paper, ink. This is unfair to artists and it hurts \nmuseums and libraries, large and small, that are dedicated to \npreserving works for posterity.\n  In my State of Vermont, we are incredibly proud of the great works \nproduced by hundreds of local artists who choose to live and work in \nthe Green Mountain State. Displaying their creations in museums and \nlibraries helps develop a sense of pride among Vermonters and \nstrengthens a bond with Vermont, its landscape, its beauty and its \ncultural heritage. Anyone who has gazed at a painting in a museum or \nexamined an original manuscript or composition, and has gained a \ngreater understanding of both the artist and the subject as a result, \nknows the tremendous value of these works. I would like to see more of \nthem, not fewer, preserved in Vermont and across the country.\n  I thank the Chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee for \nincluding this legislation in the managers package. I hope that the \nprovision will be retained by the Conference Committee.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, the Boxer-Nelson of Florida \namendment seeks to safeguard public health and improve our nation's \ndrinking water by aiding water companies to secure tax-exempt bond to \ncomply with the 10 parts per billion arsenic drinking water standard.\n  Ironically, we offer this amendment today, May 23, 2001, one day \nafter Environmental Protection Agency finalized its decision to delay \nimplementation of a new arsenic standard until February 22, 2002.\n  Thus, the 1942 arsenic standard of 50 parts per billion, a standard \nput in place before arsenic was known to cause cancer, remains the \nstandard for our nation's drinking water.\n  This is true despite the scientific data which shows that the 50 \nparts per billion standard could result in one additional case of \ncancer for every 100 people consuming drinking water.\n  The EPA knows arsenic is dangerous. In fact, the EPA has found \nanother danger associated with arsenic in addition to cancer: genetic \nalteration of our DNA. In April of this year, a team of EPA scientists \npublished a report in ``Chemical Research Toxicology'' that \ndemonstrates that in addition to causing cancer, arsenic can induce \ngenetic alterations to human DNA.\n  The risks associated with arsenic are widely known not just in this \ncountry, but throughout the world. For that reason, the European Union \nand the World Health Organization have endorsed the 10 parts per \nbillion standard.\n  Costs did not prevent the European Union or the World Health \nOrganization from protecting their citizenry from the risks associated \nwith arsenic. Costs should not prevent the United States either.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the tax \nreconciliation package we have passed today contains an amendment that \nI offered along with Senator Landrieu. That amendment is the text of \nthe Hope for Children Act, which we introduced back in January as S. \n148.\n  I greatly appreciate the consideration this amendment has received \nfrom Chairman Grassley, who has long been a leader in the area of \nadoption and foster care. He and Senator Baucus, along with the staff \nof the Finance Committee, have been extremely responsive to me and my \nstaff as we worked through this amendment, and I thank them for their \nsupport of America's adopting families.\n  As my colleagues know, this legislation will continue and improve on \ntwo current tax provisions that are helping so many Americans who seek \nto form families through adoption: the adoption tax credit and the \nexclusion for employer-provided adoption benefits. These provisions are \ndue to expire at the end of this year, and the Hope for Children Act \nwill remove that sunset. It will also double the basic tax credit and \nexclusion, to $10,000. For a family adopting a child with special \nneeds, the current credit of $6,000 will rise to $10,000; perhaps more \nimportant to these families, their credit will no longer be tied to \ncumbersome and inflexible IRS regulations that exclude a wide range of \nlegitimate adoption expenses related to children with special needs. \nOur legislation will also make it possible for more families to qualify \nfor the full credit and exclusion, by lifting the cap on income \neligibility.\n  These are sound, necessary measures that truly help families. The \nSenate should be proud they are a part of our tax reconciliation \npackage, and I hope they will be preserved in the upcoming conference \nwith the House of Representatives. It is important to note that just \nlast week, the House unanimously passed its version of the Hope for \nChildren Act, H.R. 622. While that\n\n[[Page S5497]]\n\naction suggests there is a consensus supporting the adoption tax \ncredit, I strongly believe the Senate's version of that language is \npreferable, and I encourage the Senate's conferees to work to keep the \nSenate language intact.\n  Mr. President, there are still hundreds of thousands of children in \nthis country and around the world who are waiting for permanent, safe, \nloving families. It is these children who are the focus of the Hope for \nChildren Act, and it is on behalf of these children that I thank all my \ncolleagues for supporting an amendment that will help make the promise \nof adoption a reality. I look forward to seeing this language preserved \nby the conference, adopted by the House and Senate, and sent to \nPresident Bush to be signed into law.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I renew my request, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 789) was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent no additional \namendments to the pending reconciliation bill be in order other than \nconsideration of the Collins-Warner amendment. I ask further consent \nthat, following the disposition of the amendment described above, the \nbill be advanced to third reading, and a vote occur on passage, all \nwithout any intervening action, motion, or debate.\n  Finally, I ask, following the vote, the Senate insist on its \namendments, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, those \nconferees being: Senators Grassley, Hatch, Murkowski, Nickles, Gramm, \nBaucus, Rockefeller, Daschle, and Breaux.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      unanimous consent agreement\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have one more unanimous consent request, Madam \nPresident. I ask unanimous consent that, following that, on Wednesday, \nfollowing the passage of H.R. 1836, there be 1 hour of morning business \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees. I further \nask consent that, following that time, the Senate then proceed to \nexecutive session and the Committee on Foreign Relations be discharged \nfrom further consideration of the nomination of Senator Howard Baker to \nbe Ambassador to Japan. I further ask consent that the Senate then \nproceed to its consideration and there then be up to 2 hours for debate \non the nomination, to be equally divided between the chairman and \nranking member of the committee.\n  Finally, following the use or yielding back of time, that the Senate \nproceed to a vote on the nomination and, following that vote, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action, and that the Senate then \nresume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Did I understand the last request to be that the nomination \nof Howard Baker to be Ambassador to Japan take place tomorrow?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Today.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. I was going to make the recommendation it be \ndone today.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  There are now 2 minutes evenly divided on the Collins-Warner \namendment No. 675.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 675, As Modified\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Warner and myself, \nI send a modification of amendment No. 675 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  Amendment No. 675, as modified, is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide an above-the-line deduction for qualified \n professional development expenses of elementary and secondary school \n  teachers and to allow a credit against income tax to elementary and \n       secondary school teachers who provide classroom materials)\n\n       At the end of title IV, add the following:\n\n             Subtitle E--Miscellaneous Education Provisions\n\n     SEC. 441.

I would appreciate being notified when I have used 30 \nseconds, so Senator Warner, the coauthor of this amendment, can have \nthe remaining 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Collins/Warner teacher relief \namendment would support the expenditures of teachers who strive for \nexcellence beyond the constraints of what their schools can provide. \nOur amendment enjoys the bipartisan support of several of our \ncolleagues, including Senators Landrieu, Cochran, Allen, Gordon Smith, \nHarkin, Mikulski, Jack Reed, DeWine, Hutchinson, Dodd, and Enzi as well \nas the endorsement of the National Education Association, American \nFederation of Teachers, American Association of School Administrators, \nNational School Boards Association, National Association of State \nBoards of Education, Council for Exceptional Children, National Center \nfor Learning Disabilities, and the National Board for Professional \nTeaching Standards support the Collins/Warner Teacher Relief Amendment \nof 2001. I ask unanimous consent these support letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 2001.\n     Senator Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Education \n     Association's (NEA) 2.6 million members, we would like to \n     express our support for your amendment to the Senate tax bill \n     to provide tax benefits for educators' professional \n     development and classroom supply expenses.\n       As you know, teacher quality is the single most critical \n     factor in maximizing student achievement. Ongoing \n     professional development is essential to ensure that teachers \n     stay up-to-date on the skills and knowledge necessary to \n     prepare students for the challenges of the 21st century. Your \n     proposed tax deduction for professional development expenses \n     will make a critical difference in helping educators access \n     quality training.\n       We are also very pleased that your amendment would provide \n     a tax credit for educators who reach into their own pockets \n     to pay for necessary classroom materials, including books, \n     pencils, paper, and art supplies. A 1996 NEA study found that \n     the average K-12 teacher spent over $400 a year out of \n     personal funds for classroom supplies. For teachers earning \n     modest salaries, the purchase of classroom supplies \n     represents a considerable expense for which they often must \n     sacrifice other personal needs.\n       We thank you for your leadership in introducing this \n     important amendment and look forward to continuing to work \n     with you to support our nation's educators.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Mary Elizabeth Teasley,\n     Director of Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Board for Professional Teaching \n           StandardsTM,\n                                      Arlington, VA, May 21, 2001.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: The National Board for Professional \n     Teaching Standards (NBPTS) is pleased to lend its support to \n     the Teacher Relief Act of 2001 as an amendment to H.R. 1836, \n     the Tax Reconciliation Bill. As you know, National Board \n     Certification is one of the most demanding and prestigious \n     voluntary professional development programs available to our \n     nation's teachers. The tax deductions proposed in the Teacher \n     Support Act of 2001 would provide much needed financial \n     relief to teachers seeking to improve their teaching \n     practice.\n       National Board Certified Teachers (NBCTs) are the best \n     example of quality teaching and National Board Certification \n     reflects the highest standards in professional development \n     and assessment. Allowing teachers to deduct professional \n     development expenses, such as those associated with National \n     Board Certification, is an important supplement to the \n     policies and programs of states and school districts that \n     support the mission of the NBPTS to establish high and \n     rigorous standards for what accomplished teachers should know \n     and be able to do.\n       We look forward to continuing our work with you in \n     promoting the vital link between high quality professional \n     development and higher student achievement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Betty Castor,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Association of State Boards of Education,\n                                     Alexandria, VA, May 21, 2001.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: We are writing to applaud your \n     efforts to provide tax benefits for elementary and secondary \n     school teachers through the Teacher Relief Act, which will be \n     offered as an amendment to S. 1, the Better Education for \n     Students and Teachers Act (BEST). Teachers are the most \n     influential school-based factor in a student's academic \n     success. Your legislation will not only facilitate better \n     trained teachers, but reward teachers for their classroom \n     investments.\n       Quality professional development activities can \n     significantly increase student learning and improve teaching \n     practice. Allowing K-12 teachers a $500 annual tax deduction \n     for professional development expenses is a straightforward \n     solution to help promote on-going teacher training that is \n     individually directed and designed. It is one important \n     element in realizing the ultimate goal of effective and \n     comprehensive professional development programs.\n       In addition to their time, teachers also pay for a \n     significant amount of their classroom and instructional \n     materials out of their own pockets. Because these expenses \n     are frequently not reimbursed, they constitute an educational \n     donation that is too often overlook. Your proposal addresses \n     this fact by providing teachers with a 50% tax credit (up to \n     $250 annually) for out of pocket classroom expenses that will \n     financially reimburse teachers and enrich students' classroom \n     settings.\n       We appreciate your efforts and attention to address this \n     critical situation. NASBE\n\n[[Page S5499]]\n\n     looks forward to working with your office to enact federal \n     initiatives benefiting the instructional needs of America's \n     teachers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   David Griffith,\n     Director of Governmental Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              American Association\n\n\n                                     of School Administrators,\n\n                                                     May 17, 2001.\n     Senator Susan Collins,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the American Association \n     of School Administrators, representing more than 14,000 \n     public school superintendents and school system leaders, we \n     would like to express our strong support for the Collins/\n     Warner/Landrieu teacher tax credit amendment (amendment \n     #675).\n       Passage of the Teacher Relief Act would provide teachers \n     with two well-deserved benefits: a tax deduction for \n     professional development and a tax credit for out-of-pocket \n     classroom expenses. Together with Senators John Warner and \n     Mary Landrieu you have outlined a solution to a critical \n     problem facing teachers and educational professionals: the \n     lack of reimbursement for excess expenses incurred by \n     teachers. All too often schools lack the funds to provide \n     teachers with adequate classroom supplies or continuing \n     education. Dedicated teachers frequently opt to pay for \n     books, paper, supplies, and professional development with \n     their own money. Ideally we should not be asking our teachers \n     to make such a burdensome financial sacrifice; the least we \n     can do is make sure that those teachers are partially \n     reimbursed for their expenses.\n       The Collins/Warner/Landrieu amendment should not be thought \n     of as a tax benefit for teachers; it should be thought of as \n     educational reform. The Teacher Relief Act helps guarantee \n     that America's children are taught by qualified professionals \n     in well-equipped classrooms. Thank you for your continuing \n     support of public education.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jordan Cross,\n                                           Legislative Specialist.\n\n  In fact, the tax deductions proposed in the Teacher Support Act of \n2001 would provide much-needed financial relief to teachers seeking to \nimprove their teaching practice through advanced course work, and \nassist those teachers seeking advanced certification, such as the \nNational Board or additional educational endorsements.\n  In the midst of the education and tax debates, we are asking our \ncolleagues in the Senate now to overlook the selfless efforts of \nteachers and the financial sacrifices they make to improve their \ninstructional skills and the classrooms in which they teach.\n  Senator Warner deserves enormous credit for focusing the Senate's \nattention, through a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to the education \nbill, on the need to provide tax relief for our teachers.\n  Senator Warner's sense-of-the-Senate resolution which I was proud to \ncosponsor, passed by a vote of 95-3.\n  Our amendment would first allow teachers, teacher's aides, \nprincipals, and counselors to take an above-the-line tax deduction for \ntheir professional development expenses.\n  Second, the bill would grant educators a tax credit of up to $250 for \nbooks, supplies, and equipment they purchase for their students. The \ntax credit would be established at 50 percent of such expenditures, so \nfor every dollar in supplies a teacher spent, the teacher would receive \n50 cents of tax relief.\n  I greatly admire the many educators who have voluntarily reached deep \ninto their pockets to pay for additional training and course work for \nthemselves, and also to finance additional supplies and materials for \ntheir students. By enacting these modest changes to our Tax Code, we \ncan encourage educators to continue to take the formal course work in \nthe subject matter which they teach and to avail themselves of other \nprofessional development opportunities.\n  The relief that our Tax Code now provides to teachers is simply not \nsufficient. By and large, most teachers do not benefit from the current \nprovisions that allow for limited deductibility of professional \ndevelopment and classroom expenses. Teachers, out of their own \ngenerosity, are reaching deep into their pockets to improve their \nteaching.\n  Now, under the current law, the problem is that teachers do not reach \na sufficient level to be able to deduct the costs of their professional \ndevelopment and classroom supplies. By allowing teachers to take the \nabove-the-line deduction for professional development expenses and a \ncredit for classroom expenses paid out of pocket, our amendment takes a \nfair, progressive approach that will provide a modicum of relief to our \nNation's schoolteachers.\n  I should note that most of our colleagues have already voted for very \nsimilar legislation. Last year, Senator Kyl, Senator Coverdell, and I \noffered a similar amendment to the Affordable Education Act, which was \nadopted unanimously.\n  President Bush has eloquently stated: ``Teachers sometimes lead with \ntheir hearts and pay with their wallets.''\n  Our amendment makes it a priority to reimburse educators for just a \nsmall part of what they invest in the futures of our children.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us in support of this important \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I join my distinguished colleague from Maine in a \nbipartisan effort with Senators Dodd, Mikulski, Harkin, and others. \nThey have joined with us. This is not political. This is an amendment \ndone for persons who teach our children. They simply take dollars out \nof their pocket and expend them for necessities in the classroom. All \nwe are doing--it is not tax relief, a tax break--is returning those \ndollars to their pockets.\n  The education of our children can be no stronger than those to whom \nwe entrust that educational responsibility. Let us recognize them with \nthis very simple yet, I think, straightforward and heartfelt expression \nof the Senate.\n  I thank the managers. I believe they are about to say they are \naccepting the amendment. Could we have a rollcall vote for it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n\n\n                                the eitc\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to engage the chairman of the \nFinance Committee in a colloquy regarding the earned income tax credit \notherwise known as the EITC. I thank the Chairman for including my \nprovisions expanding the EITC in the tax bill. It has come to my \nattention, however, that the EITC has a detrimental impact on the small \nU.S. Territories that are subject to tax laws that automatically mirror \nour Federal tax laws. As a result, these small Territories, like the \nU.S. Virgin Islands, end up absorbing the entire cost of the EITC, \nwhich they can ill afford. The burden of this unfunded Federal mandate \nis exacerbated because these small Territories will also lose needed \nrevenues as a result of the mirror effect of the income tax rate \nreductions mandated by this bill.\n  However, the problem can be mitigated by an agreement between the \nTreasury Department and the interested territorial governments to \npermit these governments to require that employers advance 60 percent \nof EITC payments to employees as currently permitted under Section 3507 \nof the Internal Revenue Code and the allow the employer to deduct these \nadvance payments from FICA taxes the employer currently remits to the \nU.S. Treasury, as permitted by Section 3507, not from withholding taxes \nthe employer remits to the territorial government. The remaining 40 \npercent of the EITC payments would continue to be paid by the \nterritorial governments upon filing of an eligible employee's tax \nreturn. I believe that no substantive amendment to the Internal Revenue \nCode is necessary to allow for such an agreement.\n  I would like the chairman of the Fiance Committee to include report \nlanguage in the final tax conference report that directs the Treasury \nDepartment to enter into such an agreement with any territorial \ngovernment that would like to do so.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I understand the concerns raised by the Senator from \nArkansas and will attempt to address this issue in conference.\n\n\n           taxation of special needs trusts for the disabled\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I had intended to introduce an amendment to \nmodify the taxation of so-called ``special needs trusts'' for disabled \npersons. The problem that cries out for change was first brought to my \nattention by a Tennessee constituent who has been contributing funds \nannually to a special trust for a disabled child. Under current law, \nthe income from such trusts is taxed at very high rates because the tax \nwriters were concerned about possible abusive use of such trusts. After \ndiscussion with the two managers of the bill, I am persuaded that we \ncan work together to craft a better solution to this problem than the \none I was prepared to propose. Therefore, with the understanding that \nwe can work together in coming months to develop a better answer, I \nwill not seek a vote on my amendment at this time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nhis willingness to work with us to craft a solution to a very real \nproblem. He shares with the Ranking Member and I a long history of \nconcern for American taxpayers struggling with the overwhelming expense \nand other demands of severely disabled relatives. As the Senator knows, \nSpecial Needs Trusts, also known as Supplemental Needs Trusts, are a \ncommon estate planning tool for assisting in the planning for the long-\nterm financial needs of the disabled.\n  The Senator and others have helped bring to our attention the fact \nthat these trusts are unduly burdened by the current trust tax \nrequirements of Section 1(e) of the Internal Revenue Code. We recognize \nthat these Special Needs Trusts will receive some relief under the \nRelief Act of 2001, but that more help is necessary. Therefore, I \ncommit myself to the Senator from Tennessee to work with him and others \nto craft a solution to reduce the income tax burden imposed on special \nneeds trusts and, simultaneously, to improve the lot of affected \ndisabled Americans.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I look forward to joining my colleagues \nfrom Tennessee and Iowa in working on this matter. I also hope our \neffort will give us an opportunity to address the problem of structured \nsettlements, which are also funding mechanisms for the disabled. As the \nchairman knows, I have been trying to fix the structured settlement \nproblem for a long time, and I welcome this chance to fix the two \nmatters together.\n\n\n                            high speed rail\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, amendment 676 is essentially the High Speed \nRail Investment Act I introduced with Senator Hutchison earlier this \nyear, that has 57 cosponsors, including the Majority and Minority \nleaders. Indeed, a majority of the Finance Committee supports this \nbill, as well.\n  Both of the leaders have given us their public commitments to move \nthis legislation this year, commitments to finish a job that was \nstarted in the last Congress.\n  As the Administration introduces its proposal for a new energy \npolicy, as we read daily about increasing congestion on our highways \nand at our airports, we simply must make safe, clean, high-speed \npassenger rail a key component of our nation's transportation system.\n  I say that this is essentially the same as the legislation that I \nintroduced with Senator Hutchison and others earlier this year. \nActually, the amendment we are offering today is an improved version, \nthat addresses two key concerns of many of our colleagues.\n  At the insistence of Senator Baucus, and with his cooperation, we \nhave included new language with an unambiguous prohibition on the use \nof the Highway Trust Fund by States in meeting their matching \nrequirements under this legislation. That is something that has always \nbeen important to him, and I am glad to say that we have reached an \nagreement on that issue.\n  Just as important, we have also added new language on the question of \nState and local taxation of the improvements that will come from \nupgrading rail lines around the country to carry high-speed passenger \ntrains. I know that was a concern of Senator Grassley, along with many \nother Senators.\n  As Senator Baucus knows, with this change the bill now has the \nsupport of the National League of Cities, the National Conference of \nState Legislatures, the United States Conference of Mayors, the \nNational Association of Counties, and the Council of State Governments.\n  So, with the help of Senator Baucus, from now forward we have an \nimproved version of the bill. This is the version we hope will move in \nthe Finance Committee soon.\n  While supporters of this legislation are a majority in both the \nFinance Committee and here on the Senate floor, I will respect the \nwishes of Senator Baucus that we not ask for a vote today.\n  I am grateful that he is not only willing to sign on to this \namendment, with the improvements he was seeking, but\n\n[[Page S5501]]\n\nhe is committed to helping us move this legislation through the Finance \nCommittee and on to the floor as soon as we can.\n  This is an important move forward, and an important step toward \nfulfilling the commitments Senate leaders have made to move the High \nSpeed Rail Investment Act this year.\n  I thank Senator Baucus for his help in this matter.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to make a commitment regarding the \nHigh Speed Rail Investment Act.\n  I support passenger rail in the United States and I support Amtrak. \nThe State of Montana relies on Amtrak in the north and hopes to secure \npassenger rail in the south. Last Congress, I worked with Senators \nLautenberg, Moynihan and Roth to protect the Highway Trust Fund from a \nraid by Amtrak. I have been working with Senator Biden this Congress to \nensure a similar protection of the Highway Trust Fund.\n  I am extremely concerned about Amtrak ``Double Dipping,'' by raiding \nthe Highway Trust Fund in addition to selling bonds. I was so concerned \nthat I withdrew my name as a cosponsor of the bill.\n  I am pleased to say that since then, I have worked with Senator Biden \non acceptable language to protect the trust fund. However, this \nlanguage has not been added to the current High Speed Rail Investment \nAct, S. 250. It has been included in an amendment that Senator \nTorricelli filed during the mark-up of this tax package in the Finance \nCommittee and that Senator Biden offered and withdrew today. I can \nsupport the language in this amendment.\n  I know that Senators Torricelli and Biden and others wanted to offer \nthis amendment today. I appreciate that they withdrew this amendment, \nbecause I don't think that this language belongs on this tax bill. I \nfeel very strongly that we need to examine this bill further before we \ninclude it in any package.\n  As ranking Democrat on this Committee, with the changes included in \nthis amendment, it is my intention to go through the official Committee \nprocess of mark-up and hearings, before we let this amendment be voted \non. I would like to hold a hearing within a month after the completion \nof this tax package.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise to bring my colleagues' \nattention to an important issue which affects the men and women who are \ncharged with enforcing our nation's tax laws. While I am withdrawing my \namendment to the tax reconciliation bill which affects Section 1203 of \nthe IRS Restructuring and Reform Act, I hope that bringing this issue \nto the attention of the Senate, will allow us to address this important \nissue at a later time.\n  Section 1203 of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act outlines 10 \ninfractions for which IRS employees must be removed from employment. \nThese areas of misconduct have become known as the ``Ten Deadly Sins''. \nAs of last year, a total of 109 violations of any of the ten \ninfractions outlined in Section 1203 had been substantiated. Of those \n109 infractions, 102 were of Section 1203(b)(8), which subjects \nemployees to mandatory termination for failure to file their federal \ntax return on time.\n  I believe that all IRS employees should be required to file their tax \nreturns on time and abide by the IRS Rules of Conduct. I also strongly \nbelieve that those who do not abide by the Rules of Conduct should be \nheld accountable for their actions. However, it would seem that \nmandatory dismissal, rather than supervisory discretion in applying \npenalties for these infractions, is unduly harsh. This point becomes \nclear when we learn that IRS employees have been and continue to face \nthe loss of their jobs for filing their income tax returns late, even \nwhen they have a tax refund coming to them. There are no other \ntaxpayers who are subject to any penalty for the late filing of a tax \nreturn with a refund due.\n  Close to a thousand charges have been filed against IRS employees \nunder section 1203(b)(6), which subjects employees to mandatory \nterminations for ``harassment of, or retaliations against, a taxpayer. \nThe latest data available shows that of the 830 investigations of these \ncharges completed by the Inspector General for Tax Administration, none \nhave been substantiated. Yet even though it appears that the \noverwhelming majority of these charges filed have been unfounded, the \nemployees themselves must live under the constant fear of losing their \njobs for sometimes more than a year, while the investigation of these \ncharges goes on.\n  It would not be an overstatement to say that Section 1203 is having a \nchilling effect on the ability of employees at the IRS to perform their \njobs. This notion is reflected in the fact that there has been a \nsteadily declining audit-rate of non-compliant taxpayers. Making a \nminor change in the current law, as my amendment does, will do much to \nenable the overwhelming majority of honest, hardworking IRS agents to \nperform their duties in an efficient and professional manner.\n  I believe that my proposal strikes a reasonable balance which will \npermit IRS employees to do their jobs better, but will also maintain \ntermination as a punishment for an employee who willfully harasses a \ntaxpayer. As we continue to debate this reconciliation bill, which will \nmake hundreds of changes to the tax code, I hope that we will make sure \nthat the employees who we entrust to enforce these new laws are given \nthe tools to do what they need to do.\n  While I now withdraw my amendment, I hope that this issue can be \ndiscussed by this chamber in the very near future.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I regret that I opposed a number of \namendments to this legislation that I might otherwise support because \nthey are not adequately offset.\n  The legislation before us already puts us at risk of raiding the \nMedicare and Social Security Trust Funds. We spent much of the past 8 \nyears working to climb out of a deficit ditch, and this bill steers us \nright back toward it.\n  This is not authorizing legislation subject to the further scrutiny \nof an appropriations process. Unlike other measures that come before \nus, this bill and the amendments to it have a direct and immediate \nimpact on our budget.\n  A number of amendments have been offered to this measure that, while \nlaudatory in their goals, further aggravate the fiscal position in \nwhich the underlying bill puts us. Without language offsetting the cost \nof the proposal, the amendments only add to the already fiscally \nirresponsible cost of the bill.\n  For that reason, I have opposed many otherwise worthy amendments.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I was pleased to cosponsor Senator \nSchumer's amendment which was offered last week to help families with \nthe cost of college tuition. Although the amendment did not pass, I \nwanted to state for the record the reasons for my support.\n  The decisions we make today must reflect the enduring values we hold \nas a society. Two of those values are the ideas of opportunity and \nequality for every citizen. In today's complicated society, opportunity \nand equality depend in large part upon the level of a person's \neducation. In other words, the more and the better an education one \ngets, the greater the chances that person will succeed economically. \nThe College Board tells us that ``while the cost of college may be \nimposing to many families, the cost associated with not going to \ncollege is likely to be much greater.'' Indeed, over a lifetime, the \ngap in earning potential between a high school diploma and a college \ndegree exceeds $1 million.\n  In addition, higher education is absolutely central to our ability to \nmaintain our nation's global competitiveness. Highly trained, skilled \nworkers making good wages are the engine that powers our economy, both \nbecause of the work they do and the revenue they generate as buyers and \nsellers of goods and services.\n  Yet, the cost of higher education is an increasing burden for \nAmerican families. Since 1980, tuition at both public and private four-\nyear colleges has increased on average more than 115 percent over \ninflation. A middle-income family spends an average of 17 percent of \nits annual income to send a child to a four-year public college today. \nIf the family sends a child to a private college, the cost increases to \nan average of 44 percent of the family's income.\n  A family's financial status should not be the determining factor in \nwhether a young person joins society\n\n[[Page S5502]]\n\nwith the advantages of higher education or not. Yet, families are \nunderstandably anxious about whether they will be able to provide their \nchildren with that educational advantage. They are similarly anxious \nabout the debt burden their children may have to bear after graduation \nto pay off student loans.\n  America's families need help. This is why I introduced S. 888, the \nCollege Tuition Assistance Act of 2001, which is designed to provide \ntax relief to middle and lower income families who are struggling to \npay these costs, both while a student is in school and after graduation \nwhen student loans come due.\n  Senator Schumer's amendment is an important step toward providing \nfamilies with this type of help compared to what is now in the Finance \nCommittee's bill. It increases the size of the tax deduction families \nmay take to offset the burden of tuition payments. Senator Schumer's \namendment also provides a larger tax credit for graduates paying \ninterest on their student loans. Although the amendment failed, it \nrecognized a critical issue.\n  Educational costs are difficult to bear, even for families who make a \ndecent living. My bill would provide more relief to middle income \nfamilies and would also extend a hand to lower income families, whose \nneeds are far greater than the aid they receive to put their children \nthrough college. My bill also would provide relief sooner. So, I was \npleased to support Senator Schumer's amendment and I intend to continue \nto fight for these provisions which would make a real difference for \nAmerica's families.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we have been down this road \nbefore. As a Congressman in 1981, I supported the Reagan tax cuts that \nwere promoted as a cure-all for the economic ailments of that era. \nInstead, they led to year after year of increasing deficits, exploding \nnational debt, and a series of tax increases enacted to stem the tide \nof red ink.\n  With fiscal discipline and a growing economy, we reversed that tide \njust 3 years ago. Since 1998, we have enjoyed surpluses instead of \ndeficits. And we have been paying down the debt, reducing the massive \ninterest costs that have burdened America's taxpayers.\n  But now the Government is about to dig into our pockets, pull out our \ncredit cards again, and go stumbling down that road toward economic \ncalamity. And--with smoke and mirrors--some are trying to hide the \ncosts we'll incur along the way. By manipulating the starting and \nphase-in dates for the various tax cuts--and setting unlikely \nexpiration dates on some of them--this bill is jury-rigged to fit \nwithin the $1.35 trillion allotted for tax cuts over 11 years in the \nSenate's budget resolution.\n  But, the fact is, it won't fit once we consider other tax breaks \nalready in the pipeline and spending priorities such as defense, \neducation and prescription drug benefits. And this bill does not \nguarantee to pay down the national debt.\n  Every Senator in this Chamber believes we will enact additional tax \nrelief, and provide for our Nation's most pressing needs over the next \ndecade. The additional untold story of this legislation is that--even \nif that were possible--the cost of this tax plan would triple in the \nnext decade. Unless you believe we are simply going to take back the \ntax cuts we are promising today, you are talking about a price tag \nexceeding $4 trillion in the decade from 2012 to 2022--when the baby \nboomers will all be retired.\n  Is that how we are going to provide for prescription drugs under \nMedicare and shore up Social Security? By raiding their trust funds?\n  Is that how we are going to protect our environment, improve our \nNation's schools and strengthen our military? By giving them fewer \nresources, instead of more, in the years to come?\n  And is that how we are going to keep our economy growing and \nprospering? By returning to deficit spending, ever-increasing national \ndebt, and costly interest payments on that debt?\n  That is the road we are headed down. I have been down it before, and \nI'm convinced it's the wrong road. I am choosing instead to take the \nconservative road of fiscal responsibility.\n  I strongly support responsible tax cuts of nearly $1 trillion that \nwould give Americans the relief they deserve. I voted for such cuts as \nsome of us tried to amend both this bill and the earlier budget \nresolution. Specifically, I support tax cuts that meet four criteria--\ntax cuts that (1) do not raid Social Security; (2) do not raid \nMedicare; and (3) provide relief from the marriage tax penalty now, not \nlater; and (4) pay down the national debt.\n  Instead we are left with a tax package that is fiscally \nirresponsible.\n  With all due respect to Senators Grassley and Baucus, we are about to \nvote on a tax bill that largely promises future relief based on future \nsurpluses that may not materialize. It poses a serious threat to our \neconomy because it will use up what surplus there is so we cannot pay \ndown the national debt. And it seriously threatens our Medicare and \nSocial Security trust funds--not only in 2012 but beginning next year.\n  I promised the people of Florida I would do everything in my power to \nenact a substantial tax cut, which is balanced, in order to protect \nthose trust funds and to continue paying down the national debt. I \npromised I would fight for a prescription drug benefit, and that I \nwould work for better schools, a clean environment and a strong \ndefense. I intend to keep those promises, and I must vote against this \nbill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the tax \nbill currently being debated on the floor today. Everybody agrees that \nwe need tax relief. But we must do it in a way that is affordable, \nresponsible, and ensures that we are on sound fiscal footing. \nUnfortunately, the Republican tax cut does none of these things. I will \nvote against this tax cut for three reasons: It is irresponsible, \npremature, and it does not meet the compelling needs of our Nation.\n  The Republican tax cut is irresponsible because it mortgages our \nfuture for lavish tax cuts. It is premature, there is no way to \nguarantee that the Republican tax cut will be here today and that the \nAmerican people can count on it tomorrow.\n  Unfortunately, the size of this tax cut will put an extra strain on \nthis country's cashflow just when we will need it the most, when baby \nboomers will retire.\n  Finally, this tax bill makes it impossible to meet the compelling \nneeds of our Nation. It does not have an economic stimulus in 2001; the \nsize of the tax cut will make it difficult to make balloon payments \ncoming due on Social Security and Medicare; and it will be extremely \nunlikely that the money will be there to create a meaningful and \nreliable Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  I support the Democratic alternative because it ensures that we are \nmeeting the day to day needs of our constituents and the long range \nneeds of our country. What does the democratic alternative provide? \nFirst, Democrats want to put $300 in your checkbook right away, today, \nthis year. Or $600 per family. This would provide an immediate economic \nstimulus and help all Americans who are struggling to pay for \nskyrocketing gasoline and energy prices.\n  Democrats would also provide tax cuts for all income taxpayers by \nreducing the 15 percent tax bracket to 10 percent on the first $6,000 \nincome. Additionally, we include significant marriage penalty and \nestate tax relief, we raise IRA and 401(k) contribution limits, double \nthe child tax credit, make college tuition tax deductible and provide \nresources to schools and communities modernize and build new \nfacilities. I am also pleased that our bill includes an extension of \nthe adoption tax credit and makes permanent the Research and \nDevelopment tax credit. The democratic plan is balanced, fiscally \nprudent, and leaves resources so we can continue to pay down our debt, \nand make the balloon payments coming due on Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican tax plan papers over the fiscal \nrealities of our country. We need to get back to basics, to save lives, \nsave communities, and save America. What do I mean by this? Well, while \nwe are in the midst of debating bloated tax cuts, we have Marines who \nare on food stamps. I don't see how we can meet our national security \ncommitment, do a $1.35 trillion tax cut, and have Marines on food \nstamps.\n\n[[Page S5503]]\n\nThe Marines say ``semper fi,'' ``always faithful.'' They are faithful \nto the United States and we have to be always faithful to the Marine \nCorps and to the military. That's why we must ensure that we have the \nresources to invest in core infrastructure programs, like the military, \nthat will pay dividends in the future.\n  Democrats want to put money in people's pocketbooks, but we want to \ndo it is a way that it is here today and in people's checkbooks \ntomorrow. We believe we're on the side of people who are middle class \nand those who are working their heart out to be able to get there.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in opposing the Republican tax \ncut. We should do what's responsible, honest, and allows us to meet the \ncompelling human need in our nation today. The democratic alternative \nwill put us on the right track to doing just that.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I had intended to offer an amendment to \nH.R. 1836, the Reconciliation Tax Act, that would have called for a \n$1.7 billion increase in veterans health care funding. Senators \nBingaman, Wellstone, Durbin, and Dorgan supported my amendment. While I \nwill refrain from offering my amendment today, I will nonetheless \ncontinue to fight for improved health care for our Nation's heroes.\n  In a few short days, Members of Congress will return home to \nparticipate in Memorial Day services around the country. There is no \nshortage of rhetoric to go around Congress in support of veterans \nbenefits and veterans health care.\n  However, when the time comes for real decisions to be made on the \nprioritization of veterans issues in the budget, too many Members of \nthis body are missing in action. A case in point occurred during debate \nof the budget resolution. Despite bipartisan support for increased \nfunding for veterans health care in both the House and the Senate, the \nbudget conference report include funding levels below that proposed by \nthe administration.\n  Last week, I spoke with veterans from South Dakota who expressed \ntheir concern that the current level of funding in the budget \nconference report could mean long waits for appointments and reductions \nor cuts in vital services. These situations are not unique to my State \nand affect every VA hospital and clinic in the country.\n  When the current level of funding in the budget conference, the VA \ncould be forced to delay and even deny needed care and slash vital \nprograms. Long term care and other provisions authorized under the \nMillennium Health Care Act must be fully funded in order to be carried \nout. The VA is faced with salary increases and inflation which alone \nconsume over $1 billion of health care dollars.\n  The Paralyzed Veterans of America, PVA, noted that the budget \nconference report ``pays a grave disservice to the sacrifice of the men \nand women who have served this Nation. By providing fewer resources \nthan was provided in the House-passed version, or the Senate-passed \nversion, the conference report breaks faith with veterans. By providing \nfewer dollars than even the Administration's inadequate request for \nhealth care and benefits delivery programs, the conference report calls \ninto question the commitment of this Congress to sick and disabled \nveterans.''\n  The Veterans of Foreign Wars, VFW, described the budget conference \nreport as ``sadly inadequate'' and unable to cover ``uncontrollable \nexpenses such as health-care cost inflation, implementation of the \ncongressionally mandated Millennium Health Care Act and other pressing \ninitiatives.'' The Disabled American Veterans, DAV, and AMVETS noted \nthat an additional $1.7 billion would provide necessary resources to \nmeet the needs of the men and women who have served our nation and rely \nupon the VA for the health care they need.\n  With an additional $1.7 billion, we will have the resources for a VA \nveterans health care budget that can adequately offset years of \nunderfunding, the higher costs of medical care caused by consumer \ninflation, medical care inflation, wage increases, and legislation \npassed by Congress. Only with this additional funding will the VA be \nunable to address the treatment of Hepatitis C, emergency medical \nservices, increased cost due to medical inflation, and long-term care \ninitiatives.\n  The Independent Budget, coauthored by AMVETS, the DAV, PVA, and the \nVFW, highlights the need to increase funding in a number of important \nhealth care initiatives including: an additional $523 million needed \nfor mental health care; and additional $848 million necessary for long-\nterm care; and additional $25 million needed to restore the Spinal Cord \nInjury program; and an additional $75 million to help homeless \nveterans.\n  The budget conference report is clearly inadequate to meet the needs \nof sick and disabled veterans. It is unacceptable that while the House \nprovided an increase, and the Senate truly met the needs of the VA, we \nare left with a figure that is below the amount found in either \nresolution, below the amount recommended by the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, below the amount initially requested by VA Secretary \nPrincipi, and far below the amount recommended by the Independent \nBudget.\n  The amount in the conference report fails to meet mandatory salary \nincreases due to inflation, fails to meet medical care inflation, and \nreturns us to the days of inadequate budgets to meet the needs of \nveterans. Our country's heroes deserve better, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to honor their service by supporting increased funding for \nveterans health care.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support for increased \nveterans health care be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Veterans of Foreign Wars\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 2001.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: It is my understanding that you will \n     be offering an amendment to secure an additional $1.7 billion \n     in funding for Department of Veterans Affairs' Medical \n     Programs. On behalf of the 2.7 million members of the \n     Veterans of Foreign Wars and our Ladies Auxiliary, I would \n     like to take this opportunity to express our support for your \n     amendment.\n       In partnership with other major Veterans Service \n     Organizations, we produced the annual Independent Budget for \n     VA where have identified the need for a minimum increase of \n     $2.6 billion in VA's medical care account over FY 2001. The \n     budget resolution for FY 2002 adopted by Congress has seen \n     fit to prescribe a sadly inadequate $1 billion increase. If \n     allowed to stand the VA medical care account would not even \n     be able to cover uncontrollable expenses such as health-care \n     cost inflation, implementation of the congressionally \n     mandated Millennium Health Care Act and other pressing \n     initiatives.\n       Your amendment would allow the VA to carry out its mission \n     of providing timely access to quality healthy care for \n     America's sick and disabled veterans.\n       We of the VFW, thank you for efforts on behalf of our \n     nation's veterans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert E.

Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: On behalf of the more than one \n     million members of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), I am \n     writing to you to express our support for your amendment that \n     would increase Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health \n     care funding to the level recommended by the Independent \n     Budget (IB) for fiscal year (FY) 2002.\n       The Congressional Budget Resolution, H. Con. Res. 83, \n     provides a discretionary spending increase of $1 billion. \n     This recommended amount would not even cover the costs of \n     mandated salary increases and the effects of inflation. The \n     IB has identified an increase for VA health care of $2.6 \n     billion over the amount provided in FY 2001. This recommended \n     increase would provide the resources necessary for the VA to \n     meet the needs of the men and women who have served our \n     nation, and rely upon the VA for the health care they need.\n       Thank you for your efforts on behalf of our nation's sick \n     and disabled veterans. Again, we strongly support your \n     amendment to increase the amount available for VA health care \n     up to the level recommended in the IB.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Armando C. Albarran,\n                                               National Commander.\n\n[[Page S5504]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                            American Veterans,\n\n                                         Lanham, MD, May 18, 2001.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: AMVETS fully supports your proposed \n     amendment to increase funding for veterans hospital care and \n     medical services.\n       Your proposed amendment would increase the budget for \n     veterans health care by $1.7 billion above the Fiscal Year \n     2002 Budget proposed by the administration. It meets the \n     level of funding suggested by The Independent Budget as \n     necessary for the VA to live up to our country's commitment \n     to veterans and their families.\n       Without an increase in VA health care, resources will be \n     insufficient to meet the needs of the men and women who have \n     served our Nation, and reply upon the VA for the health care \n     they need.\n       Thank you for your continuing efforts to support our \n     nation's veterans. We believe the price is not too great for \n     the value received.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                David E.

Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: On behalf of the Paralyzed Veterans \n     of America (PVA) I am writing to offer our support of your \n     amendment to H.R. 1836 that would add $1.7 billion for \n     veterans' health care. This amount, when added to the $1 \n     billion provided in discretionary funding in the recently \n     passed budget resolution, would bring veterans' funding close \n     to the $2.7 billion recommended by the Independent Budget, \n     which is co-authored by PVA.\n       The health care requirements of veterans were not met in \n     the budget resolution. After realizing increases above the \n     Administration's request in the House of Representatives, and \n     achieving increases in the Senate that would have matched the \n     Independent Budget's request, veterans' funding was cut back \n     down to the level advocated by the Administration. This \n     amount is simply not enough to meet the health care needs of \n     sick and disabled veterans.\n       That is why your amendment is so essential--it would begin \n     the process of meeting the true needs of the health care \n     system dedicated to veterans. Again, PVA thanks you for \n     offering this important amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Joseph L. Fox, Sr.,\n                                               National President.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am in strong opposition to the tax cut \nbill that the Senate has been considering over the past few days. I am \nsorry to say that this legislation fails the basic tests of responsible \ngovernment. It is fiscally irresponsible to use $1.35 trillion of the \nsurpluses projected over the next 10 years to pay for a tax cut, since \nthese estimated surpluses may never materialize. Even the Congressional \nBudget Office, CBO, acknowledges that there is considerable uncertainty \nin their forecasts. In fact, within the CBO's estimates, they suggest \nthat even a 1 percent per year slower growth in GDP would reduce the \n10-year surplus by $2.4 trillion. With that much uncertainty, this tax \ncut is too large and risks squandering the fiscal discipline that has \nbeen so hard fought and earned over the past several years. With these \nexcessive revenue losses, we will certainly sacrifice our ability to \nadequately provide for critical programs in the areas of health care, \neducation, the environment, transportation infrastructure, defense and \nfurther paying down of the national debt. Now, many of the supporters \nof this legislation also tout the theory that government should be run \nlike a business. However, no chief executive of a corporation would \nallow dividends to be locked in for 10 years, when earnings forecasts \nare so unclear. In addition, no corporation would ever submit a budget \nthat would have critical elements missing, such as is the case with \ndefense spending in this budget.\n  The tax cut also fails the test of responsible budgeting. The bill \nbefore the Senate is so backloaded that the full costs don't appear in \nthe 10-year estimates provided by the Senate Finance Committee. \nAnalysis by the CBO and the General Accounting Office, GAO, shows that \nthe retirement of the baby boom generation will put enormous pressure \non the budget starting a little over a decade from now. This is at the \nexact time when the full cost of the tax cut will be felt and will \nalmost surely aggravate the deficits that many analysts expect to \nemerge at that point. Simply put, this bill is far more expensive than \nit appears. For example, 60 percent of the costs in the legislation \ndon't occur until the second half of this decade. Some of the most \nexpensive provisions, such as the full repeal of the estate tax, don't \nappear until the last year, so their real costs are truly masked. Other \nprovisions expire in 5 years, such as Alternative Minimum Tax relief \nand tuition tax deduction, so their full cost is hidden. The effect of \nthese sunset provisions also ensure that these issues will have to be \nconsidered again by a future Congress. Some analysts have also \nsuggested that if all of the provisions in the bill were effective \nimmediately, the full cost over ten years would likely be over $2 \ntrillion, while the costs in the next ten years could exceed $4 \ntrillion. Lastly, this legislation is a sham as it purports to include \na complete tax package for the next decade, when realistically, many \nmore tax items that are expiring shortly, otherwise known as \n``extenders,'' will have to be added down the road. Again, far too much \nmoney is in play here while budgetary gimmicks and tricks are dictating \nthe process.\n  This tax cut is also markedly unfair. Cuts in marginal tax rates \nabove the 15 percent bracket and repeal of the estate tax benefit a \nsmall group of taxpayers who have experienced remarkable growth in \nincome and wealth over the past five years. However, the legislation \nappears to neglect one important group of people: those taxpayers in \nthe 15 percent bracket. Although the proponents of this bill would \nsuggest that most taxpayers are in the 28 percent bracket or higher, \nthe facts are otherwise. Research by the Democratic staff of the Joint \nEconomic Committee and the Budget Committee point out that an \noverwhelming majority of those who pay income tax are in the 15 percent \nbracket, close to 75 percent, and would get no benefit from the upper \nbracket rate cuts in this bill. Now, the bill does provide a tax cut \nfor everyone who pays income tax by creating a new 10 percent tax \nbracket immediately, albeit a minuscule one for those in the lowest \nbracket. In addition, the bill makes the child credit refundable, and \nin a manner that reduces marginal tax rates for many working families \nwith children. Both of those provisions are worthwhile and should in \nfact be expanded. Nonetheless, Citizens for Tax Justice, CTJ, has \nprovided an analysis of the legislation's rate cuts, and many of its \nfindings are disturbing, to say the least. Some of these include: the \ntop one percent of all taxpayers, with income of $373,000 or more, \nwould receive one-third of the entire tax cut; the top one percent \nwould receive an average yearly tax cut of over $20,000, while the \nbottom 20 percent would receive an average yearly cut of $64; and the \nmiddle 20 percent of taxpayers, incomes ranging from $27,000 to \n$44,000, would receive 9 percent of the tax cut, an average of about \n$600 per year.\n  One prominent example of the unfairness in this tax bill is the \nrepeal of the estate tax. Supporters of this legislation perpetuate the \nmyth that the estate tax is a ``death tax.'' The truth is that 98 \npercent of Americans face no tax liability under the estate tax when \nthey die. In fact, the repeal of the estate tax takes away budget \nresources that could be used to pay down the debt and increase national \nsaving, and it uses those resources to benefit a tiny group of very \nwealthy taxpayers. The effect on the Treasury will be astounding: \nalthough the Finance Committee estimates the estate tax portion of the \nbill to cost $146 billion over 10 years, because this provision is \nbackloaded, the real costs will come after full repeal in 2011, costing \nalmost $1 trillion over the next ten years. The impact on states will \nalso be overwhelming. A majority of the states use a ``pickup'' system \nfor their estate tax, whereby they essentially receive a portion of the \nFederal estate tax receipts. I know that in my State of Rhode Island, \nthe estate tax accounted for $34.2 million in state revenue for fiscal \nyear 2000. What can $34.2 million pay for? In fact, it can pay for 681 \nmore police officers, or 729 more firefighters, or 575 more elementary \nschool teachers. If the estate tax is repealed, States like Rhode \nIsland will no doubt have to make up the shortfall in revenue by \nraising State taxes or cutting their budgets. Total State revenue loss \nwhen the estate tax is fully repealed could exceed $9 billion. Toward \nwhat end is this repeal aimed? In 1999, Rhode Island had 134 estates \nthat were subject to the estate tax, 15 of which were estates of $5 \nmillion or\n\n[[Page S5505]]\n\nmore. That is out of a total of about 486,000 taxpayers. Although the \nnumbers for other States will fluctuate based on their size, we are \nagain talking about a very small proportion of our whole population. \nThat is why I have supported an alternative that would reform, rather \nthan repeal the estate tax system. By raising the tax exemption levels \nto $4 million for individuals and $8 million for couples, almost all \nfamily-owned farms and businesses will be erased from the estate tax \nrolls. However, the tax would remain on the largest estates that have \nthe ability, and the responsibility, to pay for the enormous wealth \nthey have been fortunate enough to acquire.\n  To put things into perspective, the supporters of this bill and the \nBush administration are hoping to pass a huge tax cut and increase \nmilitary spending, while relying on rosy estimates of our economy 10 \nyears down the line. Much of this debate recalls an earlier era during \nwhich Congress and the Reagan Administration attempted to do the same \nthing. Why are we rushing to pass a tax cut that is even more \nirresponsibly constructed than the 1981 tax cut; a tax cut which caused \nspiraling deficits and mounting debt in the 1980s and early 1990s? This \nbill takes the wrong approach and it is irresponsible. There is an \napproach we can take to provide meaningful and targeted tax relief to \nhard working American families, while ensuring that we have the \nresources to pay down the debt and invest more fully in our nation's \nenvironment, health care, education and other critical priorities. \nSadly, the legislation before us rejects that balanced approach and \nembraces a policy which will threaten our prosperity and undermine our \nability to respond to the needs of working American families.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to support this tax cut bill, though \nnot with great enthusiasm and not without great trepidation. It is \nclear that a balanced tax cut is justified given the massive budget \nsurplus we are experiencing. Whether this is that tax cut is a \ndifferent question.\n  We have heard much this week about not letting the perfect be the \nenemy of the good. We have gone beyond that point with this bill. The \ndebate now is whether we will let the good be the enemy of the \nacceptable.\n  The booming economy of the last few years has resulted in exploding \ntax revenues and growing budget surpluses. These surpluses present \ngreat opportunity and great risk. There is the opportunity to invest in \nunmet national needs; education, health care, retirement security, \nagriculture, child care. And there is opportunity to return some tax \ndollars to the hard working families whose productivity has driven our \nsolid economic performance. As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \nhas stated, a tax cut gets resources to those who know best how to take \ncare of their families, the taxpayers themselves.\n  But with these opportunities come great risks. We are at risk of \nputting too much faith in multi-year projections of ever-growing \nsurpluses. We are at risk of locking in revenue losses and deficits \nwith which future Congresses and generations will have to grapple. The \n$1.35 trillion tax cut comes dangerously close to threatening the trust \nfund surpluses that protect Social Security and Medicare. That is why I \ncosponsored an amendment to put in place a ``trigger'' that would delay \nscheduled tax cuts if the trust fund surpluses were violated. That is \nalso why I supported several attempt to bring the total tax cut number \ndown and reserve some of those funds for spending priorities or debt \nreduction. Unfortunately, none of these amendments was accepted.\n  What was accepted, at the insistence of a groups of Democratic and \nRepublican moderate Senators, was a sunset that ends all the tax cuts \ninstituted in this bill after 10 years. At minimum, that will force \nCongress to reexamine the wisdom of the policies we put in place today \nand adjust them to fit with the economic and budget circumstances of \ntomorrow.\n  The other risk we face is passing a tax bill that tilts too much \ntoward those who already have so much. I would have preferred a bill \nthat included more relief for middle and lower income tax payers, and I \nsupported numerous amendments to expand the tax benefits for these \nworking families. None of those amendments passed.\n  That is not to say that this bill does not contain significant tax \nrelief for these families. The provisions that expand and make \nrefundable the child tax credit will make a real difference in the \nlives of millions of children struggling now in families living at or \nnear the poverty line. These are gains that were not included in the \nHouse passed bill and that must be retained in the Conference Report to \nmake the final bill acceptable. In addition, the Senate bill includes \nsignificant tax incentives for those who send their children to college \nand those trying to save for retirement. These too must be retained.\n  And finally, the bill contains a small provision on which I have \nworked for several years, the Child Care Infrastructure Tax Credit. \nThis gives a modest tax incentive to employers who choose to invest in \nchild care for their employees. This Nation clearly faces a crisis \nlevel shortage in quality child care--and quality child care is often \nthe difference between work and welfare, between healthy children and \nstruggling families. We win as a Nation and as an economy when we get \nemployers involved in creating and supporting early childhood teachers \nand facilities.\n  These are all good reasons to vote for this bill. But there is \nanother reason that overwhelms these all.\n  I am a Democrat who supports tax cuts. I am a moderate at a time when \npolitical power is wobbling from right to left. It is a certainty that \na tax bill will be signed into law this year. If those like myself say \n``no'' now, and push away from the table, we may be able to make some \nlofty political statements in time for the six o'clock news. But we \ntake Democratic principles and the interests of working families with \nus. And I am not ready to do that.\n  So I vote in favor of this bill today with the hope and expectation \nthat it remains a bill that benefits working families, students, \nretirees, and children tomorrow. And I commend Chairman Grassley and \nthe ranking member, Senator Baucus, for the clear effort and good faith \nwith which they put together this bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I support a meaningful tax cut that \nprovides all Americans with financial relief as quickly as possible, \nbut I can not in good conscience support the bill before us today. The \ndecision the Senate is faced with is not whether we should have a tax \ncut--no one can doubt that Democrats and Republicans alike want a tax \ncut. Rather, the question is how can we create a tax cut that is fair \nto the majority of working people and still have enough resources for \nother critical national priorities?\n  During the Senate's consideration of this bill, I supported a $900 \nmillion tax package that provides broad relief to all Americans--across \nthe income spectrum--while ensuring sufficient funds for continued debt \nreduction and important programs like a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. Unfortunately, the tax bill that we are on the brink of \npassing here today is significantly too large and is heavily skewed \ntoward the most wealthy. If budget surpluses fail to materialize as \nprojected, this bill will threaten our ability to fund urgent national \npriorities such as education and road construction, and could force us \nto dip into the Medicare and Social Security Trust Funds in the coming \nyear just as the Baby Boomers begin to retire.\n  Mr. President, this bill is simply too large, given the enormous \nuncertainty of long-term budget projections. I believe that both \nPresident Bush's $1.6 trillion plan and this $1.35 trillion plan \njeopardize our economic future and the long-term solvency of the \nMedicare and Social Security Trust Funds.\n  The facts are stark: Social Security payments will exceed income in \n2015, and Medicare payments exceed income in 2010. We will be forced to \ntap into the Social Security Trust Fund principal in 2025 and the \nMedicare Trust Fund principal in 2017. In 2037, the Social Security \nTrust Fund will be exhausted, and the Medicare Trust fund will be \nexhausted even earlier, in 2025. I believe this tax bill jeopardizes \nthe long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare. These programs \nare fundamental for our seniors, and we have an obligation to ensure \nthat both the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds are protected \nbefore enacting massive tax cuts.\n\n[[Page S5506]]\n\n  This tax bill is even larger than it appears, because it is \nbackloaded in order to keep the real cost of the overall package \nhidden. Estate tax repeal does not occur until 2011, so its full cost \nis not included in the Budget Resolution numbers. Marriage penalty \nrelief--which to me should be a higher priority than estate tax repeal \nbecause it helps all married taxpayers across-the-board--does not begin \nto phase in until 2006. Because of these late phase-ins, the true cost \nof this tax plan will not be apparent until the second 10 years. While \nthe cost of the tax plan in the first 10 years is an estimated $1.35 \ntrillion, the cost explodes in the second 10 years to $4 trillion.\n  The simple question we must ask is this: If we cannot afford these \ntax cuts now, then how will we afford them in the following decade, \njust as the Baby Boomers enter their retirement years?\n  There are other gimmicks in the tax bill designed to make the tax \ncut's impact look smaller than it actually is. For example, the tuition \ndeduction sunsets in 2005, in order to keep the cost of the overall \nbill within the $1.35 trillion limit. But we all know from experience \nthat the Congress will certainly renew this popular deduction in 2005 \nwhen it expires, so the relatively limited price tag for this provision \nis intentionally misleading.\n\n  This bill also fails to address the need to reform the alternative \nminimum tax (AMT). AMT was designed to make sure the very richest \npeople paid their fair share of taxes, but as a result of this bill, \nalmost 40 million mostly middle income taxpayers will actually pay \nsubstantially more in AMT by the end of the decade. This is a problem \nthat will have to be dealt with in the next few years, or much of the \ntax relief in this bill will be nullified. Real AMT reform will cost \nseveral hundred billion dollars--an expense which is not accounted for \nin this tax bill.\n  Further, the majority has already asserted that it intends to pass \nadditional corporate tax cuts this session. As large as this tax \npackage is, the final figure will surely grow.\n  Another fundamental problem with this bill is that the lion's share \nof the tax relief it contains goes to the wealthiest Americans. Estate \ntax repeal was included in the bill, despite the fact that 98 percent \nof Americans who die are not subject to the estate tax and pass their \nestate on to their heirs tax free. Indeed, only 47,000 taxpayers in the \nentire country even pay the estate tax each year, and half of all \nestate taxes are paid by the wealthiest 0.1 percent of Americans. \nAccording to Responsible Wealth, the estate tax is repealed under this \nbill in 2011 at a cost of $60 billion--which effectively means we will \nneed to tap into the Medicare Trust Fund in order to meet our \nobligations.\n  State and local taxes may need to be raised to make up for the loss \nof state estate tax revenues, which are also eliminated by this tax \nbill. Under the federal estate tax, taxpayers are allowed a credit up \nto a certain amount for payment of estate taxes, and many states, like \nWest Virginia, tax up to the amount of the credit. If the estate tax is \nrepealed, the credit will be eliminated as well, and West Virginia \nwould lost over $20 million in revenue a year that is being used to \nfund critical state programs.\n  Another way this tax bill benefits the very wealthy is the cut in the \ntop rate from 39.6 percent to 36 percent. The Joint Committee on \nTaxation estimates that the cost of this cut will be $114 billion. This \nis one of the more expensive provisions in the bill--but the top rate \nonly takes effect at $297,000. So very few taxpayers, including only \n0.3 percent of West Virginians, actually receive any benefit from it.\n  The Senate version of the tax plan does make some improvements in \nterms of fairness of the distribution of tax cuts. I strongly supported \na provision to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit, so that families \nearning between $13,000-$16,000 a year will get the full EITC \nassistance. I also cosponsored Senator Snowe's amendment to give \npartial refundability of the enhanced child credit so that families \nwith children can benefit from this tax cut. The bill gives families \nearning over $10,000 a 15 percent child credit, making the child credit \npartially refundable.\n  Both of these provisions are improvements, but they do not make up \nfor a tax package that is otherwise unfair to our state, and an \nunnecessary bonanza for only the wealthiest. The provisions for low-\nincome families and children account for just 5 percent of the $1.35 \ntrillion package.\n  In addition, the low income improvements of this bill don't even \nbenefit all families with children. Nearly 68,000 children in West \nVirginia won't be helped by the partial refundability provision because \nwith incomes of less than $10,000 their families still do not ``earn \nenough.''\n  West Virginia taxpayers without children would receive little tax \nrelief under the tax bill, according to Citizens for Tax Justice. The \nbill does nothing to relieve the real federal tax burdens faced by \naverage West Virginians, who pay not only income taxes, but high \npayroll taxes and federal excise taxes.\n  During the Senate consideration of this bill, I offered an amendment \nto put a Medicare prescription drug benefit on equal footing with the \ntax cut for the wealthiest Americans--those in the uppermost income \nbracket. My amendment required that we enact a universal and affordable \nMedicare outpatient prescription drug benefit before the income tax \ncuts for the very wealthiest go into effect. The amendment was defeated \n48-51, on a mostly party-line vote.\n  I sincerely believe my amendment would have put positive pressure on \nCongress to enact the Medicare prescription drug benefit we all \npromised our constituents. The vote tells me that many Members \nunderstand very well that the size of this tax cut threatens our \nability to pass a Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  In sum, the overall size of this tax package jeopardizes our economic \nfuture and the future solvency of Society Security and Medicare for \ntoday's workers and for our children. While the Senate version of the \ntax bill is an improvement over the House and Bush plan, too much of \nthe tax cut still goes to the wealthiest, while hardworking West \nVirginia taxpayers--seniors, families with children, married couples, \nand singles--receive little or virtually no benefit. For these reasons, \nI cannot support this legislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote against this tax bill \nbecause it is not fiscally responsible. This enormous tax cut may end \nup raiding the Medicare and Social Security Trust Fund balances. It \nrisks a return to the annual budget deficits Congress worked so hard to \neliminate. It will cause our Nation to miss what may be a once-in-a-\nlifetime opportunity to put our fiscal house in order by paying down \ndebt, strengthening Social Security, and modernizing Medicare. And it \ndoes not fairly distribute its benefits. For these reasons, I must \noppose it.\n  This is the most momentous budgetary vote in two decades. For with \nthis vote, Congress appears poised to turn its back on 8 years of \nfiscal responsibility. With this vote, Congress appears willing to \nreturn to the deficit spending days of the 1980s.\n  I do believe that taxpayers deserve tax relief. With the favorable \nsurpluses before us, we should cut taxes. I supported Senator Conrad's \nproposal to cut taxes by $745 billion over the next 10 years. With its \nassociated interest costs, that package would have devoted roughly $900 \nbillion to tax relief.\n  But the tax cut in this conference report is too large relative to \nthe surpluses that economists have projected. It seeks to devote $1.35 \ntrillion to this one purpose. Interest costs could add another $400 \nbillion to the cost.\n  We should not commit to tax cuts of this size before the projections \nof future surplus dollars have proved real, before we have ensured the \nlong-term solvency of the vital Medicare system, before we have brought \nthat program up-to-date with needed prescription drug and long-term-\ncare benefits, and before we have done one single thing to prepare the \nvital Social Security safety net for the impending retirement of the \nbaby boom generation.\n  With this bill, the Congress appears headed toward repeating the \nfiscal mistake it committed in 1981. Recall that back in 1981, they had \nsurplus projections, too. In President Reagan's first budget, \nincorporating his major tax cut, the administration projected a $28 \nbillion surplus in the fifth year, 1986. In the actual event, the \nFederal Government ran up a $221 billion deficit in 1986.\n\n[[Page S5507]]\n\n  The 1980s saw the accumulation of more than $1.5 trillion in deficits \nand the tripling of the Federal debt held by the public. The Congress's \ndecision to cut taxes too deeply in 1981 thus robbed the Nation of \nfiscal policy tools, and unduly constrained the Federal Reserve Bank in \nits monetary policy.\n  We risk committing that same error again today. As I have noted, the \nbill before us will cost at least $1.35 trillion in its first 10 years. \nAnd during this bill's second 10 years, the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities estimates that it will cost more than $4 trillion.\n  And those costs will come just as the Nation faces growing costs for \nMedicare and Social Security with the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration. In their 2001 annual report, concluded under the Bush \nadministration, the Trustees of the Medicare Hospital Insurance trust \nfund project that its costs will likely exceed projected revenues \nbeginning in the year 2016. The Trustees say: ``Over the long range, \nthe HI Trust Fund fails by a wide margin to meet our test of financial \nbalance. The sooner reforms are made the smaller and less abrupt they \nwill have to be in order to achieve solvency through 2075.''\n  Similarly, Social Security's Trustees remind us again this year that \nwhen the baby-boom generation begins to retire around 2010, ``financial \npressure on the Social Security trust funds will rise rapidly.'' The \nTrustees project that, as with Medicare, Social Security revenues will \nfall short of outlays beginning in 2016. The Trustees conclude: ``We \nshould be prepared to take action to address the OASDI financial \nshortfall in a timely way because, as with Medicare, the sooner \nadjustments are made the smaller and less abrupt they will have to \nbe.''\n  This bill robs the nation of resources to deal with these important \nchallenges.\n  As well, the bill before us is tilted heavily toward high-income \ntaxpayers. According to Citizens for Tax Justice, when this bill's tax \ncuts are fully phased in, the highest-income one percent of taxpayers \nwould receive 35 percent of the benefits of the bill. The majority of \ntaxpayers in the bottom three-fifths of the population would get only a \nlittle more than 15 percent of the bill's benefits.\n  When this bill's tax cuts are fully phased in, the one percent of \ntaxpayers with the highest incomes would receive an average tax cut of \nmore than $44,000, while taxpayers in the middle fifth of the \npopulation would receive an average tax cut of less than $600.\n  This is not a balanced bill. It is not balanced fiscally. And it is \nnot fairly balanced in its benefits. I will therefore vote against it, \nand I urge my colleagues to vote against it as well.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as we near completion of debate over this \ntax bill, I want to commend the Chairman of Finance Committee, Senator \nGrassley, and the Ranking Democrat, Senator Baucus, for their good \nfaith efforts to craft a tax bill and move it through the Finance \nCommittee, that is no easy task, and I have enormous respect for their \nhard work and the extent to which they each listened to members from \nboth sides of the aisle. I am particularly grateful to see that the \nFinance Committee included a proposal advocated by myself, Senator \nSnowe, and Senator Lincoln which would extend the child tax credit to \nperhaps as many as an additional 16 million children. The legislation's \nnew child credit refundability provision amounts to nearly $70 billion \nin expanded relief for working families with children. That is truly an \naccomplishment.\n  Nevertheless, today we are considering more than a tax bill--and much \nmore than a number of individual tax pieces. What we do here has \nconsequence. Nothing happens in a policy vacuum, nothing happens that \ndoesn't affect everything else we do for this economy, the choices we \ncan and can not make for this country. This is more than just a tax \nbill. It is a blueprint for the next several years, and, as such, I am \nsorry to say it is a blueprint that jeopardizes the fiscal discipline \nthat has been the foundation of the long-term economic growth our \ncountry has enjoyed in recent years.\n  This tax cut is one of the great lost opportunities of the last \ntwenty years in American politics. I want a broad-based tax cut that \nreaches every American and I want it done in a way that's fiscally \nresponsible. I'm not alone. We could have had that, instead, we have a \ntax cut that's based on projections that won't hold up and which I fear \nwill, as a consequence, bring us back to deficit economics again in \nthis country. It didn't have to be this way. No business in America \npays out dividends to shareholders based on ten year profit \nprojections--neither should the government.\n  As someone who worked hard to put the budget in the black, from \nGramm-Rudman Hollings deficit reduction in 1986 when ``balanced \nbudget'' was a dirty word for Democrats, to the tough vote in 1993, to \nthe balanced budget in 1997, I can't stress enough how this vote takes \nthe country in the wrong direction on the question of fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  President Bush has said over and over, it's your money, not the \ngovernment's money. It's also your debt. Under the tax cut that's about \nto be sent to the floor all it takes is one dip in the economy, one \nblip in surplus projections, and we've returned to the days of deficit \neconomics, and that means higher interest rates on student loans, on \ncar loans, and on mortgages. It means we slow the economy. That's not \nfiscally responsible policy-making, and it's a departure from the \ncourse of fiscal conservatism that brought us the growth and prosperity \nof the last eight years.\n  We could have made a different choice. We could have had a one, a \ntwo, or a three year tax cut. We could have stimulated growth. If \nsurpluses were here after that, we could have cut taxes again, and I've \nnever seen a Congress that didn't like to cut taxes. But that's not \nwhat's happening here. Tax politics is trumping fiscal discipline and \nhonest economic policy.\n  We know the history here, and we know what a departure this \nrepresents. In 1993, the Senate cast a difficult vote to commit the \nCongress and the country to getting the deficit under control. This tax \nbill, if passed, could well be the vote that casts away that fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  Last week, we voted on a budget resolution. That budget resolution is \nnonbinding. But it gives us a framework for understanding how all the \ndifferent pieces--the tax bill, discretionary spending, Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and debt reduction, will fit together. In so doing, \nthe budget resolution made certain assumptions, assumptions regarding \nthe economy and assumptions regarding spending.\n  First, the budget resolution is based on CBO's ten-year economic \nprojections which are, overly optimistic and, by definition, hopelessly \nunreliable, as I will explain. Second, it assumes that nondefense \nspending will be held slightly below the rate of inflation for the next \n10 years. We have not held spending to that level in decades. Third, it \nassumes that no additional funds will be needed for Social Security \nreform. I have yet to see a viable Social Security reform plan which \ndid not need additional funds to address transitional costs. Fourth, \nalthough it did assume certain funds for Medicare, funding for a \nprescription drug benefit will have to compete with funding for overall \nMedicare reform. Finally, although it created a defense reserve fund, \nthere was no money in the budget allocated for this purpose. It will \nhave to compete with all other spending priorities.\n  Clearly, each of these assumptions deserves close scrutiny because \nthey are the foundation for the tax cut we are considering.\n  A little over three years ago, in January of 1998, the Congressional \nBudget Office projected that the federal government would accumulate a \n10-year unified surplus of $660 billion. While the January CBO report \nappeared only a few short months after the Asian financial crisis of \n1997, its authors were careful to note that their ten-year projections \nwere based not on cyclical effects, but rather on certain beliefs \nregarding the long-term prospects for the United States economy. The \nsurplus estimates were driven by trends in underlying factors--\nimportant issues such as the demographics of the labor force, the rate \nof national savings, and growth of productivity levels in output per \nworker.\n  This January, once again, our Congressional Budget Office produced \nnew estimates on what to expect over the next ten years. The economists \nprojected the economy would grow at a\n\n[[Page S5508]]\n\nrate of 2.4 percent in 2001, a full half a point higher than CBO had \nanticipated for 2001 in its budget outlook written only three years \nago. Nevertheless, we find ourselves dealing with ten-year surplus \nprojections not of $600 billion, but $5.6 trillion. From 1998 to 2001, \nthe Congressional Budget Office increased its ten-year surplus \nprojections by 5 trillion dollars. Allow me to repeat that statement. \nIn three short years, the Congressional Budget Office has increased its \nten-year surplus projections by 5 trillion dollars.\n  It begs the question, what has led the Congressional Budget Office to \nincrease surplus projections by such a tremendous amount over the last \nthree years? Is it the result of deficit reduction measures? Absolutely \nnot. Over the past three years, discretionary spending has grown by an \naverage rate of well over 4 percent. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \nslowed the growth of Medicare, but Social Security and Medicaid \nspending continue to increase.\n\n  Today, the same economists that predicted a 10-year surplus of $600 \nbillion in 1998 have changed their assumptions regarding the economy's \nability to grow. They assume that productivity growth will continue at \nlevels far exceeding levels attained from the mid-1970s through the \nmid-1990s. They assume that productivity growth will be well above its \naverage over the last 50 years.\n  Yet, productivity levels already show signs of weakening. \nProductivity has dropped steadily since last summer. In the first \nquarter of this year, productivity recorded its first decline since \n1995.\n  A surplus projection centered on an assumption that productivity \ngrowth will hold at the levels achieved over the last five years is not \na conservative projection, and it is certainly not the stone on which \nCongress should engrave the largest nominal tax cut it has ever \ncontemplated and bet the future of the US economy.\n  Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office acknowledges as much in their \nreport. Their economists go to great lengths to warn of the pitfalls \nand dangers of budget forecasting. The January report devotes 24 pages \nto this very topic. Under one specific scenario modeled by CBO, their \neconomists examine what would happen if the economy reverted to pre-\n1996 conditions, specifically, if: (1) productivity growth averages its \nhistorical rate of 1.5 percent, (2) Medicare and Medicaid spending grow \na mere 1 percent faster than the baseline, and (3) increases in \npersonal tax liabilities from phenomena such as recent capital gains \nrealizations gradually fall to historical levels. In this instance, \nthey estimate the budget surplus would fall from $5.6 trillion to $1.6 \ntrillion. A full, four trillion dollars would be eliminated.\n  That scenario is far from a ``doomsday'' scenario. It simply assumes \nthat productivity growth falls to historic levels, Medicare and \nMedicaid spending increase 1 percent, and capital gains realizations \nfall to historic levels. And it reduces the surplus by four trillion \ndollars.\n  Now I say to my colleagues, there is another piece of the surplus \npuzzle that just doesn't fit and that is the spending assumptions. Over \nthe past 20 years, the difference in projected spending in the \nCongressional budget resolution for the next fiscal year and the actual \namount of spending for the next fiscal year has averaged 3.3 percent. \nIn other words, spending for fiscal year 2002 will probably be off by \nabout 3.3 percent from the level anticipated in the budget resolution. \nThus, with a $1.9 trillion budget, we're likely to be off by about $60 \nbillion. And that's just next year.\n  Looking at the out-years, spending assumptions can be wildly \ninaccurate. Medicare spending is rising again, it increased by 3 \npercent in 2000. According to CBO, ``Historically, Medicare's growth \nrate has varied widely, and such fluctuations are likely to continue.'' \nIn 2000, Medicaid grew 2 percent faster than CBO projected. In \naddition, minor upturns in inflation can result in major spending \nincreases because many mandatory program benefits, such as Social \nSecurity, are linked to the consumer price index. And we have yet to \nadequately address all of the problems the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \ncreated for Medicare.\n  On the discretionary side, since the end of President Reagan's last \nterm, domestic nondefense outlays have increased at a rate of 6 percent \na year, those are our investments in education, the environment, \ntransportation, children and other priorities. Much of that increase \nwas balanced by declining defense expenditures. That's about to change. \nDoes anyone really believe that a budget resolution which assumes that \ndiscretionary spending will rise at the rate of inflation over the next \nten years is honest budgeting? Judging by the votes during Senate floor \nconsideration of the budget resolution, it's not about to begin today.\n  Now let's take a look at what happens to the surplus if we make a \nmuch more realistic assumption about spending. For example, maybe we \nwill lower nondefense spending growth from the 6 percent averaged since \nthe end of Reagan's term to 5 percent. Let's give ourselves the benefit \nof the doubt and assume that the defense build-up leads to increases in \ndefense of only 5 percent per year. Thus, discretionary spending \nincreases 5 percent a year over the next 10 years. In effect, with lost \ninterest savings, we would wipe out more than $1.1 trillion of the \nprojected surplus.\n  So first we have a potential situation in which our 10-year surplus, \ndue to faulty economic assumptions, has fallen from $5.6 trillion to \n$1.6 trillion. When we then figure in honest and realistic projections \nregarding spending growth, our actual 10-year surplus has now been \nreduced from 5.6 trillion to $500 billion. We have wiped out all of the \nMedicare surplus and we have wiped out about 80 percent of the Social \nSecurity surplus, and we still have not calculated the cost of the tax \ncut or Social Security reform.\n  Now combine that scenario with the tax cut before us. We are about to \nenact a $1.35 trillion tax cut and at the same time, we have done \nnothing to deal with fundamental issues resulting from mandatory \nspending and the retirement of the Baby Boom generation. Moreover, \nthere exists the very real possibility that we will return to the days \nof deficit spending and ballooning federal debt.\n  And while it may make a nice sound bite to say that if we don't send \nthe surplus back to the American people in a tax cut, Congress will \nwaste it, no one can make that argument with a straight face unless \nthey are willing to set forth a real plan to deal with the fundamental \nissues facing Social Security and Medicare. Our President has yet to \nsubmit a Social Security or Medicare reform plan and I don't see one on \nthe schedule in the Ways and Means Committee or the Finance Committee.\n  Social Security's trustees reported in March that Social Security's \ntax income will fall short of Social Security's benefit payments \nbeginning in 2016. Medicare's tax income will fall short of Medicare \nspending the same year. Social Security and Medicare's problems are \nrelated to the aging of the labor force. In the not-to-distant future, \nthere will be too few workers in the workforce to maintain Social \nSecurity and Medicare as pay-as-you-go programs. These are not small \nproblems.\n  In the case of Social Security, Congress will have to either reduce \nSocial Security benefits, raise Social Security taxes, or find a third \nalternative. Individual accounts, partial privatization, or investment \nof Social Security funds in the stock market, even under the best of \ncircumstances, regardless of how they are structured, will require use \nof large-scale additional funds to ensure that current and near \nretirees will not be penalized. But under the scenario I have outlined, \nthere would be no General Treasury funds available and Social Security \nsurpluses over the next ten years would be eliminated.\n  The same issues apply to Medicare. The Congressional budget \nresolution sets aside $300 billion in a Medicare Reserve Fund. However, \nthat $300 billion is needed just to finance a decent prescription drug \nbenefit. In addition, there will be substantial costs associated with \nreforming Medicare. This year's Trustees' Report showed that health \ncare costs per capita will rise. But as I have demonstrated, the tax \ncut would place Medicare surpluses in jeopardy.\n  Dealing with the Social Security and Medicare's financial problems \nsooner rather than later minimizes the pain for beneficiaries and \nworkers by allowing the government to address transitional costs before \nthe problem reaches the breaking point.\n\n[[Page S5509]]\n\n  Congress should be acting in a fiscally responsible way by addressing \nSocial Security and Medicare's long-term problems while we have the \nopportunity, while the Federal government is operating under surpluses \nand not deficits.\n  Turning to the actual tax cut before us, regardless of how you feel \nabout the bill's specific provisions, one glaring problem flows from \nthe fact that most of the bill's provisions will not take effect for \nseveral years.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the cost of the bill in \n2011 will exceed the cost of the tax bill in the first three years \ncombined. By the time we reach 2011, the cost of the Chairman's \nproposed tax cut will approach nearly $200 billion per year.\n  The most obvious example is the bill's estate tax relief provisions. \nOver the next five years, the bill would provide a total of $36 billion \nin estate tax relief. However, the bill does not actually repeal the \nestate tax until the year 2011, and, therefore, the revenue hit \nresulting from repeal of the estate tax will not actually occur until \n2012, so its impact does not even appear in the revenue tables.\n  Thus, the bill repeals the estate tax in the same year that the Baby \nBoom generation will begin retire. Is that fiscal responsibility? The \nstark reality is that the cost of the tax cut will arrive just when we \nare least able to afford it.\n  The same problem applies throughout the legislation.\n  To make matters worse, because many of the bill's provisions will not \ntake effect until the second five years, the costs of the tax bill \nescalates at a time when surplus estimates are the most unreliable, \ntowards the end. And by back-loading the bill, we are ensuring that the \ncosts of the tax cut will rise just when surpluses are most unreliable \nand our fiscal problems related to the aging of the population are \ntruly emerging.\n  Finally, I say to my colleague, by passing this tax cut, we are \neffectively ensuring that the Federal debt will stop falling and start \nrising again. Under the Congressional Budget Office's January baseline, \nFederal debt, i.e., debt held by the public as well as debt owed to \nFederal trust funds such as Social Security and Medicare, will fall in \neach of the next five years. However, under the budget resolution \nCongress passed last week, Federal debt would soon be on the rise \nagain. Even if you accept their assumptions about spending and the \neconomy, after five years, Federal debt will be $600 billion higher \nthan the CBO baseline. Over the full ten years of the budget \nresolution, Federal debt would increase by over $1 trillion, from $5.6 \ntrillion in 2001 to $6.7 trillion in 2011.\n  And by using unrealistic economic and spending assumptions, as I have \nshown, they are ensuring that debt held by the public will rise. From \n1969 to 1997, debt held by the public increased every year. Over the \npast three years, we reversed that trend. From 1997 through 2000, the \nFederal government retired $360 billion of debt held by the public. In \nthe early 1990s, by enacting a real deficit reduction program, we were \nable to completely change the course of interest rates, inflation, and \nthe economy.\n  Reducing publicly held debt means the government is buying back \nbonds, thereby freeing capital in private sector financial markets. As \nFederal Reserve Chairman Greenspan noted in Congressional testimony \nearlier this year, ``a declining level of Federal debt is desirable \nbecause it holds down long-term real interest rates, thereby lowering \nthe cost of capital and elevating private investment.'' Paying down \npublicly held debt results in lower interest rates and lower inflation. \nThe result is lower home mortgage rates and lower auto loan rates for \nevery American.\n  Paying down debt has also helped finance a high level of private \nsector investment at a time when personal savings rates are declining. \nBy buying back bonds, more capital is available in domestic markets. It \nis that simple.\n  But under the tax cut we have before us today, the ability to reduce \npublicly held debt will be strained. Their numbers make unrealistic \nassumptions about the economy and unrealistic assumptions about \nspending. While only time will tell, I fear we are moving down the \nwrong path, one that reverses the progress made over the last eight \nyears.\n  I acknowledge that the Chairman and Ranking Member have made great \nstrides to ensure that their bill will benefit a broad spectrum of \nAmericans. I particularly appreciate the fact that they included a $70 \nbillion provision that Senators Snowe, Lincoln and I requested which \nwill ensure that an additional 16 million children benefit from the \nexpanded child credit.\n  Nevertheless, for all of the reasons I have outlined, I believe the \nevidence is clear, the long-term consequences of the proposed tax \nreduction will set back our economy and our nation. I want tax relief, \nbut I don't believe in doing it at the expense of fiscal discipline. \nAnd that is why I would urge my colleagues to vote against this \nagreement, we can and should do better.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the tax \nreconciliation legislation pending before the Senate. Unfortunately, \nthis tax bill spends vast sums of money, based on shaky economic \nforecasts, and disguises its true cost by phasing in most of its tax \nrelief far into the future. As a result, this legislation poses a real \nrisk to our Nation's fiscal health without providing the tax relief \nAmericans have been promised for years to come.\n  Let me begin by clearly stating that I am not opposed to responsible \ntax relief. I believe we can craft a fiscally responsible tax cut that \ndoes not endanger our economy and provides meaningful tax relief, \nincluding targeted measures, a component of across-the-board \nreductions, and an economic stimulus package.\n  That being said, I must oppose the massive tax bill before the Senate \ntoday for several reasons. Foremost among them is my deep concern that, \nif we pass this legislation, we will be repeating the mistake we made \nin 1981 and squandering the fiscal security we have worked so hard to \nachieve. In 1981, Congress complied with the President's request for a \nlarge tax cut. The Nation felt the negative effects of that tax cut for \nmore than a decade, as Federal deficits grew and the national debt \nexploded. It took the country nearly 20 years to recover from that tax \ncut, and move from a period of record budget deficits, to economic \nprosperity and budget surpluses.\n  Today, we again have an opportunity to shape the course of our \ncountry for the better, and part of that course should include \nresponsible tax cuts. I have supported proposals to devote a full third \nof our projected non-Social Security surplus, approximately $900 \nbillion, to tax relief. It is my strong belief that we should devote a \nfull third of the surplus to paying down our national debt. Simply put, \nif we don't take measures to reduce the debt in times of surplus, when \nwill we? The remaining third of the surplus is needed to address the \npriorities I hear from the Marylanders I meet every day, access to \nhealthcare, education, a prescription drug benefit in Medicare, \nprotecting Social Security, enforcing our Nation's laws, addressing \nrising energy costs, and on and on.\n  A $1.35 trillion tax cut will not allow us to act on these crucial \nareas, particularly when it is based on a highly speculative ten-year \nforecast of our Nation's future revenues. This bill is based on \neconomic projections of a $2.6 trillion non-Social Security surplus. \nThat surplus is not cash-in-hand being held by the Federal Government, \nit is a prediction that in the future this money will materialize. \nBased on that prediction, the tax bill would spend $1.35 trillion over \nthe next ten years, despite a national debt of more than $5.6 trillion, \nor $20,227.19 for every man, woman, and child in our country.\n  I believe it is unwise to base such a massive tax cut on projected \nincome that may never come to pass. The serious limitations of economic \nprojections are clearly illustrated by recent experience: just six \nyears ago, in January 1995, the Congressional Budget Office projected \nthat we would finish the year 2000 with a $342 billion deficit. \nInstead, we saw a surplus of $236 billion, a swing of $578 billion. In \nfact, most of the projected surplus over the next 10 years is expected \nto occur in the outyears, when projections are the most uncertain: \nAlmost 70 percent of the non-Social Security surplus is projected to \noccur in 2007-2011, the last 5 years of the projection period. I \nbelieve it would be the height of folly to commit these uncertain \nsurpluses to large,\n\n[[Page S5510]]\n\npermanent tax cuts, as this tax bill does.\n  While I am concerned about tax reductions amounting to $1.35 \ntrillion, the cost of the tax bill this decade, I am even more \ndisturbed by the exploding cost of these tax measures in years to come. \nThe authors of this legislation have employed a variety of tactics to \ndisguise the true cost of the bill. Most significantly, the various tax \ncuts provided by this legislation are slowly phased in over ten years \nto keep costs under the $1.35 trillion maximum dictated by the budget \nresolution. Other provisions granting tax relief actually expire in the \nmiddle of the ten-year period covered by the bill.\n  I am opposed to such shell games that hide the true cost of this \nlegislation for two reasons. First, the American public is being \npromised tax relief and likely doesn't understand that the changes \nwhich may benefit them the most will not arrive for years to come. \nWhatever your own tax cut priority, odds are it will not be realized \nfor a long time. Marriage penalty relief does not begin until the year \n2005. The final rate cut in the upper income tax brackets does not \noccur until 2007. The increase in the child credit to $1,000 does not \ntake effect until 2011. The full increase in IRA contribution limits \nand the repeal of the estate tax do not take effect until 2011.\n  In addition to this extreme backloading of costs, this tax \nlegislation actually ``sunsets'' several important provisions in order \nto hold down costs. Most of the alternative minimum tax, or ``AMT'', \nrelief provided in the bill is actually eliminated in 2006. As a \nresult, the number of taxpayers affected by the AMT would explode this \ndecade to nearly 40 million taxpayers by 2011, more than 25 times the \nnumber of Americans now affected by the AMT. Provisions aimed at \nencouraging small businesses to fund employee pensions expire in 2006. \nAnd deductions for education expenses end in 2005.\n  The American people have been sold this bill as providing all of this \nrelief, and have not been told how long they are going to have to wait \nto get it, and that it is not actually permanent relief. Even more \nimportantly, such accounting gimmicks disguise the real cost that this \nlegislation will impose on our Nation. The true cost of this package \nwill rise to anywhere from $3.5 trillion to $4 trillion over ten years \nonce it is fully implemented, which coincidentally occurs right at the \ntime the baby boomers retire. If we enact this drastic cut, where will \nwe find the resources to meet the needs of an aging population? How \nwill we invest in national priorities like education, a well-prepared \nmilitary, and a prescription drug benefit in Medicare? I strongly \nbelieve that we cannot enact such a huge tax cut, based on shaky \neconomic forecasts, that will consume such a vast amount of resources \njust as our Nation's need is the greatest.\n\n  Finally, I believe it is worth noting who receives the benefits of \nthis tax reconciliation bill. As I have said before, I am not opposed \nto a component of across-the-board tax relief. For example, the new 10 \npercent tax bracket created in this bill would benefit all Americans \nwho pay taxes, including those with the highest incomes in our country. \nI would also support legislation to ease the marriage penalty and \nsignificantly increase the estate tax exemption so that our families \ncan pass on more to future generations.\n  However, a disproportionate percentage of the benefits of this \nlegislation is given to the wealthiest in our country. According to \nCitizens for Tax Justice, thirty-five percent of the benefits of this \ntax bill goes to the richest one percent of taxpayers--who have an \naverage income of $1,117,000. While they get 35 percent of the benefits \nof this bill, that top one percent of taxpayers pays only 20 percent of \nall Federal taxes.\n  In contrast, this legislation fails to provide tax relief for many of \nour Nation's hardest-working taxpayers. The tax bill we are considering \ntoday provides no tax relief to the many American families who pay no \nincome taxes, but who pay substantial payroll taxes. These low-income \nworkers have not benefitted from our Nation's booming economy in recent \nyears. Between 1992 and 1998, the bottom 95 percent of Americans \nexperienced an eight percent rise in their after-tax incomes, while the \ntop one percent of taxpayers saw their after-tax income increase by 47 \npercent. We should find some way to give those workers who have not \nparticipated in our recent economic prosperity, but still pay \nsubstantial payroll taxes, the relief they so desperately need.\n  Nonetheless, some will argue that wealthy Americans pay more taxes \nand, therefore, deserve a larger tax cut. That may be true if only the \ndollar amount of the tax cut is considered, but the tax bill we are \ndebating gives a larger percentage of its tax cuts to high-income \nAmericans. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, \nthis tax bill, when fully phased in, will increase the after-tax income \nof the richest one percent of Americans by an average of five percent. \nIn contrast, the bill will increase the after-tax income of the middle \nfifth of American taxpayers by only 2.2 percent, and the poorest 20 \npercent of families in our country will see their income increase by \nonly 0.8 percent. Therefore, this legislation would increase the after-\ntax income of our richest Americans more than twice as fast as those in \nthe middle class, and six times faster than families in the bottom 20 \npercent of the income scale. Clearly, this bill denies middle-class and \nlower-income Americans tax relief in order to benefit the wealthiest in \nour country.\n  I believe that by passing this tax bill we will throw away an \nunprecedented opportunity to develop a sound fiscal policy for our \nNation. We have an unparalleled opportunity to pay down the Nation's \ndebt, to invest in our future, and to shore up vital programs. If we \nact prudently, we can ensure that the Federal government will have the \nresources to meet our obligations after the baby boomers retire and \nbeyond. We can do a reasonable tax cut in response to the problems \nconfronting working families all across the Nation, and we can do all \nthis in a very balanced way. Because this legislation would squander \nour best chance for investing in America's future, lifting the debt \nburden off the next generation, and providing a reasonable tax cut for \nour working families, I strongly oppose this excessive tax bill and I \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the tax \nreconciliation bill being considered by the Senate today. I believe \nVermonters and all Americans deserve tax relief, but we need to have a \nfiscally responsible tax package that benefits everyone. We do not need \none that is so large, so likely to result once again in budget \ndeficits, so full of budgetary gimmicks, and so skewed toward the \nwealthy.\n  If we are serious about passing a tax cut bill to provide needed \nrelief to all Americans we should be lowering the tax rate for low- and \nmedium-income people, making the child tax credit fully refundable, \neliminating the marriage penalty tax immediately, creating an R tax \ncredit, increasing IRA and pension contributions, and allowing for \ngreater college tuition credits. Unfortunately, we are delaying all of \nthese important tax relief components in order to shoehorn a massive \nrate reduction for the wealthiest Americans into this bill. It also \npays for this massive tax plan at the expense of needed investments in \nSocial Security, Medicare, education, the environment, and paying off \nthe national debt.\n  I am one of five Senators still in the Senate who voted against the \nReagan tax plan in 1981. We saw what happened there: We had a huge tax \ncut, defense spending boomed, and the national debt quadrupled. The tax \nplan was popular but it was wrong. America should not move backward in \nthat direction.\n  This tax plan is too large. I voted for a responsible tax cut plan \ntargeted to help the low- and medium-income people of this country who \nneed tax relief the most. The $900 billion alternative I supported \noffered immediate tax refund checks to help boost the economy and help \nAmericans pay for higher gasoline and energy prices, rate reductions \nfor all income taxpayers, marriage penalty relief to start immediately, \na partially refundable child tax credit, tuition tax deductibility to \nmake college more affordable for middle class families and a major \neffort to modernize our public schools, a comprehensive package of \nretirement savings incentives to increase IRA and pension contributions \nand encourage small business to set up pension funds for their \nemployees, a permanent extension of the $10,000 adoption tax credit, \nhealth insurance deduction for the self-employed, responsible estate \ntax relief, a permanent\n\n[[Page S5511]]\n\nR tax credit, and elimination of the alternative minimum tax, AMT, \nfor people with income up to $80,000. Unfortunately, the majority \nrefused to seriously consider this offer to provide reasonable tax \nrelief to working men and women and their families.\n  This tax plan is not fiscally responsible. We should keep in mind the \ninherent risks of forecasting budget surpluses ten years into the \nfuture. The President has argued that the surplus will be around $1.6 \ntrillion and that all of that should go toward tax cuts. And most of \nthe tax cuts in this bill come in the second 5 years of the 10-year \nplan. Setting aside the argument of how to spend that much money, is it \nreally available? The predictions used to calculate $1.6 trillion were \nbased on the U.S. economy expanding at an annual rate of 4 percent from \n2000-2010. I think we know from the current economic slowdown that our \neconomy is growing nowhere near 4 percent, if at all, right now. That \nis a big yellow flag that these assumptions are wrong. Focusing on \nbudget predictions 10 years in the future is exceptionally risky and \ndoes not allow businesses and individuals to properly plan long-term.\n  This tax plan does not address our enormous Federal debt. Whatever \nsurplus our Nation now enjoys should be used to pay down the $5.7 \ntrillion gross Federal debt burden our country still carries. The \nFederal Government has to pay almost $900 million in interest every \nworking day on this national debt. Paying off our debt will help \nsustain our sound economy by keeping interest rates low. I want to \nleave a legacy for our children and grandchildren of a debt-free \nNation.\n  This tax plan is slanted toward the wealthiest among us. The original \ntax plan proposed by the President provides nearly half of that $1.6 \ntrillion tax cut to the wealthiest in our country. We are sacrificing \nreal tax relief to working families in this country for rate reductions \nto the wealthy. We should focus on enacting a responsible plan that \nwill benefit the broadest number of people by reducing taxes to low- \nand medium-income people. By focusing only on income tax rate \nreductions, this tax cut plan leaves out millions of taxpayers who do \nnot pay Federal income taxes but who do pay payroll taxes. In Vermont, \nthere are 23,000 families who do not pay Federal income taxes. But 82 \npercent of those families do pay payroll taxes. For the vast majority \nof taxpayers, payroll taxes generate the largest tax burden, and yet \nthis plan does not touch payroll taxes.\n  This tax plan has not been thoroughly reviewed and is full of \nbudgetary gimmicks designed to mask the true effects of the bill. There \nare many unforeseen consequences of this tax bill that we should take \ninto account before enacting this massive tax cut. However, with \nRepublicans pushing to get this bill done by Memorial Day, there is \ngreat pressure to ram through a $1.35 trillion tax cut without a full \nreview of all the proposals.\n  The New York Times has reported that one unanticipated effect of full \nrepeal of estate tax may be greater capital gains taxes for most \nestates. After 2011, when the estate tax will be repealed, capital \ngains taxes would be owed on everything inherited above $1.3 million. \nAs the Times reporter said:\n\n       Presumably, the drafters of the legislation did not worry \n     if all the pieces did not fit together in a coherent package \n     because they were primarily interested in getting a bill on \n     the table for debate.\n\n  States that tie their State tax returns to Federal returns are going \nto be hurt by the lost Federal revenues. Vermont's tax system is one of \nthree in the nation in which taxpayers use their Federal tax bill to \ncalculate their State income taxes. It is a simple system, but it is \naffected by every little tax change at the Federal level. In effect, a \nmassive Federal tax cut leads to a massive State tax cut. According to \nVermont State economists, the State stands to lose $506 million over \nthe next ten years because of this tax bill. In FY 2002 alone, Vermont \nwill lose $35.7 million. The conservative Heritage Foundation has \nestimated that Vermont may lose up to $1.5 billion because of this huge \ntax cut. This is a very large amount of money for a State whose \npopulation is only 609,000. How will the State make up these lost \nrevenues?\n  Vermont was hurt 20 years ago when Congress last considered a massive \ntax cut. Those rewrites to the Federal Tax Code put the State in red \nink for years. As the red ink grew, an emergency tax study group \nassembled by the Governor found that between 1982 and 1987 the State \nstood to lose $300 million because of the Reagan tax cut. Now we will \nbe putting Vermont back in a similar situation. As our Governor has \nalready warned, without raising State taxes to make up for Federal \nloses, Vermont will once again see major deficits.\n  This tax bill also asks States to pay for repealing the Federal \nestate tax by abruptly ending payments from Federal estate tax revenue \nthat are now shared with the States. This bill will cut by half the \nFederal credit that States receive for the Federal estate taxes that \nare collected and will deny States between $50 billion and $100 billion \nover 10 years, or as much as two-thirds of the cost of the estate tax \nrepeal in the bill.\n  Another anomaly of this bill is the way the AMT is calculated. While \nDemocrats hoped to exempt people who make under $100,000 from AMT \npermanently, Republicans only want to slightly increase the exemption \nfor 4 years from 2002 to 2006. The Republican plan would cause 39.6 \nmillion taxpayers to be subject to the AMT by 2011. Clearly this flies \nin the face of the original intent of the AMT, which was to ensure that \nwealthy taxpayers cannot make use of tax breaks to eliminate much or \nall of their tax liability. The tax bill will force more and more \nmiddle-class taxpayers to pay a tax that was meant to reach very few, \nwell-off taxpayers.\n  I do not like the marriage penalty and think it is poor public \npolicy. While this bill does contain two provisions designed to provide \nmarriage penalty relief, it makes couples wait 5 years for that relief. \nWhile the rate cuts in upper-income tax brackets take effect next year, \nmarried couples will have to wait until 2005 to get relief and until \n2010 until full repeal is fully phased in. This is 3 years after the \nupper income bracket rate cuts are fully effective.\n  After years of hard choices, we have balanced the budget and started \nbuilding surpluses. Now we must make responsible choices for the \nfuture. Our top priorities should be paying off the national debt, \nsaving Social Security, creating a real Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit, protecting domestic spending programs, and passing a fair and \nresponsible tax cut.\n  This tax bill falls far short of these priorities. It uses gimmicks \nto hide the bill's true costs. It provides no marriage penalty relief \nfor five years. It contains no immediate tax refund to stimulate the \neconomy. It has a hidden tax increase on the middle-class through the \nAMT. And its costs explode after 10 years, just as the baby boom \ngeneration begins to retire. For the sake of our economy and the \nworking families of America, I will vote against this tax cut bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the budget resolution, including the tax \nbill which has passed the Senate, will almost surely push us back into \nthe deficit ditch. The tax bill was rushed through before the President \nmakes his request for additional defense funds, before the tax writing \ncommittees adopt additional provisions which we all know are \nforthcoming to extend current tax provisions, before the tax writing \ncommittees act to avoid the calamity which will befall 40 million \npeople who will be forced to pay an alternative minimum tax as a result \nof this tax bill. That's twice the number that will be paying \nalternative minimum taxes by 2011 under current law. This fiscally \nirresponsible tax bill was pushed through before the review of the \nprojected surplus which is due in August, and also before the \nappropriations bills are reported, which everyone here knows will \nexceed the domestic discretionary spending cap provided for in the \nbudget resolution. The final result of all this fiscal irresponsibility \nwill almost surely be the raiding of the Medicare surplus and a return \nto the deficit days of the 1980s.\n  Our future economic health took a blow today.\n  I support a tax cut, a reduction in taxes which is modest enough to \nbe fiscally responsible, swift enough to provide an economic stimulus, \nand fair to\n\n[[Page S5512]]\n\nall Americans, including working families who are so shortchanged by \nthe Republican proposal. The bill passed today is the opposite. Its \nlarge size makes it fiscally irresponsible, it actually delays tax \nrelief, and it provides most of its benefit to the upper income \nAmericans. It is based on long-term surplus projections which history \nshows to be highly speculative making this bill dangerous to our \neconomic future. Finally, it is being catapulted through the Senate, \nexploiting a process which severely limits debate and which was never \nintended for tax reduction legislation of this size.\n  Although this bill is advertised as a $1.35 trillion tax bill, it's \ntrue cost is closer to $2 trillion. It fails to account for the cost of \nreal Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) reform. In fact, under this \nlegislation, by 2011, nearly 40 million taxpayers will have to pay the \nAMT, including many middle income taxpayers. It ignores the fact that \ntens and perhaps hundreds of billions of dollars worth of additional \nspending, over ten years, will be required to live up to the \nPresident's goals for defense and education, and to provide for urgent \ndomestic needs this Senate knows it is going to support.\n  This tax bill takes us back to the bad old days of backloaded tax \nbreaks whose real costs explode several years after enactment. Although \nit technically sunsets its provisions in 2011 to meet the requirements \nof the Byrd Rule, the changes in the tax code which it makes, such as \nthe repeal of the estate tax, are clearly intended to be permanent. The \ncost of these changes explode immediately beyond the ten-year \n``window''. In fact, the bill's claimed $1.35 trillion price tag could \ntriple in the second ten years. This budgetary time bomb is set go off \nat roughly the same time as the bill begins to come due for Medicare \nand Social Security. That is the time the ``baby boomers'' begin to \nretire and we must begin to draw down the Social Security Trust fund.\n  This tax bill is based on highly speculative long-term projections. \nProjections are always risky. We have seen many Federal budget \nestimates, and we know well that as quickly as these surpluses \nappeared, they could disappear. This bill is based on projections of \nsurpluses for ten years downstream. History has shown that CBO \nprojections for even five years into the future have been off over the \npast decade by an average of more than 100 percent.\n  The massive tax cut which the Senate has passed threatens to lead us \nback into the deficit ditch. We just climbed out of that ditch. And we \nshouldn't head there again, particularly when the country is saddled \nwith a national debt that resulted from the last binge of deficits. The \ncurrent national debt is $5.6 trillion. Based on the Budget Resolution \nwhich the Senate recently adopted and based on this tax cut, the \nnational debt at the end of the next ten years will have increased to \n$6.7 trillion. If the projected surpluses do in fact materialize, we \nshould be using them mainly to pay down the national debt instead of \nincreasing that debt with a big tax cut.\n  In 1981, President Ronald Reagan introduced his Economic Recovery Tax \nAct which included huge tax cuts and predictions that the budget would \nbe balanced by 1984. In 1981, I opposed that supply side economic \napproach because I was convinced that it would lead to huge deficits. \nWe did indeed pay dearly for the debt which resulted from that \nlegislation. In 1992, the annual deficit in the federal budget had \nreached $290 billion. The remarkable progress which since then has \nbrought us to our current surpluses came about in large part as a \nresult of the deficit reduction package which President Clinton \npresented in 1993, and which the Senate and House each passed by a \nmargin of one vote. We should not now be passing an imprudent tax bill \nlike the one before us, and head back toward new future deficits.\n  Although the tax cut is irresponsibly large, the economic impact will \nbe remarkably small, because the bill before us does not contain the \n$85 billion economic stimulus adopted in the Senate-passed budget \nresolution. Only $33 billion is allocated for tax relief this year. The \nbill is extensively back-loaded: it doesn't start marriage penalty \nrelief--the doubling of the standard deduction and the expansion of the \n15 percent bracket--until 2006. IRA contribution limits aren't fully \nphased in until 2011. The Child Credit isn't fully phased in until \n2011. The delay in relief actually shifts the responsibility of paying \nfor our excess onto the next generation.\n  The relief provided in the bill isn't equitable. There is no tax \nrelief for the 25 million taxpaying Americans that pay their federal \ntaxes through the payroll tax. And it means too little to taxpayers in \nthe 15 percent bracket, who will see no reduction in their marginal tax \nrate, while those in the top 1 percent receive nearly $40,000 worth of \nrelief. In fact overall, the top 1 percent, earning an average of more \nthan a million dollars a year, will receive about 35 percent of the \nbenefits under this tax legislation.\n  I am also deeply troubled by the process which has brought us to this \npoint. We considered this legislation under special rules contained in \nthe Budget Act for a process called ``reconciliation''. This process is \nbeing misused to steamroll this bill through the Senate. By restricting \na Senator's right to fully debate and amend this bill--no more than \ntwenty hours of debate is permitted and the amendment process is \nseverely constrained--the majority puts the Senate in a straightjacket. \nA similar oppressive tactic was used earlier when the majority bypassed \nthe Budget Committee to bring the Budget Resolution to the Senate floor \nand when they excluded Democrats from the Conference Committee in order \nto write the reconciliation instructions which are being used to shield \nthis legislation from full debate and amendment. This process is a rush \nto judgment which does damage to the institution of the Senate and its \nreputation for deliberation. And, it does this damage to promote a \nmassive tax bill which will negatively affect the economic well-being \nof Americans for decades to come.\n  This Administration argues that the projected surplus should be \nreturned to the tax payers because it is their money. Of course it is \ntheir money. But the economy is all of ours too. Social Security \nbelongs to all of us. The Medicare program belongs to all of us. Our \neducation program and helping people through college, belongs to all of \nus. And, of course, the national debt belongs to all of us as well. We \nowe it to the American people to reject this imprudent tax cut in order \nto pay down that national debt and to strengthen our commitment to \nthose programs that the American people want. We can do that consistent \nwith a targeted, modest, prudent tax cut. Unless it is improved in the \nConference with the House, which is not likely, we should defeat this \nmassive, unfair, imprudent tax cut bill when it returns to the Senate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is unfortunate that the Republican \nleadership has interrupted the Senate's action on landmark education \nreform legislation in order to expedite action on their massive tax cut \nbill. It demonstrates once more that education is not a real priority \nfor our Republican colleagues. Their only priority is tax cuts, tax \ncuts and more tax cuts.\n  The Republican position could not be clearer: Education can wait \nwhile we rush to give away hundreds of billions of dollars in tax \nbreaks for the wealthy. In Republican priorities, the needs of the \nwealthiest taxpayers for new tax breaks rank far higher than the needs \nof America's school children.\n  Across America, 12 million children are disadvantaged in our \neducation system, but we currently provide the full range of title I \nFederal education services to only one in three of these children. The \nrest are left to fend for themselves, with the most overcrowded \nclassrooms, the least amount of quality teacher time, the most outdated \ntextbooks and learning tools, and the most inadequate facilities.\n  Students with disabilities suffer from the same federal neglect. The \nFederal Government has long promised to fund 40 percent of special \neducation. Yet it still only funds 17 percent, less than half of what \nwas promised. Parents of millions of disabled children are forced to \nstruggle in the States every year for the education that their children \ndeserve. For years, states have called on the Federal Government to \nlive up to its commitment to students with special needs. Yet the \nRepublican budget, and the tax cut that follows from it, say no.\n  Instead, one of every three dollars of the tax breaks in the bill \nbefore us will\n\n[[Page S5513]]\n\ngo to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers. Once the tax breaks are \nfully implemented, the richest 1 percent will receive an average tax \ncut of $37,000 each year--more than most families take home from work \nin an entire year.\n  Mr. President, $37,000 a year could pay the salary of a new teacher \nin most school districts. But if this tax bill passes, there won't be \nfunds for new teachers. Our Republican colleagues in Congress have \ndecided that wealthy taxpayers need the money more.\n  The tax cut is clearly excessive. It is neither fair nor affordable. \nNo wonder the Republican leadership is attempting to force a final vote \nin Congress as soon as possible, before public outrage builds.\n  Through the use of smoke and mirrors and budget gimmicks, the bill \ntechnically complies with the mandate of the budget resolution to \nreport a tax bill costing $1.35 trillion over eleven years. But the \nreal costs are far higher. The real costs of this bill explode in the \noutyears. It does not conform with the clear intent expressed by a \nmajority of Senators to substantially reduce the size of the Bush tax \ncut.\n  Most disturbing of all is the extreme use of backloading to conceal \nthe enormous cost of these tax cuts when they take full effect. The \nrate reduction is not fully implemented until the year 2007. Marriage \npenalty tax relief does not even begin until the year 2005. The amount \nof the child credit does not reach the full $1000 until the year 2011. \nThe estate tax is not repealed until the year 2011 as well, so that \nalmost none of the cost of the repeal shows up until the year 2012.\n  These tactics are the height of fiscal irresponsibility. The \nexcessive cost of the tax breaks in the first 10 years is bad enough. \nBut that cost will triple in the following 10 years. A $1.35 trillion \ntax cut in the first 10 years will mushroom to more than $4 trillion in \nthe next 10 years, precisely when the Nation will confront \nunprecedented additional costs for Medicare and Social Security because \nof the retirement of the baby boom generation. Funds urgently needed to \nstrengthen these basic programs are being denied by these reckless tax \ncuts.\n  Democrats support a substantial tax cut, one that would cost nearly a \ntrillion dollars over the next 10 years, and that would give working \nfamilies a fair share of the tax benefits. But this Republican bill \ndoes not deserve to be enacted. It is far too costly, and it fails to \nprovide significant tax relief to those who need help the most.\n  It is clear that the nation cannot afford this tax cut without \nseriously neglecting America's most important priorities, including \neducation. To meet our basic education needs, I will propose an \namendment making reduction in the top marginal income tax rate \ncontingent upon funding education at the levels that the Senate has \nalready voted to support during our consideration of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. If we do not have adequate resources to \nprovide all students with a quality education, then we certainly do not \nhave the resources needed to provide new tax breaks for the wealthiest \nAmericans.\n  Fewer than 1 percent of taxpayers have incomes high enough to be \naffected by the top income bracket. These are the richest men and women \nin America. The $120 billion in tax breaks contained exclusively for \nthem in this misguided bill should not take priority over the support \nfor education that the Senate has already agreed is necessary. Support \nfor basic education deserves higher priority than lavish new tax breaks \nfor the wealthiest citizens.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Americans deserve a tax cut. They deserve a \nlarge tax cut. And in this time of budget surpluses, we can afford \nhundreds of billions of dollars of tax relief.\n  But Americans deserve other things at least as much. They deserve \nhonesty in budgeting. They deserve a government that will face up to \nthe fundamental choices that have to be made in writing a ten-year \nbudget plan.\n  Americans deserve a strong national defense, safe streets, effective \nschools, world-class health care, clean air and water, a safe and \nefficient transportation system.\n  I must vote against this tax bill because it does not honestly face \nthe serious choices that still confront us in this era of surpluses, \nbecause it sacrifices virtually all other priorities--and some of our \nfundamental values--to the single-minded pursuit of cutting taxes.\n  Despite what some would have us believe, we cannot afford to do \neverything for everybody all at the same time. We cannot cut taxes by \nnearly 2 trillion dollars in the next ten years--a number that actually \ndoubles in the following decade--and continue to provide the \nfundamental governmental functions that Americans need and deserve.\n  If we are honest about the real costs of this tax cut, Mr. President, \nwe would admit that on top of the $1.35 trillion sticker cost, we have \nto add $300 billion in additional interest payments that come from not \npaying down the national debt.\n  If we admit that we will have to reform the Alternative Minimum Tax \nthat will soon hit millions of Americans, we have to add another $300 \nbillion to its cost. Because history shows that we will extend the \nResearch and Development tax credit and other popular and useful breaks \nthat we have always supported in the past, we can add another $100 \nbillion to the size of the tax cut.\n  Those calculations put the full cost of the tax cut and the real, \nforeseeable, inevitable tax issues that will face us in the next decade \nat over $2 trillion.\n  Two trillion--again, a number that will at least double in the ten \nyears after the coming decade.\n  But we are told that there is a surplus that will cover the costs of \nthis and all of the other things we will want and need. Money in the \nbank. Not to worry.\n  There is an old saying to the effect that something that sounds too \ngood to be true, probably is too good to be true. This big tax cut \ncertainly sounds good. It certainly would be appealing to go along and \nvote for it.\n  But that would not be honest because the numbers that we have in \nfront of us right now tell us that we simply can't afford it.\n  The surpluses available to us in the next decade, if we agree not to \nspend money from the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds, is \nsupposed to be about $2.5 trillion. That sounds like a lot of money, \nand it would be, if it were real.\n  But it is not real for two reasons.\n  First, it is based on some assumptions we all know are just not true. \nIf we can, let's just leave aside for a moment how well we can project \nthe future of this economy--that problem alone has proved every other \nlong-term surplus projection we have ever made wrong by hundreds of \nbillions of dollars.\n  But even if we could know for sure that the economy will continue to \ngrow at the high rates of investment and productivity we need to match \nthe forecasts behind those projections--which we don't--those \nprojections simply ignore some basic facts.\n  Only if we ignore those facts can we believe that the tax cuts in \nthis bill make sense.\n  Here are some of the facts that make those surplus forecasts more \nlikely wrong than right. They assume we will have no wars, no \nhurricanes, no floods, no earthquakes--no national security emergencies \nor natural disasters that would subtract billions of dollars from the \nprojected surpluses.\n\n  The second reason the projections have to be wrong is that they \nassume we will cut the size of government in our country by 25 percent \nover the next ten years. As a share of the economy, our federal \ngovernment is already the lowest it has been since 1960. There are \nplenty of reasons to believe that we will not be able to cut it by \nanother 25 percent.\n  Our surplus projections do not account for increases in our \npopulation or increases in the cost of living over the next decade--\nincredible as it may sound, they do not. If we put those two basic \nbudgeting concepts back into our assumptions, that subtracts as much as \n$640 billion from the surpluses.\n  Subtract that $640 billion from the $2.5 trillion estimated surplus, \nthe tax cut is greater than the surplus remaining. Basic honesty in \nbudgeting shows that we cannot afford a tax cut this big.\n  And the surplus projections ignore new spending priorities that \neveryone wants to address, on top of just keeping up with current \nlevels.\n\n[[Page S5514]]\n\n  The Administration has called for both a radical overhaul of our \nnational defenses, and a new anti-ballistic missile program. We have no \nclear idea what those programs might cost, but I have added up just the \nsix best known weapons modernization programs, and they add up to over \n$380 billion.\n  The new defense plan could add perhaps $250 billion, and a full-blown \nmissile defense plan that covered every option the President has \nexpressed an interest in covering could be another $100 billion. So \nprudence suggests we should show some of those costs in the budgets for \nthe next ten years.\n  But we don't. That is hundreds of billions of dollars that will have \nto come out of the supposed surpluses, but we have no place for them in \nour discussions of this tax bill or in our budget calculations.\n  The President says that he wants to spend more for education, even \nthough his budget includes no new spending for it. So far here in the \nSenate, we have passed $150 billion in new education spending, on a \npriority that all Americans share.\n  With just the spending that we know about in defense and education, \nvirtually all of the non-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus is \ngone--and then some--with nothing left for improvements to our aging \nroads, bridges, sewers, dams, or docks.\n  No money for additional air traffic controllers or airports, no money \nto break the gridlock on our highways with a national high-speed \npassenger rail system.\n  No money for new policemen on the beat, for after-school programs to \nprevent juvenile crime, no money for drug interdiction or drug \ntreatment programs.\n  With the huge additional burdens on Social Security and Medicare \ncoming in the years just beyond the decade covered by this tax plan, \nthere is no money left for the fundamental reforms of those programs. \nIf we follow the Administration's approach to Social Security reform, \nwe will need an additional trillion dollars. But there will be no money \nleft.\n  Why are we left with so little for so many of our fundamental needs? \nWhy, when we have finally brought our budgets into balance after years \nof deficits, can we not afford to pay for these essential priorities \nthat we all agree deserve our support?\n  Because this tax cut was not designed as part of a comprehensive \nbudget plan. If it becomes law for the next decade, it will be the only \nreal priority in our budget. Every other priority, from defense to \neducation--and even, I am afraid, balanced budgets--will be only an \nafterthought.\n  That is why I will vote against this tax bill. It costs too much; it \ndepends too much on wishful thinking; it ignores realities that are \nstaring us in the face over the next ten years.\n  We tried to amend this bill to fix the problems I have discussed. \nSenator McCain offered an amendment to scale back the size of the tax \ncut to make room in our budget for the projected increases in defense \nspending. That prudent statement of our national priorities was voted \ndown.\n  Senator Harkin offered an amendment to simply hold off on a piece of \nthe tax cut until we could certify that we can meet the long-term \nobligations of Social Security and Medicare. Once we could make that \ncertification, every bit of the tax cut would go forward. That basic \ncommitment to the promises we have made was voted down.\n  I offered an amendment to scale back the size of the tax cut to make \nroom for a tuition tax deduction to help pay for college. That \nimportant priority of middle-class families was voted down.\n  Senator Rockefeller offered an amendment to make sure we can afford \nto provide a prescription drug benefit for seniors before we cut taxes. \nIt would not prevent a cent of the tax cut from going out--as long as \nwe could pay for a prescription drug benefit. That bipartisan priority, \nshared by the President, was voted down.\n  Senator Feingold offered an amendment to scale back the size of the \ntax cut so that surviving spouses will not have to give up their \nearthly possessions to pay for nursing home care received by deceased \nMedicaid patients. That small gesture toward fairness was voted down.\n  In every case the tax cut came first; every other priority--every \nother value--was left behind.\n  We can afford major tax relief for all Americans. And we can afford \nto provide the national security, the world-class education, the health \ncare and the other priorities Americans have a right to expect. We can \neven afford a little fairness in the distribution of the many blessings \nwe enjoy. We can afford to act on our values.\n  But not if we pass this tax bill.\n  We are indeed a blessed nation, at an historic peak in our prosperity \nand in our influence in the world. We have the resources to prudently \nmanage the challenges and opportunities before us. But we are not \nimmune to the basic laws of budgeting--we have to make choices.\n  This tax cut, by its sheer size--a size selected without \nconsideration of any other priority--refuses to face honestly those \nfundamental choices. It refuses to recognize any other values.\n  I cannot support it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I commend Senator Grassley and Senator \nBaucus for their dedication and hard work in completing this \nReconciliation bill.\n  During the debate on the tax reconciliation bill, I have had serious \nreservations about some of the priorities contained in this bill.\n  First, after years of neglect, our military forces need to be \nsignificantly strengthened and it won't be cheap. But in the wake of \nlarge tax cuts, non-defense spending initiatives, and uncertain surplus \nprojections, we cannot be sure how much money will remain to fund such \ndefense priorities as National Missile Defense, force modernization, \nspare parts, flight hours, overdue facility maintenance, training \nprograms, and the care of our service members. As of yet, we have not \nreceived from the Administration a request for defense spending \nincreases. I hope their request, when it comes, is adequate to meet the \nneeds of our national security, which, as I observed, are many and \nserious. If that request is not adequate to our needs, I will fight as \nhard as I can to increase it.\n  With the adoption of the Reconciliation bill both the Administration \nand Congress are going to have to make some very hard choices to find \nthe resources to fund our national defense priorities. There's no way \naround it. We cannot take money from the Social Security and Medicare \nTrust Funds, so that means we will have to cut other spending programs \nor adjust the tax cuts to support our military forces. Those are very \nhard choices, indeed, and we don't like to make hard choices in \nCongress very often.\n  But, Mr. President, we are going to have to make them because our \nfirst duty, is and always will be the nation's security, and the \ndefense of American interests and values in the world. And those \nmembers who believe we have been derelict in our duty lately, will have \nto take our case to the public, inform them of the hard choices before \nus and urge them to urge us to do the right and necessary thing, even \nif it requires us to take on a few sacred cows around here.\n  Mr. President, while I hoped for even more tax relief to middle \nincome Americans, I do want to commend Senate Grassley for moving in \nthat direction by insisting that the top rate should be cut to only 36 \npercent. I wish we could have made even greater progress by increasing \nthe 15 percent bracket to include more middle class taxpayers. But the \nSenate has decided otherwise, and, recognizing what progress has been \nmade by Senator Grassley, I will not register my disappointment by \nvoting against the bill. Neither do I wish to vote against the \nPresident's first, important success in the Senate. But I do want to \nmake clear my firm opposition to any increases in benefits to the top \ntax rate payers at the expense of the majority of Americans who are in \nmuch greater need of tax relief. Should further reductions in the top \ntax rates be made in conference, I will vote against the conference \nreport without hesitation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I would like to express my \nsupport for the tax cut bill. Simply stated, the time has come for a \nsensible tax cut. The American people deserve it; the budget can \nsupport it. Now, it's time for Congress to authorize it.\n  I sincerely believe this legislation will serve as an efficient \ndelivery vehicle for responsible tax relief that will\n\n[[Page S5515]]\n\nbenefit all Americans. While I support this tax cut plan for several \nreasons, the most concise justification for my position is that the \n$1.35 trillion in tax cuts over 11 years provided in the bill will cut \ntaxes without cutting hope.\n  Since the beginning of this debate, I have repeatedly and \nconsistently voiced my support for a substantial tax cut, as long as it \nwould not interfere with our ability to fund our domestic budgetary \npriorities. I am pleased that this tax cut plan will not sap our \nresources for important obligations like agriculture and defense. It is \nreassuring to know that implementation of this plan will not be at the \nexpense of our critical responsibilities. This legislation will provide \nacross-the-board tax relief for the people of Nebraska, as well as all \nAmericans, without interfering with Social Security and Medicare or \nhampering our efforts to pay down the national debt. Clearly, the \ncornerstone of this bill is responsible tax relief.\n  Perhaps even more significant in this bill's eleven-year, $1.35 \nbillion tax cut package is the inclusion of a $100 billion up-front \nstimulus package. This two-year economic stimulus package will have an \nimmediate impact on our economy, which has been showing all the \nsymptoms of a slow-down. Such tangible, instant relief is precisely \nwhat is needed to counteract the threat of an economic recession.\n  While the reduction of personal income tax rates and the economic \nstimulus package are the highlights of this bill, I would like to \nemphasize the fact that there are several other components of this \nlegislation contributing to its overall efficacy. This bill includes \nraising the exemption for estate tax relief followed by a gradual \nrepeal of the estate tax, a doubling of the childcare tax credit by \n2010, the dissolution of the so-called marriage penalty tax, and \npension reform that will allow larger contributions to IRAs and 401(k) \nplans. I know Nebraskans have supported these initiatives for quite \nsome time, so it brings me great satisfaction to know that they will \nsoon be implemented.\n  I commend Senators Grassley and Baucus for their efforts to achieve \nsubstantial bipartisan support for this tax cut bill. Their work has \nresulted in legislation that skillfully and responsibly addresses many \nof the major points of contention among the members of the Senate. It \nis in that same spirit of bipartisanship that I hope the Conference \nReport will be crafted. If the Conference Committee will follow the \nSenate Finance Committee's lead and work to build bipartisan support \nfor the Conference Report, I am confident that the American people will \nfinally receive the tax relief they deserve.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Restoring \nEarnings to Lift Individuals and Empower Families Act of 2001. This tax \npackage provides some needed tax relief to the people of Louisiana. In \naddition, it represents a bipartisan compromise by the committee \nmembers. I would like to thank the chairman of the committee, the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, and the ranking member, from Montana, \nfor their hard work in developing a tax relief package that tries to \naddress the concerns and priorities of the people of our Nation.\n  While there is not a consensus on how to provide tax relief, there is \nconsensus that the American people deserve a tax cut in the face of \nlarge projected surpluses. This package provides marginal income tax \nrate reductions, marriage penalty and estate tax relief, expands \nprovisions for the child tax credit, encourages savings, and rewards \nadoption. The benefits of these provisions are not balanced in the way \nthat I would like to see, but, of course, that is the nature of \ncompromise. However, some of the tax cut initiatives included provide \nreal relief to people who really need it, working families, struggling \nto make ends meet.\n  Louisianians work hard to provide for their families. Our State has \nan average income of $30,000 a year. In addition, 90 percent of all \nLouisiana households earn less than $75,000. I believe that the \nproposal before us now, the Senate RELIEF package, distributes benefits \nmore fairly to the average taxpayer and middle-income families than the \ntax plan initially proposed by President Bush, and far better than the \nbills supported by the House Leadership.\n  This bill has many of the elements that will make a real difference \nto many Americans and Louisianians. Among these compromise elements are \nmarriage penalty relief, and reform and eventual repeal of the estate \ntax, which I have voted for in the past and continue to support. In \naddition, this package provides necessary broad-based income rate \nreductions including the creation of a new 10 percent rate, and a \ndoubling of the child tax credit to $1,000, to strengthen families.\n  When fully phased-in, the average Louisianian can expect to receive a \ntax cut anywhere from $300 to $500 a year. But more importantly, the \neffect of the new refundable child credit could offset much of the \npayroll and excise taxes that affect many Louisiana families. For \nexample, a married couple with two children earning $20,000 could \nreceive a tax benefit of as much as $2,000. That is a real saving that \ncould make a substantial difference for many families.\n  In representing the people of Louisiana, my commitment has been to \nfiscal discipline, tax code fairness, debt reduction, and tax relief. \nLouisianians and Americans of all income levels deserve the significant \ntax relief included in the $1.35 trillion tax cut package now being \nconsidered by Congress. So, while I support tax cuts, I also support an \namendment that provides an insurance policy against returning to \ndeficit spending, a trigger mechanism. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan repeatedly has stated in recent months his support for a \ntrigger mechanism.\n  Through this trigger mechanism, the goal is to enact tax relief in a \nfiscally responsible way that protects against the depletion of the \nSocial Security and Medicare surpluses, and allows for true debt \nreduction. The trigger creates a safety mechanism to address the \npossibility of either fiscally irresponsible tax cuts or ``budget \nbusting'' Federal spending increases that would lead the nation back to \na period of budget deficits and mounting public debt. Under such a \ntrigger, tax relief would continue to be phased-in while specified debt \nreduction targets are met. If Congress falls short of those targets, \nthe trigger would delay the implementation of new spending and tax \nreduction proposals until those debt reduction targets are back on \nschedule. The trigger mechanism will not cancel out or hamper the $1.35 \ntrillion tax cut package. It will instead strengthen and increase the \ncertainty of the tax relief by ensuring fiscal discipline.\n  I have also offered an amendment on behalf of myself and Senator \nCraig. The adoption tax credit amendment will truly encourage \nparenthood through adoption, and in the long run, reduce the costs to \ntaxpayers. It provides a permanent expansion of the credit to $10,000 \nfor both special needs and non-special needs adoptions for families \nwith incomes up to $190,000. Removing children from long term foster \ncare is a great benefit to society because it reduces the possibility \nthat these children will develop costly social problems; such as drug \ndependence or criminal involvement. This delinquency comes at a high \ncost to the taxpayer. Our amendment enjoys wide bipartisan support, and \nshould be included in the final package passed by the Senate.\n  While I support many of the measures in this tax relief package, I \nshould add that there are provisions that I find very troubling. This \ntax cut is back loaded, with many of the costs exploding after the 10-\nyear budget window. The repeal of the estate tax, only one provision of \nthis tax bill, has been estimated to cost at least $145 billion in the \neleventh year alone. In the long run, over the next 15 to 20 years, the \nrevenue cost of the total tax package could be as high as $5 trillion. \nThis is an enormous drain on Federal revenues, greatly reducing our \nability to pay down our debt and provide strategic investments \nnecessary for our economic growth.\n  Another concern is the lack of immediate marriage penalty relief, a \nprovision that would benefit many families in Louisiana. This is \nunfortunate, because married couples treated unfairly by the tax code \ndeserve a speedy remedy. In addition, Education Savings Accounts \nestablished in the tax bill are costly and, in my opinion, are an \ninefficient use of these funds given the great need of new investments \nnecessary to support essential education reform efforts underway in \nLouisiana and across\n\n[[Page S5516]]\n\nthe Nation. We need to target more of our federal revenue to poorer, \nmoderate-income, and disadvantaged school districts to the level the \nplaying field of opportunity and to truly ensure that no child is left \nbehind.\n  Despite these concerns, the package does provide tax relief that is \nwarranted due to the large projected surplus. That is why I rise to \nsupport this compromise tax relief package.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the reconciliation \nbill currently pending before the Senate.\n  Although this bill is far from perfect, I do not think there is a \nmember of the Senate who would not have drafted a different bill giving \ndifferent weight to different provisions if given the opporutnity. It \nrepresents a compromise on a very difficult set of issues and does, in \nsome areas, make progress.\n  While it does not provide the immediate economic stimulus I would \nlike, for example, it does afford a wage earner providing for his or \nher family who makes less than $45,000 a tax cut of $300 this year, and \n$600 next year. Additionally, although not phased-in as fast as I would \nlike, the changes this bill makes to the marriage penalty and the child \ntax credit provisions will allow a working couple to avoid paying the \nmarriage penalty simply for getting married, and provide them with \nchild tax credits when they have children.\n  The President requested a $1.6 trillion tax cut over ten years. This \nreconciliation bill will cost $1.35 trillion, still a sizable amount, \nover 11 years, including $100 billion for economic stimulus.\n  This bill contains several provisions which I believe are important \nto assure the continued long-term economic health of the American \neconomy and which will benefit many hard-working American families: It \ncontains the creation of a new, retroative, 10-percent tax bracket \nwhich has the effect of benefitting every single American who pays \nincome taxes. Most of the benefit of the 10 percent bracket goes to \npeople who earn less than $75,000 a year. It contains an across-the-\nboard tax cut, including reductions in the upper brackets. \nSignificantly, this legislation does not go as far as the President's \nproposal. The 39.6 percent bracket, for example, will fall only to 36 \npercent, not the 33 percent the President wanted. This is a fair \ncompormise. It provides significant marriage penalty relief although \nthat does not go into effect until 2005. Marriage penalty makes sense \nfor social reasons: It reinforces the important institutions of family \nand marriage. It eliminates what many of us see as a vast inconsistency \nin our tax law. The marriage penalty simply makes no sense: Two people \nshould not find that they pay more in taxes if they are married than if \nthey stay single. Although not phased-in as quickly as many of us would \nlike, this bill will eliminate this problem for many couples who now \nfind they face a marriage penalty. I hope that the Conference Committee \nwould find a way to implement this reform earlier than 2005.\n  It provides significant estate tax reform and repeal. I have long \nheld that people should not be forced to pay a tax simply because of \nthe death of a parent or spouse. In all too many instances under the \ncurrent estate tax families are forced to sell a primary residence or \ngo deeply into debt to hold on to a family farm or business simply \nbecause of the estate tax triggered by the death of a loved one. This \nlegislation will first raise the unified credit to $4 million and lower \nestate tax rates and, then, in 2011, repeal the estate tax. Estate \nassets will not escape taxation under this approach. Rather they will \nbe taxed at a stepped-up capital gains rate of 20 percent if and when a \nfamily chooses to sell them. This will allow families to keep the \nfamily home, business, or farm and, I believe, represents real progress \non this issue.\n  This is especially important for California because of high land and \nproperty costs. Under the present estate tax, the heir of a $3 million \nestate which includes a home or business or farm could pay $700,000, or \n45 percent of the taxable estate value of $1.7 million in estate taxes, \ndue immediately. In future years, because of astronomic increases in \nland and property values, this will affect many more Californians than \nin the past. A child who does not have the cash to pay the tax may be \nforced to sell the family home, business, or farm. I cannot support a \ntax where rates are so high that they force an heir to sell their \ninheritance simply to pay the tax on it, especially in the case of \nfarms or businesses where taxes have already been paid on the income \nwhich was used to purchase the asset.\n  This reconciliation bill expands the tax credit for families with \nchildren from $500 to $1,000 per child; increases the amount of the \ncredit that is partly refundable so lower income families can benefit; \nand it expands and simplifies the earned-income tax credit so it is \navailable to many more low-income working families than it is today. \nFor example, under the current rules a family with one child would have \nto earn at least $14,000 to have a fully refundable credit of $600. \nThis bill will extend the credit to families with incomes of $10,000.\n\n  It provides incentives for parents to set aside money for their \nchildren's future education by expanding the education savings accounts \ncontribution limit from $500 to $2,000; extends the employer-provided \ntuition assistance credit to encourage employers to help employees \ncontinue their education; and helps college students pay off their \nstudent loans by eliminating the 60-month limit on deductibility of \nstudent loan interest.\n  It includes pension provisions to provide an incentive for people to \nsave for their retirement, including increasing the contribution limits \nfor IRAs from $2,000 to $5,000 by 2011; increasing 401(k) contribution \nlimits from $10,500 to $15,000 in 2010; and includes provisions to help \nprovide retirement fairness for women, including allowing ``catch up'' \ncontributions to retirement plans for individuals over age 50.\n  It includes a down payment towards fixing the Alternative Minimum \nTax, AMT, problem, an issue that is projected to mushroom by 2010. More \nneeds to be done to make sure that middle class families do not find \nthat because of the AMT they do not receive the benefits promised under \nthis tax cut package. But I am pleased that in taking this first step \nthe Senate has recognized that this is a big problem, especially for \nstates like California, and I look forward to continuing to work with \nmy colleagues in the years ahead to fix this problem before it develops \ninto a genuine crisis.\n  I have had two concerns about this approach taken in this \nlegislation, however. First, that the costs of this tax bill after 2011 \nmay be quite high--as much as $3 to $4 trillion by some estimates.\n  That is why it was critical, for me to be able to support this \nlegislation, that the ``sunset'' provisions remained in place and that \nthe provisions included in this bill expire in 2011.\n  Although I fully expect that Congress will extend many, if not all, \nof these provisions, this provides us a critical opportunity to make a \nmid-course correction if, 10 years from now, a different approach on \nthese issues is called for.\n  Second, I want to make sure that the tax cuts we are considering here \ntoday will not endanger the projected surpluses or undo the hard work \nand hard choices of the past decade which have allowed us to eliminate \ndeficits and pay down the debt.\n  That is why I supported the amendment offered by Senators Bayh and \nSnowe to create a ``trigger mechanism'' which will allow us to slow-\ndown the phase in of some of these tax provisions should we not meet \nour debt reduction goals. Although this bipartisan amendment narrowly \nfailed, I think that it sends an important message about our commitment \nto fiscal responsibility.\n  On the whole I think that the bill pending before the Senate today \nrepresents a fair compromise on a most contentious issue.\n  Today we are voting on a $1.35 trillion package, some $150 billion \nmore than the Senate approved in the budget amendment last month with \n65 votes, but still a fair package with many positive elements. So let \nthere be no mistake: This is a large bill, and represents a major \nchange in the tax system. As this reconciliation bill goes to \nconference, it is my sincere hope that the conferees understand that \nfor myself, and, I believe, many of my colleagues, the package that we \nare voting on here today represents what we consider to be fair and \nbalanced, and\n\n[[Page S5517]]\n\nthat we would have considerable difficulty supporting any changes which \nmay threaten to upset this balance.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this reconciliation \nbill.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Holocaust \nVictims Tax Fairness amendment, No. 670, to H.R. 1836, which I offered \nlast Thursday, and which was approved by the Senate yesterday by voice \nvote.\n  I would like to thank Senators Schumer, Jeffords, Clinton, McCain, \nTorricelli, Domenici, Allen, Durbin, Gordon Smith, Specter, Bill \nNelson, Bingaman, Corzine, DeWine, Leahy, Collins, and Feinstein for \ncosponsoring my amendment.\n  This year we mark the 56th anniversary of the end of the Holocaust. \nThere are as many as 10,000 Holocaust survivors in my home state of \nIllinois, and over 100,000 in the entire United States, with an average \nage over 80. It is imperative that Congress act as soon as possible to \nprevent the federal government from attempting to tax any restitution \nobtained by Holocaust survivors and their families because of their \npersecution by the Nazis.\n  Holocaust survivors and their families have lived through unspeakable \nhorrors. Three weeks ago, I attended a Holocaust Memorial Service at a \nsynagogue in Skokie, Illinois. After the formal proceedings were over, \nI spoke with a number of survivors of concentration camps, and heard \nwhat they were able to tell me about their dreadful experiences. One \nsurvivor of Auschwitz told me things she had never told her children. \nWhy? Because I was a United States Senator, and she felt she had to \ntell me so that the Holocaust would never be forgotten, even though \nremembering these horrors caused her indescribable pain.\n  The accounts of these survivors remind all of us that America has an \nobligation to continue to pursue justice and compensation for Holocaust \nvictims and their families.\n  My amendment, the Holocaust Victims Tax Fairness Act of 2001, would \nprevent the Federal Government from imposing the Federal income tax on \nHolocaust restitution or compensation payments that victims or their \nheirs may receive.\n  The IRS has indicated in various private letter rulings that certain \nrestitution money is exempt from the Federal income tax, but these \nrulings apply only to the specific individuals who received them, or to \nspecific settlement funds, not to all recipients of compensation and \nrestitution.\n  The U.S. Treasury Department has made clear that Federal legislation \nis needed to ensure that all compensation and restitution payments are \nprotected from unfair taxation. In fact, the Bush Administration \nTreasury Department supports my legislation, as did the Clinton \nAdministration last year. The Holocaust Victims Tax Fairness Act of \n2001 will provide certainty for elderly Holocaust survivors, thereby \nsparing them from having to navigate complex legal and bureaucratic \nprocesses.\n  More than 50 years after the end of World War II, many banks and \ncompanies in Europe are beginning to return stolen assets to survivors \nof the Holocaust and their heirs. In August of 1998, two of the largest \nbanks in Switzerland agreed to distribute $1.25 billion as restitution \nfor assets wrongfully withheld during the Nazi reign. And in February \nof 1999, the German government agreed to establish a fund to compensate \nvictims of the Holocaust.\n  This amendment ensures that the beneficiaries of these settlements \nand other Holocaust restitution or compensation arrangements can \nexclude the proceeds from taxable income on their Federal income tax \nforms. The measure also ensures that survivors and their families do \nnot lose their eligibility for federal or federally assisted need-based \nprograms when they receive Holocaust-related restitution or \ncompensation payments.\n  Those of us too young to have lived in those times can never know the \npain of the survivors. But we must learn from them. We who were born \nafter the war must commit ourselves to try our best to shoulder the \nresponsibility the survivors have carried for so long. While the \nrestitution settlements pale in comparison to what they have lost, this \nlegislation ensures that survivors and their families can keep all that \nis returned to them without being unnecessarily burdened by taxes or \nexcluded from need-based programs.\n  The Congress must send a clear message that to allow the federal \ngovernment to tax away any reparations obtained by Holocaust survivors \nor their families because of their persecution by the Nazis or their \nsympathizers is simply unacceptable. Given that the average age of \nHolocaust survivors now exceeds 80 years of age, we believe it is \nimperative that the Congress act now to prevent the Federal Government \nfrom attempting to tax this money.\n  Similar legislation was agreed to by the Senate as an amendment to \nthe Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999. The provision was retained in \nconference, but the final bill was vetoed, preventing this important \nmeasure regarding Holocaust restitution from becoming law.\n  My amendment improves significantly upon bills on this issue that \nwere introduced in the 106th Congress. For example, this amendment is \nmore carefully crafted to encompass all possible types of restitution \nand compensation that Holocaust survivors or their heirs may receive in \nthe coming years.\n  Furthermore, unlike previous versions, my legislation ensures that \nsurvivors and their families do not lose their eligibility for Federal \nor federally assisted need-based programs when they receive Holocaust-\nrelated restitution or compensation payments; this provision expands \nupon a 1994 law that protected only victims, not their heirs, from \nlosing benefits from need-based programs because of restitution \npayments. My legislation corrects this unfortunate omission in the 1994 \nlaw.\n  Finally, unlike previous versions, my amendment provides that the \ninitial tax basis of property returned to Holocaust victims or their \nheirs will be the fair market value of the property on the date of \nrecovery. This provision ensures that Holocaust survivors who receive \nin-kind, rather than cash, restitution do not have to pay tax on \ncapital gains if they immediately sell the property. Survivors should \nnot be unfairly penalized because they receive in-kind restitution; and \nthe Federal Government should not make one dime on Holocaust \nrestitution, whether the restitution is in cash or in kind.\n  This legislation has strong bipartisan support in Congress. Twenty \nSenators have already cosponsored S. 749, a bill I introduced last \nmonth that is identical to this amendment.\n  Many organizations that work to assist Holocaust survivors have \nendorsed the Holocaust Victims Tax Fairness Act of 2001, including the \nConference on Jewish Material Claims, the Anti-Defamation League, B'nai \nB'rith International, the American Jewish Committee, and the American \nGathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors-the largest organization of \nAmerican Holocaust survivors.\n  After over 50 years of injustice, Holocaust survivors and their \nfamilies are reclaiming what is rightfully theirs. Even as we support \nthese efforts to reclaim stolen property, we must do our part in \nprotecting the proceeds. I thank my colleagues in joining me in \nsupporting this amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I express my support for H.R. \n1836, the Tax Reconciliation Act of 2001. This bill is the largest \nincome tax relief bill in 20 years and I believe the American taxpayers \ndeserve and desire this legislation.\n  The Tax Reconciliation Act goes a long way to relieve taxpayers of an \nunfair tax burden. This bill provides: broad-based tax relief by \nreducing tax rates; family tax relief by addressing the Marriage \nPenalty Tax and by immediately increasing the Child Credit to $600; \n$150 billion to Estate Tax Relief and by repealing the Estate Tax by \n2011; $30 billion in education benefits and $40 billion in retirement \nand pension benefits, and by extending the availability of the child \ncredit under the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) and by increasing the \nAMT exemption amount.\n  I am particularly interested in the estate tax relief because again \nthis year I introduced the Estate and Gift Tax Rate Reduction Act of \n2001, S. 31. Estate and gift taxes remain an unfair burden on American \nfamilies, particularly those who pursue the American dream of owning \ntheir own business. Why should family-owned businesses and farms be hit \nwith the highest tax rate when they are handed down to descendants--\noften immediately following the death of a loved one? These\n\n[[Page S5518]]\n\ntaxes, and the financial burdens and difficulties they create come at \nthe worst possible time. Making a terrible situation worse is the fact \nthat the rate of this estate tax is crushing, reaching as high as 55 \npercent for the highest bracket. That is higher than even the highest \nincome tax rate bracket of 39 percent.\n  Furthermore, the tax is due as soon as the business is turned over to \nthe heir, allowing little time for financial planning or the setting \naside of money to pay unscheduled tax bills. Estate and gift taxes \nright now are one of the leading reasons why the number of family-owned \nfarms and businesses are declining. Quite simply, the burden of this \ntax is just too much.\n  This tax sends the troubling message that families should either sell \nthe business while they are still alive in order to spare their \ndescendants this huge tax after their passing, or allow the value of \nthe business to decline, so that it won't make it into their higher tax \nbrackets. Whichever the case may be, it hardly seems to encourage \nprivate investment and initiative, which have always been such a strong \npart of our American heritage.\n  I am pleased that the bill before us takes the important step of \naddressing this unfair burden. I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues for the complete elimination of the death tax.\n  I have heard people say that the cost of this bill is too great--that \nwe can't afford it at this time. But I think since we now have a \nbalanced budget and a significant surplus, then the American people \ndeserve this tax relief and they deserve it now. The American people \nhave earned this tax relief.\n  I know that $1.35 trillion is a lot of money, but we have over a $3 \ntrillion surplus and one reason we have a $3 trillion surplus is the \ntaxpayers got their taxes raised too much. If the American people \noverpaid, then the American people should get their money back--that is \njust fair.\n  The Tax Reconciliation Act of 2001 is the largest middle-class tax \nrelief in twenty years and I think it is high time the hard-working \ntaxpayer get this relief. I support this legislation and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have engaged in a very hard-fought \nbattle on the Senate floor since last Thursday. Some would say that \nthis has been a partisan battle, and in many ways it has been a good \npartisan battle. If you look at the series of amendments that we have \nconsidered these past few days, you will see a fundamental \nphilosophical division between the majority of both parties in the \nSenate.\n  The Republicans have stood firmly for the proposition that the \nAmerican people have been overtaxed and deserve a partial refund of the \nhuge $5.6 trillion surplus that is expected to accumulate over the next \n10 years. We are not saying all of the surplus should be returned to \nthe American taxpayer, but a modest portion--25 percent deservedly \nbelongs to hard working American families. The remainder will be used \nto preserve and protect Social Security; enhance Medicare and pay down \nthe national debt.\n  On the other hand, the Democrats have come up with dozens of \namendments that reduce the size and scope of tax cut in order to \npromote more federal spending. In fact, I think one amendment offered \nby the senior Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, pretty much sums up the \nphilosophy of the Democratic Party. That amendment provided that if \nGovernment discretionary spending went beyond the amounts set forth in \nthe budget resolution, then the Secretary of the Treasury would be \nrequired to raise the top marginal rates paid by individuals.\n  In other words, let the Congress spend as much of the taxpayers' \nmoney as it pleases, with no discipline, no limits and then pay for \nthat spending with administrative tax increases. Thus if Congress \nspends $200 billion more than budgeted, the Treasury Secretary simply \ncan push a button and the top marginal rate could be 50 percent or 60 \npercent of whatever it takes to pay for wasteful spending.\n  Fortunately, that unconstitutional amendment was defeated, though 41 \nof the 50 Democrats supported the concept of this unconstitutional \ndelegation of taxing authority and the lifting of all discipline or \nspending.\n  That said, the final bill before us is a bipartisan measure that will \nbring much needed tax relief to nearly every taxpayer in the country. \nAnd for more than 10 million individuals and families with no income \ntax liability, they will receive a rebate of payroll taxes; 19 million \nof the 64 million individuals and families with a top income tax rate \nof 15 percent will now have a top rate of 10 percent. And that tax cut \nis immediate and retroactive to January 1, of this year.\n  More than 30 million families will benefit from the increased child \ncredit, 10 million of whom will receive a refundable child credit. Over \nmore than 40 million couples will benefit from the marriage penalty \nrelief contained in the bill and small businesses, the engine of growth \nin this country, will now be able to preserve their family assets \nwithout the threat that the government will force the business' breakup \nbecause of the punitive death tax.\n  For Alaska Natives, the bill contains a provision that will allow \nAlaska Native Corporations to establish settlement trusts. This is only \nfair. These tribal corporations, unlike lower-48 tribes, are required \nto pay income taxes. Settlement trusts will allow them to invest some \nof their earnings for the future social benefit of their members.\n  And for the many employees who work in the building and construction \ntrades, the bill includes a provision that will allow them to receive \npensions that better reflect the pension agreements their unions \nnegotiated as part of multi-employer agreements.\n  This is a fair and balanced tax cut. I would have preferred we would \nhave cut taxes even more, as the President proposed. But the step we \ntake tonight marks the first major tax cut for all Americans in 20 \nyears. I commend the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nGrassley, and the ranking member, Senator Baucus, for their diligence \nand hard work in achieving this important relief for the American \ntaxpayer.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 896, the Restoring \nEarnings to Lift Individuals and Empower Families, or RELIEF Act of \n2001. It is time we ease the tax burden on all American taxpayers and \nreturn part of the surplus to the people who created it.\n  The legislation before us will benefit American taxpayers and improve \nour Nation's economy. The provisions of the RELIEF Act of 2001 include \nacross-the-board rate reductions for all Americans, repeal of the death \ntax, reduction of the marriage penalty, doubling of the child credit, \nand increased incentives for retirement savings and education. This \nlegislation incorporates some good principles of tax policy, such as \nencouraging investment, strengthening families, and rewarding savings. \nIt takes an important step in the right direction toward a tax policy \nmore worthy of a great nation.\n  The RELIEF Act of 2001 will encourage economic growth and \nproductivity by strengthening America's small businesses. Small \nbusinesses are the backbone of the American economy. They represent \nover 99 percent of all employers in America and employ half of \nAmerica's private workforce.\n  Small business creates 80 percent of all new jobs in America and \naccounts for bout 38 percent of the gross domestic product and half of \nthe gross business product. Because of their ability to adapt quickly \nto changing market conditions, small businesses are nearly the sole \nsource of job growth during times of economic recession. In short, if \nwe want to provide a stimulus to the present economy, we should do all \nwe can as soon as we can to help America's small businesses.\n  The legislation before us will greatly help small businesses. First, \nit kills the death tax. It should come as no surprise to anyone that \nthe death tax is one of the most destructive taxes to small businesses. \nIn one foul swoop, this tax can demolish the work of several \ngenerations of entrepreneurs.\n  The death tax rewards savings and investment with crippling tax rates \nthat all too often force families to sell off their businesses just to \npay their bill to the IRS. The death tax is a punitive tax on families \nby penalizing them for trying to pass on their life's labor to their \nchildren. I am pleased that this legislation axes the death tax and \nsends it to its grave where it belongs.\n\n[[Page S5519]]\n\n  Secondly, the RELIEF Act of 2001 will help stimulate the economy by \nempowering small businesses in their effort to provide more jobs, \ninvest in their physical facilities, and develop new products that will \nbenefit American consumers and our Nation as a whole. it is important \nfor everyone to understand that most small business owners file their \ntaxes as individuals. Most do not file as traditional C-corporations, \nbut rather organize as sole proprietorships, partnerships, S-\ncorporations or some other structure that allows them to file their \ntaxes using the tax rates for individuals. Each and every one of these \n``flow through'' businesses that has positive income will benefit from \nthe tax relief before us.\n  I would like to give my colleagues and the American people an idea of \nthe number of small-business owners who would benefit under the rate \nreductions in the legislation before us.\n\n  There are nearly 17\\1/2\\ million individuals who had income from sole \nproprietorships in 1999, the last year for which we have complete data. \nEach one of these 17\\1/2\\ million people will receive tax relief under \nthis legislation. These might be retailers, dentists, general \ncontractors, accountants, or people employed in any other number of \noccupations that provide the goods and services that we use every day.\n  I should mention that these numbers only include taxpayers who had \nincome from non-farm sole proprietorships and does not include business \nowners who may organize using other business entities, such as \npartnerships or S-Corporations. If we added in the people who file the \nschedule F for farm income and those who file schedule E for \npartnership income, the total would probably be in the neighborhood of \n24 million. Since we don't have that data broken down by States, we \nwill consider those small business owners who file as sole \nproprietorships. Keep in mind that the 17\\1/2\\ million is really the \nfloor rather than the ceiling of small business owners who will benefit \nfrom the rate reductions in this bill.\n  To give people an idea of how this tax bill will benefit their \nconstituents, I would like to share some of the numbers from individual \nStates. In my home State of Wyoming, there were 38,000 people with \nsmall business income in 1999. By passing this tax relief, each and \nevery one of these business owners would have more money to put into \ntheir businesses and benefit the economy as a whole.\n  Here is how this often works in the real world. Many of these \nbusinesses have a profit on paper which effectively puts these business \nowners into the highest tax bracket for any given year. If they didn't \nhave to pay 40 percent of their income to the Federal Government, they \nwould use this invest this money into their business by buying more \ninventory, building, remodeling, or re-tooling their physical \nfacilities.\n  Many of these businesses would use this money for testing, research \nand development of new products and technology which would in time \ngreatly benefit the economy as a whole. In my home State of Wyoming, \neach of our 38,000 business owners are making a great contribution to \nour local communities and it is time we let them keep a little more of \ntheir own money so they can grow their businesses rather than grow the \npork in the Federal budget.\n  If you look at the other States, you will find that they also have \nsignificant number of small business owners who will benefit under the \ntax relief before us.\n  Montana has 76,000 business owners who would benefit from this tax \nrelief. Like Wyoming, many of these are Main Street businesses which \nform the backbone of the economy in our small towns and help perpetuate \nthe western way of life.\n  Colorado has 329,000 business owners who would benefit from this tax \nrelief. Nebraska has 117,000 small business owners who would see their \nincomes rise from this tax relief. When you include the number of small \nbusiness owners who operate farms, I expect this number would be \nconsiderable higher.\n  Similarly, 486,000 small business owners in Georgia would find more \nmoney in their pockets if we pass the RELIEF Act of 2001.\n\n  I have heard the criticism from some on the other side of the aisle \nthat this tax cut is too tilted toward the rich. Some have said that \nthe President's proposal would give millionaires the money to buy a new \nLexus while it would only allow middle income people money to buy a new \nmuffler. I really don't know what world they are living in, but I find \nit interesting that most of the people who are making these claims \ndon't have any experience owning or operating a small business.\n  I have heard a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nexpress great concern about the number of mega-mergers between \nmultinational corporations over the past several years. They have \nargued that these businesses continue to swallow up their smaller \ncompetitors in many of our communities and all too often have the \neffect of eliminating any real local competition. As a former small \nbusiness owner, I am very sympathetic to these concerns.\n  My experience has taught me that the small, locally owned family \nbusinesses are much more likely to be active in their community. These \nare the businesses that constantly donate their goods and services to \nlocal charities, schools, and civic organizations in an effort to make \ntheir towns better places to live. Small business owners live in the \nsame communities where they sell their products or offer their services \nand this is generally not true of the large, multinational \ncorporations. Since most small businesses pay taxes under the \nindividual rates, this legislation takes an important step in leveling \nthe playing field with their large competitors.\n  In short, if members of the U.S. Senate want to take one action this \nyear that can greatly aid in the survival of America's more than 17\\1/\n2\\ million small businesses, they should vote for this tax relief \nlegislation. Members will not have a better opportunity this year to \nregister their support for America's Main Street business owners than \nthe RELIEF Act of 2001.\n  It is important to understand that we need to lower all the marginal \nrates to benefit our small businesses. According to treasury data, \nnearly two-thirds of the taxpayers who would benefit from lowering the \ntop income tax rate are small business owners and entrepreneurs. \nContrary to the stereotypes too often painted by the far left, most of \nthe taxpayers in the top income tax bracket are not the idle rich.\n  Now I have a little experience in owning and operating a small \nbusiness. I owned operated a Main Street shoe store in Gillette, WY, \nfor 26 years with my wife and our three children. Let me tell you, when \nI got a tax cut, I did not go out and buy a Lexus. I would take that \nmoney and make improvements to my store so that my business would be \nmore successful in the future and I would be better able to provide the \nservices and products that would benefit my family and my community.\n\n  I wonder how these 17\\1/2\\ million small-business owners would feel \nif we told them ``you can't have a tax cut, because we don't trust you \nto spend your own money. You might just waste that tax cut on a luxury \ncar. You better let us keep that money in Washington so we can continue \nto increase the size and scope of the Federal Government and have a \nlittle more control over every aspect of your lives.'' I don't know who \nmy colleagues are talking with, but I trust the more than 38,000 small-\nbusiness owners in my State to use their own money as they see fit.\n  America's taxpayers are long overdue for a return of their surplus. \nAmericans are shouldering the highest peacetime tax burden in our \nNation's history. Both the level of taxation and our underlying tax \npolicy are unjust and in desperate need of reform. For too long, we \nhave punished marriage and savings, discouraged innovation and job \ngrowth, and punished the same small business owners that deserve much \nof the credit for our economic success over the past decade.\n  It is time we listen to the more than 17\\1/2\\ million small business \nowners spread throughout our States, and our communities. It is they \nwho will benefit from the RELIEF Act of 2001, and they in turn will \nhelp us by providing many of the goods and services that we will use \nevery day.\n  The RELIEF Act of 2001, will benefit every American taxpayer by \nallowing them to keep some of their own money. It will stimulate the \nAmerican economy by rewarding entrepreneurship and job creation. It \nrespects marriage\n\n[[Page S5520]]\n\nand the family. It encourages savings and investment. It gives \nAmericans greater freedom over their incomes and their futures. I \napplaud Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus for their hard work in \nwriting this legislation and bringing it before the Senate today. We \nshould enact this legislation with all deliberate speed. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the RELIEF Act of 2001.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bipartisan tax cut \npackage which passed the Finance Committee on Tuesday.\n  I first want to thank and commend Chairman Grassley and Ranking \nMember Baucus for working so closely together to build a principled \nconsensus one that not only brings this pressing issue to the floor in \na timely fashion, but will also ultimately benefit the people of this \nnation. They have worked tirelessly for a fair and balanced tax cut \nbill, and I believe they have achieved that goal.\n  Inevitability, none of us will agree with everything in this bill. \nSome will wish we had done more, some less. But that is the sign of \ntrue compromise.\n  It is not about any one of us getting everything we would like. It's \nabout making a judgment as to whether the preponderance of the measures \nin a given bill works for the good of the country. That is how the \nprocess should function--however difficult that process may be, and \nhowever much it may require us as individuals to compromise on facets \nof the bill we would prefer to be different.\n  We cannot allow the gears of the deliberative process to become \njammed with the monkey-wrench of absolutism. This is not the time to \nretreat into the false haven of ideological absolutes. Especially in \nthese perilous economic times, we cannot let personal or partisan \ndifferences get in the way of passing a fair and meaningful tax cut. Of \ncourse we have an obligation to speak our minds and to make changes \nwhere and when we can. But we also have an obligation to heed the \nwarning signs our economy is sending.\n  I think everyone has probably had the opportunity to read at least a \nnumber of the myriad articles on the state of the economy. One Business \nWeek article spoke of a terrible first quarter, stating that ``the \nearnings of the 900 companies on Business Week's Corporate Scoreboard \nplummeted 25 percent from a year earlier . . . The first quarter profit \nplunge was the Scoreboard's sharpest quarterly drop since the 1990-91 \nrecession.''\n  Productivity fell at a 0.1 percent annual rate in the first quarter--\nthe first quarterly drop in 6 years. And layoffs are at their highest \nlevels since they were first tracked in 1993, with major corporations \nannouncing more than 572,000 job cuts this year. Little wonder, then, \nthat the unemployment rate has risen to 4.5 percent, with April's job \nloss the largest since February 1991.\n  Even more ominous is Business Week's recent observation that if wide \nlayoffs of high wage earners continue, the likelihood of recession \nbecomes even greater.\n  And the Washington Post noted recently that Federal Reserve cuts in \ninterest rates have been the most aggressive since the second quarter \nof 1982--the worst recession since the Great Depression--and that \nobservation came before the most recent half-percent rate cut. We \ncannot ignore these economic storm clouds that may portend negative \nconsequences for American workers as well as our economic future.\n  And while it is true that a tax cut may not actually prevent a \nrecession, if one is in the offing, I well remember the words of \nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who came before the Finance \nCommittee in January.\n  Chairman Greenspan stated that tax cuts, while perhaps not having an \nimmediate effect, could act as ``insurance'' should our recent downturn \nprove to be more than an inventory correction . . . that it could \nsoften the landing and shorten the duration of any recession should it \noccur. Again, there are ominous clouds on the horizon, and let's keep \nthis in mind as well--``blue chip'' economists have indicated just this \nweek that they are factoring the tax cut in their projections.\n  In fact, if there is one concern I have with this package, it's that, \ngiven our growing economic uncertainty and the grim repercussions it \ncould have, we need to do even more this year to get money into the \nhands of taxpayers and to get the economy back on track.\n  I know there is an ongoing discussion about whether the best way to \ndo this is to adjust the withholding tables as this bill envisions, or \nto issue checks directly to taxpayers. In the end, I think that \nwhatever method best gets this into taxpayers hands--be it accelerated \nwithholding, sending checks, or a combination of the two--is an \nimperative and I would urge the conferees to develop such a plan as \nthey craft the conference report.\n  The fact of the matter is, the case for cuts has never been more \ncompelling--it's an issue of our economic health and well-being, and \nit's an issue of fairness for the American taxpayer--who shouldered the \nburden of the debt and created the surplus in the first place.\n  As a percent of GDP, Federal taxes are at their highest level, 20.6 \npercent, since 1944--and all previous record levels occurred during \ntime of war or during the devastating recession of the early-1980s, \nwhen interest rates exceeded 20 percent and the highest marginal tax \nrate was 70 percent.\n  The fact of the matter is, it would be irresponsible not to return a \nreasonable portion of the surplus--which is really just an overpayment \nin the form of taxes--to the American taypayer. And there should be no \nmistake--if we fail to pass a meaningful relief package, we will fail \nboth working families and the economy upon which their work depends.\n  And let us not forget that this package is nearly 25 percent smaller \nthan was proposed by President Bush in his budget. Let us not forget \nthat it will utilize less than one-half of the projected surplus over \nthe coming 10 years, 45.7 percent, excluding both Social Security and \nMedicare surpluses.\n  In fact, even with a $1.25 trillion tax cut over the coming ten \nyears, we will still have about $1.5 trillion available for other \npriorities, including the funding of a new prescription drug benefit \nand additional debt reduction. Mr. President, this package is neither \nunreasonable nor irresponsible.\n  As to the issue that's been raised of ``backloading'' the tax cuts in \nthis bill, as the chart behind me demonstrates, the structure of the \ntax package is phased-in to reflect the flow of surpluses projected to \naccrue over the coming ten years.\n  Specifically, during the first 5 years, when the non-Social Security \nand non-Medicare surpluses are smaller, the tax cut is also smaller. In \nlater years, as the surpluses grow, the tax cut grows as well. The \nalternative is to phase-in the tax cuts more rapidly and dip into the \nSocial Security and Medicare surpluses--not an option at all in my \nbook.\n  Just as importantly, many of us fought hard to ensure that the \nbenefits of this tax cut package will be weighted toward those who need \nrelief the most--middle and lower-income taxpayers.\n  We have before us a thoughtful proposal that addresses concerns I, \nmyself, had with the distributional effects of the original package. \nAnd it does so in a variety of meaningful ways--retroactively creating \na new ``10 percent'' bracket . . . providing much-needed AMT relief for \nmiddle-income families . . . and ensuring marriage penalty relief for \nall couples while bolstering the Earned Income Tax Credit program by \nproviding $22.5 billion over the duration of the package.\n  And we didn't stop there. The bipartisan education package that the \nFinance Committee reported in March is included in this bill, along \nwith a new deduction of up to $5,000 for higher education tuition paid, \nand a new credit of up to $500 for interest paid on student loans--\nprovisions that I have sought along with Senators Torricelli and \nSchumer.\n  With the cost of college quadrupling over the past 20 years--a rate \nnearly twice as fast as inflation--and with students borrowing as much \nduring the 1990s as during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s combined, these \nprovisions will provide critical assistance to individuals and families \ngrappling with higher education costs.\n  It also includes the bipartisan IRA and pension package--introduced \nseparately by Senators Grassley and Baucus that will not only \nstrengthen and improve access to pensions and IRAs, but also enhance \nfairness for women who frequently leave the workforce\n\n[[Page S5521]]\n\nduring prime earnings years, and suffer from reduced retirement savings \naccordingly.\n  And finally, no package could truly be said to produce fairness \nwithout including a refundable child tax credit. That is why I worked \nwith Senators Lincoln, Jeffords, Kerry and Breaux--as well as both the \nchairman and ranking member--to include a provision that builds on the \nPresident's proposal to double the $500 per child tax credit by making \nit refundable to those earning $10,000 or more, retroactive to the \nbeginning of this year.\n  This is introducing a wholly new concept with respect to that child \ntax credit, and one that is most assuredly warranted. For the first \ntime we will provide and expand benefits to minimum wage earners.\n  How will this help? In its original form, the tax relief plan would \nnot have reached all full-time workers--the tax reduction would have \ndisappeared for wage-earners with net incomes of less than about \n$22,000. Indeed, without refundability, there are almost 16 million \nchildren whose families would not benefit from the doubling of the \nChild Tax Credit. To give an idea of how many children we're really \ntalking about, that is about twice the population of New York City or \nabout 13 times the entire population of my home state of Maine.\n  Thanks to the changes we have made, the bill now provides a \nsubstantial tax credit to a total of 37 million families and 55 million \nchildren nationwide who might otherwise have gained no benefit from the \nproposal to simply double the per-child credit.\n  Many of these are families earning minimum wage, struggling to make \nends meet in addition to paying their share of State and local taxes, \npayroll taxes, gasoline taxes, phone taxes, sales taxes, and property \ntaxes. All told, the average full-time worker earning the minimum wage \npays more than $1,530 in payroll taxes, and more than $300 in Federal \nexcise taxes.\n  This is no small burden to working families already living on the \nfiscal edge. In fact, despite America's strong economy, one in six \nchildren live in poverty, and the number of low-income children living \nwith a working parent continues to climb. My provision that is included \nin this bill to make the child tax credit refundable will give these \nfamilies a hand up as they strive for self-sufficiency, and give these \nkids the hope of a childhood without poverty.\n  The partially refundable credit will provide a benefit of up to 15 \ncents for every dollar earned above a $10,000 per year threshold. In \nreal terms, this year, a working family with one child and an income of \n$13,000 would be eligible for a refundable credit of $450; and a family \nwith an income of $14,000 would qualify for the full $600 credit.\n  As tax reductions and the child tax credit are phased in over 10 \nyears, the maximum allowable refundable credit will rise from $500 to \n$600 this year, increasing to $1,000 by 2011. Families with more than \none child would also receive a refundable credit based on their income.\n  Will this tax relief solve all the financial problems faced by \neligible families? No. But it will help to purchase essentials, like \ngroceries, heating fuel, or electricity. And it sends an important \nmessage of encouragement that we want those who work hard and strive to \nimprove their lives to succeed. Refundability shows that tax relief is \nfor all full-time working families.\n  With these kinds of adjustments, we take a critical first step in \nensuring that the balance of this package in its totality will help \nlower and middle income taxpayers.\n  In fact, in looking at the various analyses of the changes we made to \nthe package, the Joint Tax Committee estimates that those earning less \nthan $50,000 will see their share of Federal taxes drop from 14.3 \npercent under current law to 13.8 percent in 2006.\n  Indeed, the largest reductions in the effective tax rates will apply \nto those in the $20,000 to $40,000 range. Conversely, in 2006--the \nfifth year of implementation--the share of federal taxes paid by those \nwith incomes of $100,000 or more will increase from 58.4 percent to 59 \npercent.\n  Moreover, as a result of the refundability of the child tax credit, \naccording to Joint Tax, those in the $10,000 to $20,000 income range \nwill see their share of federal taxes reduced from 1.5 percent to 1.3 \npercent--a reduction of $3 billion. And by 2006, this level is down to \n1.1 percent.\n  If you look at upper income brackets, and I know there are those who \nstill have concerns with the top one percent, according to Citizens for \nTax Justice, this gives 19 percent of tax cuts to the top one percent \nwho pay 37 percent of taxes, as opposed to 31 percent in the \nPresident's original package.\n  And in terms of the overall package, it is worth noting that creation \nof the new 10 percent bracket alone accounts for $438.6 billion, while \nreductions in all other brackets amount to $397.3 billion--that's 52 \npercent of the cuts going to the lowest bracket, with 48 percent going \nto all others.\n  At the same time, the share of federal taxes paid by those with \nincomes of $50,000 to $100,000 will fall from 27.3 percent to 27.1 \npercent--and from 14.3 percent to 13.8 percent for those earning under \n$50,000. So yet again we've seen a shift in the weighting of the bill \naway from benefits for the higher income brackets.\n  As for the compromise we developed that results in a reduction of the \nuppermost bracket from 39.6 to 36 percent, it is worth noting that many \nindividuals in that bracket are small business owners whose business-\nrelated income is taxed as personal income.\n  According to the Treasury Department, in 2006, 63 percent of the tax \nreturns that would benefit from reducing marginal rates in the top two \nbrackets would be reporting some income or loss from a business. And in \nmy home state of Maine, for example, about 97 percent of all businesses \nare small business.\n  The reality is, small businesses have played a central role in our \nnation's economic expansion. From 1992 to 1996, for example, small \nfirms created 75 percent of new jobs--up 10.5 percent--while large-\ncompany employment grew by 3.7 percent. So why--when we're talking \nabout such a tremendous impact on individuals and the economy . . . \nwhen the top corporate tax rate is 35 percent--why should we continue \nmaking small business men and women pay so much more?\n  I think the American public often thinks about tax cuts the way they \nwould think of winning the lottery it would be great if it really \nhappened, but it in reality it really only happens for ``the other \nguy'' . . . that tax cuts will only apply to someone else . . . and if \nthey do happen, they'll be so small as to have no appreciable effect on \neveryday life.\n  Well, the American people should know that this tax cut applies to \neveryone, and especially those who could use the break the most. And \nthat's true not just on paper, but in reality--in the real world.\n  For example, a married couple with two children and $15,000 in income \nwill pay no income tax. They will receive $4,008 from the earned income \ntax credit--an increase of $402--and a benefit from the expanded per-\nchild tax credit of $600. That is over $1,000 extra in their pocket--\nthat's going to mean a lot to that family making $15,000 a year.\n  The point is, this is no phantom tax cut--this is real, this is \nbalanced, and this is fair. And what this all comes down to is, if you \nare really serious about cutting taxes, you should support this package \nthat begins the process of providing some relief given, once again, the \nstatus of our economy and the tax burden on the American people.\n  We know we are never going to get unanimity on an issue of this \nmagnitude. But we can have progress and we can come to some kind of \nconsensus. This package represents a bipartisan effort that, in the \naggregate, is good for our future and good for the American taxpayer \ntoday. And it deserves our support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider that vote and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Do we have an \nagreement to be in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. If the leader will permit. under the \nprevious order, the Senate insists on its amendments and requests a \nconference with the House of Representatives.\n  Under the previous order, the Chair now appoints Mr. Grassley, Mr. \nHatch, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Gramm of Texas, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \nRockefeller, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Breaux conferees on the part of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, even though the distinguished managers of \nthis legislation have just left the Chamber, I want to say once again, \nas I have earlier, I think we should congratulate our two managers, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, and the ranking \nDemocrat on the Finance Committee, Max Baucus. They have done yeoman's \nwork. There are a lot of us who say that the chairman and ranking \nmember of committees should always reach out and try to work together \nand find a way to have a bipartisan agreement. In this case, these two \ngentlemen have done it.\n  Perhaps there is not a total happiness with their agreement on either \nside. But this is the way it should work. I think they have come up \nwith a good package and they should be commended. We didn't set a \nrecord with a number of votes on a package of this nature, but we did \ndo 54 votes on amendments. We went through a lot of hours, having votes \nbasically every 15 minutes. We stayed right with it. They are \nexhausted, but they are also exhilarated, as they should be, because \nthis is a real good day's work.\n  I know this legislation is going to be good for America, good for job \nsecurity, and economic growth for working families of America and for \ntheir children. It does have the core components the President asked \nfor but also other areas, such as education, pension savings, and the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  So they have done good work, and I am glad we have passed this tax \nrelief package. They now have to go to conference and that, too, will \nbe a challenge. I am sure they are up to it, and they are going to work \nto make sure the interested parties in the House and the Senate, on \nboth sides of the aisle, are included.\n  So this has been a real lift to get it completed. I know it has been \ndifficult on both sides of the aisle. I know Senator Reid has been here \nthrough the long hours--12 hours, I believe, yesterday alone. Senator \nDaschle and I talked many times to try to find a way to bring it to a \nconclusion. We have been able to achieve that.\n  The vote speaks for itself; 62 Senators voted aye for tax relief for \nAmerica. I am very happy that this hurdle has been jumped and now we go \nto the final stage.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time to make a few \ncomments about the tax bill. Let me first begin by congratulating the \ndistinguished chairman and the ranking member. While I differ with the \noutcome, I certainly do not differ with the manner in which they worked \ntogether. I appreciate the bipartisan spirit in which they worked, and \nI hope we can see more of that in the future.\n  I do hope we can see a different result in the future as we face \nthese critical questions. I believe with all my heart that we will \nregret the day this passes and is sent to the President for his \nsignature. I think we will regret it, in part, because it is based on \nprojections that are very faulty. We will not realize a $5.7 trillion \nsurplus. I think we can predict that safely. We also recognize that, \nwith the uncertainty of the budget and all of the economic conditions \nthat we will face, to commit to a tax cut of more than $4 trillion in \nits entirety over a 10-year period of time is not in keeping with the \nfiscal responsibility that we have all said we are so proud of--the \nfiscal responsibility that actually brought about surpluses over the \ncourse of the last 3 years.\n  So our first concern has been, and continues to be, that it is based \non faulty projections. Our second concern is that it will crowd out all \nother priorities that we hold, in some cases, in both parties. We say \nwe are for reducing the public debt. I believe that as a result of the \npassage of this legislation there will be no further reduction of \npublic debt. We all have indicated a willingness to support \nprescription drug benefits. I predict that as a result of this we will \nbe told we can't afford prescription drug benefits.\n  We all indicated that we advocate strongly protecting Medicare and \nSocial Security. This bill will force us to tap into the Medicare fund, \nthe Social Security fund, and deny the protection and the kind of \nviability in those trust funds that we have counted on these last \nseveral years. This bill will not allow us to provide the kind of \nresources for investment in education that we have all said is \nimportant to both parties and this country. So across the board, this \nlegislation crowds out and, in some cases, eliminates our opportunity \nto address America's priorities in a balanced and meaningful way.\n  The third concern I have is one of fairness. We can do better than \nthis. We ought to do better than this. When we provide a third of a $4 \ntrillion tax cut to the top 1 percent, a third to the next 19 percent, \nand a third to the bottom 80 percent, that doesn't say much about the \nbalance and our sensitivity and empathy for working families all across \nthis country.\n  There is only one group of taxpayers who will not receive any \nmarginal rate reduction in this bill, and that is the 72 million \ntaxpayers who will still pay the 15-percent rate. That is wrong. We \nought to do better than that. We ought to be sending a clear message \nthat we understand they deserve a tax rate cut like everybody else. But \nthat is not what this bill says. So I am concerned about the fairness. \nI am concerned about the imbalance that this legislation represents.\n  Mr. President, for all of those reasons, I regret the fact that we \npassed this legislation today with the vote that we did. I suspect we \nwill be back addressing budgetary and other implications for many years \nto come. I hope in the future we will remember our promise, our \ncommitment to fiscal responsibility, our commitment to the other issues \nthat we have all said are important not only to us, but to the country. \nI hope, in a bipartisan way, our judgment in the future will reflect \nthose commitments more accurately than the one we have just made today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/23/senate-section/article/S5522-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5522-S5524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         A PROCEDURAL TRAVESTY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, just a couple words. The fact is, Mr. \nPresident--and I speak advisedly--this is a travesty; it is a travesty \neconomically and, more than that, a travesty procedurally with respect \nto the Senate. I speak as having served on the Budget\n\n[[Page S5523]]\n\nCommittee since its institution--and as having been its chairman--and I \nhave never seen such a gross abuse of the process.\n  Specifically, Mr. President, in 1993, which has been compared by the \npresent chairman of the Budget Committee to the action just recently on \nthe floor, in 1993, President Clinton presented his budget. We had \nhearings on that budget, and we had a markup within the Budget \nCommittee under the rules. There were some 30 votes--and 1 more vote \nfor final passage. Thereafter, when we brought it to the floor of the \nSenate, we had an additional 52 votes on amendments. Compare this with \nthe majority leader's bragging now about 54 votes--like that was really \na task.\n  The truth of the matter is we didn't get to reconciliation until \nAugust. At that particular time, they were really gloating with glee at \nthe passage of the bill and reconciliation, stating that when we \nincreased taxes on Social Security, they were going to hunt us down in \nthe street like dogs and shoot us. They said, when we passed that bill, \nit was going to cause a depression. The distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Packwood, said if this procedure worked back \nin 1993, which we voted for without a single Republican vote either in \nthe House or in the Senate, that he would give us his home downtown \nhere in the District. And Congressman Kasich, later chairman of the \nBudget Committee on the House side said, if this thing worked, he would \nchange parties. I want to be a good memory.\n  I will never forget a conversation once with Bernie Baruch, when he \ntalked about President Truman. He said Truman had a good memory, but he \nsaid he had a good, bad memory. That crowd over there has a good, bad \nmemory for the simple reason that they know it is an abuse. They rammed \nit. Instead of the President presenting a budget, we in the Budget \nCommittee went through make-work hearings--just blather. They could not \nhear on the President's budget because the President would not submit \nit.\n  Of course, when we debated the so-called budget on the floor of the \nSenate, it was merely a tax cut. It wasn't a budget. The President had \nyet to submit his budget. It had not been submitted when they voted on \nit in the House; it had not been submitted when they voted on it in the \nSenate.\n  Then, of all things, we did get appointed to the conference \ncommittee--only to be told: Get out, we are not going to confer. So we \ngot out.\n  Then, of all things, they abused the reconciliation process, bringing \nthe tax bill to the floor--not to reconcile, not to lower the deficit, \nas was intended--and I know because I helped write it--the \nreconciliation process was used as an abuse to ram it. I know of one \nParliamentarian who said it could not be used that way, and then I know \nof that same Parliamentarian who changed his mind. Oh, yes. Anything to \ngo along and ram it through and give us the bum's rush, and then have \nthe unmitigated gall to call us bums. They have been putting it out \nthat we are just delaying and delaying. But we're not delaying. This is \nour first opportunity on this bill to financially discuss education, \nhousing, defense, which are all important matters; we are trying to get \nsome break in this bum's rush from leadership.\n  When I turned on the Republican Policy Committee's channel, channel \n2, they said, ``Votes will continue ad nauseam.'' The votes were just \nnauseous. I have never seen such arrogance. I have been here 34 years, \nand it is the worst that we have ever experienced. I can tell you that.\n  But, more importantly, Mr. President, this is a travesty \neconomically. Of course, they make no bones about it. When we did \nincrease Social Security taxes, they complained, but you don't find a \ndecrease of Social Security taxes now. When we increased the gasoline \ntax, they complained, but you don't find a decrease of the gasoline tax \nnow.\n  You do not find anything in this bill for working Americans only \npaying payroll taxes. Instead, they are indirectly increasing the \nburden on these people by giving everyone but them relief and taking \naway Government resources.\n  We approached the budget process in 1993 in a very deliberate \nfashion. We said: Look at these rising deficits in the national debt \nand the interest costs on the debt. In 1992, President Bush ran a \n$403.6 billion deficit. Ergo, the Government was spending over $400 \nbillion more than it was taking in, and, yes, we are for tax cuts.\n  I have been in politics for a long time, and I have not found a \npolitician yet who was not for tax cuts. But we said the way to give a \nbetter tax cut was to lower these long-term interest payments. Alan \nGreenspan can play around with the short term, but only the fiscal \npolicy of this Senate can change the long term.\n  In the 1993 package, we downsized the Government by reducing the \nfederal workforce by almost 300,000; we cut spending by $250 billion; \nand we increased taxes by slightly less than $250 billion--and it \nresulted in the greatest prosperity in the history of the entire Nation \nfor an 8-year period.\n  The reason why the present President Bush cannot sell tax cuts--he \nhas been to over half of the States in America trying to sell them and \ngiving us the bum's rush--is because the people know, the financial \nmarkets know, the bankers know, the automobile salesmen know that \ngovernment borrowing will explode, and everybody is uptight.\n  This is not a wonderful thing that has occurred in this Chamber and \nto be congratulated. Economically, it is a travesty. We did it before \nin 1981. Yes, we picked up 38 votes today. We only had 11 votes then. \nWe had one Republican, Mack Mathias of Maryland, but we did have, as \nthey call now with even one vote--we had a bipartisan opposition. I say \nthat with tongue in cheek, but that was all, just 11 votes, against so-\ncalled Reaganomics which the first President Bush called voodoo. Now, \nMr. President, you have voodoo II.\n  There is no education in the second kick of a mule. That first kick \nwithin 4\\1/2\\ years put the economy into the dumps. That is when we had \nno resources and we were trying to hold on, and we were cutting \nspending under President Reagan.\n  I know, yes, during the Reagan administration we increased defense, \nand I supported those increases. But after eight years of Reagan's \ndomestic cuts and four years of cuts under President Bush, we ran \nenormous deficits because of the $750 billion revenue loss from the \nReagan tax cut.\n  Now we are on course for at least a $1.35 trillion tax cut, but they \nsay after the alternative minimum tax, after the interest costs, that \nthis ought to be in excess of $2 trillion, compared to $750 billion.\n  There it is. We passed the bill and everybody is going to champion \nit. We have agreed on this side that it will be conferenced and it will \ngo to the President, but let's not have a third kick of the mule, with \nmore of these coming across the deck as if we had the resources.\n  Look at the public debt to the penny today on the Treasury Web site \nand you'll see that currently we are running a $19 billion surplus. \nHowever, this tax cut means at least $10 billion in lost revenues this \nyear--with defense, under Secretary Rumsfeld, asking for an additional \n$10 billion, and agriculture, $10 billion. Then, June comes and we make \nthe big interest payments to the trust funds, the likes of $79 \nbillion. Instead of bringing Government back down to the black, like \nunder the Democrats with President Clinton for 8 years, we are now \nstarting back up today with this vote. Somewhere in the Congressional \nRecord there ought to be registered that what we have done, in essence, \nis increased taxes and not lowered them because we are going to \nincrease the debt and we are going to increase the interest costs, \nalready at $366 billion, which are taxes for nothing.\n\n  If I pay a gas tax, I get a highway. If I pay a sales tax, I get a \nschoolhouse. If I pay interest taxes, just profligacy, absolute waste.\n  I will never forget last year when President Clinton was giving his \nState of the Union Address, the distinguished majority leader remarked: \nThat man is costing us a billion dollars a minute. He talked for an \nhour and a half. That was $90 billion.\n  President Bush wants to cut taxes $90 billion a year. We can pay for \nthe Clinton and the Bush programs, $180 billion, and still have $186 \nbillion left over\n\n[[Page S5524]]\n\nto increase defense, to increase research at the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n  We are spending the money, and no one is talking about it. We are not \ngetting anything for it.\n  In 1968-1969, when we balanced the budget last under President Lyndon \nJohnson, the interest cost was only $16 billion. We have increased the \ninterest costs without the cost of a war incidentally--$350 billion a \nyear. We cannot afford it.\n  When the Budget Committee meets, first, before we tackle defense and \nanything else in the budget, we have to immediately spend $366 billion. \nThe economy is cool, people are not going to be able to save enough \nmoney to send their kids to college, they are not going to make their \nhouse payments, and we in the Government are thinking that what we have \ndone is really good--the Government is too big, the money belongs to \nthe people and all that childish gibber.\n  Come on. What we have done has, by gosh, sidelined the people and \nsidelined this Government and, in essence, politically bought the vote. \nI do not know where my friend Senator McCain is, but he ought to hasten \nto the Chamber because the biggest campaign finance abuse has just been \nvoted through the Senate. The majority has bought the people's vote \nbecause they would not go back home and explain to the people what is \ngoing on here. They went along with the singsong--the money belongs to \nthe people, surplus, surplus, surplus.\n  We cannot find a surplus. We have not had one in 40 years, and we \nwill not have one this year, and if anybody believes differently, tell \nthem to come see me and we will make the bet and give them the odds.

I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I voted no on the tax bill that passed the Senate. I \nrecognize there are some positive provisions in that legislation. I \nwill speak to two of them. One was in the area of education. There were \na number of features which will make it easier for families to send \ntheir children to college, the provisions which will make it easier for \nlocal school districts to finance the construction of new and to \nrehabilitate older school buildings. Those are positive features. I \nalso had supported the provisions that dealt with estate tax reform by \nraising the level of the exemption; that is, the amount of dollars one \ncan exclude before a person calculates the estate tax obligations. By \nraising those exemptions, we have substantially diminished the number \nof Americans who will pay any estate tax.\n\n  On the whole, I found much more that was disturbing, much more that I \nconsidered to be a failure of vision, than I found to be worthy in this \nlegislation. I hope I am wrong. I hope the comments I am going to make \nprove to be inaccurate in the history we will write in the aftermath of \nthis legislation. Frankly, my experience leads me to doubt that I will \nbe wrong.\n  I believe in life we are constantly forced to make choices. Those in \npolitics like to avoid making choices. We are very good at telling \npeople what we think they want to hear, even if the cumulative effect \nof all the things we have told the people we want is incompatible.\n  For instance, most Members have told the people we want to strengthen \nSocial Security. Most Members have told the people we want to \nstrengthen, reform, and add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. \nThe fact is, I believe what we have just done is going to make it \nimpossible to deliver on either of those commitments. I hope I am \nwrong, but I doubt it.\n  I believe while what we say is not necessarily a true reflection of \nour choices, how we spend our money is a true reflection of how we will \nmake our choices. I believe there was a metaphor earlier this morning. \nWe had before the Senate legislation that would have provided \nsubstantial assistance to individual Americans and American families in \ndealing with the reality of the aging of our population. One of the \nlessons of many that we learned from the 2000 census is that America is \ngetting older. I know that well from my own State where almost 19 \npercent of our population is over the age of 65 and where an increasing \npercentage of our population is over the age of 85.\n  Florida is a State of the future. The United States of America will \nbe like Florida in another generation. Yet with the legislation that \nwould have provided immediate assistance to families that were \nrendering care to an elderly grandparent, an elderly uncle or aunt, \nsome loved one in the family, or to those Americans who are thinking \nabout their own future and are considering the purchase of long-term \ncare insurance so they will not be a burden on their children and \ngrandchildren when they reach advanced age, we had a choice: We could \nhave voted for an amendment that would have made a substantial \ncommitment of the Federal Government to encourage and recognize those \nkinds of sacrifices, or we could have maintained for a 3-year period \nthe structure of the bill which provides one-third of the tax benefits \nto 1 percent of the American people.\n  We would have been asking the 1 percent of the most affluent \nAmericans to have slightly deferred a portion of the benefits from this \nlegislation in order to have been able to pay for substantial \nincentives for tens of millions of Americans to prepare for their today \nor future consequences of aging.\n  I regret to say we chose when we made a decision today. The decision \nwas, it was more important to provide that benefit for the 1 percent of \nthe most wealthy Americans than it was to assist tens of millions of \nAmericans to prepare for their aging families and for their own future. \nI think that is a real choice that demonstrates real values. Frankly, I \nam disappointed the Senate made such a selection of values.\n\n  Analyzing this bill, I say it fails on three counts, which can all be \ndenominated through the calendar. It failed on a long-term basis; it \nfailed on a short-term basis; and it failed today.\n  On a long-term basis, there is no greater challenge facing this \nNation than the one which that amendment to which I just alluded \nrepresents; that is, the aging of America. When Social Security was \nestablished in the 1930s, for every person who was in retirement in the \nUnited States or was of retirement age, we had some 15 to 20 active \npeople in the labor force, people who were providing the means by which \nthose older Americans of the 1930s could be supported. In just a few \nyears, when the large number of Americans born immediately after World \nWar II reach retirement age, we will be down to fewer than four working \nAmericans for every person retiring.\n  We have contracts outstanding called Social Security and Medicare \nPart A hospitalization. These are contracts for which Americans are \npaying every time they get their paycheck. They look down at the \nallocation of the dollars they have just worked hard to earn and they \nsee the subtractions. A big part of those subtractions of the dollars \nis taken out of every paycheck for Social Security. Another part of \nthose subtractions is the part taken out of every paycheck for the \nhospitalization component of Medicare.\n  Why are Americans tolerating this reduction from their immediate \nincome? They are tolerating it because they have confidence in the \ncontract which exists between them and the U.S. Government. That \ncontract is that once they reach the age of eligibility for Social \nSecurity and Medicare, the services for which they are paying every \npaycheck are going to be delivered. It is going to be our challenge to \nsee that those contracts are maintained.\n  Today we are not in a position to say with confidence that those \ncontracts will be able to be honored because both the Social Security \ntrust fund and the Medicare hospitalization trust fund, by any \nactuarial standard, are seriously under water.\n  We had an opportunity this year, an opportunity unique in the history \nof this country with the enormous economic growth and surpluses it has \nbrought, to be able to say to the American people that for the next \nthree generations we will place ourselves in a position to honor those \ncontracts. From now until the year 2075, we will be in a position to \nsay we have the resources, we have made the proper preparations to \nhonor our contractual responsibilities. We would have started that by \nan aggressive program to pay down the national debt so that as we\n\n[[Page S5525]]\n\nentered the period of greater demands on Social Security and Medicare, \nwe would have been in the best possible national financial position. We \nwould have done it by supplementing the funds going into the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds with a portion of the savings in \nnational interest, about which Senator Hollings spoke so eloquently, \nthat we are going to gain because we are paying down the national debt. \nA portion of those savings should have gone to strengthen the Social \nSecurity and the Medicare trust funds.\n  The decision we made a few minutes ago by passing what I consider to \nbe an engorged, excessive tax bill will deny us the opportunity to pay \ndown the national debt as fully as we should. We will miss the mark by \napproximately $750 billion to $1 trillion in the next 10 years--what we \ncould have done to have strengthened our Nation's finances. We are not \ngoing to be in the position to make the kind of investments for these \ntrust funds for Social Security and Medicare that we should have made.\n\n  I hope I am wrong. I hope I am unduly pessimistic. But, frankly, I \ndoubt that I am.\n  So we have failed the calendar in the long run. We have also failed \nthe calendar in the short run.\n  If there is a phrase we have heard too much of in the last few months \nand have honored too little, it is the phrase ``economic stimulus.'' \nWhat would happen if the economy, after a long run of booming, \nexpanding economic growth, suddenly began to turn soft and unemployment \nlevels reached a level we had not seen since the early 1990s?\n  We all read about substantial layoffs in companies that we thought \nwere invulnerable to those kinds of economic reversals. We have seen \nthe stock market first decline, then come back, then generate a level \nof uncertainty, unpredictability. All those things were signals of an \nuncertain but potentially seriously declining economy. So we said: \nLet's buy an economic insurance policy. Let's not just rely on what the \nFederal Reserve Board can do with short-term interest rates. Let's \nadopt a fiscal policy that will help stimulate the economy.\n  We turned to some of the best experts in the country. They said what \nthe Congress could do would be to give an immediate tax cut to the \nAmerican people, target that tax cut at those Americans who were most \nlikely to spend it because the essential diagnosis of this economic \nsoftening is on the demand side. People are losing confidence in their \nown economic futures and therefore are less willing to make that \ndownpayment for a new refrigerator, are less willing to buy a new pair \nof shoes for the children, less willing to plan for a vacation in \nFlorida.\n  We want to reverse those senses of insecurity and give them an \nimmediate sense of confidence, both by putting more dollars in their \npockets as well as giving them a sense that they will have a greater \nstream of funds available to them to meet their family needs into the \nfuture.\n  So plans were developed for a serious economic stimulus right here on \nthe Senate floor. We will all recall it was not very many days ago that \nwe voted for an $85 billion economic stimulus in the year 2001--$85 \nbillion. What was the economic stimulus in the bill we just passed? \nLess than $10 billion--anemic, pathetic, not worthy of the phrase \n``economic stimulus.''\n  So I hope I am wrong. I hope some of the signs we have seen in recent \ndays that maybe the economy is turning around will prove to be a \nharbinger of a bright summer for America. We all hope so. But just as a \nperson might hope their house doesn't burn down, that still doesn't \nkeep them from buying fire insurance so, in the unlikely event it does \nburn down, they will have some dollars to start the rebuilding process.\n  Mr. President, I ask for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We should be buying an economic insurance policy against \nthe possibility that the bright summer may turn into an arid fall. In \nthe short term, on the No. 1 economic issue facing America, in my \njudgment we have failed. I hope I am wrong but I doubt that I am.\n  On the calendar, we failed in the long run; we failed in the short \nrun; we have even failed today. This bill has too much of what I would \ncall bait and switch, where you say this is what you are going to get \ndone. Then when the actual product arrives it is something different.\n\n  We have said $1.35 trillion is going to be the outer limits, outer \nperimeters of tax cuts--not for May of 2001, not even for the year \n2001, but for the next 11 years. We have just committed the totality of \nwhat we have said is a prudent amount of tax cuts for the next 11 \nyears. Yet at the same time we said that, we had over half of our \nMembers willing to vote to add $50 billion more, beyond the $1.35 \ntrillion, in a debate earlier this morning.\n  We know we are soon going to get a recommendation from the President \nand the Secretary of Defense for substantial increases in what it will \ncost to defend America. Senator McCain of Arizona spoke fulsomely about \nthat yesterday. Yet no dollars are in our economic plan for that \nassured request for additional spending on national defense.\n  We know we are going to have to spend some more money on Social \nSecurity, either the way I suggested, by paying down the debt and \nputting some of the savings of interest costs directly into the Social \nSecurity trust fund, or even a way I do not happen to support but at \nleast it is a way, and that is to begin the process of partial \nprivatization of Social Security. There is a $1 trillion cost over the \nnext 10 years to implement that plan. There is no money in the budget \nplan to do either of those.\n  We have had a number of areas in the Tax Code where it is clear we \nare going to have to have some additional funds. If we do nothing but \npass the bill that has just left the Senate, we are going to increase \nthe number of Americans who have to pay the alternative minimum tax \nfrom today's approximately 1.5 million to almost 40 million 10 years \nfrom now. That is not going to happen. We are going to find some way to \nmoderate the effect of the alternative minimum tax, and that is likely \nto have a price tag of $200 to $300 billion. Not a penny of that is \nprovided for.\n  We also know there are going to be a number of extenders required. \nExtenders are tax provisions that are in the code but only for a short \nperiod of time. One of those we passed today, which was to provide an \nexpanded deductibility for families who pay tuition for their child to \ngo to college. We start it in a couple of years and then end it 3 or 4 \nyears later. The reality is we are not going to end it 3 or 4 years \nlater. Once we commence this program of allowing deductibility of the \ncost of college tuition, which is a good idea, we are going to continue \nit. Yet we do not have the resources in this budget for that known \nreality with which we are going to contend.\n  Today we are poking a very sharp stick in the eye of our fellow \nMembers of this federalist system. Without any consultation, without \nany consideration of the impact that it will have on their ability to \nmeet basic obligations such as to educate our children, we have just \ntaken $10 billion a year out of the budgets of our 50 State partners in \nthis American system of federalism. Half of that money is going to come \nout approximately beginning the first of January of the year 2002, well \ninto the budget year that most States will start as of July 1 of this \nyear, running until June 30 of 2002. In the case of my State, our \nGovernor has indicated he is going to have to find somewhere in the \nrange of $150 to $200 billion in the next period to pay for the hole we \nhave just created in his budget beginning in January of 2002.\n  So by the long-term calendar, the short-term calendar, or today's \nwatch, this is a deficient tax bill. It is a deficient fiscal plan. I \nhope I am wrong. I hope America will be strong enough, resilient enough \nto avoid the kind of difficulties we have just given them as our legacy \nof action today.\n  I hope I am wrong. But, frankly, I doubt that I am.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Capo). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5526]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have just passed a massive tax cut \nbill. I opposed that legislation. I opposed it because I believe it is \nfiscally irresponsible. It is not just a conclusion that I reach, but \nthe New York Times said that overall it amounts to another gross \nabdication of fiscal responsibility. I wish that were not the case. I \nwish we could have passed a tax cut that I could have supported.\n  I proposed a tax cut of $900 billion in the context of a budget \nresolution that would have preserved every penny of the Social Security \nsurplus for Social Security, every penny of the Medicare trust fund for \nMedicare, that would have taken the remainder and divided it in thirds: \nOne-third for a tax cut; one-third for high-priority domestic needs, \nincluding a prescription drug benefit, money to strengthen our national \ndefense, and resources to improve education. And even with that \nadditional funding for domestic priorities, we would have continued to \nreduce the role of the Federal Government.\n  This $900 billion plan was not a tax-and-spend proposal. It would \nhave continued to take down the role of the Federal Government from 18 \npercent of our national income to 16.5 percent of our national income--\nthe lowest level of Federal spending as a share of our national income \nsince 1951.\n  Then, with the final third, we would have used that money to \nstrengthen Social Security for the future because we know it is not \nenough just to save the Social Security trust fund money for Social \nSecurity. We also need additional resources to strengthen Social \nSecurity for what is to come because every Member in this Chamber \nknows, when the baby boomers start to retire, the story changes from \nsurpluses to deficits.\n  One reason I believe this bill is fiscally irresponsible is that it \nis back-end loaded. It goes from a $1.35 trillion tax cut in this \ndecade to a $4 trillion tax reduction in the second decade, right at \nthe time the baby boomers begin to retire.\n  I predict now that what we have put in place today will not stand. It \nwill not stand because it is part of an overall budget approach that \ndoes not add up. It is going to have to be changed.\n  I opposed this bill not only because it is fiscally irresponsible, \nbut because it is fundamentally unfair. The top 1 percent of income \nearners in this country, people who, on average, earn $1.1 million a \nyear, get 33 percent of the benefits. Contrast that with the bottom 60 \npercent of American taxpayers who get half as much. That does not \nstrike me as fair.\n  Additional evidence of unfairness is contained in what was done in \nthe rate reductions that are part of this legislation.\n  We have five income tax brackets in current law. This bill would \nreduce the rates for four of the five brackets. The one bracket that \nwould get no rate relief is the bracket that applies to the vast \nmajority of the American taxpayers. Seventy percent of the American \ntaxpayers are in the 15-percent bracket, and they get no rate relief, \nnone. I do not know how one justifies that.\n  In addition to that--in addition to being fiscally irresponsible, in \naddition to being unfair--this bill flunks the test of stimulus. The \nsenior Senator from Florida made the case, I think, very powerfully and \nvery persuasively. We know the economy is weak now. We ought to provide \nfiscal stimulus now. Fiscal stimulus can be in the form of either tax \nreduction or expenditure. But what did we do? We have only $10 billion \nof fiscal stimulus in this year. In the Senate, we passed $85 billion \nof fiscal stimulus for this year. Somewhere the vast majority of it got \nleft on the cutting room floor. It makes no economic sense. You provide \nfiscal stimulus when the economy is weak. And the economy is weak now. \nWe ought to provide fiscal stimulus now. This bill does not do it.\n\n  The final point I want to make is on the alternative minimum tax \nbecause currently only 1.5 million--actually somewhat less than 1.5 \nmillion--taxpayers are affected by the alternative minimum tax. That is \nsomething we passed years ago to make certain the super rich did not \navoid taxes altogether. Now we are going to see, under this \nlegislation, nearly 40 million people affected by the alternative \nminimum tax.\n  As I have said before, boy, are these people in for a surprise. They \nthought they were getting a tax reduction, and they are going to wake \nup and find that not only do they not get a tax reduction, they are \ngetting a tax increase. Under the bill passed today more than 1 in \nevery 4 taxpayers in America are going to be swept up into the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  This is not going to happen. It is not going to happen because it \ncannot happen, just like much of the rest of this bill is not going to \nhappen. It is not going to happen because it is part of an overall \nbudget that does not add up. That is the unfortunate reality of what \nhas happened today. It is part of an overall budget plan that simply \ndoes not pass the fiscal responsibility test. I regret that.\n  I think we could have passed responsible tax reduction, tax reduction \nthat is fair, that is weighted more toward middle-income people in this \ncountry than toward the wealthiest among us. And I want to be quick to \nsay, I have nothing against those with great wealth. That is a great \nopportunity that exists in America. That is part of what makes this \ncountry economically strong. But when we are taking the people's money, \nwe have to make judgments about where it should go.\n  I do not think it is fair to take the people's money and give a third \nof what is provided for in this tax cut to people who, on average, are \nearning $1.1 million a year. That is not fair. That is not right. I \nespecially do not think it is fiscally responsible to put in place a \ntax cut of this magnitude in light of the obvious flaws in the budget \nthat serves as a basis for it.\n  That basis is a 10-year forecast, a 10-year projection that everybody \nin this Chamber knows is not going to come true. Even the people who \nmade the forecast say it is not going to come true. They wrote an \nentire chapter in the book saying there is only a 10-percent chance it \nis going to come true; a 45-percent chance it is going to be less \nmoney. That forecast was written 10 weeks ago, and since then the \neconomy has weakened.\n  This is unwise. This is not the way we ought to do business. We ought \nnot to lock in a 10-year plan based on a 10-year projection whose \nmakers tell us is highly unlikely to occur. It makes no sense.\n  This Congress meets every year. We should have passed a more modest \ntax cut and reserved more money for long-term and short-term debt \nreduction, so we could be certain we are keeping on course to reduce \nthis national debt.\n  Unfortunately, the gross national debt of the United States will not \nbe reduced at the end of this 10-year period. It will not be. According \nto the Congressional Budget Office, the gross debt of the United States \nis going to be increased under this 10-year plan, from $5.6 trillion \ntoday to $6.7 trillion 10 years from now.\n  That is an increase in the gross indebtedness of the United States. \nThat is not the direction we should be taking.\n  We ought to have embarked on a policy not only to pay down our short-\nterm debt, the publicly held debt that is paid down under this \nscenario, but to pay down our long-term debt, our gross debt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank all Senators for their patience \nand for their goodwill. This has not been easy. This has been a debate \nthat has been conducted under difficult circumstances. I thank \nSenators. I commend them. Some were justifiably frustrated, as I was, \nat the short time constraints of this process. But I think, by and \nlarge, we have conducted this debate in a dignified way, and I deeply \nappreciate that.\n  I most especially thank our chairman, Senator Grassley. He has \nreached out with me to craft a very fair, bipartisan compromise. He has \nmade all the difference in the world.\n  I especially thank the assistant Democratic leader, Senator Reid. He \nhas been at his post throughout the debate, keeping us on track. I \ndeeply appreciate his fairness, his ability. We\n\n[[Page S5527]]\n\nwere able to pass this bill fairly expeditiously in large part because \nof the efforts of the Senator from Nevada.\n  Let me turn to the bill and make the case one more time. Some \nSenators might say--and they have said--that the tax cut is too large. \nWith deepest respect, I say to those Senators that that issue has been \ndecided in the budget resolution. I also note that we have added a \n``circuit breaker'' to this bill. This provision allows us to make \nchanges to the tax cut if our budget targets are not met.\n  Some will say the tax cut is unfair. I disagree. This tax cut is very \nfair. I take issue with many of the statements made on the floor. Some \nare not entirely accurate.\n  In the first place, our tax cut is much more fair on a distributional \nbasis than the President's proposal. But forget about the President's \nproposal for a minute and compare it with current law. If you set aside \nchanges to the estate tax, which virtually every Senator supports, this \nbill is significantly more progressive than current law. Taxpayers \nearning less than $100,000 will pay a smaller share of the overall tax \nburden. Taxpayers earning more than $100,000 will pay a larger share of \nthe overall tax burden. In other words, we make the income tax more \nprogressive, not less. Our income tax system is made more progressive \ncompared with current law, not less.\n\n  Let me also remind Senators of some provisions of the bill that are \nvery important. We create a new 10-percent bracket that replaces part \nof the 15-percent bracket in current law--the single largest piece of \nthe bill. It cuts income taxes for every American who pays income \ntaxes, including everyone in the 15-percent bracket, and it reduces the \nmarginal rate from 15 percent to 10 percent for 19 million low-income \ntaxpayers. That is a rate reduction of one-third.\n  We double the child credit, and we make it partly refundable. Thirty \nmillion families get a higher child tax credit. For 10 million, the \ncredit is refundable.\n  We expand and simplify the earned income credit. This will help 4 \nmillion low-income working families. We include a $35 billion package \nof education incentives, including a new provision that makes up to \n$5,000 worth of tuition payments deductible. We expand IRAs; we expand \n401(k)s. We create new incentives to help low-income earners save for \nretirement. We reduce the marriage penalty to the benefit of 40 million \ncouples and, of course, we address the estate tax.\n  Of course, this bill is not perfect, but it is balanced. It is \nbipartisan. It is good for taxpayers. It is good for working families, \nand it is good for the economy. It is good for the country.\n  Now comes the conference. That is going to be difficult. We want to \ncome back with a bill that is balanced and that is fair; that is, a \nbill very close to the Senate position. After all, the Senate is 50/50, \nand it is going to be difficult to come back with a conference report \nthat gets at least 51 votes in the Senate. We will be more likely to \nattain that the more it adheres to the Senate position. A strong vote \nfor final passage will certainly strengthen our hand, and we did \nreceive a strong vote of 62 Senators.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues, especially on this side of the \naisle, for their forbearance and for their help as we work on, and work \nto adopt, the conference report.\n  I add my deepest thanks and gratitude to the people who did the real \nwork; that is, our staff.\n  I will begin with John Angell, who is the Democratic staff director, \nMr. Calm and Collected, keeping things all nice and even when otherwise \npeople are frenetically running here and there. That is what a good \nstaff director does. Democratic staff director John Angell filled that \nbill. Mike Evans, deputy staff director, he is our ``points of order'' \nguy. He knows more about Senate rules or at least as much as the \nParliamentarian. I might say, I deeply relied on him as we worked out \npoints of order. Then there is Mr. Everything, Mr. Russ Sullivan, chief \ntax counsel. Russ knows this Code as well as anybody I can think of. He \nis out negotiating. He is advising me. He is helping put amendments \ntogether. He has done a heck of a job.\n  Cary Pugh is our amendments maven. She was making sure all the \namendments were worked out and in order. Pat Heck is Mr. R and knows \nthat subject more than I care to admit. Maria Freese handled our estate \ntax matters as well as pension provisions. Mitchell Kent really has \nhelped so much in crafting the child care provisions of the bill, one \nheck of a job.\n  We have our Brookings fellows: Luis Rivera and Frank Rodriguez, my \nthanks to them. Our law clerks: Jonathan Selib and Todd Smith. Jonathan \ncame to work for us last Monday--his baptism by fire. He has worked so \nhard, such late nights, as has everyone. My deepest thanks to them. \nThey are not getting paid.\n\n  Our office manager, Josh LeVasseur, has done a heck of a job. Josh is \nsort of our home base manager. He keeps our office organized. Our \noffice assistant, Jewel Harper, is always upbeat, always cheerful. And \nour interns: Lindsay Crawford; Emilie Klein; and Annabelle Bartsch, who \nhas been a numbers cruncher; she did one great job. Our ``budgeteer,'' \nAlan Cohen. Alan knows more about debts and budgets than I care to \nadmit. Liz Fowler, our chief health counsel, has helped so much with \nhealth matters. Tom Klouda, who works on Social Security. And then, of \ncourse, Michael Siegel in my personal office has done a super job \ndealing with the press, and many others in my personal office.\n  I also commend Senator Conrad's Budget Committee staff. Senator \nConrad has had about six or seven staff on the floor at all times, \nprobably to carry all those charts he brings over here. I don't know \nanybody who has more charts than the Senator from North Dakota. They \nhave been very instructive, very helpful.\n  There is the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation. They are the \nones who really are not honored enough and do so much work. And I thank \nthe entire floor staff and all the pages.\n  On the other side of the aisle, I thank Kolan Davis, Mark Prater, \nDean Zerbe, Elizabeth Paris, Ed McClellan, Diann Howland, Brig Pari, \nLeah Shimp, Jeanne Haggerty, and Gina Falconio.\n  I save my greatest thanks to those who really have the hardest job of \nall; that is, our leader, Senator Daschle, Democratic leader. Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle pummel him with their requests, with their \ndemands, with what they want. It is an impossible job to be leader in \nthis body. I thank Senator Lott as well. I have the highest regard and \nrespect for the Senator from South Dakota as well as the Senator from \nMississippi. They have done one heck of a job. I wish more Americans \nknew how hard they tried to corral and herd 100 Senators together to \nreach a result that is good for our country.\n  In summary, my heartfelt thanks and gratitude for all the people who \nhave worked so hard. We have other issues ahead of us, more amendments, \nmore bills, but thus far, they have been just great.\n  I thank, finally, my good friend from Iowa, Chuck Grassley. Many \ntimes I have told the world of the high regard I have for him. It is \npretty hard to say much more. He is such a great guy. Deep down, nobody \nis more salt of the earth, a straight shooter who tells it like it is \nand is dependable, honest, and direct--making him very popular--my good \nfriend, Chuck Grassley.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana for his \nkind remarks. More important, I thank him for the cooperation that has \nbeen going on since day 1 of this year that we have been working \ntogether, bringing to culmination this vote and, eventually, a \nconference report that we hope will successfully pass the Senate a \nsecond time and go to the President with the largest tax cut for \nworking men and women in our country.\n  In addition to that, this is within the tradition of how the Senate \nFinance Committee works. I think I have served in the Senate when we \nhad as many as 55 Republicans and as little as 42 Republicans; and in \nany of those circumstances, the products of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, whatever party controlled it, for the most part, were \noverwhelmingly bipartisan. On the other hand, if it were not that way, \nthere would not be much chance of getting a bill through this body with \n100 Members of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S5528]]\n\n  I thank the number of people who voted for this bill on final \npassage. I am not sure I expected that large a number of votes. I \nexpected a sizable number of Democrats, but many more voted than I \nanticipated. Quite frankly, I didn't expect to get every Republican \nvote, which we did in the final analysis. I thank all of my colleagues \nwho voted for the bill. Those who didn't vote for it, I thank them very \nmuch for their cooperation in letting this come to final passage, even \nthough they did not like it.\n  So with passage of the RELIEF Act, I feel that struggling families \nwill have more money to make ends meet. Parents and students will be \nable to more easily afford the cost of a college education. A \nsuccessful businesswoman will be able to expand and hire more people. A \nfather finally getting a good paycheck after years of work will be able \nto provide for his aging mother. A farmer won't have to worry about \npassing on to his children the family farm without selling half of the \nland, maybe, for estate taxes. The examples are endless, but the great \nbenefits that we realize when we give tax relief to working men and \nwomen are great.\n\n  I thank many members of the committee staff, both Republican and \nDemocrat. Most of all, I think we have to thank the members of the \nFinance Committee--each one--for sitting through 10 hours of debate. \nRoughly a week ago now, we worked day and night to get that bill \nthrough. I thank my Finance Committee staff, Mark Prater, with me here, \nour chief tax counsel; and other tax counsels, including Ed McClellan, \nBrig Pari, Elizabeth Paris, who is here with me; Dean Zerbe, as well as \nDiann Howland. These individuals have been the workhorses of the \ncommittee, keeping the lights burning long into the night to make this \nfinal product the statutory language that it is and the perfection that \nstatutory language must have.\n  I also thank the entire staff support, particularly Gina Falconio, \nLeah Shimp, Jeanne Haggerty, and Carla Martin. Lastly, on my side, I \nthank Kolan Davis and Ted Totman, the committee staff director and \ndeputy staff director, for riding herd on all of this work.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. It would not have been possible without \nthe close work and cooperation at the staff level. So as chairman of \nthe committee, I have to appreciate and thank the minority staff for \ntheir good work, particularly Russ Sullivan, chief tax counsel; as well \nas Cary Pugh, Pat Heck, Maria Freese, Frank Rodriguez, and Mitchell \nKent. In addition, I thank John Angell and Mike Evans for their time \nand hard work as leaders of the staff for the Democrats.\n  Let me extend my thanks as well to a person who is not very public--\nLindy Paull and her staff at the Joint Committee on Taxation, who \nprobably want to be known for their anonymity. They provide a great \ndeal of extensive knowledge and guidance to this effort, particularly \nnot only in writing but also in their analysis of the cost of \nlegislation--what different policies add up to particular income into \nthe Federal Treasury or less income into the Federal Treasury.\n  Then I think we should not forget the Assistant Secretary for Tax \nPolicy, Mark Weinberger, and his staff for their assistance because \neven though they don't have a vote on Capitol Hill, there is a lot of \nexpertise at the U.S. Department of Treasury that this committee--the \nSenate Finance Committee--has on a regular basis called upon for \nanalysis for their opinions, and also to some extent to give us a view \nof the executive branch of Government as one more issue in \nconsideration that we ought to have.\n  My thanks also goes to Jim Fransen and Mark Mathiesen and their \ncapable staff and legislative counsel for taking our ideas and drafting \nthem into statutory language.\n  Then, finally, as Senator Baucus has done, I thank people on his side \nof the aisle who worked so hard as leaders of the Senate Finance \nCommittee or Senate Budget Committee. I also believe that we would not \nbe here if we had not had a successful budget resolution passed to make \nroom for this third largest tax cut in 50 years, the largest tax cut in \nthe last 20 years. So I thank Senator Pete Domenici and his staff \ndirector, Bill Hoagland, and the entire Budget Committee staff for \ntheir assistance. They were assistants to me during this deliberation, \nas Senator Conrad was for Senator Baucus, but also that sort of \nleadership provided the budget resolution.\n  This is a historical bill for historical times, and I am honored and \nprivileged to be a part of it. Once again, as Senator Baucus has said \nso often, and I have said often, I hope this spirit of bipartisanship \ncontinues, as it has, as a tradition in the Finance Committee through \nour leadership but will also be a standard for other work we do in the \nFinance Committee; more importantly, that it is something which is \ncontagious, and that there will be closer working relationships and \nmore bipartisanship between all Senators and the products of the \nSenate.\n  We go to conference now, and there again we are going to have to \nproduce legislation that hopefully gets the same bipartisan support \nthis bill did. If it is something a little less than that, it can't be \nmuch less. I don't want to be gambling that we will get 51 votes when \nwe come to the floor of the Senate after the negotiations are done. I \nwant to make sure that when we come to the floor, we come to the floor \nin a way that, before we bring the bill up, we have bipartisanship.\n  The fact is there aren't a lot of Democrats voting for this bill. We \ncan't take for granted the 62 people who have voted for it already.\n  I wish we could. It would make for a very easy conference. We go \nthere now to negotiate with the other body. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleagues from Iowa and \nMontana for the great job they have done. It was a tremendous amount of \nwork, a tremendous amount of patience. I congratulate them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/23/senate-section/article/S5528-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5528-S5529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VITAL DRUG SHORTAGE\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an emergency \nsituation facing many of our hospitals across the country. It is an \nemergency that faces our hospitals, many of our doctors but, much more \nimportantly, it is an emergency that faces the tiniest members of our \nsociety, and they are babies who are about to be born and premature \nbabies.\n  Right now, we have a drastically short supply of a vital drug that is \nused to help save the lives of babies who are born prematurely. Let me \nexplain.\n  There is a drug called beta-methasone, commonly known as Celestone, \nwhich is given to mothers who are about to deliver their child early. \nThe drug is designed to help the premature baby's lungs develop more \nfully and more completely and to help reduce the risk of bleeding in \nthe baby's brain.\n  This drug is absolutely essential to giving these tiny newborns a \nchance to live and grow into healthy children.\n  An obstetrician at Riverside Hospital in Columbus, Dr. Tracy Cook, \ncontacted me about the current shortage of this very necessary drug. \nFrom what I understand, many hospitals no longer have a supply of the \ndrug on hand at all, and others have only a few day's worth left in \nstock. In fact, I have taken a survey around Ohio, and I suspect what I \nfound in Ohio is true across the country, that doctors and hospitals \nare running low, many are out, some will be out in just a few days.\n  I have contacted the Secretary of HHS, Mr. Tommy Thompson, as well as \nthe FDA, to enlist their help in getting emergency supplies of the drug \nshipped to hospitals as soon as possible. The FDA tells us there are \nsome manufacturing problems with the drug which is causing this \nshortage.\n  Whatever the delay, I believe it is absolutely critical that we get \nthese drugs to our hospitals so that no lives are lost, no matter what \nthe cause is for this delay. This is a problem which has to be dealt \nwith.\n  This drug is critical to the health and future of premature babies. I \nurge my colleagues to support me in urging the FDA to take whatever \naction is necessary to resolve this problem. The lives of so many \nnewborns hang in the balance.\n  This is a problem the FDA must address immediately. We have contacted \nthe FDA, and the response we get back is: These are manufacturing \nproblems. That does not tell us what the exact\n\n[[Page S5529]]\n\nproblem is, nor does it tell us what the FDA is doing and what the \nmanufacturer is doing to resolve this problem.\n  We need some answers from the FDA. This is something that cannot wait \n2 weeks or 1 month or 6 months. This problem has to be resolved over \nthe next few days. It is critical for the safety of these newborn \nchildren.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/23/senate-section/article/S5529-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TAX RELIEF\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have been spending all of our time this \nweek on taxes. I am delighted the tax bill has passed. Certainly there \nare different views on how to do it. There will always be different \nviews when one raises the question of taxes or spending. There are \ndifferent points of view. Much has to do with the priorities of people. \nMuch has to do with the philosophy of what one thinks the appropriate \nrole of the Federal Government is, what kinds of programs should be \nfunded by the Federal Government. Those are the broad issues.\n  I was very pleased when we did follow through, and the House, of \ncourse, passed tax relief in the amount of approximately $1.6 trillion, \nwhich is what the President requested. The bill that passed the Senate \nis something less than that. It is still a huge amount of money. Most \nof us cannot conceive what $1.3 trillion is, but nevertheless it is \nvery close to the same amount and I think deals with the same \nprinciples that are so important.\n  Taxes are one of the highest priorities for this Congress and, \nindeed, should be. Taxes are high priorities for this Congress because \nof the fairness question. It is a question of adequately funding \nappropriate programs.\n  It is a high priority for the American people for much the same \nreason in that no one wants to pay more taxes than they have to, but \nmost of us are willing to pay taxes. It is necessary to do that. \nFairness is an issue. This is one of the President's first priorities.\n  Interestingly enough, this and education are the two highest \npriorities, and soon we deal with the energy issue. Those are the three \nthings that have been talked about the most in the last several months, \nso it is appropriate this Congress has focused on and made progress in \nthose areas.\n  The Senate will be going to conference with the House, and hopefully \nwe will have it down to the President perhaps before this week is over. \nThat is an excellent performance.\n  On the tax bill we went through 50-some votes on amendments, which \ngave everybody a good opportunity to talk about the different issues. \nYet the bill survived pretty much as it was reported out of committee. \nI congratulate the committee and the leaders.\n  There are a number of principles involved. We talk about amount \nalways but limited Government is part of it. One of the reasons for a \nreturn of taxes is because the citizens, the American people have paid \nmore taxes than are necessary, and we have a surplus. Clearly, it \nshould go back to the people who paid it.\n  Quite frankly, my experience is if we have a surplus for very long, \nwe will find a way to spend it even though it may not be one of the \nhighest priorities. The principles of limited Government are very much \na part of what we do.\n  There are questions as to, when one projects out 10 years, how close \nthe projections will come to the actual surpluses. I think any economic \nprojection for 10 years has some variability in it. However, I believe \nall the professionals who have made this projection indicate it is a \nvery modest projection and, indeed, it is very likely the surpluses \nwill, in fact, even be higher.\n  It is a time, too, when it is necessary to stimulate the economy. \nThis is one of the ways the economy is stimulated--by letting people \nspend more of their own money. It is true it takes a while for all of \nthis to kick in, but there will be some immediate impact, and that is \nvital to the economy.\n  Fairness in the Tax Code is very important, and we have a hard time \nwith fairness in the Tax Code. This bill provides more fairness in the \nmarriage penalty where two single people who earn a certain amount of \nmoney marry, and their tax on the same amount of money is increased. \nThat is a fairness issue and needs to be changed.\n  It is something we need to do. We talk a lot about the simplicity of \nthe Tax Code.\n  We didn't do much about that. We are always wanting to give tax \ncredits, so the Tax Code keeps getting larger.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/23/senate-section/article/S5529-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5529-S5531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AGAINST WITHDRAWAL FROM BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to take strong issue with \nremarks by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as summarized in the \nWashington Post on May 18 and subsequently reproduced in their entirety \non the paper's website, that he is ``pushing'' to pull U.S. troops out \nof Bosnia. According to Secretary Rumsfeld, ``the military job [in \nBosnia] was done three or four years ago.''\n  I firmly believe that Secretary Rumsfeld's analysis of the situation \nin Bosnia is incorrect, and that his policy prescription would be \nseriously detrimental to the national security interests of the United \nStates.\n  First, let me turn to Mr. Rumsfeld's statement that the ``military \njob was done three or four years ago.'' It is true that IFOR, and then \nSFOR, successfully separated the largely exhausted warring parties \nwithout much difficulty. But to assert that this separation spelled the \nend of our troops' mission is to define ``military'' in such a narrow \nway so as to make it nearly meaningless in the Balkan context.\n  Putting it in other terms, Secretary Rumsfeld seems to belong to the \nschool that begins talking about so-called ``exit strategies'' as soon \nas troops are committed. Of course we need an ``exit strategy,'' and we \nhave had one. The Clinton Administration early on outlined ten detailed \nbenchmarks for Dayton implementation that need to be met before we can \nsay ``mission accomplished'' and honorably withdraw. These are not \nsecrets. The U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo hands out a list of the \nbenchmarks to all visitors. I must assume that Secretary Rumsfeld is \nfamiliar with them, so it seems that he either believes they no longer \napply, or that our troops no longer have anything to do with most \naspects of Dayton implementation.\n  From Secretary Rumsfeld's published remarks, I get the impression \nthat he sees anything short of actual combat or the separating of \nwarring parties as inappropriate tasks for our soldiers. If he does, I \ndisagree with him. In fact, his view strikes me as the old syndrome of \n``preparing to fight the last war.'' The last two so-called ``Strategic \nConcepts'' of NATO have made clear that the most likely security \nchallenges of the twenty-first century will be ethnic and religious \nstrife, trans-national crime, terrorism and the like--rather than a \nfrontal attack on the territory of alliance members.\n  The details bear examination. Little more than two years ago in this \ncity, NATO celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. At that Washington \nSummit, NATO issued the latest version of its Strategic Concept. I \nwould like to quote several parts of the Strategic Concept in order to \nshow that we and our allies have clearly understood that the military's \nfunction is not bound in a narrow straightjacket.\n  The document, agreed upon by all nineteen NATO members on April 23 \nand 24, 1999, declares in Article 20 that ``large-scale conventional \naggression against the Alliance is highly unlikely.'' It goes on to say \nthe following: ``Ethnic and religious rivalries, territorial disputes, \ninadequate or failed efforts at reform, the abuse of human rights, and \nthe dissolution of states can lead to local and even regional \ninstability.''\n  It then graphically outlines the possible ramifications of such \ndevelopments: ``The resulting tensions could lead to crises affecting \nEuro-Atlantic stability. . . [and] could affect the security of the \nAlliance by spilling over into neighboring countries, including NATO \ncountries, or in other ways, and could also affect the security of \nother states.''\n  Moreover, Article 25 of the 1999 Strategic Concept specifically \nstates that ``The Alliance is committed to a broad approach to \nsecurity, which recognizes the importance of political, economic, \nsocial and environmental factors in addition to the indispensable \ndefense dimension.''\n  How can these factors be addressed? Article 29 mentions the \n``Alliance's ability to contribute to conflict prevention and crisis \nmanagement\n\n[[Page S5530]]\n\nthrough non-Article 5 crisis response operations.''\n  So, clearly NATO, including the United States, is on record as seeing \nthe threats of this new century as being new, complex, and calling for \na variety of responses. In that context the marvelous men and women of \nour armed forces serving in Bosnia and in Kosovo have taken on many \ntasks that military people of earlier generations, trained to stop the \nRed Army from pouring through Germany's Fulda Gap, either do not \nunderstand or believe are beneath the dignity of regular troops.\n  But our troops understand their mission and believe in it. I have \nspoken at length with our soldiers in SFOR in Bosnia and in KFOR in \nKosovo, and the overwhelming majority of them think that their broadly \ndefined pacification activities are making a contribution to lessening \nthe very threats that NATO's Strategic Concept describes.\n  Skeptics may think that I have gained impressions that I wanted to \nget. Fair enough, I'm only human. But statistics don't lie. Every year \nthe Pentagon issues re-enlistment targets for troops based abroad. When \nI stayed at Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo this past winter, I was told that \nthe re-enlistment figures for our Army troops in KFOR were one hundred \nforty-two percent of target--the highest for any foreign-based units in \nthe entire world. Re-enlistment rates in SFOR in Bosnia are also high. \nSo obviously our troops in the field in the Balkans seem to grasp what \nSecretary Rumsfeld apparently does not: that what they are doing is \nimportant to the security of the United States and is not beneath the \ndignity of soldiers.\n\n  I might also add that the charge that our Balkan-based troops lose \ntheir fighting ability has been shown to be another canard used to \ndress up neo-isolationist ideology. In fact, the U.S. Army has a well \nthought out program to restore so-called ``HIC'' or high intensity \nconflict skills to troops rotating out of the Balkans in a short amount \nof time. Equally important is the universally accepted fact that the \ntroops who have served in SFOR and KFOR have acquired leadership skills \nthrough the missions frowned upon by Secretary Rumsfeld, which they \nnever could have gotten sitting in bases in Germany or elsewhere \noutside the Balkans.\n  I understand full well that non-military police forces also have a \nrole to play. That is why several years ago I began calling for the \ncreation of a ``gendarmerie'' force for crowd pacification and \nassistance to refugees returning to their homes. In fact, so-called \n``MSUs'' or Multinational Specialized Units were created in Bosnia. \nUnfortunately, though, their strength has been allowed to decrease. \nU.S. General Mike Dodson, Commander of SFOR, told me that while he once \nhad nineteen MSU units under his control, the number has shrunk to \neleven. They should be beefed up to their former strength.\n  In addition, new local police forces have been created both in the \nFederation and in the Republika Srpska. Some of them are functioning \nwell, others not so well.\n  But neither the MSUs, nor the local police forces, have the clout or \ninspire the fear in the ultra-nationalists that the regular SFOR troops \ndo. We may not like this situation, but we have to face the facts: \nBosnia is not yet fully pacified, and the recipe for curing the unrest \nis exactly the opposite from talking of withdrawing American troops.\n  A few months ago, I stood here and said that we are at a critical \njuncture in Bosnia. The moderate, non-nationalist forces embodied in \nthe ``Alliance for Change'' political coalition had just made \nimportant, even extraordinary, gains by winning, in free and fair \nelections, control of both the national and the Federation parliaments.\n  The hardline ultra-nationalist HDZ Bosnian Croat party has violently \nrefused to yield to its democratic defeat. Rather, it announced that it \nwas creating its own ``self administration'' and withdrew its troops \nfrom the Muslim-Croat Federation Army and from cantonal police forces. \nAn international operation that seized the bank through which the HDZ \nconducted its nefarious activities prompted a violent riot in Mostar in \nwhich serious bloodshed was only narrowly averted. After extreme \npressure from the West the Bosnian Croat ultra-nationalists have \nindicated that they may resume participation in government \ninstitutions, but the situation remains precarious.\n  In the Republika Srpska the hardliners who owe their allegiance to \nindicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic and who are at least \nrhetorically supported by Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica have \nbeen up to their old caveman tactics.\n  Two weeks ago they broke up a ceremony in Banja Luka in which the \ncornerstone was to have been laid to rebuild the great Ferhadija \nMosque, destroyed by Bosnian Serbs in the early 1990s. They trapped two \nhundred Bosnian and international officials for several hours before \nthey were rescued. As a nice reminder of their lofty cultural level, \nthe Bosnian Serb thugs burned Muslim prayer rugs and let a pig loose on \nthe mosque grounds. Incidentally, although President Kostunica \ncriticized this barbarity, he added that the reconstruction of such \nbuildings was a provocation!\n  Ultra-nationalists have also rioted in Trebinje and elsewhere against \nreturning refugees.\n  In short, the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is hardly pacified. \nIt is a time of great opportunity, for the hardline Serbs and Croats \nare reacting to their dwindling power. But it is also a time fraught \nwith danger.\n  For example, one strictly military task remaining to be accomplished \nis the amalgamation of the rival armies. If the U.S. forces, and SFOR, \nwould withdraw before this occurs, renewed warfare would almost \ncertainly break out. Instead of publicly musing about exit strategies, \nwe need to be stressing our country's commitment to helping Bosnia and \nHerzegovina move once and for all beyond the domination of the corrupt \nultra-nationalist parties.\n\n  Moreover, rather than setting artificially limited goals for our \nmilitary and then congratulating ourselves on fulfilling them, we need \nto utilize SFOR to kill the serpent that continues to poison Bosnian \nlife: by apprehending the more than three dozen individuals indicted by \nThe International Criminal Tribunal at The Hague for war crimes who are \ncurrently living with impunity in the Republika Srpska. This rogues' \ngallery includes, above all, Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic--who, \naccording to Carla Del Ponte, the Chief Prosecutor of The Hague War \nCrimes Tribunal, enjoys the protection of a security detail that is \npaid for by the Yugoslav army.\n  SFOR claims that it doesn't know where Karadzic and Mladic are. Well, \nMrs. Del Ponte, with whom I met earlier this month, has offered to use \nher tribunal's capabilities to locate Karadzic and Mladic for SFOR. I \nthink we should take her up on her offer. As long as these two mass \nmurderers are on the loose, there will be no definitive peace in \nBosnia. Our British allies have not been squeamish about undertaking \nrisky operations to nab individuals indicted for war crimes. We must \nget Karadzic and Mladic, and, if necessary, the U.S. Army should be \ninvolved.\n  The linchpin to the strategy of pacifying and democratizing Bosnia \nand Herzegovina is a continued robust U.S. military presence in SFOR.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld's comments are bound to boost the spirits of the \nultra-nationalist hardliners who, according to a recent report \npublished by the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and \nResearch, ``are gambling . . . that [if] they can intimidate or just \noutlast the international community, they may still succeed in dividing \nBosnia into ethnic states.''\n  Moreover, I am certain that the Secretary's comments have reignited \nconcerns among our European allies that they will be left holding the \nbag in Bosnia.\n  In the Washington Post interview, Secretary Rumsfeld stressed that \nthere was no friction between him and Secretary of State Colin Powell \non this issue.\n  His comments, however, appear to directly undercut Secretary's \nPowell's repeated assurances to our European allies during the past \nseveral months that the United States ``will not cut and run'' from the \nBalkans, and that ``we went in together with our allies and we'll go \nout together.''\n  What on earth is going on here?\n  Just as Secretary Powell has spent the last six months trying to undo \nthe damage done by similarly ill-considered unilateralist comments in a \nNew\n\n[[Page S5531]]\n\nYork Times interview by Condoleeza Rice, now the President's National \nSecurity Advisor, so the Bush Administration spin-doctors were quick to \ntry to explain away the Rumsfeld interview by asserting that his \nproposals were only part of a process by which we intend to use NATO's \nSix Month Reviews to reduce our combat troops in Bosnia.\n  Well, if that's the case, we have a case of ``choose your poison.'' \nOne possibility is that the Bush Administration is, once again, \ninternally out of control as President Bush showed by cutting off EPA \nChief Christine Todd Whitman at the knees on carbon dioxide and \nSecretary Powell on his sensible support of South Korea's ``sunshine \npolicy.''\n  The other possibility is that Secretaries Powell and Rumsfeld are, \nindeed, on the same page, and that ``in together, out together'' really \nmeans that the United States intends to use its unparalleled influence \nwithin NATO to force our allies to join us in a precipitous withdrawal \nbefore the mission in Bosnia is successfully completed.\n  Given the choice, I'd opt for poison number one, and wait for this \nAdministration to finally get its act together. But I fear that poison \nnumber two is the more likely scenario.\n  If my fears prove correct, and we withdraw our troops, I predict that \nrenewed fighting in Bosnia is just a matter of time. This next round \nwould be bloody, and, inevitably, we would have to go back in again, at \nmuch greater cost in men and materiel. Because no matter how much my \nneo-isolationist friends salivate at the idea of sitting on the \nsidelines while the European Union's European Security and Defense \nPolicy rapid-reaction force takes care of things--they will be sorely \ndisappointed, because for the foreseeable future ESDP will need massive \nAmerican support to function.\n  You know, I think this town has a great many very intelligent \nindividuals, and Secretary Rumsfeld is one of the brightest of the \nbunch. It's difficult for me to understand how even the most Asia-\ncentered, or missile defense-centered person, can believe that their \nnew foreign policy emphases have a chance of succeeding if Europe is \nnot stable. And with the Balkans still erupting, Europe will not be \nstable.\n  So let's all reread NATO's Strategic Concept and not view our \nmilitary's tasks through a twentieth century prism. Let's listen to our \nmen and women on the ground in the Balkans. Let's listen to our \ndiplomats who know full well that a stepped up, resolute effort at \nDayton implementation--backed up by a still robust SFOR--is what is \ncalled for. Let's stop talking about accelerated exit strategies before \nthe mission is successfully accomplished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/23/senate-section/article/S5531-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NOMINATION ANNOUNCEMENT\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, today I recognize National Missing \nChildren's Day and the great work of the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children, NCMEC. The NCMEC has made an unmatched \ncontribution in the area of missing children recovery.\n  At their annual Congressional Breakfast this morning, the NCMEC \nhonored law enforcement officers from around the country for their \nexemplary performance in recovering missing children and in \napprehending child sex offenders. Last year, we honored a Vermonter at \nthis event for his extraordinary work in tracking down a child \nexploitation offender.\n  In 1999, I helped pass legislation that authorized funding for the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children and I am pleased to \nsee its continued success. Since 1984, when the Center was established, \nit has handled more than 1.4 million calls through its national Hotline \n1-800-THE-LOST; trained more than 161,728 police and other \nprofessionals; and published more than 20 million publications that are \ndistributed free of charge. The Center has worked with law enforcement \non more than 75,283 missing child cases, resulting in the recovery of \n50,605 children.\n  In 1998 the Center launched the CyberTipline which allows Internet \nusers to report suspicious or illegal activity, including child \npornography and online enticement of children for sexual exploitation. \nSince its launch in 1998, the CyberTipline has received close to 37,000 \nleads with many of those leading to arrests.\n  I applaud the ongoing work of the Center, its President, Ernie Allen, \nand all those dedicated employees and volunteers who make this good \nwork possible. I wish them continued success in the area of missing \nchildren recovery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/23/senate-section/article/S5531-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy last month. The \nLocal law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current \nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a heinous crime that occurred May 17, 2000 \nin Holbrook, Massachusetts. A grand jury indicted a 17-year-old high \nschool student on seven charges for attacking a fellow student he \nbelieved to be gay. For five months prior to the attack, the \nperpetrator allegedly harassed the victim. In the attack, which \noccurred in the school cafeteria, the perpetrator hit the victim five \nor six times in the head before knocking him to the floor. The attack \nleft the victim with a punctured eardrum and internal bleeding.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate.

Mr. President, S. 805, introduced on May 1, is a vital \nstep toward the day when advanced research will find ways to halt, and \neven to cure, the maladies of muscular dystrophy.\n  Muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder, actually, nine separate \ngenetic disorders, that cause wasting of muscle tissue throughout the \nbody. A quarter of a million Americans of all ages suffer from the \ndisease. One form of it, Duchenne's, strikes young boys, and usually \ntakes their lives before they reach their twentieth birthday. All forms \nof it are disabling and costly.\n  Many millions of Americans know about muscular dystrophy and \ncontribute to its relief because since 1966 the entertainer Jerry Lewis \nhas conducted a telethon on Labor Day, calling the nation's attention \nto muscular dystrophy, and asking help for its victims and their \nfamilies. The Muscular Dystrophy Association, which Jerry Lewis chairs, \nhas raised hundreds of millions of dollars for the treatment and relief \nof this disease. It supports over two hundred clinics, and makes \nwheelchairs and braces available to people suffering from muscular \ndystrophy.\n  Part of the money the association raises, about $30 million yearly, \ngoes to support research projects. But if the breakthroughs are to \noccur that will enable scientists not just to treat, but to halt the \ndisease, research funding must be substantially increased. This is the \npurpose of S. 805.\n  It calls upon NIH and the Centers for Disease Control to establish \nCenters of Excellence, in which intensified clinical research can be \nconducted that will speed the discovery of cures for the various forms \nof muscular dystrophy.\n  It provides the Director of the NIH, and the Directors of the several \ninstitutes within NIH where research into muscular dystrophy is being \nconducted, with authority and responsibility to concentrate and \nintensify that research effort, with the funds needed to conduct \nclinical trials. In short, it gives NIH the organization and the \nmandate to exploit recent advances in gene therapy. The goal is the \nswiftest possible rescue for children and adults whose lives will \notherwise be lost or badly damaged by muscular dystrophy.\n\n[[Page S5532]]\n\n  I commend my colleagues for introducing S. 805, and I ask that my \nname be added as a co-sponsor of the bill at its next printing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/23/senate-section/article/S5532-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HONORING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it is my privilege today to commend the \nUniversity of Minnesota, its students, staff faculty, alumni and \nsupporters for its long history of excellence and accomplishments. The \nUniversity of Minnesota celebrates its 150th anniversary this year as \none of the Nation's great public universities.\n  The University was established in 1851, six years prior to the \nfounding of Minnesota as a state. It began as a small preparatory \nschool and operated without State or Federal funding.\n  During the Civil was the University went through a series of trying \nfinancial times, but was greatly lifted when Congress passed the Morril \nLand Grant Act in 1862.\n  Signed by President Abraham Lincoln, this act gifted over 100,000 \nacres of land for public use in Minnesota, and called for the creation \nof a perpetual public fund.\n  The interest on this fund was to go towards, in the historic words of \nthe document, ``the endowment, support, and maintenance of at least one \ncollege where the leading object shall be, without excluding other \nscientific and classical studies, and including military tactics, to \nteach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and \nmechanical arts . . . in order to promote the liberal and practical \neducation of the industrial classes in several pursuits and professions \nin life.''\n  In 1869 William Watts Folwell was inaugurated as the first president \nof the University. At that time there were only nine faculty members \nand 18 students. Today the University of Minnesota system is home to \nnearly 60,000 undergraduate and graduate students under the direction \nof President Mark Yudof.\n  As a land-grant institution, the University of Minnesota with its \ncampuses in Crookston, Duluth, Morris and the Twin Cities has earned \ndistinction as one of the most prestigious and competitive public \nuniversity systems in the nation.\n  Since the first two bachelors of arts degrees were awarded in 1873, \nthe university has granted over 549,000 undergraduate degrees and \n25,000 Ph.D.'s in over 373 fields of study. Such rich academic \ndiversity has allowed for students to walk in step with their dreams.\n  The University of Minnesota has fostered an environment for high-\nstandards of education, academic achievement, and public service. It \nconducts some 300 programs serving children and youth, and students and \nstaff of the University work with over 700,000 Minnesotans every year \non issues ranging from agricultural research, health and medical \nsciences, to social development. The University of Minnesota is also a \nmajor source of employment, providing work for more than 100,000 \nMinnesotans.\n  As a major research institution the University has produced scholars \nof national and international distinction, including 13 faculty members \nand alumni who have been awarded Nobel Prizes, including the Nobel \nPeace Prize.\n  Alumni, faculty and staff have also developed a strong tradition of \ngiving back to the University, beginning with historic philanthropist \nand University Regent, John Sargent Pillsbury in 1867, and continuing \ntoday. Private donations, grants and scholarship funds, along with \nFederal and State funds help the University of Minnesota to provide \nstudents with the necessary resources for a world-class education.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota I take pride in congratulating the \nUniversity of Minnesota, with its solid and colorful academic history, \non its 150th year of excellence. The State of Minnesota and the nation \nshall continue to benefit greatly from the efforts of this fine public \nuniversity.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I join the senior Senator from Minnesota, \nPaul Wellstone in honoring the 150 year anniversary of the University \nof Minnesota. The many milestones so aptly described by Senator \nWellstone illustrate the distinguished history of one of America's \ngreat land grant schools. From the most humble beginnings in 1851, \nbefore Minnesota could call itself a State, the University established \nitself, as a small preparatory school. Today, it is a premier land \ngrant University, with a major medical school, an Institute of \nTechnology, School of Agriculture and three campuses in greater \nMinnesota. The University serves nearly 60,000 undergraduate and \ngraduate students.\n  The value of any great learning institution is measured both within \nits hallowed, academic halls as well as beyond the geographic borders \nof a central campus. The University of Minnesota Twin Cities has long \nbeen considered one of the Nation's top 25 public research \nuniversities. The University also serves a large and diverse state by \nreaching young people through the campuses at Morris, Crookston, and \nDuluth. In addition, the University has formed a unique partnership \nwith the Rochester Community and Technical College, and Winona State \nUniversity to form the University Center at Rochester.\n  Each of these campuses has its own identity, and adds a unique \ndimension to the University, and to the State. Rochester, the newest \ncampus, is a joint venture with three different institutions and two \nacademic systems. Because of this partnership, a student attending the \nUniversity Center at Rochester can pursue a doctorate program or \ncertificate. Established in 1959, the University of Minnesota, Morris \nis today considered one of the top three public liberal arts \ninstitutions in the country. University of Minnesota, Crookston \nattracts nearly 3,000 students, earning one of U.S. News and World \nReport's Best College rankings and Wired Magazine's Most Wired Campus \nDesignation. And, the University of Minnesota Duluth, ranked as one of \nthe 12 best Midwest regional public universities, serves the academic \nneeds of the State with a comprehensive undergraduate and graduate \nprogram. Equally important, UMD is a vitally active partner in the \neconomic development of Northern Minnesota.\n  We celebrate the University's Sesquicentennial by looking back \nthrough the long lens of a history rich with the achievements that have \ninformed the people of our great State. These are the accomplishments \nin which the University of Minnesota played a key role. They include \nhelping Minnesotans develop a strong agricultural economy, building a \nglobal reputation in medical sciences, establishing the relationship \nbetween the University's intellectual resources and community service, \nand forging an academic base, providing the brainpower that has carried \nMinnesotans into the new millennium. While we celebrate the \nUniversity's past, we recognize that it is a part of our present and \nour future. It educates our children, grows our economy, and evaluates \nour decisions with sound research and good science.\n  I join all Minnesotans in celebrating the University of Minnesota's \n150th anniversary. I know there will be many more productive years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/23/senate-section/article/S5532-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5532-S5533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             UNBORN VICTIMS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize a group of \npeople who are often overlooked--the unborn. Recently, the House has \npassed legislation that would protect this defenseless group from \nviolent attacks. The Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2001 would make \nit a crime to assault or murder an unborn child.\n  Recently, I have come across several compelling stories that show the \nimportance of this legislation. One such story is of Tracy Marcinlak of \nWisconsin. On February 8, 1992, Tracy was pregnant with her son, \nZachariah, who was due to be born in four days. That night, Tracy's \nhusband, Glendale Black, brutally beat her and refused to let her get \nhelp. Eventually relenting, her husband let her call an ambulance and \nTracy was rushed to the hospital. Little Zachariah was delivered by an \nemergency Caesarean section. It was too late. He had bled to death from \nblunt-force trauma.\n  Unfortunately, in 1992, Wisconsin did not have an unborn victims law \nand state prosecutors were unable to convict Tracy's husband under a \nlaw that required them to prove that he intended to kill Zachariah. He \nwas only convicted of assaulting Tracy. Glendale\n\n[[Page S5533]]\n\nBlack, who murdered his own son, is already eligible for parole.\n  In response to violent acts such as this, the Wisconsin legislature \npassed one of the nation's strongest unborn victims laws in 1998. \nHowever, even today, there is no federal law to prosecute criminals who \nkill unborn children. The Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2001 would \ncorrect this injustice. Under this law, people like Glendale Black, who \nkill their unborn children, will be prosecuted in the same manner as if \nthey had murdered someone who is already born.\n  I applaud my colleagues in the House for passing this important \nlegislation as it will give unborn children a fundamental right--the \nright to live. Many of our forefathers fought and died to make this a \nbasic right for all Americans. Today, the fight continues. I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate will join me in this fight and vote yes to the \nUnborn Victims of Violence Act of 2001.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/23/senate-section/article/S5533-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ROCKY BOY/NORTH CENTRAL MONTANA WATER SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to voice my support for the Rocky \nBoy/North Central Montana Regional Water System Act of 2001. I join \nSenator Burns, Representative Rehberg, and Governor Martz in \nrecognizing the problem that the Chippewa Cree Tribe and other Montana \nresidents in the surrounding area face in getting clean, affordable \ndrinking water. The population of the Rocky Boy Reservation, which grew \nby over 40 percent in the last decade, is dangerously underserved. Many \nother residents in the North Central Montana area are completely \nwithout water service, and the problem is worsening because of the \ndrought conditions plaguing our State. Many families must haul in their \nown water, or pay to have it delivered. This is just unacceptable.\n  Within the region, many homes can turn on the faucet in the kitchen \nor bathroom and see a black liquid come pouring out. Others are \nexposing their families to dangerously high levels of arsenic. I ask my \ncolleagues if they would be willing to subject their husbands, wives, \nand children to these water quality issues? The situation has become so \ndesperate that the current area water systems have ``qualified'' for \nthe EPA's Significant Non-compliance list. I say again, this is \nunacceptable.\n  Without a reliable, accessible safe drinking water source, North \nCentral Montana cannot diversify its economy or encourage future \neconomic growth.\n  The Rocky Boy/North Central Montana Regional Water System Act would \naddress these important water needs by constructing a Regional Water \nSystem. The system would involve fifteen participants, eight water \ndistricts, and six municipalities. It would cover a six-county region, \nand its service area would span more than 10,000 miles. By allowing \ncurrent water systems to cooperate under a larger regional framework, \nthe proposal will allow for more efficient management.\n  For the Chippewa Cree Tribe, the Act would represent the fulfilment \nof a Water Compact which was ratified by the Montana Legislature and \nsigned by President Clinton in December, 1999. The Compact guaranteed \nthe Tribe a 10,000 acre feet water allocation from the Tiber Reservoir \nsouth of Chester. In order to honor this agreement, the Act authorizes \nthe construction of a water treatment plant at Tiber Reservoir, along \nwith the 50 miles of pipeline necessary to connect the Reservoir and \nthe Reservation.\n  The Rocky Boy/North Central Montana Regional Water System Act is also \nextremely important to other Montana households as well in the area, in \nfact, it is important to over 7000 additional households. Fourteen off-\nreservation towns and counties have expressed their interest in the \nprogram by signing an Interlocal Agreement to create the North Central \nMontana Regional Water Authority. The Authority is the legal entity, \nrequired under Montana law, that will administer the non-tribal \ncomponents of the regional system.\n  This project is important to me and to North Central Montana. Water \nis life and without it our communities cannot continue to flourish and \ngrow. This region in Montana is economically very important to our \nstate. But, if they don't have clean, safe water to drink, their \neconomic future looks uncertain. How will their business continue to \nexpand? How can you build new houses? The answer is simple. They will \nnot and you cannot. Without water, all growth and progress stops.\n  That is why I will do everything I can to see that this project is \nauthorized and funded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/23/senate-section/article/S5533-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5533-S5535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE SAVINGS OPPORTUNITY AND CHARITABLE GIVING ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today, I rise on behalf of legislation \nwhich I have introduced with Senator Joe Lieberman, S. 592, The Savings \nOpportunity and Charitable Giving Act of 2001. Other bipartisan \ncosponsors of the underlying bill include Senators Hutchinson, Durbin, \nBrownback, Landrieu, Lugar, Bayh, DeWine, Miller, Kyl, Johnson, Bob \nSmith, Sessions, and Cochran. The amendment number is 655.\n  I am disappointed that we have not included in H.R. 1836 the key tax \nrelief provisions of the President's Faith-Based Initiatives to expand \ncharitable giving opportunities and incentives for all Americans and \nexpansion of savings opportunities through Individual Development \nAccounts (IDAs) which President Bush also endorsed in his campaign and \nincluded in his budget. Just yesterday, in a speech at Notre Dame \nUniversity, President Bush reaffirmed his vision and support for these \ninitiatives in the effort to enable the community renewal and poverty \nalleviation efforts throughout this country. I will continue to work \nwith the President and my colleagues to create additional opportunities \nto advance this initiative this year.\n  Representatives J.C. Watts, Jr. and Tony Hall have introduced a \nsimilar measure in the House of Representatives along with Speaker \nHastert, H.R. 7, the ``Community Solutions Act of 2001.'' Charitable or \nBeneficiary Choice expansion, charitable donations liability reform, \nand other provisions will be introduced in the Senate, but on a \nseparate track from the tax provisions which have already been \nintroduced in S. 592 and reflect two-thirds of the President's initial \nfaith-based proposals.\n  Success in today's new economy is defined less and less by how much \nyou earn and more and more by how much you own--your asset base. This \nis great news for the millions of middle-class homeowners who are \ntapped into America's economic success, but it is bad news for those \nwho are simply tapped out--those with no assets and little hope of \naccumulating the means for upward mobility and real financial security. \nThis widening asset gap was underscored in a report issued earlier this \nyear by the Federal Reserve. The Fed found that while the net worth of \nthe typical family has risen substantially in recent years, it has \nactually dropped substantially for low-income families.\n  Statistics: For families with annual incomes of less than $10,000, \nthe median net worth dipped from $4,800 in 1995 to $3,600 in 1998. For \nfamilies with incomes between $10,000 and $25,000, the median net worth \nfell from $31,000 to $24,800 over the same period. The rate of home \nownership among low-income families has dropped as well. For families \nmaking less than $10,000, it went from 36.1 percent to 34.5 percent \nfrom 1995 to 1998; for those making between $10,000 and $25,000, it \nfell from 54.9 percent to 51.7 percent.\n  How do we reverse this troubling trend? IDAs are the unfinished \nbusiness of the Community Renewal and New Markets Empowerment \ninitiatives which became law in December of 2000 and will increase job \nopportunities and renew hope in what have been hopeless places. But to \nsustain this hope, we must provide opportunities for individuals and \nfamilies to build tangible assets and acquire stable wealth.\n  Our legislation is aimed at fixing our nation's growing gap in asset \nownership, which keeps millions of low-income workers from achieving \nthe American dream. Most public attention focuses on our growing income \ngap. Though the booming American economy has delivered significant \nincome gains to the nation's upper-income earners, lower-income workers \nhave been left on the sidelines. This suggests to some that closing \nthis divide between the have-mosts and the have-leasts is simply a \nmatter of raising\n\n[[Page S5534]]\n\nwages. But the reality is that the income gap is a symptom of a larger, \nmore complicated problem.\n  How do we do this? We believe that the marketplace can provide such \nopportunity. Non-profit groups around the country have launched \ninnovative private programs that are achieving great success in \ntransforming the ``unbanked''--people who have never had a bank \naccount--into unabashed capitalists. Through IDAs, banks and credit \nunions offer special savings accounts to low-income Americans and match \ntheir deposits dollar-for-dollar. In return, participants take an \neconomic literacy course and commit to using their savings to buy a \nhome, upgrade their education or to start a business.\n  Thousands of people are actively saving today through IDA programs in \nabout 250 neighborhoods nationwide. In one demonstration project \nundertaken by the Corporation for Enterprise Development (CFED), a \nleading IDA promoter, 1,300 families have already saved $329,000, which \nhas leveraged an additional $742,000.\n  While the growth of IDAs has been encouraging, access to IDA programs \nis still limited and scattered across the nation. The IDA provision of \nthis legislation will expand IDA access nationwide by providing a \nsignificant tax credit to financial institutions and community groups \nthat offer IDA accounts. This credit would reimburse banks for the \nfirst $500 of matching funds they contribute, thus significantly \nlowering the cost of offering IDAs. Other state and private funds can \nalso be used to provide an additional match to savings. It also \nbenefits our economy, the long-term stability of which is threatened by \nour pitiful national savings rate. In fact, according to some \nestimates, every $1 invested in an IDA returns $5 to the national \neconomy.\n  What are IDAs? IDAs are matched savings accounts for working \nAmericans restricted to three uses: (1) buying a first home; (2) \nreceiving post-secondary education or training; or (3) starting \nor expanding a small business. Individual and matching deposits are not \nco-mingled; all matching dollars are kept in a separate, parallel \naccount. When the account holder has accumulated enough savings and \nmatching funds to purchase the asset (typically over two to four \nyears), and has completed a financial education course, payments from \nthe IDA will be made directly to the asset provider.\n\n  Financial institutions (or their contractual affiliates) would be \nreimbursed for all matching funds provided plus a limited amount of the \nprogram and administrative costs incurred (whether directly or through \ncollaborations with other entities). Specifically, the IDA Tax Credit \nwould be the aggregate amount of all dollar-for-dollar matches provided \n(up to $500 per person per year), plus a one-time $100 per account \ncredit for financial education, recruiting, marketing, administration, \nwithdrawals, etc., plus an annual $30 per account credit for the \nadministrative cost of maintaining the account. To be eligible for the \nmatch, adjusted gross income may not exceed $20,000 (single), $25,000 \n(head of household), or $40,000 (married).\n  Supporters: President Bush has expressed support for IDAs in his \ncampaign and included them in his budget and we are working with the \nAdministration to coordinate efforts. Supporting groups include the \nCredit Union National Association, the Financial Services Roundtable, \nthe Corporation for Enterprise Development, the National Association of \nHomebuilders, the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, the \nNational Federation of Community Development Credit Unions, the \nNational Council for La Raza, and others.\n  Individual Development Accounts, combined with other community \ndevelopment and wealth creation opportunities, are a first step towards \nrestoring faith in the longstanding American promise of equal \nopportunity. That faith has been shaken by stark divisions of income \nand wealth in our society. With the leadership of President Bush and \nSpeaker Hastert, I am hopeful, along with our other cosponsors, that \nCongress will take this first step toward restoring the long-cherished \nAmerican ideals of rewarding hard work, encouraging responsibility, and \nexpanding savings opportunity this year.\n  The charitable giving incentives provision will initially allow non-\nitemizers to deduct 50 percent of their charitable giving, after they \nexceed a cumulative total of $500 in annual donations ($1,000 for joint \nfilers). The deduction will be phased into a 100 percent deduction over \nthe course of 5 years in 10 percent increments. Under current law non-\nitemizers receive no additional tax benefit for their charitable \ncontributions.\n  More than 84 million Americans cannot deduct any of their charitable \ncontributions because they do not itemize their tax returns. In \ncontrast, there are 34 million Americans who itemize and receive this \nbenefit. For example, in Pennsylvania, there are nearly 4 million \ntaxpayers who do not itemize deductions while slightly more than 1.5 \nmillion taxpayers do itemize.\n  While Americans are already giving generously to charities making a \nsignificant positive impact in our communities, this provision provides \nan incentive for additional giving and allows non-itemizers who \ntypically have middle to lower middle incomes to also benefit from \nadditional tax relief. In fact, non-itemizers earning less than $30,000 \ngive the highest percentage of their household income to charity. It is \nestimated that restoring this tax relief provision to merely 50 percent \nwhich existed in the 1980's would encourage more than $3 billion of \nadditional charitable giving a year. The phased in increase to 100 \npercent will result in even more additional giving. The floor is \nincluded because the standard personal deduction encompasses initial \ncontributions.\n  One important dimension of promoting charitable efforts helping to \nrevitalize our communities, empower individuals and families, and \nenhance educational opportunities is encouraging charitable giving. \nThis legislation is a great opportunity to lower the tax burden on the \nmany Americans who have not received any tax relief for their \ncharitable contributions since 1986.\n  The IRA charitable rollover allows individuals to roll assets from an \nIRA into a charity or a deferred charitable gift plan without incurring \nany income tax consequences. The donation would be made to charity \ndirectly without ever withdrawing it as income and paying taxes on it.\n  The rollover can be made as an outright gift, for a charitable \nremainder annuity trust, charitable remainder unitrust or pooled income \nfund, or for the issuance of a charitable annuity. The donor would not \nreceive a charitable deduction. This incentive should assist charitable \ngiving in education, social service, and religious charitable efforts.\n  Food banks are finding it increasingly difficult to meet the demand \nfor food assistance. In the past, food banks have benefitted from the \ninefficiencies of manufacturing, including the over-production of \nmerchandise and the manufacturing of cosmetically-flawed products. \nHowever, technology has made businesses and manufacturers significantly \nmore efficient. Although beneficial to the company's bottom-line, \ndonations have lessened as a result. The fact is that the demand on our \nnation's church pantries, soup kitchens and shelters continues to rise, \ndespite our economy.\n  According to an August 2000 report on Hunger Security by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, 31 million Americans (around 10 percent of \nour citizens) are living on the edge of hunger. Although this number \nhas declined by 12 percent since 1995, everyone agrees that this figure \nremains too high.\n  Unfortunately, many food banks cannot meet this increased demand for \nfood. A December '99 study by the U.S. Conference of Mayors found that \nrequests for emergency food assistance increased by an average of 18 \npercent in American cities over the previous year and 21 percent of \nemergency food requests could not be met. Statistics by the United \nStates Department of Agriculture show that up to 96 billion pounds of \nfood goes to waste each year in the United States. If a small \npercentage of this wasted food could be redirected to food banks, we \ncould make important strides in our fight against hunger. In many ways, \ncurrent law is a hindrance to food donations.\n  The tax code provides corporations with a special deduction for \ndonations\n\n[[Page S5535]]\n\nto food banks, but it excludes farmers, ranchers and restaurant owners \nfrom donating food under the same tax incentive. For many of these \nbusinesses, it is actually more cost effective to throw away food than \ndonate it to charity. The hunger relief community believes that these \nchanges will markedly increase food donations--whether it is a farmer \ndonating his crop, a restaurant owner contributing excess meals, or a \nfood manufacturer producing specifically for charity.\n  This bipartisan legislation was introduced separately by Senators \nLugar and Leahy with 13 additional cosponsors including myself. It has \nbeen endorsed by a diverse set of organizations, including America's \nSecond Harvest Food Banks, the Salvation Army, the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, the National Farmers Union, the National Restaurant \nAssociation, and the Grocery Manufacturers of America.\n  Under current law, when a corporation donates food to a food bank, it \nis eligible to receive a ``special rule'' tax deduction. Unfortunately, \nmost companies have found that the ``special rule'' deduction does not \nallow them to recoup their actual production costs. Moreover, current \nlaw limits the ``special rule'' deduction only to corporations, thus \nprohibiting farmers, ranchers, small businesses and restaurant owners \nfrom receiving the same tax benefits afforded to corporations.\n  This provision would encourage additional food donations through \nthree changes to our tax laws:\n  Expand Deduction to All Business Taxpayers: This bill will extend the \n``special rule'' tax deduction for food donations now afforded only to \ncorporations to all business taxpayers, including farmers and \nrestaurant owners.\n  Enhance Deduction for Food Donations: This legislation will increase \nthe tax deduction for donated food from basis plus \\1/2\\ markup to the \nfair market value of the product, not to exceed twice the product's \nbasis.\n  Codify Lucky Stores Decision: This bill will codify the Tax Court \nruling in Lucky Stores, Inc. v. IRS, in which the Court found that \ntaxpayers should base the determination of fair market value of donated \nproduct on recent sales.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in this important bipartisan \neffort to increase savings opportunities for lower income working \nAmericans, to encourage the charitable giving of all Americans, to \nprovide additional resources for the charitable organizations which \nserve their communities, and to encourage additional donations of food \nto alleviate hunger. I would also like to thank President Bush for his \nleadership in this critical area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/23/senate-section/article/S5535-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, since 1963, the month of May has \nhelped the nation focus on the contributions and achievements of \nAmerica's older citizens. Fewer people over the age of 65 require \nnursing home care and more are living on their own, with little or no \noutside help. Older Americans increasingly redefine modern maturity, \nre-shape cultural boundaries and dispel age-related stereotypes \nassociated with getting older. They are leaders in our families, in our \nworkplaces and in our communities.\n  One of these leaders is a 71-year-old man from Davenport, Iowa. Larry \nSinclair understands the value of helping others. Through his \ninitiative, compassion, and commitment, he has touched the lives of \nmany in the Davenport community.\n  Originally from Maine, Mr. Sinclair and his wife, Sylvia, moved to \nDavenport in 1959. A 33-year veteran of the Rock Island Arsenal, Mr. \nSinclair became involved with helping seniors after his retirement. At \nthe time, his mother in Maine was suffering from Alzheimer's Disease \nand the distance prevented Mr. Sinclair from helping his sister care \nfor her on a regular basis.\n  After hearing a presentation at church about respite assistance for \ncaregivers, Mr. Sinclair decided it was time to get involved. Although \nhe couldn't go to Maine to give his sister the respite she needed, he \ncould provide help to caregivers in Davenport. For eight years, Mr. \nSinclair volunteered up to 10 hours a week to provide relief to \ncaregivers in the community. Although he is no longer actively involved \nin the program, he still keeps in touch with several of families that \nhe worked with over the years.\n  Mr. Sinclair's commitment to seniors in the community has been \ninstrumental in the success of one of the few all-volunteer congregate \nmeal sites in Iowa. Eleven years ago, Mr. Sinclair helped establish the \nmeal site at his church. Every Tuesday, he and his wife spend the their \nday serving a meal to 25-30 seniors. Mr. and Mrs. Sinclair do \neverything from meal pick-up in the morning to clean-up in the \nafternoon. Although Mr. Sinclair has the formal title of meal site \nmanager, he gives much of the credit to his wife. He says the two of \nthem make a ``pretty good team.''\n  Mr. Sinclair also is highly active in the Great River Bend Area \nAgency on Aging. He has been a member of the agency's policy board for \nthe past six years, serving as its president last year and vice \npresident this year. As an Operation Restore Trust volunteer he makes \npresentations to various senior groups, nursing homes and assisted \nliving facilities about Medicare fraud and abuse. He has served as a \ndelegate to aging association meetings in Washington, DC, and he is a \nmember of the agency's nutrition committee and services committee.\n  In 1959, Mr. Sinclair became a charter member of the West Park \nPresbyterian Church and he is still actively involved in serving the \ncongregation. Friends know that if they need help, Mr. Sinclair is the \nfirst one to call. He serves as an elder in the church and chairman of \nthe committee that is responsible for programming church activities and \nfundraisers. Mr. Sinclair says he feels it is important for people like \nhim, who have the time to help, to do what they can to keep the church \ngrowing for younger members.\n  A devoted family man, Mr. Sinclair has been married to his wife \nSylvia for 50 years. The couple has three daughters, four grandchildren \nand one great-grandchild. Mr. Sinclair stays physically active by \nwalking with his wife three miles a day. In addition, he enjoys golfing \nand biking.\n  With all of these activities, Mr. Sinclair's friends sometimes wonder \nif he is one of those people who just can't say no. But, Mr. Sinclair \nrefutes that characterization, saying he chooses not to say no because \nhe enjoys what he does.\n  I want to thank Mr. Sinclair for his contributions to the Davenport \ncommunity. His initiative and compassionate concern for others is an \nexample to us all that we should always be willing to help others, no \nmatter what our age.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/23/senate-section/article/S5535-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5535-S5536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DR.

HARMON FROM THE U.S. EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \naccomplishments of James A. Harmon, the outgoing Chairman of the \nExport-Import Bank of the United States. When Chairman Harmon steps \ndown from this position on May 25, he will have served Ex-Im Bank for 4 \nyears, one of the longest terms as Chairman in the Bank's history.\n  Chairman Harmon came to Ex-Im Bank in 1997 after a distinguished 38-\nyear career as an investment banker in New York. He brought his wealth \nof private sector experience to Washington and immediately set about \nthe task of enhancing Ex-Im Bank's ability to achieve its important \nmission, supporting U.S. jobs through exports.\n  One of the early challenges he had to face was the global financial \ncrisis that hit Asia and other emerging markets in 1997-98. Recognizing \nthe important role Ex-Im Bank could play in this crisis, Chairman \nHarmon directed the Bank to extend much needed credit to many of the \nimpacted Asian nations to keep trade flowing between this region and \nthe United States. Perhaps the most dramatic example was in South \nKorea, where Ex-Im Bank provided $1 billion of short-term export credit \ninsurance for South Korean banks that allowed South Korean businesses \nto purchase urgently needed raw materials and equipment from the United \nStates. Ex-Im Bank supported more than 2,400 transactions in South \nKorea during this crucial period, compared to less than 60 the prior \nyear. Ex-Im Bank also worked to shore up the struggling Asian markets \nby coordinating assistance for the region from the other major export \ncredit agencies. Ex-Im Bank's aggressive response to the Asian \nfinancial crisis helped stabilize these economies and keep U.S. goods \nand services flowing to the region until commercial financing was once \nagain available.\n  Under Chairman Harmon's leadership, Ex-Im Bank forged into new \nmarkets in an effort to increase opportunities for U.S. exporters. I am \nparticularly pleased to cite the Bank's expanded involvement in Africa. \nDuring Chairman Harmon's tenure, Ex-Im Bank unveiled new programs for \nfacilitating U.S. exports to sub-Saharan Africa and expanded the number \nof countries in this region for which financing support is available. \nNotably, Chairman Harmon demonstrated his personal commitment to sub-\nSaharan Africa by traveling to the region three times, becoming the \nfirst Ex-Im Bank Chairman to visit southern Africa. The results of \nthese efforts have been dramatic. Ex-Im Bank support for transactions \nin sub-Saharan Africa rose from $50 million in 1998 to nearly $1 \nbillion in 2000. I know from my own visits to sub-Saharan Africa the \nvital importance of increased U.S. trade with the region and I commend \nChairman Harmon for his efforts.\n  Ex-Im Bank also enhanced its presence in Russia and the New \nIndependent States, developing innovative financing structures that \nallowed U.S. exporters to capitalize on the vast opportunities of this \nmarket. In June 2000, Ex-Im Bank launched a Southeast Europe Initiative \nto develop U.S. trade opportunities in Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, \nBulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia and Romania, an initiative that can help \nfoster the development of these emerging market economies as well as \nbenefit U.S. exporters.\n  While working to support exports to new markets abroad, Chairman \nHarmon also pushed Ex-Im Bank to reach out to new groups of exporters \nhere at home. During Chairman Harmon's tenure, Ex-Im Bank implemented \nprogram changes and marketing efforts aimed at expanding its support \nfor women- and minority-owned businesses, two groups that have \ntraditionally had difficulty accessing export financing. Chairman \nHarmon also made environmental exports a top priority, recognizing both \nthe potential export opportunities for U.S. producers of environmental \ngoods and services and the importance of promoting environmentally \nsound development. At the same time, Chairman Harmon championed the \nneed for greater environmental responsibility in export financing, \nurging his G-7 and other major export credit agency counterparts to \nadopt uniform, meaningful environmental standards for the projects they \nfinance.\n  Jim Harmon has worked tirelessly at Ex-Im Bank to create high-paying \nexport-related jobs here at home by expanding opportunities for U.S. \nexporters abroad. I am pleased to welcome him back to New York after \nfour years of distinguished service to Ex-Im Bank and the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/23/senate-section/article/S5536-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5536-S5537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO KAHUKU HIGH AND INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL\n\n Mr. INOUYE.

These \nactions are mandated in part by United Nations Security Council \nResolution 1343 of March 7, 2001.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of \nState, is authorized to issue regulations in exercise of my authorities \nunder the IEEPA and the United Nations Participation Act, 22 U.S.C. \n287c, to implement this prohibition. All Federal agencies are also \ndirected to take actions within their authority to carry out the \nprovisions of the Executive Order.\n  I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued. The Order \nwas effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 23, 2001.\n  I have authorized these measures in furtherance of Executive Order \n13194 of January 18, 2001, and in response to the Government of \nLiberia's continuing facilitation of and participation in the\n\n[[Page S5538]]\n\nRUF's illicit trade in diamonds from Sierra Leone and its other forms \nof support for the RUF. The Government of Liberia's actions in this \nregard constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign \npolicy of the United States because they directly challenge United \nStates foreign policy objectives in the region and the rule-based \ninternational order that is crucial to the peace and prosperity of the \nUnited States.\n  In Executive Order 13194, President Clinton responded to the RUF's \nillicit arms-for-diamonds trade that fuels the brutal, decade-long \ncivil war in Sierra Leone by declaring a national emergency and, \nconsistent with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1306, by \nprohibiting the importation into the United States of all rough \ndiamonds from Sierra Leone except for those importations controlled \nthrough the certificate of origin regime of the Government of Sierra \nLeone. In a report issued on December 14, 2000, the United Nations \nPanel of Experts established pursuant to resolution 1306 found that \ndiamonds represent a major and primary source of income for the RUF to \nsustain and advance its military activities; that the bulk of the RUF \ndiamonds leaves Sierra Leone through Liberia; and that such illicit \ntrade cannot be conducted without the permission and involvement of \nLiberian government officials at the highest levels. The Panel \nrecommended, among other things, a complete embargo on all diamonds \nfrom Liberia until Liberia demonstrates convincingly that it is no \nlonger involved in the trafficking of arms to, or diamonds from, Sierra \nLeone.\n  On March 7, 2001, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution \n1343 to impose sanctions against the Government of Liberia. The \nresolution determined that the Government of Liberia's active support \nfor the RUF in Sierra Leone and other armed rebel groups in neighboring \ncountries constitutes a threat to international peace and security in \nthe region and decided that all states shall impose an immediate arms \nembargo on Liberia and also shall impose travel and diamond bans on \nLiberia on May 7, 2001, unless the Council determined before that date \nthat the Government of Liberia had ceased its support for the RUF and \nfor other armed rebel groups and, in particular, had taken a number of \nconcrete steps identified in the resolution. In furtherance of this \nresolution, the Secretaries of State, Commerce, and Defense have taken \nsteps, under their respective authorities, to implement the arms \nembargo.\n  With regard to the travel ban and diamond embargo, the Government of \nLiberia has failed, notwithstanding the two-month implementation period \ngranted by resolution 1343, to honor its commitments to cease its \nsupport for the RUF and other armed rebel groups. As a result, the \nSecurity Council did not determine that Liberia has complied with the \ndemands of the Council.\n  In Proclamation 7359 of October 10, 2000, President Clinton suspended \nthe entry as immigrants and nonimmigrants of persons who plan, engage \nin, or benefit from activities that support the RUF or that otherwise \nimpede the peace process in Sierra Leone. The application of that \nProclamation implements the travel ban imposed by resolution 1343.\n  Finally, for the reasons discussed above and in the enclosed \nExecutive Order, I also have found that the Government of Liberia's \ncontinuing facilitation of and participation in the RUF's illicit trade \nin diamonds from Sierra Leone and its other forms of support for the \nRUF contribute to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign \npolicy of the United States described in Executive Order 13194 with \nrespect to which the President declared a national emergency. In order \nto deal with that threat, and consistent with resolution 1343 and this \nfinding, I have taken action to prohibit the importation into the \nUnited States of all rough diamonds from Liberia, whether or not such \ndiamonds originated there, in order to contribute to the international \neffort to bring a prompt end to the illicit arms-for-diamonds trade by \nwhich the RUF perpetuates the tragic conflict in Sierra Leone. This \naction, as well as those discussed above, also expresses our outrage at \nthe Government of Liberia's ongoing contribution to human suffering in \nSierra Leone and other neighboring countries, as well as its continuing \nfailure to abide by international norms and the rule of law.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \nThe White House, May 23, 2001.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/23/senate-section/article/S5538-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5538-S5539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-1946.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to a \n     comprehensive national energy policy; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 43\n\n       Whereas, the nation needs an effective, comprehensive \n     national energy policy which will have an enduring impact on \n     the supply and demand for energy in a manner that will help \n     sustain the strength of the U.S. economy and improve the \n     quality of life in this nation and around the world; and\n       Whereas, a national energy policy can help ensure that \n     there are energy supplies sufficient to support economic \n     growth with an eye towards improving the quality of life for \n     people the world over; and\n       Whereas, a national energy policy should encourage \n     responsible use of energy and responsible development of \n     energy resources and efficiencies in order to meet the \n     nation's expectations for secure energy sources while\n\n[[Page S5540]]\n\n     preserving and protecting the nation's environmental health \n     through performance-based regulations founded on sound \n     science; and\n       Whereas, a national energy policy should support basic and \n     applied scientific research to improve energy availability, \n     conservation, utilization, and environmental performance and \n     should encompass the development, availability, and use of a \n     multitude of different energy sources and fuels; and\n       Whereas, a national energy policy should incorporate and \n     encourage the significant advances in technology through the \n     past several years which can improve energy production and \n     delivery practices and should incorporate new discoveries and \n     developments of energy resources, particularly those which \n     will cause minimal environmental impact; and\n       Whereas, recent undesirable experiences with the inability \n     to obtain sufficient energy in some states in this great \n     nation are a good indication of the drastic consequences of a \n     lack of preparation for the ever-changing and rapidly \n     expanding universe of energy development, production, and \n     consumption; and\n       Whereas, the oil and gas industry has developed technology \n     which reduces the footprint of oil and gas development to a \n     minimum and the industry mitigates this minimal wetlands \n     impact with offsetting environmental enhancements in \n     accordance with Louisiana's no net loss of wetlands policy; \n     and\n       Whereas, the oil and gas industry has demonstrated its \n     ability to develop outer continental shelf (OCS) resources in \n     a manner which is environmentally responsible and \n     technologically state of the art, resulting in minimal \n     offshore environmental impact and extraordinary hydrocarbon \n     production in the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, Lease Sale 181 offers an area of the Gulf of \n     Mexico with significant oil and gas potential which can be \n     developed with minimal environmental risk, and it is \n     responsible to include the potential of this sale in any \n     national energy plan; and\n       Whereas, the Coastal Zone Management Act, reauthorization \n     of which is currently pending in congress, contains certain \n     provisions which have been applied in an unreasonable manner \n     to the detriment of securing OCS energy, and congress should \n     be urged, as a matter of national energy policy, to use the \n     pending legislation to reform such provisions and to reform \n     coastal zone management policies generally: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the U.S. Congress to adopt a national energy \n     policy which will prepare our nation for the future through a \n     comprehensive plan for the development, production, delivery, \n     conservation, and consumption of all manner of sources of \n     energy, for a future that includes economic growth and \n     development which allow a better quality of life for all \n     people of the world. Be it further\n       Resolved, That this policy should specifically include \n     strong support for Lease Sale 181 and for reform of the \n     Coastal Zone Management Act to reflect the original intent of \n     the Act to encourage multiple-use and energy development in \n     an environmentally responsible way. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     each member of the Louisiana congressional delegation and to \n     the presiding officer of each house of the U.S. Congress. Be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the President and Vice President of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-68. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to Pacific Basin \n     Agricultural Research Center; to the Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 87\n\n       Whereas, the Legislature in partnership with local \n     citizens, the Department of Agriculture, the University of \n     Hawaii, the United States Department of Agriculture, certain \n     Hawaii and other states' congressional offices, the United \n     States Army, through the Hawaii office of the Small Business \n     Administration, the Rural Economic Transition Assistance--\n     Hawaii Program, and after reviewing selected farming and \n     business research over the last several years concluded that \n     Hawaii's physical, biotic, cultural, and social environment \n     is capable of serving the country's chocolate food needs by \n     establishing a uniquely aligned full continuum of cacao \n     farming and chocolate industry in Hawaii; and\n       Whereas, work by the private industry and state and federal \n     governments to date has resulted in the scientific selection \n     and planting of cacao trees of different varieties to match \n     Hawaii's unique multi-climate environment and soil conditions \n     that is conducive to growing high quality varieties of cacao \n     trees all year long; and\n       Whereas, it is recognized that Hawaii's unique geographic \n     location, climate, and biotic environment qualifies it as the \n     nation's only state that can grow different varieties of \n     cacao all year long; and\n       Whereas, there are forty seven cacao growing countries \n     worldwide that currently harvest 3,000,000 metric tons of \n     cacao beans annually to supply the world's growing chocolate \n     industry worth $50,000,000,000 in annual sales; and\n       Whereas, our nation's current and growing dependency on \n     foreign cacao sources will now be partially relieved by \n     Hawaii's high quality, sub-sector premium commodity priced \n     cacao beans; and\n       Whereas, the United States is domestically growing a new \n     agricultural product that is an important food for our \n     nation's citizens and a food that incorporates other U.S. \n     farm products, such as sugar, milk nuts, and others, to \n     manufacture chocolate; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Agriculture \n     historically and currently funds foreign cacao farming \n     research, including cacao germplasm centers, pests and \n     disease control work, and flavor testing; and\n       Whereas, by virtue of this Concurrent Resolution, Hawaii \n     announces its intent to compete for such federal funds to \n     shift certain existing funding and other support to Hawaii; \n     and\n       Whereas, Hawaii will attract world attention to its cacao \n     farming practices and its chocolate manufacturing work, which \n     is aligned with its growing recognition as a high technology, \n     knowledge-based industry state with a broad range of unique \n     human, capital and other resource capabilities; and\n       Whereas, cacao farming in Hawaii provides a new domestic \n     farming opportunity for Hawaii-based private industry to \n     establish a full continuum of chocolate production including \n     manufacturing, marketing, selling, and commodity trading of \n     cacao beans and chocolate products for Hawaii, the mainland, \n     and the rest of the world's markets; and\n       Whereas, the enactment of Act 188, Session Laws of Hawaii \n     2000 that provided $10,000,000 to facilitate construction of \n     new manufacturing facilities in Hawaii county significantly \n     helped launch a new Hawaii-based $22,000,000 (initial \n     capitalization), high technology chocolate manufacturing \n     industry that is fully integrated with multi-island private \n     sector cacao nursery and farming operations located on former \n     sugar cane lands in communities where there is high \n     unemployment and underemployment of farmers and manufacturing \n     workers; and\n       Whereas, these displaced plantation workers are ideally \n     suited for the continuing employment available through the \n     cacao industry; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii recognizes the establishment of the new \n     $55,000,000 investment in the Pacific Basin Agricultural \n     Research Center in Hilo, Hawaii, which significantly advances \n     the work by the Center in the following areas:\n       (1) Tropical plant genetic resource management;\n       (2) Tropical plant physiology, disease and production;\n       (3) Tropical plant pests research;\n       (4) Post harvest tropical commodities research; and\n       (5) Tropical aquaculture management; and\n       Whereas, cacao farming and chocolate manufacturing in \n     Hawaii is a generational opportunity given the thirty-plus \n     year life of the cacao tree coupled with the additional value \n     of cacao processing and chocolate manufacturing facilities; \n     and\n       Whereas, cacao farming is a globally valuable food industry \n     that can contribute to a healthy commercial economy that in \n     turn materially contributes to the overall health and well-\n     being of Hawaii; and\n       Whereas, continuous quality improvement from cacao seed to \n     chocolate sale, over the full continuum of cacao farming, \n     chocolate manufacturing, marketing and sales work, is at the \n     center of Hawaii's national and global private and public \n     operating strategies; and\n       Whereas, both the United States and Europe each annually \n     consume about one-third of the $50,000,000,000 in global \n     chocolate industry production with the remaining third \n     consumed in the growing Asian Pacific, South and Central \n     American and other countries; and\n       Whereas, except for Hawaii, major world chocolate \n     manufacturing facilities are located in temperate climate \n     zones that cannot farm cacao; and\n       Whereas, only forty-seven countries located within twenty \n     degrees of the equator can grow cacao with Hawaii predicting \n     that it can grow approximately five per cent of the world's \n     cacao production within a decade at which time it will rank \n     in the top ten of cacao producing countries in the world; and\n       Whereas, certain cacao growing foreign countries also farm \n     plants that supply the raw material for the growing worldwide \n     of illegal drug crops; and\n       Whereas, the federal government funds initiatives to \n     encourage these foreign countries to concentrate their \n     farming efforts on new crops such as cacao farming instead of \n     illegal drugs; and\n       Whereas, the county of Hawaii, the State, the United States \n     Department of Agriculture, the Pacific Basin Agricultural \n     Research Center, and Hawaii's congressional delegation have \n     received solid synergistic encouragement and endorsement from \n     the Chocolate Manufacturers Association, the National \n     Confectioners Association, and the American Cocoa Research \n     Institute to establish a world class U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture--Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center \n     managed cacao germplasm center in Hawaii; and\n       Whereas, all of these organizations note that a Hawaii-\n     based cacao germplasm center will provide high quality and \n     professional cacao research in Hawaii, which is \n     environmentally sound and historically safe from natural \n     disasters and social turmoil; and\n       Whereas, support from the chocolate industry for Hawaii's \n     cacao farming and chocolate enterprises was significantly \n     advanced as a result of the authorization to issue \n     $10,000,000 in state special purpose revenue bonds to assist \n     Hawaii Gold Cacao Tree, Inc., with the\n\n[[Page S5541]]\n\n     construction of its chocolate and cacao manufacturing \n     facility in Hawaii; and\n       Whereas, the special purpose revenue bonds demonstrated \n     Hawaii's commitment to cacao farming and to securing a U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture--Pacific Basin Agricultural \n     Research Center-managed cacao germplasm center: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     First Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2001, the Senate concurring, That the Congress and the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture are urged to establish and fund a \n     U.S. Department of Agriculture--Pacific Basin Agricultural \n     Research Center-managed cacao germplasm center in Hawaii; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the U.S. \n     Senate, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, the \n     Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and to the \n     members of Hawaii's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-69. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to children with \n     disabilities; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 38\n\n       Whereas, under Title 20, section 1411(a) of the United \n     States Code, the maximum amount of federal funds that a state \n     may receive for special education and related services is the \n     number of children with disabilities in the State who are \n     receiving special education and related services multiplied \n     by forty per cent of the average per-pupil expenditure in \n     public elementary and secondary schools in the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas, since the enactment of the Education for all \n     Handicapped Children Act of 1975 and its subsequent \n     amendments, including the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act of 1990, Congress has appropriated funds for a \n     maximum of ten per cent of special education and related \n     services for children with disabilities when federal law \n     authorizes the appropriation of up to forty per cent; and\n       Whereas, the Hawaii Department of Education received \n     approximately $23,500,000 in federal funds during fiscal year \n     1999-2000 for what was then referred to as ``education of the \n     handicapped''. If this figure represented an appropriation of \n     funds for ten per cent of special education and related \n     services for children with disabilities, then an \n     appropriation of forty per cent would have equaled \n     $94,000,000; and\n       Whereas, the difference between an appropriation of forty \n     per cent and an appropriation of ten per cent for ``education \n     of the handicapped'' would amount to $70,500,000 just for the \n     Department of Education. If the number of students receiving \n     special education and related services equaled 22,000 during \n     fiscal year 1999-2000, then the difference would have \n     amounted to approximately $3,200 per student; and\n       Whereas, the State of Hawaii, through the Felix consent \n     decree, is being compelled by the federal district court to \n     make up for more than twenty years of insufficient funding \n     for special education and related services--funding that \n     should have been borne substantially by Congress, which \n     enacted the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of \n     1975 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of \n     1990; and\n       Whereas, if Congress is going to mandate new programs or \n     increase the level of service under existing programs for \n     children with disabilities, and if it is going to give the \n     federal courts unfettered power to enforce these mandates \n     through the imposition of fines and the appointment of \n     masters, then Congress should provide sufficient funding for \n     special education and related services: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, By the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     first Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2001, that the United States Congress is requested to \n     appropriate funds for forty per cent of special education and \n     related services for children with disabilities; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President pro tempore of the United \n     States Senate, the Vice-President of the United States, and \n     the members of Hawaii's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-70. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky relative to the \n     Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                           Resolution No. 70\n\n       Whereas, the Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement \n     Act of 2000 was approved in a bipartisan effort by 391 \n     members of the United States House of Representatives in the \n     106th Congress, including the entire Kentucky delegation to \n     Congress; and\n       Whereas, more than 80 United States Senators, including \n     both Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell and Kentucky Senator \n     Jim Bunning, signed letters of support for this legislation \n     in 2000; and\n       Whereas, the bill now before the 107th Congress modernizes \n     the railroad retirement system for its 748,000 beneficiaries \n     nationwide, including over 16,600 in Kentucky; and\n       Whereas, railroad management, labor, and retiree \n     organizations have agreed to support this legislation; and\n       Whereas, this legislation provides tax relief to freight \n     railroad, Amtrak, and commuter lines; and\n       Whereas, this legislation provides benefits improvements \n     for surviving spouses of rail workers who currently suffer \n     deep cuts in income when the rail retiree dies; and\n       Whereas, no outside contributions from taxpayers are needed \n     to implement the changes called for in this legislation; and\n       Whereas, all changes will be paid for from within the \n     railroad industry, including a full share by active \n     employees: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the General Assembly of the \n     Commonwealth of Kentucky:\n       Section 1. This honorable body hereby urges the United \n     States Congress to support the Railroad Retirement and \n     Survivors' Improvement Act in the 107th Congress.\n       Section 2. That the Clerk of the Senate is hereby directed \n     to transmit a copy of this Resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, \n     members of the Kentucky Congressional delegation, and to the \n     United Transportation Union, 3904 Bishop Lane, Suite #5, \n     Louisville, KY 40218.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-71.

Mr. President, I rise to send three separate bills to the \ndesk, S. 935, S. 943, and S. 944. The bills I am introducing provide \nauthority to negotiate bilateral free trade agreements with three \nimportant trading partners: New Zealand, Australia, and the Republic of \nKorea.\n  Over the next several months, the Senate will turn its attention to \ninternational trade. As we do so, we find ourselves under serious \nscrutiny. Will we be able to reach consensus? Will we be able to break \nthe impasse?\n  I don't know the answers to these questions. I have been working hard \nto find common ground on issues like labor and the environment, and on \nensuring the strength of our trade laws. I will continue to do so. But \nwe have a long way to go.\n  As we think about these issues, though, there is another, more subtle \nlogjam within the trade agenda. Right now, our vision of the future \nseems locked in on sweeping, multilateral agreements, Free Trade for \nthe Americas, the launch of a new round of global trade negotiations \nunder the WTO.\n  These are enormous and complicated undertakings. These agreements are \nalso major opportunities for trade liberalization, and we should \ncontinue to work hard to get agreements that are good for our workers, \nfarmers, and companies.\n  But it is interesting to listen to the rhetoric. Why can't we advance \nlabor and environment issues in the WTO? Some say developing countries \nsimply would not allow it. Why can't we agree that our fair trade laws \nare not for sale in FTAA negotiations? Some say Brazil will never \nrelent.\n  Indeed, our trade policy seems to have become so focused on sweeping \nmultilateral agreements, that we ignore other avenues to trade \nliberalization--much to the detriment of U.S. competitiveness.\n  Take a closer look at this so-called trade impasse: The U.S.-Jordan \nFree Trade Agreement contains extensive and enforceable provisions on \nlabor and the environment. Our free trade agreement with Canada and \nMexico also addresses labor and environmental issues, with potential \nrecourse to trade sanctions. We are moving towards completing an \nagreement with Chile--a country we know is open to labor and \nenvironment issues because they just recently struck a free trade \nagreement with Canada that includes enforceable provisions on both.\n  What's the moral of this story? It's simple. These agreements \ndemonstrate we can break the impasse on trade.\n  Indeed, we must move forward where we can, whenever we can. If not \nfast track for all, then fast-track for some, specifically, those \ncountries where we have strategic commercial and political interests. \nThose countries that will share our commitment to open markets, and our \nvalues for environmental quality and labor rights.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that would authorize trade \nnegotiations with Australia, New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea. It \nwould grant fast track consideration for these agreements, while also \nestablishing a general policy framework for future negotiations.\n  Trade agreements must address the full range of issues, from \nguaranteeing national treatment and market access, to protecting \nintellectual property. From promoting electronic commerce to ensuring \nthat countries do not gain unfair advantage by lowering labor and \nenvironmental standards. And these agreements must not weaken our fair \ntrade laws.\n  I believe there are many countries ready to take that deal. Australia \nand New Zealand are two countries eager to negotiate free trade \nagreements. We must continue to build our economic alliances in the \nAsia-Pacific region, and both countries have been strong partners in \ntrade. We must also be realistic. An FTA would present tremendous \nopportunities, but we must recognize where there are differences. One \nsuch difference is the operation of the Australian wheat board, which, \ndespite recent reforms, still works to distort world markets. \nAgriculture negotiations with both countries would require careful \ntreatment, but should allow us to better work together to reduce unfair \ntrade barriers in other parts of the world.\n  A trade agreement with Korea will take more time, as the issues are \nmore difficult to resolve. For example, Korea maintains very high \ntariffs on beef, hurting ranchers in my home state of Montana. High \ntariffs, high taxes, and other trade-restrictive practices in Korea, \nreduce the competitiveness of American automobiles from Michigan and \nOhio. Government subsidies in Korea undercut American semiconductor \nmanufacturers in Idaho and Utah.\n  But we must not wait to negotiate agreements until all these problems \nare solved. Rather, we should use FTA negotiations as part of the \nsolution. And with Korea, there are benefits that extend well beyond \ntrade. An FTA would help lock in Korea's economic and political \nprogress, and would also be an important part of our strategic \ninterests in Asia.\n  The bottom line is this: while America hesitates on trade \nliberalization, and while many reject trying to reach a bipartisan \nconsensus, the rest of the world continues to move forward. Regional \ntrade arrangements in Europe, Latin America, and Asia put U.S. \nexporters at a competitive disadvantage. We lose overseas markets to \nforeign competitors who enjoy trade preferences for which our farmers, \nmanufacturers, and service providers are ineligible.\n  I hope this legislation will send a strong signal to the rest of the \nworld: America intends to continue its leadership in the global trading \nsystem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 936. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand S \ncorporation eligibility for banks, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation that will expand and improve Subchapter S of the Internal \nRevenue Code. I am joined in this effort by Senators Tim Johnson and \nCraig Thomas. I have introduced this legislation over the last few \nyears and I am hopeful that this year we can get this important tax \nlegislation enacted.\n  The Subchapter S provision of the Internal Revenue Code reflect the \ndesire of Congress to eliminate the double tax burden on small business \ncorporations. Pursuant to that desire, Subchapter S has been \nliberalized a number of times, most recently in 1996. This legislation \ncontains several provisions that will make the Subchapter S election \nmore widely available to small businesses in all sectors. It also \ncontains several provisions of particular benefit to community banks \nthat may be contemplating a conversion to Subchapter S. Financial \ninstitutions were first made eligible for the Subchapter S election in \n1996. This legislation builds on and clarifies the Subchapter S \nprovisions applicable to financial institutions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and an explanation \nof\n\n[[Page S5545]]\n\nthe provisions of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 936\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

By contrast, Subchapter C corporations pay \n     corporate income taxes on earnings, and shareholders pay \n     income taxes again on those same earnings when they pass \n     through as dividends. Subchapter S of the IRS Code was \n     enacted in 1958 to reduce the tax burden on small business. \n     The Subchapter S provisions have been liberalized a number of \n     times over the last two decades, significantly in 1982, and \n     again in 1996. This reflects a desire on the part of Congress \n     to reduce taxes on small business.\n       This S corporation legislation would benefit many small \n     businesses, but its provisions are particularly applicable to \n     banks. Congress made S corporation status available to small \n     banks for the first time in the 1996 ``Small Business Job \n     Protection Act'' but many banks are having trouble qualifying \n     under the current rules. The proposed legislation:\n       Permits S corporation shares to be held as Individual \n     Retirement Accounts (IRAs), and permit IRA shareholders to \n     purchase their shares from the IRA in order to facilitate a \n     Subchapter S election.\n       Clarifies that interest and dividends on investments \n     maintained by a bank for liquidity and safety and soundness \n     purposes shall not be ``passive'' income. This is necessary \n     because S corporations are restricted in the amount of \n     passive investment income they may generate.\n       Increases the number of S corporation eligible shareholders \n     from 75 to 150.\n       Provides that any stock that bank directors must hold under \n     banking regulations shall not be a disqualifying second class \n     of stock. This is necessary because S corporations are \n     permitted only one class of stock.\n       Permits banks to treat bad debt charge offs as items of \n     built in loss over the same number of years that the \n     accumulated bad debt reserve must be recaptured (four years) \n     for built in gains tax purposes. This provision is necessary \n     to properly match built in gains and losses relating to \n     accounting for bad debts. Banks that are converting to S \n     corporations must convert from the reserve method of \n     accounting to the specific charge off method and the \n     recapture of the accumulated bad debt reserve is built in \n     gain. Presently the presumption that a bad debt charge off is \n     a built in loss applies only to the first S corporation year.\n       Clarifies that the general 3 Year S corporation rule for \n     certain ``preference'' items applies to interest deductions \n     by S corporation banks, thereby providing equitable treatment \n     for S corporation banks. S corporations that convert from C \n     corporations are denied certain interest deductions \n     preference items for up to 3 years after the conversion, at \n     the end of 3 years the deductions are allowed.\n       Provides that non-health care related fringe benefits such \n     as group-term life insurance will be excludable from wages \n     for ``more-than-two-percent'' shareholders. Current law taxes \n     the fringe benefits of these shareholders. Health care \n     related benefits are not included because their deductibility\n\n[[Page S5547]]\n\n     would increase the revenue impact of the legislation.\n       Permits Family Limited Partnerships to be shareholders in \n     subchapter S corporations. Many family owned small businesses \n     are organized as Family Limited Partnerships or controlled by \n     Family Limited Partnerships for a variety of reasons. A \n     number of small banks have Family Limited Partnership \n     shareholders, and this legislation would for the first time \n     permit those partnerships to be S corporation shareholders.\n       Permits S corporations to issue preferred stock in addition \n     to common. Prohibited under current law which permits S \n     corporations to have only one class of stock. Because of \n     limitations on the number of common shareholders, banks need \n     to be able to issue preferred stock in order to have adequate \n     access to equity.\n       Facilitates charitable giving by S corporation shareholders \n     by providing a basis increase for the excess of the \n     charitable contribution deduction over the basis of property \n     contributed. Current law penalizes a shareholder who makes a \n     charitable contribution through an S corporation by limiting \n     the charitable deduction that flows through to the \n     shareholder to the basis of the donated property. This means \n     that the shareholder is unable to benefit from the full fair \n     market value deduction when the basis does not reflect the \n     appreciation in the property. This differs from the full \n     value deduction afforded the taxpayer who donates property in \n     an individual capacity or through a partnership, instead of \n     through an S corporation.\n       Reduces the required level of shareholder consent to \n     convert to an S corporation from unanimous to 90 percent of \n     shares.\n       Clarifies that Qualified Subchapter S Subsidiaries (QSSS) \n     provide information returns under their own tax id number. \n     This can help avoid confusion by depositors and other parties \n     over the insurance of deposits and the payer of salaries and \n     interest.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Mr. Reed, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. Dayton, Mr. \n        Bingaman, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 937. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to permit the \ntransfer of entitlement to educational assistance the Montgomery GI \nbill by members of the Armed Forces, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I come before you today to introduce \nlegislation that addresses the educational needs of our men and women \nin uniform and their families. I appreciate the support of my \ncolleagues who have supported my provisions to enhance the GI bill, \nSenators Levin, Kennedy, Bingaman, Reed, Dayton, Landrieu, and \nCarnahan. I also like to recognize the Chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Warner, who himself went to school on the \nGI bill. I want to thank him for his cosponsorship, support and \nencouragement in improving the GI bill for military personnel and their \nfamilies.\n  I call this measure the HOPE, Help Our Professionals Educationally, \nAct.\n  In 1999, Time magazine named the American GI as the Person of the \nCentury. That alone is a statement about the value of our military \npersonnel. They are recognized around the world for their dedication \nand commitment to fight for our country and for peace in the world. \nThis past century has been filled with strife and conflict. During this \nperiod, the American GI has fought in the trenches during the first \nWorld War, the beaches at Normandy, in the jungles of Vietnam, in the \ndeserts of the Persian Gulf, and most recently in the Balkans and \nKosovo.\n  The face of our military and the people who fight our wars has \nchanged. The traditional image of the single, mostly male, drafted, and \ndisposable soldier is gone. Today we are fielding the force for the \n21st century. This new force is a volunteer force, filled with men and \nwomen who are highly skilled, married, and definitely not disposable. \nGone are the days when quality of life for a GI included a beer in the \nbarracks and a three-day pass. Now, we know we have to recruit a \nsoldier and retain a family.\n  We have won the cold war, this victory has changed the world and our \nmilitary. The new world order has given us a new world disorder. The \nUnited States is responding to crises around the globe, whether it be \nstrategic bombing or humanitarian assistance, and our military is the \nour most effective response. In order to meet these challenges, we are \nretooling our forces to be lighter, leaner and meaner. This is a \npositive move. Along with this lighter force, our military \nprofessionals must be highly educated and highly trained.\n  Our Nation has recently experienced the longest running peacetime \neconomic growth in history. This economic expansion has been a boom for \nour Nation. However, there is a negative impact of this growing \neconomy. With the enticement of quick prosperity in the civilian sector \nit is more difficult than ever to recruit and retain our highly skilled \nforce.\n  The services have increased their budgets for advertising and \nrefocused attention on recruiting. However, we still face problems in \nretaining some of the key skills that our service men and women \npossess--skills that our new economy is demanding. The highly trained \ntechnical skilled personnel are leaving the military to seek a better \nquality of life for their family outside of our military.\n  As I have heard so often, the decision to stay in the military is \nmade at the dinner table. It was the wisdom of a young enlisted soldier \nat Schofield Barracks who noted, when the choice is `stay in the \nmilitary or stay married,' the soldier opts to stay married. In my \ntravels across Georgia, around the country, and abroad, I have found \nthat our men and women in uniform want to do what is right, for \nthemselves and the country. However, our benefits systems have not kept \npace and forcing our personnel to choose between family and service.\n\n  In talking with our military personnel, we know that money alone is \nnot enough. Education is the number one reason service members come \ninto the military and the number one reason its members are leaving. In \nrecent years the Senate began to address this issue by supporting \nimproved education benefits for military members and their families.\n  My amendment will improve and enhance the current educational \nbenefits and create the GI bill for the 21st century and beyond.\n  One of the most important provisions of my amendment would give the \nService Secretaries the authority to authorize a service member to \ntransfer half of his or her basic MGIB benefits to family members. Many \nservice members tell us that they really want to stay in the service, \nbut do not feel that they can stay and provide an education for their \nfamilies. This will give them, in affect, an educational savings \naccount, so that they can stay in the service and still provide an \neducation for their spouses and children. This will give the \nSecretaries a very powerful retention tool.\n  The measure would allow the Services to authorize transfer of unused \nbasic GI bill benefits of a servicemember who has been in the military \nfor 6 years. The spouse would be able to use these benefits immediately \nupon authorization by the services. This provision is designed to \nassist the spouse of a military member in pursuing their own education \nor assist them in gaining the necessary skills to prepare for an \noccupation in the new economy.\n  The measure also includes language that permits a servicemember with \nten years of service to transfer GI bill benefits to a dependent child. \nThis provision is designed to help a servicemember with the expected \ncosts of a child's education. It could be used to help with secondary \nexpenses as well as with college costs.\n  I believe that the Services can use this much like a reenlistment \nbonus to keep valuable service members in the service. It can be \ncreatively combined with reenlistment bonuses to create a very powerful \nand cost effective incentive for highly skilled military personnel to \nstay in the Service. In talking with service members upon their \ndeparture from the military, we have found that the family plays a \ncrucial role in the decision of a member to continue their military \ncareer. Reality dictates that we must address the needs of the family \nin order to retain our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines.\n  Another enhancement to the current MGIB would extend the period in \nwhich the members of Reserve components can use this benefit. Currently \nthey lose this benefit when they leave the service or after 10 years of \nservice. They have no benefit when they leave service. My amendment \nwill permit them to use the benefit up to 5 years\n\n[[Page S5548]]\n\nafter their separation. This will encourage them to stay in the \nReserves for a full career.\n  I believe that this is a necessary next step for improving our \neducation benefits for our military members and their families. We must \noffer them credible choices. If we offer them choices, and treat the \nmembers and their families properly, we will show them our respect for \ntheir service and dedication. Maybe then we can turn around our current \nretention statistics. This GI bill is an important retention tool for \nthe services. I believe that education begets education. We must \ncontinue to focus our resources in retaining our personnel based their \nneeds.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Fitzgerald, and Mr. \n        Brownback):\n  S. 938. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat the exclusion from gross income for foster care payments shall \nalso apply to payments by qualifying placement agencies, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill that will \nsimplify and make more fair the tax treatment of foster care payments. \nThe bill will eliminate unnecessary distinctions drawn by the Internal \nRevenue Code in the treatment of payments received by people who open \ntheir homes to foster children and adults. I introduced this same bill \nin the 106th Congress, and it was passed by both Houses as part of a \nlarger tax bill that was subsequently vetoed by the President. I am re-\nintroducing the bill now, as I believe that this issue should not be \noverlooked as we debate tax reform this year. This bill not only \nsimplifies the tax treatment of foster care payments, it will also \nremove inequities and uncertainties inherent in current law.\n  In my home State of Vermont, we are proud that we have been able to \nreduce our reliance on the institutional care of children and adults. \nWe have accomplished this by developing an array of services that can \nbe provided in typical family homes, in a cost-effective and fiscally \nresponsible manner. I believe that this is not only good public policy, \nbut that whenever possible we should encourage these alternatives. \nEqual tax treatment for all tax families that provide foster care \nservices should provide some encouragement.\n  Under current law, foster care families are required to include \nfoster care payments in income. They can offset this income with \ndeductions for the expenditures they incur. Families must maintain \ndetailed records to substantiate these deductions. In lieu of detailed \nrecord keeping, Section 131 of the Internal Revenue Code allows certain \nfoster care families to exclude from income the payments they receive \nfor providing foster care. Eligibility for this exclusion depends upon \na complicated analysis of three factors: the age of the person in \nfoster care; the type of foster care placement agency; and the source \nof the foster care payments. For children under age 19 in foster care, \nSection 131 permits families to exclude payments when a State, or one \nof its political subdivisions, or a tax-exempt charitable placement \nagency places the individual in foster care and makes the foster care \npayments. For persons age 19 and older, Section 131 permits families to \nexclude foster care payments from income only when a State, or one of \nits political subdivisions, places the individual and makes the \npayments.\n  This bill is designed to provide tax fairness; it will simplify the \nanachronistic tax rules by amending the tax code's current exclusion to \ninclude foster care payments for all persons in foster care, regardless \nof age. The exclusion will also be available when the foster care \nplacement is made by a private foster care placement agency and even \nwhen the foster care payments are received through a private foster \ncare placement agency, rather than directly from a State. To ensure \nappropriate oversight, the bill requires that the placement agency be \neither licensed or certified by a State.\n  A qualified foster care payment under this bill must be made pursuant \nto a foster care program run by a State or county. My intention is for \nthis bill to cover the wide variety of foster care programs developed \nby States. Recognizing foster care as an effective approach to provide \nsupport within the community to people with mental retardation and \nother disabilities, these programs place children, and in some cases \nadults, in homes of unrelated families who provide foster care on a \nfull-time basis. Families providing foster care give those in their \ncare the daily support and supervision typically given to a family \nmember. Like traditional families, foster care families ensure that \nfoster children and adults have a healthy physical environment, get \nroutine and emergency medical care, are adequately clothed and fed, and \nhave satisfying leisure activities. Foster families provide those in \ntheir care with stimulation and emotional support all too often lacking \nin large congregate and institutional settings.\n\n  In some State, the State itself administers both child and adult \nfoster care programs. Many States, however, are increasingly entrusting \nadministration of these programs to private placement agencies, \napproved through licensing or certification procedures, or to \ngovernment-designated intermediary tax-exempt organizations. Through \nthe approval process, private placement agencies are accountable for \ntheir use of funds and for the quality of services they provide. This \nbill is intended to cover governmental foster care programs funded \nsolely by State or political subdivision monies, and, especially in the \ncase of adult foster care, programs funded by the federal government, \ntypical through a State's Medicaid Home and Community-Based Waiver \nprogram.\n  While foster care for children has been in existence for decades, \nfoster care for adults is a more recent phenomenon. Sometimes referred \nto as ``host homes'' or ``developmental homes,'' adult foster care \nfacilities have proven to be an effective alternative to institutional \ncare for adults with disabilities. In 1993, Vermont closed the State \ninstitution for people with developmental disabilities, choosing \ninstead to rely on foster families. Under this approach, Vermonters \nwith developmental disabilities can live in homes and participate in \nthe routines of daily life that most of us take for granted. Vermont's \napproach has provided people with disabilities a cost-effective \nopportunity for successful lives in communities, with valued \nrelationships with their foster families.\n  Vermont authorizes local developmental disability service \norganizations to act as placement agencies and contract with families \nwilling to provide foster care in their homes. The current tax law's \ndisparate tax treatment of foster care payments impedes these types of \narrangements. Persons providing foster care for individuals placed in \ntheir homes by the government can exclude foster care payments from \nincome, while foster care families receiving the same payments through \nprivate agencies under contract with State or local governments are not \neligible for this exclusion, unless the individual in foster care is \nunder age 19 and the placement agency is a nonprofit organization. \nBecause of the complexity of current law, families often receive \nconflicting advice from tax professionals regarding the proper tax \ntreatment of foster care payments. In addition, the law's complex rules \ndiscourage willing families from providing foster care in their homes \nto persons placed by private agencies, reducing the availability of \ncare alternatives.\n  This bill will advance the development of family-based foster care \nservices, a highly valued alternative to institutionalization. My home \nState of Vermont is proud of having closed its institutions and leading \nthe nation in developing other support systems. The use of foster care \nservices has facilitated this effort. I believe this represents good \npolicy and is something to be encouraged. We should be removing \ndisincentives and barriers to quality support for people with \ndisabilities in our communities. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 939. A bill amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to confer \ncitizenship automatically on children residing abroad in the legal and \nphysical custody of a citizen parent serving in a Government or \nmilitary position abroad; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer legislation on \nan issue important to many of our military and government families \nassigned\n\n[[Page S5549]]\n\noverseas. Currently, if one of these families adopts a child who is a \ncitizen of the United States, that child is not automatically eligible \nfor citizenship. Current law allows U.S. citizens residing in the \nUnited States to adopt children from overseas and to automatically \nconfer citizenship on these children who are residing in the legal and \nphysical custody of the citizen parent. My bill would allow U.S. \nmilitary and government employees who are stationed overseas and adopt \na child to enjoy the same ability to have citizenship automatically \nconferred.\n  Today many of our service members and government employees are \nstationed overseas serving their country. Some of these families want \nto offer their home and their hearts to children needing a good, loving \nfamily. The opportunity is often missed by these families because of \nthis oversight in the current law. This amendment will ensure that \nthose who are serving our nation and our government overseas are not \npenalized when adopting children during their tour.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 940. A bill to leave no child behind; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Kennedy, and \nSenator Wellstone, I rise today to introduce the Leave No Child Behind \nAct, legislation that will address the needs of our nation's children \nto deliver them from poverty, violence, abuse, neglect, and poor \neducation.\n  This measure combines the best public and private ideas, policies, \nand practices into a comprehensive measure to improve the lives of all \nchildren. Not just poor children. But all children.\n  Many Members of Congress have contributed to this legislation, adding \ntheir ideas and their thoughts, including: Senator Kennedy, Senator \nJeffords, Senator Rockefeller, Senator DeWine, Senator Harkin, Senator \nStevens, Senator Biden, Senator Snowe, Senator Boxer, Senator Grassley, \nSenator Daschle, Senator Gordon Smith, Senator Reed, Senator Chafee, \nSenator Wellstone, Senator Kerry, Senator Durbin, Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Kohl, Senator Torricelli, Senator Schumer, and Senator Bayh. A \nnumber of Members of the House have also contributed to this \nlegislation. It is without hesitation that I say that this bill would \nnot have been possible without the help of so many of my colleagues.\n  For the first time in more than a generation, our budget is in \nbalance. Indeed, we have a surplus. At long last, we can talk about \nmeeting the needs of the future, rather than paying off the debts of \nthe past. For the first time in decades, we have an opportunity to put \nchildren first, to move them out of poverty, to end their hunger, to \nheal their wounds, to enrich and inform their minds.\n  We are on the verge of doing what many of us have long dreamed of \ndoing for America's young people.\n  The legislation we are introducing today represents a vision for \nchildren in the 21st century.\n  It's more than a bill. More than pages of legislative language. It's \na covenant that we are entering into today. Not only with each other, \nbut with those who will stand in this place long after we have gone.\n  It's a declaration that we need to put children first, and that we \nintend to put children first. In doing so, we put America first.\n  A question that we must all ask ourselves and ask this country, is, \nwhat should our highest priority be? When I ask this question, the \nresponse I most often receive is our children.\n  Children are one-quarter of our population. But they are one hundred \npercent of our future.\n  Despite that fact, they are getting a fraction of our attention and a \nfraction of our resources.\n  Having languished in budget deficits for years, we now have the \nlargest projected federal budget surpluses in the history of this \nNation. We have witnessed unprecedented prosperity. We are so lucky to \nlive in this free and dynamic society, a Nation at peace, of such great \nwealth.\n  But some are not so lucky. Some families struggle through each day. \nThey live paycheck to paycheck. Their children are hungry. They're \ncold. They might have difficulty following the teacher's instructions \non the blackboard because they can't see it clearly. But their parents \nhaven't taken them to the doctor because they don't have health \ninsurance.\n  Over 12 million children live in poverty.\n  Nearly 11 million children have no health coverage.\n  About 7 million children go home alone each week after school.\n  This is America, too.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is called, ``An Act to Leave \nNo Child Behind''. We are committed to one principle beyond all others. \nNot just as a slogan, but as a means to define an urgent national \npriority.\n  Regrettably, however, for some those words are slogans, and nothing \nmore. There are those who utter the words ``Leave No Child Behind'' in \nfront of microphones and television cameras. They have adopted the \nwords as a political mantra, repeating it endlessly during ``photo-\nops'' with children and in press conferences with reporters.\n  We need to make sure that we not only talk about leaving no child \nbehind, but that we actually take steps to do so. Introducing this bill \nis the first step.\n  Every word on every page is focused on the same purpose--lifting our \nchildren up, giving each child an opportunity, helping each child to \nhave a safe and rewarding life.\n  Under the Act to Leave No Child Behind, every child in America would \nhave health coverage. No child in America would go to bed at night \naching from hunger. We would use our tax code to lift millions of \nchildren out of poverty.\n  It's time to ensure that every American child has an opportunity to \nattend Head Start, Pre-K, or child care to begin a lifetime of \nlearning. That every American child can read by 4th grade, and read at \ngrade level. It's time to take dramatic new steps to address the needs \nof children who are abused and neglected every year.\n  Those who are truly committed to leaving no child behind will support \nthis bill. It's about priorities. It's about values.\n  As we speak, Congress is considering how to spend our nation's \nsurplus.\n  Sadly, a disproportionate share of that surplus will not go to our \nnation's children, but to those who least need our help and attention.\n  Most of the surplus will go to the tax cut. And, most of the tax cut \nwill go to those who are doing the best in our society, those who least \nneed a helping hand or a step up.\n  Are those the values that we want to instill in our children? That as \na Nation we care not for those who need our help most?\n  It's time to take a stance for children.\n  It's time to invest in the needs of our children. Not in a token way, \nbut in a real way. A meaningful way that will make a difference in a \nchild's life.\n  We have the resources. The time is right.\n  If we join together, we can transform this Nation and give each and \nevery child his God-given right to grow and flourish to all he can be. \nTo grow to his or her fullest potential. We want an America where all \nchildren can realize their dreams.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the Act to Leave No Child \nBehind be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    The Act To Leave No Child Behind--Detailed Summary, May 23, 2001\n\n\nTitle I.

A bill to revise the boundaries of the Golden Gate National \nRecreation Area in the State of California, to extend the term of the \nadvisory commission for the recreation area, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation to add approximately 5,000 acres of pristine natural land \nto the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in San Mateo County. This \naddition will protect the sweeping views of the San Mateo Coast and \nensure the protection of rich farmland, several miles of public trails, \nand incredible array of wildlife and vegetation. I am happy to be \njoined by Senator Boxer in sponsoring this legislation.\n  The property to be added is one of the most visible and important \npieces of land on the San Mateo coast north of Half Moon Bay. The \nlargest parcel to be added is a 4,262 acre stretch of land known as the \nRancho Corral de Tierra. The Rancho Corral de Tierra is one of the \nlargest undeveloped tracts remaining on the San Mateo Coast and is \nconstantly under threat of development.\n  The mountainous property, which surrounds the coastal towns of Moss \nBeach and Montara, was previously purchased by the Peninsula Open Space \nTrust. The Trust has agreed to transfer the land to the Federal \nGovernment for about half of the purchase cost. It is this type of \npublic-private partnership that Congress needs to support in our \nefforts to preserve open space.\n  The Rancho Corral de Tierra Golden Gate National Recreation Area \nBoundary Act of 2001 has the support of the entire Bay Area \nCongressional Delegation. Similar legislation is being introduced today \nin the House of Representatives by Tom Lantos with co-sponsors Anna \nEshoo, Nancy Pelosi, George Miller, Lynn Woolsey, Ellen Tauscher, Peter \nStark, Mike Thompson, Barbara Lee, Mike Honda, and Zoe Lofgren.\n  The addition of the Rancho Corral de Tierra property will result in \nthe protection of all or part of four watersheds, and several \nendangered species such as the peregrine falcon, San Bruno elfin \nbutterfly, San Francisco garter snake, and the red-legged frog. \nMoreover, due to the coastal marine influence and dramatic altitude \nchanges, plants grow on the property that are found nowhere else in the \nworld.\n  This legislation will also reauthorize the Golden Gate National \nRecreation Area and Point Reyes National Seashore Advisory Commission \nfor another 20 years. The Advisory Commission was established by \nCongress in 1972 to provide for the free exchange of ideas between the \nNational Park Service and the public. The Commission holds open and \naccessible public meetings monthly at which the public has an \nopportunity to comment on park-related issues.\n  I have always felt that protecting our nation's unique natural areas \nshould be one of our highest priorities. The Golden Gate National \nRecreation Area is one of our Nation's most heavily visited urban \nnational parks as it is in close proximity to millions of people. I \ninvite my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Ensign, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. \n        Thompson):\n  S. 942. A bill to authorize the supplemental grant for population \nincreases in certain states under the temporary assistance to needy \nfamilies program for fiscal year 2002; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of Senators \nHutchison, Bingaman, Hutchinson, Breaux, Ensign, Baucus, Lincoln, \nThompson, and myself to introduce a piece of legislation which will \nextend the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families supplemental grants \nfor one year. This grant program has been critical to the success of \nwelfare reform in our States.\n  The TANF block grant, as it is commonly known, was established in the \n1996 welfare law. These were modest supplemental grants for 17 \nrelatively poor or rapidly growing States. The grants were intended to \nreduce the very large disparity in welfare funding between poorer and \nwealthier States that resulted from the basic TANF funding formula. The \nTANF supplemental grants have afforded States, like ours a more \nadequate opportunity to achieve TANF goals. While TANF is scheduled to \nbe reauthorized in 2002, the supplemental grants included in the 1996 \nlaw were authorized only through October 2001.\n  If the grants expire, 17 States will lose as much as 10 percent of \ntheir TANF funding beginning in October 1 of this year. Wealthy, low-\ngrowth States will experience no reduction.\n  These grants are not supplemental in the sense of being add-ons. They \nwere designed as an integral part of the TANF allocation formula and \nare critical to the success of the TANF programs in the States that \nreceive them. The decision to end the grants a year before \nreauthorizing the entire program was not a policy consideration, only a \nfinancial one. It was done in order to ensure a balanced budget by \n2002.\n  The 2001 budget resolution, passed by both the House and the Senate, \nprovides $319 million for a one-year extension of these important \ngrants. This provision acknowledges the Senate's commitment to \nmaintaining the tools that many of our States require to continue \nefforts to help people move from welfare to work, from jobs to careers.\n\n[[Page S5553]]\n\n  Since the passage of the welfare reform law in 1996, more is expected \nof state welfare systems that ever before. TANF agencies provide a \nbroad range of social services that include job training and employment \ncounseling, reducing out-of-wedlock births and promoting family \nformation, and addressing individual challenges such as domestic \nviolence--just to name a few. Without the TANF supplemental grants, \nimpacted states will find themselves unable to provide many of the \nprograms that have enabled their citizens to successfully move from \npublic assistance to independence.\n  Given the significant costs of work supports, many of the 17 States \nthat receive supplemental TANF grants are now spending more TANF funds \neach year than they receive from their basic TANF grant. In fiscal year \n2000, for example, TANF expenditures in nine of the 17 States that \nreceive TANF supplemental grants exceeded 100 percent of their basic \nTANF allocation. These States are my own home State of Florida, Alaska, \nArizona, Arkansas, Idaho, New Mexico, North Carolina, Tennessee, and \nTexas.\n  For these reasons, we are requesting that a one year extension of the \nTANF supplemental grants. This step will help to ensure that high-\ngrowth States can continue their welfare reform efforts and will enable \nthe supplemental grants to be considered as part of the overall TANF \nreauthorization next year.\n  Support for the extension of this program should come from all \nSenators who want to see the goals of welfare reform fulfilled. Whether \nor not one comes from a State that receives TANF supplemental grant \ndollars, support for this bill will send a loud and clear message that \nthe United States Senate adheres to the goal of ensuring that all \nStates have the means to provide the services necessary to help all \nAmericans, regardless of where they live, to move from dependence to \nindependence.\n  That is a goal worth fighting for and I encourage all of my Senate \ncolleagues to cosponsor this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am glad to cosponsor this bill from my \ncolleagues Senators Graham and Hutchison. It's an important matter for \nthose of us who represent less prosperous States. I have worked hard to \npromote economic development in Montana. It is crucial to providing a \nbetter future for the children of my great State. Until the economy \nimproves in Montana, I will advocate for measures such as this one, \nwhich help alleviate the difficulties that stem from our circumstances.\n  When we enacted welfare reform in 1996, a law I am glad to have \nsupported, there was much discussion here about the appropriate way to \nallocate welfare funds among States. The old funding formula had \nproduced wide disparities, especially between high per capita income \nStates and low per capita income States. In the end it was resolved to \nprovide additional funding in the form of ``TANF supplemental grants'' \nto certain states which were poorer or had high growth rates or both. \nHowever, the funding was only provided through fiscal year 2001, while \nthe rest of the welfare funds were provided through fiscal year 2002, \nas part of an effort to balance the budget.\n  Well, the budget is in surplus now. And we need to continue the TANF \nsupplemental grants for one more year, as this legislation would do, so \nthat we can assess it as a part of the policy on overall welfare \nfunding during next year's reauthorization of the 1996 welfare reform \nlaw. The TANF supplemental grants represent a substantial source of \nwelfare funds in several states. Failing to continue this funding would \nmean, in effect, a 10 percent reduction in the allocations for states \nsuch as Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana. My own state \nof Montana received $1 million last year. I assure you we can use those \nfunds to help poor children in Montana, especially the many who have \nlow-income working parents, the kind who hold down two or three part-\ntime minimum wage jobs, which is all too common in my State.\n  I thank my colleagues for their leadership and look forward to \nworking with them on this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/23/senate-section/article/S5553-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 42--A BILL CONDEMNING THE TALEBAN FOR \n          THEIR DISCRIMINATORY POLICIES AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 42\n\n       Whereas the Taleban militia took power in Afghanistan in \n     1996, and now rules over 90 percent of the country;\n       Whereas, under Taleban rule, most political, civil, and \n     human rights are denied to the Afghan people;\n       Whereas women, minorities, and children suffer \n     disproportionately under Taleban rule;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Department of State \n     Country Report on Human Rights Practices, violence against \n     women and girls in Afghanistan occurs frequently, including \n     beatings, rapes, forced marriages, disappearances, \n     kidnapings, and killings;\n       Whereas Taleban edicts isolate Muslim and non-Muslim \n     minorities, and will require the thousands of Hindus living \n     in Taleban-ruled Afghanistan to wear identity labels on their \n     clothing, singling out these minorities for discrimination \n     and harsh treatment;\n       Whereas Taleban forces have targeted ethnic Shiite Hazaras, \n     many of whom have been massacred, while those who have \n     survived, are denied relief and discriminated against for \n     their religious beliefs;\n       Whereas non-Muslim religious symbols are banned, and \n     earlier this year Taleban forces obliterated 2 ancient \n     statues of Buddha, claiming they were idolatrous symbols;\n       Whereas Afghanistan is currently suffering from its worst \n     drought in 3 decades, affecting almost one-half of \n     Afghanistan's 21,000,000 population, with the impact severely \n     exacerbated by the ongoing civil war and Taleban policies \n     denying relief to needy areas;\n       Whereas the Taleban has systematically interfered with \n     United Nations relief programs and workers, recently closing \n     a new hospital and arresting local workers, closing United \n     Nations World Food Program bakeries providing much needed \n     food, and closing offices of the United Nations Special \n     Mission to Afghanistan in 4 Afghan cities;\n       Whereas, as a result of those policies, there are more than \n     25,000,000 persons who are internally displaced within \n     Afghanistan, and this year, contrary to past practice, the \n     Taleban rejected a United Nations call for a cease-fire in \n     order to bring assistance to the internally displaced;\n       Whereas, as a result of Taleban policies, there are now \n     more than 2,200,000 Afghan refugees in Pakistan, and 500,000 \n     more refugees are expected to flee in the coming months \n     unless some form of relief is forthcoming;\n       Whereas Pakistan has closed its borders to Afghanistan, and \n     has announced that Pakistani and United Nations officials \n     will begin screening refugees in June with a view toward \n     forcibly repatriating all those who are found to be staying \n     illegally in Pakistan;\n       Whereas the Taleban leadership continues to give safe haven \n     to terrorists, including Osama bin Laden, and is known to \n     host and provide training ground to other terrorist \n     organizations; and\n       Whereas the people of Afghanistan are the greatest victims \n     of the Taleban, and in recognition of that fact, the United \n     States has provided $124,000,000 in relief to the people of \n     Afghanistan this year: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) condemns the harsh and discriminatory policies of the \n     Taleban toward Muslims, Hindus, women, and all other \n     minorities, and the attendant destruction of religious icons;\n       (2) urges the Taleban to immediately reopen United Nations \n     offices and hospitals and allow the provision of relief to \n     all the people of Afghanistan;\n       (3) commends President George W.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Howard H. \nBaker, Jr. The nomination will be stated.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Howard H. Baker, Jr., of \nTennessee, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the \nUnited States of America to Japan.\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 hours equally divided for \nconsideration of the nomination. Who yields time? The Senator from \nWyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I do want to talk a moment about the \nnomination of Howard Baker to be Ambassador to Japan. I am chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific Rim. We held a hearing today \nfor Howard Baker. Fortunately, we were able to move it today so that \nhis nomination can be voted on for confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to accept Howard Baker as Ambassador to \nJapan. I am chairman of that subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific rim. \nCertainly one of the most important countries in that area is Japan, a \ncountry with which we have worked closely\n\n[[Page S5562]]\n\nfor a very long time. We have had some of our highest profile \nAmbassadors in Japan, people in the past who had come from the Senate, \nalso including a Speaker of the House and a majority leader of the \nSenate several years ago.\n  Now we have the opportunity--and I was very pleased to be able today \nto hold that hearing--to have Howard Baker as our nominee whom the \nPresident nominated to this important task. We are very proud to pass \nit on. We thank the leader for being able to bring it to the floor \ntoday so we can get our Ambassador in place in Japan.\n  Japan is key, of course, to much of what we do in the Asian area, and \nit is key to what we do in Korea, particularly North Korea and the \nKorean peninsula. We need to work with Japan to do that. The same is \ntrue with Taiwan and China. Japan is our partner.\n  Of course, they are the largest economy in that area and continue to \nhave some economic problems, particularly banking problems. We have \nsome things we have to work out with them with regard to our Armed \nForces being in Okinawa and work out things to see if we can reduce the \ndeficit with have in trade.\n  I cannot think of a better person to represent us. He has great \nexperience and great compassion. He worked in the White House, in the \nSenate, and has been the Senate floor leader. He has done all things in \npublic. I am delighted Howard Baker is our nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I see other Senators who are here to speak \non behalf of former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker to be \nAmbassador to Japan. I will not be too long. I am delighted to have \nthis opportunity. I think this is such a great selection for this very \nimportant position as Ambassador to Japan.\n  I feel a personal relationship with Howard Baker for a lot of \nreasons. First of all, I think Howard Baker was the first live \nRepublican I actually saw up close in my life. When I was growing up in \nPascagoula, MS, there was none. Then I had the good fortune of going to \nthe great center of learning, Oxford, MS. There I saw this outstanding \nand very calming and articulate spokesman, Howard Baker, on Memphis \ntelevision. I was impressed. And he was a Republican. I started \nlistening to him and watching him and had occasion to meet him one time \nwhen he came down to the university.\n  Of course, this outstanding man from a small town in Tennessee ran \nfor the Senate. He didn't go through the State legislature and through \nthe House of Representatives and eventually to the Senate. He went \nstraight to the Senate.\n  Of course, it is of interest that his mother and his father had also \nserved in the House of Representatives. I believe his mother had been \nthe sheriff of the county in Tennessee. I think that is accurate. He \nhad a pedigree of knowledge, the people of Tennessee and of \ngovernments. So it was a natural for him to go straight to the Senate.\n  His wife, of course, was the daughter of Everett Dirksen. He of the \nmelodious voice, a legend in his own time, his portrait hangs on the \nmajority leader's conference wall. He had that influence.\n\n  Immediately, he drew attention and respect. Immediately, he started \nto seek leadership in the Senate. He was not successful the first time. \nI think the Senator from Alaska can remember the details of that. He \nvery quickly, comparatively speaking, became the leader of the \nRepublicans of the Senate and then of course, in 1980, after the \nelection, became the majority leader.\n  I remember watching him from my perch on the House side of the \nCapitol as the Republican whip at the time and having meetings with him \nin his room where he always had the fireplace going. I was always \nimpressed. There were a couple of difficult issues with which we had to \ndeal--the settling of AWAC, the Panama Canal. I can remember not \nagreeing with the position he took on at least one of those.\n  I watched how masterful he was. I remember coming over and watching \none of the votes. We were standing in the back of the Chamber. As I \nrecall, he sat on the corner of the table, and it seemed to have an \ninfluence on voters just because he was sitting there. Though both \nthose motions prevailed, and they were in many ways unpopular, I \nremember sending him a handwritten note at the time how impressed I was \nat how he pulled those issues together in a bipartisan way.\n  Soft spoken; intellectual, actually. A lot of people would be \nsurprised that an intellectual could rise to that kind of position, but \nhe did.\n  Now I have an even greater respect for his leadership since I have \nfor the past 5 years been able to serve as majority leader. I remember \ntelling my immediate predecessor, Bob Dole: I thought your job was a \npiece of cake. Why wasn't it that way when I got here? This job is a \nchallenge, every day. You have people who disagree with you around you, \nyour friends on both sides of the aisle, and you try to give some \ndirection to get some result. I truly now have a renewed and greater \nrespect for the majority leader and the majority leader's position, and \nfor Howard Baker in particular.\n  Of course, he went on to run for President. In fact, I think almost \nevery majority leader except George Mitchell and Trent Lott have been \ncandidates for President. I might note, none of them has been \nsuccessful, although Lyndon Johnson did manage to come in sort of \nthrough the back door, after being selected to be Vice President. He \ndid a wonderful job.\n  Then he showed even greater wisdom. He said: I've done that job; I'm \nout of here. And he went back to the private sector. And did he \ndisappear into the hills of Tennessee? No, though that is where he \nseeks refuge to this very day. He went into the private sector, went to \na law firm. He is involved and thoughtful. He returned to public \nservice as Chief of Staff to President Reagan.\n  Probably his greatest stroke of recent years is his marriage to the \nfine former Senator from Kansas, Nancy Kassebaum. What a duo that is.\n  Just a year or so ago in our continuing Leader's Lecture Series, \nHoward Baker was one of the speakers. It was extremely interesting. He \ngave us a Baker's dozen of suggestions of being in the Senate. That is \n13, for those who are not from the South or who don't know a baker's \ndozen is 13. It was a great list, and he did a wonderful job.\n  Now he has been selected for this position. I received a call a \ncouple weeks ago from none other than Senator Byrd who said: This is \nour colleague. We know him well. He was our majority leader. He wasn't \njust a member or just a leader; he was majority leader at a very tough, \ndifficult time.\n\n  He worked with Senator Byrd across the aisle.\n  We don't have to wait for weeks or months for an investigation. We \nknow this man. Let's move it. Let's expedite it.\n  The committee had its hearing today, and the Senate will vote \ntonight. We will vote to confirm Howard Baker, and he will be an \nAmbassador, very similar to the ones who have preceded him, former \nMajority Leader Mike Mansfield and former Speaker of the House Tom \nFoley.\n  Japan, I hope, recognizes and appreciates that we send them as our \nAmbassador the very best. That tradition continues with Howard Baker. I \nam delighted we are moving expeditiously. We will get this confirmation \ndone. Senator Baker and his helpmate, Senator Kassebaum, will be great \ndiplomats for America. They will be a tremendous asset for all who get \nto know him in Japan. I thank all of my Senate colleagues for agreeing \nto move this nomination expeditiously.\n  I invite Senator Baker to join us in about an hour and a half to hear \nthe next Leader's Lecture presentation from former President of the \nSenate, former House Member, Gerald Ford.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am delighted to follow our leader, \nspeaking about our former majority leader, Howard Baker, and his lovely \nlady, Senator Kassebaum. As one whose home is closer to Tokyo than it \nis to Washington, DC, I welcome this appointment.\n  This is the century of the Pacific. If one really studies \ngeopolitical affairs in this world, they can only come to the \nconclusion that the Pacific is going to be the region of great interest \nto the world, of great potential, and of great strife if we are not \ncareful.\n  I am delighted the President has chosen Howard Baker to become the \nAmbassador to Japan. He has shown his\n\n[[Page S5563]]\n\nleadership on the floor of the Senate and in activities he has \nparticipated in around the world since he left the Senate. His wife, as \nwe know, is one of the distinguished leading ladies of this country. \nThe President is very smart. He gets two Ambassadors for the price of \none.\n  We will welcome him going to Alaska on his way to Japan and on his \nway back because he is a great friend. It was my privilege to serve \nwith Howard Baker. During the 8 years he was the leader I was assistant \nleader, and I consider him one of the finest Americans who has ever \nlived. I am glad to see he continues being willing to serve our \ncountry, and I shall vote for him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nnomination of my good friend and former colleague Senator Howard Baker \nto be U.S. Ambassador to Japan. I can think of no finer individual to \nserve in this important post, for no finer person ever served in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Having an Ambassador to Japan with Senator Baker's experience, \nknowledge, and statesmanship is crucial during this important period in \nU.S.-Japan relations. It is vital to America's goals for peace in this \nregion. The overall security situation in Asia is of utmost importance. \nHaving Senator Baker representing the United States in Japan will be a \ntremendous asset as we work to maintain security and stability in that \nvital region.\n  He proudly served as a sailor--P.T. boat sailor--who knows how to \nnavigate rough seas.\n  Senator Baker's past service to the nation has been exemplary. He \nrepresented his home State of Tennessee for three terms in the Senate, \nfrom 1967 until 1985. Over the course of his final four years in the \nSenate, Howard Baker served with distinction as the Senate majority \nleader. After leaving the Senate, Senator Baker went on to serve the \nNation as former President Reagan's Chief of Staff and as a member of \nthe President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.\n  Senator Baker, of all people, fully understands the demands and \nsacrifices we ask of our public officials and their families. His \nwillingness to take on this challenge and once again return to public \nservice is greatly appreciated. By his side, indeed a partner, will be \nhis lovely wife, our former colleague, Nancy Kassehaum Baker.\n  Mr. President, I have been fortunate, to have worked with Senator \nBaker for many years. I have the great privilege to now be in my fourth \nterm because of his help, and, above all, his advice and friendship The \nNation, the Senate wish them both good fortune.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Presidents of this country long ago \nestablished a tradition of nominating the most eminent of our political \nleaders to be ambassadors to Japan. Former Senators Mansfield and \nMondale, and most recently, Speaker Tom Foley have maintained that \ntradition of diplomatic excellence and service to our country up until \nthis day.\n  When President Bush nominated my old friend, Howard Baker, to be our \nnext ambassador to our most important Asian ally, he kept the highest \nstandards of this important tradition. That is why I fully expect my \ncolleagues today will concur in supporting this nomination. And while \nwe will all miss the presence in Washington of our dear friend and his \nwife, another esteemed former colleague, Nancy Kassebaum Baker--who \nherself established a well-deserved reputation in this Senate as one of \nour most thoughtful leaders on foreign policy--what we will lose will \nbe more than offset, once again, by the contribution that they will \nmake for our country.\n  Howard Baker has been a public servant all of his life. It is an \nhonor to serve in the Senate, not least because one serves with such \ndistinguished and admirable colleagues, but I must say I have always \nconsidered myself particularly fortunate that my career overlapped in \npart with the three terms the distinguished Senator from Tennessee \nserved here. I was particularly honored to have worked with him during \nthe time he served as our party's majority leader. And as my colleagues \nwell know, Senator Baker never really retired. He left the Senate and \nbecame the chief of staff to former President Reagan, serving that \ngreat President in an outstanding manner. While it would take too long \nto enumerate all of the contributions rendered since then by this \nexceptional public servant, it serves to note that he most recently was \na leader of an important commission that conducted an essential review \nof our nuclear cooperation programs with Russia. The recommendations of \nthat bipartisan commission were key in the new administration's policy \nreview of this very important component of this important bilateral \nrelationship. Now Howard Baker will go to serve another of America's \nimportant bilateral relations, as our Ambassador to Tokyo.\n  I have been saying for years that the strategic partnership American \nmust nurture in Asia is not with China, but with Japan. President bush \nclearly recognizes this reality, and he has demonstrated this with his \nappointments of Japan experts at the State Department, Pentagon and the \nNational Security Council. The President has capped these selections by \nchoosing Howard Baker as our Ambassador. I commend the President on his \nstrategic thinking, and I think the President could not have made a \nbetter selection in filling this post.\n  Howard Baker brings to this position his long experience in the \nSenate, in the White House and in the corporate sector. All aspects of \nthis experience will be beneficial to his efforts to represent the \nUnited States to our Japanese ally. For the Japanese leadership, which \nhas warmly welcomed this nomination, former Senator Baker will bring an \nappreciation of all of aspects of American society, and a deep respect \nfor Japanese society and culture. The new Japanese leadership of \nJunichiro Koizumi could not begin its relationship with Washington on a \nmore auspicious note.\n  I have personally known Howard Baker for nearly a quarter of a \ncentury. I know him for his steady, calm presence and for his wise \ncounsel. I know him for his love of country, and for his deep \nunderstanding of how the world beyond our borders works. He and his \ndear wife, former Senator Nancy Kassebaum, will be missed in \nWashington. But we can rest assured that our country's interests in \nJapan are superbly represented by this exceptionally dedicated and \ntalented couple. I know that my colleagues concur and join me in \nwishing Howard Baker Godspeed.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to add my support to the \nnomination of Howard H. Baker, Jr., to be the U.S. Ambassador to Japan.\n  Howard Baker has an outstanding record of serving the people of the \nUnited States as an officer in the U.S. Navy, as a Senator, as White \nHouse Chief of Staff to President Reagan, and as a member of numerous \nPresidential Advisory Boards. During the nearly 20 years that he \nrepresented Tennessee in the U.S. Senate, he served as both the \nminority and majority leader, earning the respect of his colleagues and \na reputation as a talented, fair leader, and consensus builder. Senator \nBaker also served on the Foreign Relations Committee and was a \nCongressional Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly.\n  The experience and the skill that Senator Baker has developed as a \nlong time public servant will be valuable as he takes on the important \nrole of working to strengthen U.S. relations with Japan. Howard Baker \nsucceeds a long and illustrious line of envoys to Japan including \nformer House Speaker Tom Foley, former Vice President Walter Mondale, \nMichael Hayden Armacost, and former Majority Leader Mike Mansfield. I \nam sure that he will represent the United States with honor, in a \nmanner that reflects well upon his predecessors.\n  I am also especially pleased that the United States will benefit from \nthe wisdom and expertise of Nancy Kassebaum Baker, our former \ncolleague, who will accompany her husband in this important endeavor. I \nhad the pleasure of working with Senator Kassebaum on many issues and \nknow that America is getting a truly excellent team to represent our \ncountry in Japan.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to state how delighted I \nam that the President has nominated a statesman of such skill and \nintegrity to serve as our Ambassador in Japan. Senator Baker had just \ncompleted three terms when I entered this body, including terms as \nmajority and minority leader. He was well known as a man\n\n[[Page S5564]]\n\nof courtesy and thoughtfulness, who managed difficult political battles \nwith grace and good humor. He took those traits with him to the White \nHouse, where as Chief of Staff he played a key role in rebuilding \npublic confidence in a presidency that was racked by foreign policy \nscandal. Throughout his career Senator Baker has often been called into \nservice to help heal the ruptures created by difficult issues like \nWatergate, the Panama Canal and Iran-Contra; and he has repeatedly \nplayed a key role in forging the bipartisan consensus necessary to move \nour government and our nation forward.\n  There is no relationship more important for the U.S. than Japan. The \nvicissitudes of our difficult relationship with an emerging China, or \nthe ongoing frictions on the Korean Peninsula, tend to attract most of \nthe media attention devoted to Asia. But it is in fact Japan that is \nthe indispensable country to the U.S. in Asia. Even after a decade of \nslow growth, Japan has by far the largest economy in Asia, and is the \nlargest overseas market for U.S. products. Japan is an important \ninvestor in the United States, including in my state of West Virginia. \nJapan hosts the largest number of American troops in Asia, and is an \nimportant ally in our efforts to promote peace, prosperity and \ndemocracy throughout Asia.\n  The nomination of Senator Baker as Ambassador to Tokyo--the most \nrecent in a series of senior statesman to serve in that critical post--\nwill send confirmation to our Japanese allies the tremendous importance \nthe United Sates attaches to our partnership with Japan. I know he will \nwork with the new Government of Prime Minister Koizumi to express \nsupport for measures that will restart the Japanese economy, and enable \nJapan to resume its part as one of the locomotives of global growth. I \nknow he will work with Japan to continue to re-invigorate our security \nalliance, which plays such an important role in maintaining peace in \nAsia. And I know he, by his very presence in Tokyo, will dispel \nJapanese perceptions that America is ``Japan-passing.'' Having followed \nU.S.-Japan relations for the past 40 years, I am confident that U.S. \nrelations with Japan are not moribund but in fact mature.\n  I commend the President for his excellent selection of a \nrepresentative for this critical post, and add how pleased I am that \nhis wonderful and talented wife, our former colleague, Senator Nancy \nKassebaum, will be in Tokyo with him. I can think of no one better to \njoin him on this mission than my dear and most admired former \ncolleague.\n  I will vote to support the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today also in enthusiastic and \nstrong support for the nomination of Senator Howard Baker to be U.S. \nAmbassador to the nation of Japan. In fact, Mr. President, I can think \nof no person who could represent America with more honor and more \ndistinction than my fellow Tennessean, Howard Baker, a truly \nextraordinary man and an extraordinary leader in this body, in his \ncommunity, and this Nation.\n  As we all know, Senator Baker served as the United States Senator \nfrom the great State of Tennessee for three terms. He served as \nminority leader, majority leader, and he served President Ronald Reagan \nas White House Chief of Staff.\n  More important than all of that, which we know, he has served America \nlong and well, with unfailing grace, with inexhaustible courage, and \nwith integrity; never hesitating, as we just heard from the majority \nleader, in taking on the tough tasks, the tough assignments, never \nfailing to shoot straight with us, to call it like it is. Whether it \nwas winning over, in Tennessee, traditional Democrats, union members, \nto become the first Republican in the history of Tennessee to be \nelected to the Senate and teaming up with Senators to pass monumental \nand historic clean air and water bills without a single dissenting \nvote, or lobbying his colleagues to allow the televising of Senate \nproceedings, which are routine today, or supporting plans to end the \ndraft, or to provide for the direct election of the President, or give \n18-year-olds the right to vote, or investigating a President of his own \nparty, or forging a foreign policy consensus to check Soviet cold war \nexpansion, Howard Baker never flinched from the tough decisions.\n  He always put principle before politics. He was not just a good \nSenator; he wasn't just a good leader; but he was a good mentor and \nfriend to me personally.\n  What is remarkable as we hear people in this body talking about him, \nis his ability to build coalitions, his ability to disarm his opponents \nwith compromise that addressed both the concerns of supporters and \nlimited the problems of dissenters, bringing them together, addressing \nconcerns from groups who would not normally be together--leaving all \nsides in good spirits.\n  I mentioned the personal reflection of being a good mentor and a good \nfriend. Again, this comes from my own experience when 10 years ago I \nwas trying to make a decision of how best to enter public service. I \nwent by to see Senator Baker, someone whom I did not know, someone whom \nI had not met--sitting down with that person in conversation--and you \nknow it is a conversation he has had with hundreds and hundreds of \npeople thinking about public service--sitting down for an hour and \nlistening to what not only a campaign would be like but what the \nprivilege of serving the United States of America in this body was all \nabout.\n  Over the next year and a half I made three more appointments with him \nand took my wife Karen to listen to him, to talk to him. Indeed, he \nseemed to listen more to us than we did to him, in the thoughtful way \nof introspection and then comment. Yes, ultimately, after those \nconversations I decided, in large part based on those conversations, to \nrun for the Senate.\n  At the height of his political power, Howard Baker stunned Washington \nby making a decision to leave the Senate, following his own advice of \nterm limits, of the citizen legislator, only to be called back by \nPresident Reagan who tapped him as the White House Chief of Staff. He \nserved President Reagan well.\n\n  The majority leader, a few minutes ago, mentioned that that legacy \nlives on. It was 2 years ago that he did come and give the lecture \nseries--we will hear President Ford later tonight--and the title of \nthat talk 2 years ago was ``On Herding Cats,'' talking about his \nexperience in this body, each of the little points of the ``Bakers \nDozen,'' of the 13 points I remember, as I listened in awe, as I \nlistened in pride to my fellow Tennessean.\n  ``Listen more often than you speak,'' was one of the 13;\n  ``Be patient,'' another;\n  ``Tell the truth, whether you have to or not,'' was another;\n  ``Be civil, and encourage others to do the same.''\n  So his story continues to unfold. Tonight, as we come together both \nto praise him and to support his nomination, we recognize that he \nremains an informal and trusted adviser, a model to which all \npoliticians in Tennessee aspire, a friend to freedom, to democracy, a \ndefender of principle, a man of honesty, integrity, and courage, who \nwill represent America well.\n  His wife Nancy Kassebaum Baker has been mentioned, a friend to all of \nus. Together they make an experienced team, a knowledgeable team; \ntogether, a tremendous asset to the United States of America.\n  It is, indeed, with honor and pleasure, and I should say pride as a \nTennessean, that I close in my support for Howard H. Baker, Jr., for \nthe post of U.S. Ambassador to Japan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nHoward Baker for Ambassador to Japan. I, first of all, compliment my \ncolleague, Senator Frist, for his eloquent remarks which encapsulated \nSenator Baker's career and his character. It is very gratifying to hear \nso many favorable remarks about someone whom we hold so dear.\n  This was the case this morning as we had the hearing on Senator \nBaker. We heard so many from both sides of the aisle--Senator Biden, \nSenator Byrd--say so many nice things about the Senator. It is a very \npersonal matter to me in many respects.\n  Many years ago, I, with shaky hand, dialed a telephone number in \norder to\n\n[[Page S5565]]\n\nreturn a call from Senator Howard Baker. He had asked me to come up as \ncounsel to the Watergate committee when he served as minority leader of \nthat committee. Today that is the telephone number of my office because \nI have the privilege of occupying the chair. As I said earlier today, \nno one will be able to fill the shoes of Howard Baker, but I am \nprivileged to occupy what we call the Howard Baker seat. I am sure \nothers who have held that seat would not begrudge me referring to it in \nthat way.\n  I would probably not be in politics were it not for Howard Baker. I \nleft a job I dearly loved as assistant U.S. attorney many years ago, as \na young lawyer, to go and manage middle Tennessee for Howard Baker, as \nif anyone could manage him, or as if he needed managing.\n  A young lawyer by the name of Lamar Alexander, later to be Governor \nof Tennessee, came to me and suggested this to me and suggested it to \nhim and put us together. I asked how much the job paid and they said \nnothing. So with my usual business sense, I said that sounded good to \nme. I took on the job. Of course, he was the first popularly elected \nRepublican in the history of Tennessee.\n  During Watergate, I had an opportunity that I know no other young man \nor young lawyer has ever had; that is, to sit at the right hand, \nliterally and figuratively, of a man such as Howard Baker during the \nmost tumultuous time in our generation and in American history. I saw \nhim and the difficulties he encountered. We were dealing with a \nPresident of the United States who was a friend of Senator Baker. We \nwere dealing with members of the Cabinet such as John Mitchell, who \nwere friends of Senator Baker. I saw the agony that he went through as \nhe tried to be fair. But he also tried to be steadfast to the \nConstitution of the United States. He walked that line and he showed \nthe ethical and moral dimensions of his character.\n  He gave an example not only to this young lawyer at the time but to \nall of America of what it meant to be a statesman. In fact, I think the \nword ``statesman'' was coined for individuals such as Howard Baker \nbecause he demonstrated to all of us that it matters not only what you \ndo but how you do it.\n  It is a great pleasure to see how revered he is by those who served \nwith him, not the least of which, of course, is Senator Byrd of West \nVirginia, who served as the majority leader when Senator Baker served \nas minority leader. I heard them talk earlier today. I am looking \nforward to hearing Senator Byrd again on the floor, but I sat there and \nthought what two strong men, what two great men, oftentimes disagreeing \nbut working together for the benefit of their country, what an example \nthey set for us doing their job with mutual respect and only one thing \nin their minds--ultimately, serving their States and their country.\n  Senator Baker said earlier today that essentially, after all is said \nand done, he is a man of the Senate. Of course, the same could be said \nof Senator Byrd.\n  I compliment President Bush for making this appointment. Senator \nBaker--I assume; I have never really talked to him about it--was not an \nintimate of the Bush campaign, although I know he was a hard worker for \nit. I assume, looking back on it, that former President Bush and he \nwere somewhat friendly competitors, as they were coming along about the \nsame time. President Bush, the current President, obviously, has the \ngood judgment to reach out and get the best for this most serious \nappointment.\n  This is a troubled part of the world. It is probably going to create \nmore trouble for us in the years to come. We have a very unusual, \nambiguous relationship with the country of China right now, as in many \nrespects China is progressing in terms of its economy and in terms of \nits economic openness, while at the same time it is increasing its \nmilitary might and has 300 missiles along its coast pointed toward \nTaiwan. It, clearly, has designs on being the predominant player in \nthat part of the world, whether it be Taiwan or the South China Sea \nislands or various other parts of that area of the world.\n  It is extremely important that we maintain the best of relations with \nour friends and our allies in that area. There is none more important \nthan the country of Japan.\n  Japan is undergoing its own internal changes that at this point we \nare attempting, while not being an overbearing friend, to be a helpful \nfriend, whether it be with regard to reform of their banking system or \nthe other aspects of their economy, and to go through those tough \nchanges, that we and other countries have had to go through, to get to \nwhere they need to get. It is a very delicate time. They are undergoing \na change in their leadership right now.\n\n  For all of these reasons, it is going to take a wise person, a steady \nhand representing us in that part of the world. Thank goodness we have \na man such as Howard Baker to take on that job.\n  We make it very difficult nowadays for people to come in and serve \ntheir country. Our nomination process takes too long. It is too \nintrusive. The rewards oftentimes do not outweigh the benefits. But, \nthank God, we still have people such as Howard Baker and so many others \nwho are willing to give a portion of their time to serve their country.\n  I am totally content that Senator Baker is going to serve as another \nin a long line of illustrious predecessors who have held this job and \nmade America proud. America and the world will be better because he has \nserved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on the nomination \nof former Senator Howard Baker to be the next U.S. Ambassador to Japan. \nThis will be a vote I will long remember and of which I will long be \nproud. It will be one of those proud moments in the history of the \nSenate.\n  I have voted on many nominations, and I have cast 16,027 votes as of \nnow. This will be one of the best votes I have ever cast. I have no \ndoubt that this former colleague, with whom I worked so closely, will \nbe an excellent representative of the United States to the Japanese \nGovernment and the Japanese people.\n  Senator Howard Baker served his home State of Tennessee in this \nChamber for three terms, from 1967 to 1985. As the country began to \nrecover from the scandal of Watergate, Howard Baker was chosen to lead \nthe other side of the aisle as minority leader while I served as \nmajority leader, positions that we would later exchange. Senator Baker \ndistinguished himself as a man of strong character, sound judgment, and \ngood humor. Having followed his father, with whom I served in the House \nof Representatives, his stepmother, and his father-in-law in Congress--\nagain, speaking of his father-in-law, I can see Everett Dirksen \nstanding in his place. I can see his unruly hair. I can see him \ngesturing and uttering the most beautiful phrases. He could paint word \npictures, Everett Dirksen--\n  Senator Baker comes with great credentials in many ways. He had a \ndeep and abiding understanding of and respect for the legislative \nbranch. There was no doubt in Howard Baker's mind as to where the \nlegislative branch stood. He knew of the Constitution. He knew about \nthe separation of powers and the checks and balances. He was one who \nwould always uphold those principles. His love for the Senate, his love \nfor his country always came before partisan imperatives.\n  Senator Baker was often a voice of reason in challenging times. As \nthe ranking Republican on the select committee that investigated the \nWatergate affair, his stated intent for the hearings was to determine \nthe answer to the memorable question, as he put it: What did the \nPresident know and when did he know it?\n  I think everyone in this country has heard those words and probably \nmost of us will remember having heard them.\n  Senator Baker and I joined together on a number of major initiatives \nthat were important to the country as well as to the Senate. I can \nremember the Panama Canal treaties. I was majority leader. I was \nagainst the treaties to begin with. Howard Baker was against the \ntreaties. I went to Panama and took with me six other Senators: Senator \nSarbanes, Senator Metzenbaum, Senator Matsunaga, Senator Riegle. There \nwere seven, I believe.\n  We went to Panama. We talked to Americans living there. We talked to \nour military people. We talked with our State Department people. We\n\n[[Page S5566]]\n\ntalked with the representatives of the Government of Panama, including \nGeneral Torrijos. I read all about the history of the Panama Canal by \nDavid McCullough, ``The Path Between the Seas.'' It is fascinating. \nAnything David McCullough writes is fascinating. I changed my mind \nabout it.\n  Both Howard Baker and I knew we were swimming uphill, so to speak. \nThe polls showed that the great majority of the American people were \nagainst those treaties. There were two of them. They were against those \ntreaties. A majority of the Members of the Senate were against the \ntreaties. So we had an uphill battle. We both came to the conclusion \nthat it was in the best interest of the United States to ratify those \ntreaties. It was a difficult task.\n  I can remember coming in here on a Sunday and meeting with the \nPanamanian Ambassador to the United States and with our own State \nDepartment people right down the hall to my right here, in room 207, \nwhich was and is named the Mansfield Room. I remember our meeting; and \nthen in the room there, which was formerly the room of the Presidents \npro tempore of the Senate, we met to hammer out some differences.\n  Howard Baker and I formulated two amendments to the treaty, and but \nfor those two amendments--which we called the leadership amendments \nbecause the two leaders were joining--but for the leadership \namendments, the treaties would not have been approved.\n  What I am saying is this. Here was a man who stood above party and \nvoted for what he thought was in the best interests of the country, \nrealizing that in the next election he would pay a price for that. I am \nstill paying a price in West Virginia. There are still those who \nremember my votes for the treaties and continue to write to me about \nthem to remind me. But he was in a far more difficult position than I. \nThe Democrats controlled the Senate. We had at that time a Democratic \nPresident, President Jimmy Carter. So it was more difficult for Howard \nBaker.\n  But notwithstanding the difficulties, notwithstanding the politics of \nthe matter, which were adverse to the position we took, Howard Baker \nproudly took that position, stating it clearly, articulately, and \neffectively; and because he joined in approving the treaties, we were \nsuccessful. We ended up, on both treaties, getting a vote of two-thirds \nof the Senate plus one vote. We had one vote to spare. So we joined \ntogether on that occasion. I can't forget that.\n  I have said many times--and I said it this morning in the Foreign \nRelations Committee hearing on the nomination--that there are several \nmedallions in the Senate reception room just off the floor here, and in \nfive of those medallions we find the pictures of Webster, Calhoun, \nClay, La Follette, and Taft of Ohio. I have stated one day this Senate \nwill determine the names of other Senators whose pictures and names \nwill go in those remaining medallions. The Senate has already made a \ndecision, I believe, with regard to the next medallion or so.\n  But at some point in time Howard Baker's picture--it is my hope--will \nappear in those medallions. So today, for the Record--although I won't \nbe here, I am sure, when that decision is made--I nominate Howard Baker \nbecause he was a Senator who stood above the fog in public duty and in \nprivate thinking and took a hard position. It was hard for him and hard \nfor his party, more so than mine. He provided invaluable support in \nthat instance, as I say. And he also joined me in my effort to bring \ntelevision coverage to the floor of the Senate.\n\n  In later years, he served well. You see, he served as minority leader \nfirst with me when I was majority leader, and then I served as minority \nleader while he was majority leader. Always, I found Howard Baker to be \na very agreeable, down-home, homespun person, a person who had great \ncommon sense, which is so often absent in the halls of Government--\ncommon sense, and a man of good humor, very intelligent, exceedingly \nknowledgeable, highly articulate, a man of the people.\n  He served as President Reagan's Chief of Staff at a time when mature \ncounsel and moderate leadership in the White House were needed.\n  In a 1998 address to the Members of this body, Senator Baker recalled \nthe lessons that helped him as majority leader from 1981 to 1985. This \nis what he said:\n\n       What really makes the Senate work--as our heroes knew \n     profoundly--is an understanding of human nature, an \n     appreciation of hearts as well as minds, the frailties as \n     well as the strengths, of one's colleagues and one's \n     constituents.\n\n  That is bringing it right down to the common understanding, bringing \nit right down to earth. I suggest that this lesson will continue to \nserve him well in his role as Ambassador to Japan.\n  Over the years, the United States has sent some of its finest \ncitizens to Japan to act as the President's representative, most \nrecently Tom Foley, former Speaker of the House of Representatives; and \nprior to him there was Walter Mondale, former Vice President of the \nUnited States, and Mike Mansfield, former majority leader of the \nSenate. The appointment of Senator Baker to this position will again \ndemonstrate the importance of our relationship with Japan, the most \nprosperous country in Asia, and, more importantly, allow our Government \nto regain the services of a very talented individual who has spent more \nthan half of his life in the service of this country.\n  As Senator Thompson mentioned a little while ago, Nancy Kassebaum, a \nformer Senator, will be there likewise. Howard Baker and his wife Nancy \nwill be a great team. She could well serve as U.S. Ambassador to Japan \nin her own right.\n  Japan will be a vital partner to the United States in what many are \ncalling ``the Pacific century.'' Senator Baker will represent our \ncountry in a nation of great importance, in a region of great change, \nin a world in transition. I am confident that he will work to the best \nof his considerable abilities to ensure a prosperous, peaceful, and \nproductive relationship with Japan.\n  I don't know of anyone, Democrat or Republican, I would be happier to \nstand on this floor and recommend to the people of the United States as \nAmbassador of Japan, or anyone who could serve more ably, or one who \nwould be more effective. There isn't anyone who would be more patriotic \nand dedicated to the service of his country than Howard Baker.\n  I came to the floor immediately after the hearing and urged the \nmajority leader to bring this nomination up today. There is no point in \nwaiting. Bring it up today. I asked my own leader on this side of the \naisle if we could do this nomination today. Of course, they had already \nmade up their minds to do it today.\n  I have looked forward to this moment. I am proud of my service with \nHoward Baker. I am proud of Howard Baker because he typifies to me a \ntrue Senator, a Senator who understands the importance of party, \npolitical party, but a Senator who puts the Senate and the Constitution \nand his country above political party. I know because I was here when \nhe did it.\n  As my former colleague prepares to journey to Tokyo following his \nconfirmation, Erma and I will be wishing him and Nancy, his lovely \nwife, the best and a very successful tenure in that office.\n  Mr. President, I close by those words first written by Horace Greeley \nbecause they typify what I think is best about Howard Baker and \nbasically what is most needed by every statesman who serves in \ngovernment, whether at the national or local level, and basically what \ndistinguishes one individual from another perhaps:\n\n       Fame is a vapor, popularity an accident, riches take wing. \n     Only one thing endures, and that is character.\n\n  This man has it. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia on a characteristically extraordinary statement. He \nspeaks for all of us. He spoke eloquently, sincerely, and truthfully.\n  Senator Mike Mansfield once called America's relationship with Japan \nour most important bilateral relationship. How right he was.\n  Combined, our two countries account for more than 40 percent of the \nworld's gross domestic product. When our nations work together, we can \nmake and have made Asia more stable, Japan stronger, and America more \nsecure.\n  Today, during this time of transition in Asia, our alliance with \nJapan is\n\n[[Page S5567]]\n\nmore important than ever. I can think of no individual better equipped \nthan Senator Howard Baker to ensure that our two countries continue to \nwork together and succeed together.\n  As our distinguished Senator from West Virginia noted, Senator Baker \nserved not only as the Republican leader, as the minority leader of the \nparty, but also as the majority leader at a time when America faced \nchallenges at home and the monumental challenge of the cold war. He \nworked with his colleagues in the Senate without regard to party \naffiliation to lead us through countless legislative challenges, and he \nproved to be a statesman without equal.\n  By confirming Senator Baker's nomination, we are sending Japan more \nthan an outstanding Ambassador. We are sending a message that we \nbelieve Senator Mansfield's observation is truer today than it has ever \nbeen. The alliance between our two great nations is so important that \nit demands an Ambassador of the caliber of Senator Howard Baker, and I \nam certain that Japan will recognize, by receiving Senator Baker and \nSenator Nancy Kassebaum, that America is clearly sending its very best.\n  I join with my colleagues this afternoon in expressing heartfelt \ncongratulations to Howard and Nancy, to express a sentiment I know is \nshared by every Member of this body in our pride and admiration for \nthem and in our hope that they continue to enjoy public service and our \nthanks for serving their country so well. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nnomination of Howard Baker to be U.S. Ambassador to Japan. I must say, \nand I am merely here speaking to the Japanese, I think this nomination \nis yet again a clear indication of the importance the United States \nattaches to the relationship with Japan.\n  For now what will be a quarter of a century, we have sent Senator \nMike Mansfield, Speaker Tom Foley, and now Senator Howard Baker as our \nrepresentatives to the Japanese Government and to the Japanese people. \nI hope it is fully appreciated in Japan--and I think it is--exactly \nwhat this means in terms of how highly we value this relationship, how \nimportant we think it is to the course of events internationally and, \nof course, how much it reflects the very strong conviction on the part \nof all of us here that Howard Baker and his wife Nancy will do an \noutstanding job representing us.\n  I have taken the floor of the Senate on occasion to oppose \nambassadorial nominations, particularly non-career ambassadorial \nnominations. I do not take the position that all Ambassadors should \ncome out of the career service because I think we can draw from outside \nof the career service to bring people who can make a real \ncontribution--and there is something of a tradition of that in our \ncountry--although I think it is very important that the large majority \nof the positions go to career people in part to help maintain the \nmorale of the Foreign Service, so someone going into the Foreign \nService at a young age and committing a career to the Foreign Service, \nwho has an opportunity to rise and become an Ambassador, is not cut off \nas they move up the ladder because the Ambassadors are all brought in \nfrom outside. That would have a very harmful impact on the morale of \nthe Foreign Service, and I think having a Foreign Service with high \nmorale is a very important thing in contributing to America's interests \nand objectives around the world.\n  If someone were to come to me and say, ``You have admitted you would \naccept non-career people; you do not have an absolutely rigid position \non that; what kind of people is it you are looking for in terms of non-\ncareer people to become Ambassadors,'' I would start right off by \nsaying I would be looking for someone like Howard Baker. This can be \nthe mold, in a sense, of what we are looking for from outside the \ncareer foreign service.\n  We have all known Howard well in the Senate. We hold him in enormous \nrespect. He is a man of great wisdom and judgment, of never-failing \ncourtesy. All here who have dealt with him always sensed the respect he \nextended to others which, of course, evoked a respect from others back \ntowards him. We need to remember that lesson around here sometimes.\n  Over the years we saw him exercise power with a sensitivity and a \nresponsibility that is a real tribute to him as a leader. We have a lot \nof difficult issues that arise from time to time with Japan.\n  We ought not let those issues cause us to lose sight of how important \nhaving a strong positive relationship is with that country. I am sure \nHoward Baker, as his predecessors, Tom Foley and Mike Mansfield, have \ndone, will be able to communicate that to the Japanese people and \ncommunicate back to Members of the Congress the situation that exists.\n  One of the things that both Ambassador Mansfield and Ambassador Foley \ndid was maintain contacts with Members of Congress. Having come out of \nthe institution, they appreciated the role it plays in these \nrelationships. I think that is one of the strengths that Howard Baker \nwill bring to this ambassadorship. Second, he served in the White House \nas chief of staff, so he knows the workings of the executive branch. He \ncan bring that expertise also to bear as he assumes this very important \nresponsibility.\n  I think Nancy Baker will be an extremely important dimension to this \nambassadorship. I know at one point there was talk of a co-\nambassadorship. I don't quite see how you do that, given the direct \nresponsibilities on an Ambassador, but I am sure she will add a very \nsignificant and extra dimension to this representation that our country \nwill have in Japan.\n  I am pleased to take the floor, along with my other colleagues, in \nsupport of this nomination. I thank the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia for his very eloquent statement about Howard Baker, about \ntheir relationship in the Senate, and about his character.\n  This is a man of character. This is a man of wisdom. This is a man of \njudgment. This is a man of civility. I am delighted he will be our \nAmbassador to Japan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination as \nwell of Senator Howard Baker to be Ambassador to Japan, and of Nancy \nKassebaum, a good friend of mine, a former Senator from Kansas, to go \nalong, as well.\n  Senator Baker I have gotten to know better. I have not served in this \nbody with him.\n  I have known Nancy Kassebaum very well over the years, her political \nhistory in Kansas. Her family has great leadership in my State. Her \ndad, Alf Landon, was a Presidential nominee, and in 1936 was Governor \nof Kansas. Senator Kassebaum followed in his footsteps as a very able, \nqualified, wholesome, and dignified public servant. She did an \nexcellent job. She will do an excellent job in Japan, as well.\n  Senator Howard Baker I have gotten to know later in life. Sometimes \nhe has come to Kansas State University football games. A great fan--and \nhe picks a great team to support. When we play Tennessee, I understand \nthey have a family dispute between Kansas and Tennessee and he stays \nwith Tennessee, while Senator Kassebaum stays with Kansas State \nUniversity.\n  This is an important nomination for reasons already noted, but I will \nreiterate; that is, the significance of the stature of the Ambassador \nwe are sending to represent us in Japan. Japan is a key ally of the \nUnited States. Japan is in a region that will draw increasing focus \nfrom the United States in the future and has in recent times even more \nso. So we are sending to Japan a man of stature from our Nation to \nrepresent us in a part of the world on which we will increasingly \nfocus.\n  We have had difficulties recently in Asia, particularly in our \nrelationship with China. We are expanding our relationship with other \nnations throughout Asia. We are expanding our relationship with India \nand South Asia. This entire region of the world is growing in \nsignificance globally and growing in significance to the United States.\n\n  It is important we send this level of leadership to this region in \nthe form of Senator Baker, for him to be able to represent our \ninterests and our thoughts at this time of expanded U.S. activity and \nengagement throughout that area.\n\n[[Page S5568]]\n\n  I wholeheartedly endorse his nomination as a member of the Committee \non Foreign Relations. I am delighted the United States will have this \nindividual involved in its foreign affairs. He will make an outstanding \nrepresentative, an outstanding Ambassador. Nancy Kassebaum will be a \nco-Ambassador. I think she will be dearly loved by the Japanese people, \nthe same way she was loved by the people of Kansas. While she served in \nthe Senate, there was no politician in the country who had a higher \napproval rating on a statewide basis than Nancy Kassebaum. There are \nsome who say she ranked just below the sunset and the wheat harvest in \nher approval ratings in our State. She had a lofty stature, and she \nwill carry that along with her to Japan. This is a great nomination \nthat I wholeheartedly support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask it be in order for me to deliver my brief remarks \nseated at my desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I made some remarks this morning at the \ntime of the reporting out of the Committee on Foreign Relations the \nvery wise nomination of Howard Baker to be the U.S. Ambassador to \nTokyo. I said then, and I repeat, there is not one Senator who ever \nserved with the distinguished former majority leader of this Senate--\nand I see where he sat right there--not one Senator who would not be \nhonored to join in paying his or her respects to one of the most \nrespected Senators ever to serve in the Senate.\n  All of us have fond memories of our relationship with Senator Baker, \nand all of us like him and respect him and admire him for his \nintelligence and his legislative skills and his ability to broker \nmeaningful compromises and for being just a darn nice guy.\n  I must confess, my affection for Howard is because he has been so \ngracious to my grandchildren, and that is the way to any man's heart. I \nrecall that on one occasion, the day after one of my granddaughters was \nborn, Howard was going to North Carolina with me for a little \nadventure. He called me before we left and he said: Jesse, who is going \nto meet us at the airport?\n  I said: I don't know, but I will find out.\n  He said: I just wondered if I could take a trip.\n  I said: You can go anywhere you want to go.\n  He said: I would like to go to the hospital where that young one of \nyours was born yesterday.\n\n  I said: Howard, you don't need do that.\n  And he said: No, I like grandchildren, and I would like to go, if you \ndon't mind.\n  I said: Fine.\n  He said: As long as I'm going, can I take my camera with me?\n  A lot of people don't know that he is an accomplished photographer \nand has published two or three books of pictures that are outstanding. \nHe took pictures of that young one just born 24 hours earlier, and her \nmama and proud daddy and granddaddy and all the nurses in the hospital.\n  Fast forward about 4 or 5 years and Katie Stuart visited us and \nHoward found out about it. He was then the chief of staff for the \nPresident of the United States at the White House, President Ronald \nReagan. He called me up and said: We need to update that picture that \nwe took at the hospital. So we went down to the White House and he had \nall the lights set up and he said: Now, Jesse, I want you to get Katie \nin your arms and I want to photograph the proudest granddaddy and the \nsweetest granddaughter I ever saw. And he took that picture. That \npicture is on my wall to this good day.\n  Howard Baker will make a great Ambassador. On his own hook he would \nbe great, but he has a second advantage, and that is a lady named Nancy \nKassebaum Baker, who sat right back there, as a great Senator herself. \nAnd as someone said this morning, Nancy herself would make a good \nAmbassador anywhere she was sent.\n  I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that Howard Baker's \nexperience and personal qualities and those of Nancy Kassebaum Baker \nwill serve him and her and them well. The United States relationship \nwith Japan is critical in this new era. In sending an Ambassador such \nas Howard Baker, President Bush has chosen a superbly qualified \nAmerican to represent the American people in Japan, an outstanding ally \nof our country, the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Howard Baker. I \nrealize this is unusual; the chairman of the committee should be the \none to close. I apologize. I didn't know you were speaking. I think I \nam the last to speak and I will be brief.\n  Howard Baker is one of the few men or women nominated for Ambassador \nthat it would be warranted not to be briefed about because there is so \nmuch to say about Howard Baker. The distinguished senior Senator from \nHawaii, standing in the well, knows him as well as I do--and maybe a \nlittle better. I have been here 28 years. He was as fine a leader of \nthe Senate as we had in either party. He is a man who, as I said this \nmorning, possessed not only good judgment but a strong dose of wisdom.\n  Howard Baker has a piece of the country lawyer in him, the country \nlawyer who knows how to cut through difficult circumstances in a way \nthat resolves a situation and at the same time does no harm or damage \nto either the egos and/or positions of either of the parties. That is \nthe mark of a leader. It seems to me that is the primary ingredient \nthat an Ambassador should possess.\n  The appointment of Howard Baker to be Ambassador to Japan is the \nsingle strongest signal that the people of Japan could have that we \nvalue this relationship with Japan.\n  Senator Helms and I have been here the same length of time, Senator \nInouye longer, but I doubt whether there is any country to which we \nhave sent more distinguished men and women--men in this case--than to \nJapan. He goes in the tradition of some truly great Americans. That \nsounds like a trite thing to say, ``great Americans,'' but Mike \nMansfield, ``iron Mike,'' from Montana had more integrity in his little \nfinger than most have in their whole body, a man whom everyone admired, \na distinguished Speaker of the House of Representatives, Tom Foley, a \ndistinguished colleague of ours, and on the opposite side of my friend \nfrom North Carolina, but respected, Fritz Mondale, a man who graced \nthis place--and I mean that literally, graced this body--and Howard \nBaker. And I am leaving out others of consequence as well.\n\n  Let me say it is not hyperbole to suggest, as I did this morning, and \nthe Senator referenced it, that Senator Nancy Kassebaum, all by \nherself, would be fully capable of dispatching the responsibilities of \nthe Ambassador to Japan. Really, as we always say, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina and I, because of our responsibilities on the Foreign \nRelations Committee and confirming all Ambassadors--we always say the \nspouse of the nominee is someone who makes a sacrifice as well as who \nmakes a contribution. It is almost always true, in some cases more than \nothers.\n  This is a combination of political leadership, diplomacy, knowledge, \nand access--access to the corridors of power in the White House--that I \nthink is unparalleled.\n  I join with my colleagues in saying that Howard Baker is a fine \nchoice. More than that, he is a truly fine man.\n  As I said this morning, he and I have been on opposite sides of \nthings--more together than on opposite sides--but I truly consider him \na friend. It is presumptuous of me to say of a man of his stature that \nI am a friend. He was a man of consequence long before I arrived. I \ndon't mean to be presumptuous in saying we are close friends. We are \ndifferent in generations and different in age. But we are friends. I \nadmire him. I admire him very much, and I compliment the President.\n  I will close with what I have always thought to be and I believe to \nbe an old Anglo-Saxon expression. It says: Character is little more \nthan the lengthened shadow of a man.\n  Howard Baker casts a very long shadow. He has great character. He \nwill serve this Nation well at what I believe to be the single most \ncritical time in U.S.-Japanese and U.S.-Asian affairs since the end of \nWorld War II. Words\n\n[[Page S5569]]\n\nmatter; Howard Baker chooses his well, and I know of no place more than \nJapan where words, decorum, and diplomacy matter more.\n  No better choice could be made. I compliment the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me commend President Bush on his appointment of \nformer Senator Howard Baker as the Ambassador to Japan. I guess, since \nwe came to the Senate together, I know him about as well as any. I have \ntraveled with him. I have seen him in action on trips. I have his \nphotography in my home. I visited in his home at Huntsville, TN, with \nhis former wife Joy and, since he lost Joy, he is now married to our \ngreat friend and distinguished former Senator from Kansas, Nancy \nKassebaum.\n  They are a wonderful family, Nancy's son, daughter-in-law, the \ngrandchildren. They are right down there in my hometown of Charleston, \nso I get to see them fortunately from time to time.\n  There is an old wag about coming to the Senate. You wonder how in the \nworld, when you first get here, you got into this exclusive body. Then \nafter a couple of years, you lose all humility and you wonder how the \nrest of them got here.\n  You observe them. Everyone here has a talent, all of high intellect \nand experience or they would not have been selected by their several \nStates.\n  But what I really look for is that judgment. There is no question, \nmore than a balanced budget we need balanced Senators around here, and \nthat was Howard Baker. When I ran for President, I know no one \nremembers that----\n  Mr. BIDEN. I do.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You and I were out there together--to be forgotten.\n  We were asked that question, when you get along to a stage in your \ncampaign, who would you select as Secretary of State? This is back in \nthe early 1980s. And I said Howard Baker because of his sense of \nhistory, his capacity for reasoned judgment, and his intellect. He \nknows the world. He knows Japan. He knows our defense needs, our \nsecurity needs in the Pacific rim, our trade problems and opportunities \nthere and everything else.\n\n  Since others are here and ready and I take it we are ready to vote, \nlet me simply say I am enthused about this particular appointment. I \nthink the country is very fortunate to have him as our Ambassador.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I yield \nthe remainder of the time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the chairman allow me to say one short \nthing?\n  Mr. HELMS. I defer the question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I just wanted to say as a member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, to the chairman and my ranking member, as \na new Member, I was quite struck today at the testimony taken with \nregard to Senator Baker.\n  First of all, I saw the deep respect that Senator Biden and Senator \nHelms had for him. And then I heard the testimony from Senator Dole as \nwell, and Senator Byrd.\n  What struck me was Senator Biden's words, when he referred to Senator \nBaker as a man of the Senate. Before I came here, I would not have \nknown the depth of feeling in that statement. But as I have had the \nprivilege of getting to know all of you, and to interact with you on a \ndaily basis, I now understand the respect that you accorded to Senator \nBaker by referring to him as a man of the Senate: Someone whose word \ncan be counted on; someone who has principles; someone whose sense of \nintegrity other people recognize. Isn't that what we need in our \nGovernment these days?\n  So it is with a feeling of great privilege that, as a new Senator, I \njoin with all of you supporting Senator Baker to be our Ambassador to \nthis very important country, to further the interests of the United \nStates of America.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question is, Will \nthe Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Howard H. Baker, \nJr., of Tennessee, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary \nof the United States of America to Japan?\n  The yeas have and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.
