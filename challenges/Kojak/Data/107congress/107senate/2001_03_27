Mr. President, I never thought I would be putting a \nRichard Cohen column in the Congressional Record for any purpose on any \nissue, and certainly not on campaign finance reform. But I think this \nliberal columnist of the Washington Post must have had an epiphany. His \ncolumn this morning I think is noteworthy, and I want to read a couple \nparts of it before putting it in the Record.\n  Richard Cohen said this morning in the Washington Post with regard to \nthe underlying bill that it would do damage to the first amendment. He \nsaid:\n\n       There is no getting around that. The AFL-CIO is right about \n     it. The American Civil Liberties Union is right too. Some \n     senators who support McCain-Feingold do not quibble with that \n     assessment; they say only that no bill is perfect. . . .\n\n  Further in the article, Cohen says:\n\n       The trouble is that the lobbyists on K Street will \n     ultimately figure out a way around any campaign finance \n     reform. This is virtually a physical law in Washington, like \n     water seeking its own level. It happened following the \n     Watergate reforms, and it will happen this time, too.\n       And so when that happens we will be left with nothing much \n     in the way of reform. But we will be left with a bit less \n     free speech. Specifically, we will be left with severe \n     restrictions on so-called issue advocacy. Sometimes these \n     efforts are scurrilous and underhanded: Remember the scuzzy \n     attack by friends of George Bush on John McCain's record on \n     cancer research? But sometimes such attacks are valuable \n     additions to the political debate.

It's corruption by a \n     different name.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Richard Cohen column be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 27, 2001]\n\n                       . . . Preserve Free Speech\n\n                           (By Richard Cohen)\n\n       To tell the truth, I had no intention of ever writing about \n     campaign finance reform, as in the McCain-Feingold bill. It \n     is a complicated matter, clotted with arcane terms like \n     ``soft money,'' ``hard money'' and now--and God help us--\n     ``non-severability.'' This is the sort of mind-numbing issue \n     that I felt could be better handled by a panel of experts on \n     the Jim Lehrer show--people with three names, like Doris \n     Kearns Goodwin.\n       But an unaccountable sense of professional obligation got \n     the better of me. I have done my reading, done my \n     interviewing, consulted some very wise people and asked \n     myself one basic question: What is it that I hold most dear \n     in American public life? The answer, as always: the First \n     Amendment.\n       Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), one of those wise men I \n     consulted, tried to make me see matters differently. He \n     essentially stated his case in an eloquent speech on the \n     floor of the Senate, pleading for campaign finance reform as \n     a way to restore the people's confidence in the political \n     system--to make us all feel that the votes of our \n     representatives are not for sale.\n       Oddly enough, it was just that quality--a restoration of \n     faith or idealism--that attracted me to Sen. John McCain's \n     presidential campaign. Here was a candidate who in words, \n     deeds and something undefinable had many convinced that good \n     people could do good in government, and that the power of \n     money had to be met by the power of ideas. McCain deserves \n     all the credit he can get for putting the issue before the \n     public.\n       But his bill would do damage to the First Amendment. There \n     is not getting around that. The AFL-CIO is right about it. \n     The American Civil Liberties Union is right too. Some \n     Senators who support McCain-Feingold do not quibble with that \n     assessment; they say only that no bill is perfect and no \n     constitutional right is absolute. In this case, they say, we \n     will have to give up some free speech rights to gain some \n     control over a very messy and sometimes corrupt campaign \n     finance system.\n       The trouble is that the lobbyists of K Street will \n     ultimately figure out a way around any campaign finance \n     reform. This is virtually a physical law in Washington, like \n     water seeking its own level. It happened following the \n     Watergate reforms, and it will happen this time, too.\n       And so when that happens we will be left with nothing much \n     in the way of reform. But we will be left with a bit less \n     free speech. Specifically, we will be left with severe \n     restrictions on so-called issue advocacy. Sometimes these \n     efforts are scurrilous and underhanded: Remember the scuzzy \n     attack by friends of George Bush on John McCain's record on \n     cancer research? But sometimes such attacks are valuable \n     additions to our political debate. However you judge them, \n     they are speech by a different name, and the First Amendment \n     protects them all.\n       McCain-Feingold has various restrictions on issue advocacy. \n     I will not bore you with the details. But those details are \n     what so worries the AFL-CIO, the ACLU and--if they are to be \n     believed--some of the GOP opponents of the bill in the \n     Senate.\n       Probably, the courts will toss these provisions--that's why \n     non-severability is so important. (Non-severability means \n     that none of the law will take effect if any part of it is \n     ruled unconstitutional.) McCain calls non-severability \n     ``French for `kill campaign finance reform,' '' and \n     undoubtedly he is right. Still, Congress has no business \n     enacting a law--any law--that contains provisions it knows \n     will not pass constitutional muster.\n       But Congress is feeling real sorry for itself. Many of its \n     members work long and hard and don't make anything like the \n     money you can get just for failing at a big corporate job. On \n     talk radio, they're denounced by intellectually corrupt \n     personalities who make much more money, work many fewer hours \n     and talk about Congress as if it were entirely on the take.\n       So there is a great desire to do something--almost \n     anything, it seems, to convince the public that not all \n     Washington is for sale. Much of the Washington press corps, \n     symbiotically tied to government for its sense of importance, \n     also cried out for reform. But this particular reform comes \n     at a steep price, even the criminalization of what heretofore \n     was free speech.\n       No doubt the power and wealth of special interests post a \n     problem for the political system. But worse than the ugly \n     cacophony of a last-minute smear campaign is the chill of any \n     government-imposed silence. That's not reform. It's \n     corruption by a different name.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I also noted with interest David Broder's column this \nmorning. Broder can best be described as something of a moderate on the \ncampaign finance issue. He has been at several different places over \nthe years. He makes this point about raising the hard money limit.\n  Much has changed in America since 1974, the year that Richard Nixon \nwas forced to resign from the Presidency. Since then, we have had six \nother Presidents, the arrival of the Internet, and enough inflation to \nmake the 1974 dollar worth 35 cents. That debate will, of course, occur \nduring the course of the Hagel amendment.\n  Broder goes on to point out:\n\n       Twenty-six years ago, Congress said that contributions \n     below $1,000 were free of that taint. Is there something \n     magical about that figure, or could it be bumped up to $2,000 \n     or even $3,000 in order to finance robust campaigns without \n     forcing candidates to spend as much time organizing \n     fundraisers or dialing for dollars as they do in the current \n     money chase?\n\n  Further in the article:\n\n       Democrats and liberal interest groups claim that raising \n     the $1,000 limit would benefit only a few wealthy givers. \n     Only one-tenth of one percent of adult Americans made a \n     political contribution of $1,000 in the last cycle. Of \n     course, politics would be healthier if more Americans \n     contributed something, but only a small minority now check \n     their returns to divert $3 of their taxes to the presidential \n     campaign fund--which would cost them nothing.\n\n  All this does is reflect a basic lack of interest in politics on the \npart of the Americans, which is not something we applaud, but it is \ncertainly understandable.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent David Broder's column be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 27, 2001]\n\n                         Raise the Limit . . .\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       Much has changed in America since 1974, the year that \n     Richard Nixon was forced to resign from the presidency. Since \n     then, we have had six other presidents, the arrival of the \n     Internet and enough inflation to make the 1974 dollar worth \n     about 35 cents.\n       This week the Senate faces the question of whether a \n     campaign contribution limit of $1,000 should be adjusted \n     upward for the first time since it was written into law in \n     1974. Amazingly enough, there are people inside and outside \n     Congress who would jeopardize the passage of meaningful \n     campaign finance legislation in order to preserve that $1,000 \n     limit.\n       The Senate clearly has enough votes in sight to pass the \n     McCain-Feingold bill, whose central provision would ban \n     unlimited ``soft-money'' contributions to political parties \n     from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals. These \n     contributions, which can run from $100,000 upward and often \n     are extorted by persistent pressure from candidates and \n     officeholders, are rightly seen as potential sources of \n     political corruption.\n       But before McCain-Feingold comes to an up-or-down vote, \n     senators will confront the question of lifting the $1,000 \n     limit on individual contributions to federal candidates. That \n     ``hard money'' limit applies to regulated contributions that \n     the candidates can use to buy ads or pay for other campaign \n     costs. Raising the hard-money limit will offset some of the \n     revenue lost to the parties if the six-figure soft money is \n     banned.\n       Common sense says--and the Supreme Court has held--that \n     contribution limits are justified by the public interest in \n     preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption. \n     Twenty-six years ago, Congress said that contributions below \n     $1,000 were free of that taint. Is there something magical \n     about that figure, or could it be bumped up to $2,000 or even \n     $3,000 in order to finance robust campaigns without forcing \n     candidates to spend as much time organizing fundraisers or \n     dialing for dollars as they do in the current money chase?\n       Some Democrats and liberal interest groups, avowedly \n     champions of reform, are finding creative rationalizations \n     for opposing an increase in the hard-money contribution \n     limit. Notable among them is Sen. Tom Daschle of South \n     Dakota, the Democratic leader, who has been warning that if \n     the $1,000 limit is raised (or raised by an unspecified ``too \n     much'') he and others will have to reconsider their support \n     for the McCain-Feingold soft-money ban.\n       It may be sheer coincidence that Democrats caught up to \n     Republicans in the past election in the volume of soft-money \n     contributions, while Republicans actually increased their \n     hard-money lead, collecting $447 million to the Democrats' \n     $270 million. Republicans have more contributors, especially \n     small donors, thanks to their well-established direct-mail \n     solicitations, while Democrats have failed to cultivate a \n     similar mass base.\n       Democrats and liberal interest groups claim that raising \n     the $1,000 limit would benefit only a few wealthy givers. \n     Only one-tenth of one percent of adult Americans made a \n     political contribution of $1,000 in the last cycle. Of \n     course, politics would be healthier if more Americans \n     contributed something, but only a small minority now check \n     their returns to divert $3 of their taxes to the presidential \n     campaign fund--which would cost them nothing.\n       The reality is that campaigns are going to be funded by \n     relatively few people, but the notion that the $2,000 \n     contributor of today is\n\n[[Page S2925]]\n\n     more corrupting than the $1,000 contributor of 1974 is \n     nonsense.\n       The second argument is that raising the contribution limit \n     is bad because the goal should be to reduce the amount spent \n     on campaigns. Why? Political communication is expensive in \n     mass-media America. Candidates are competing not only with \n     each other but with all the commercial products and services \n     vying for viewers' attention with their own ads and \n     promotions. Contributions of reasonable size that help \n     candidates get their messages out are good for democracy, not \n     a threat.\n       McCain and Feingold are seeking to negotiate what a \n     ``reasonable'' increase in individual limits would be. Such \n     an amendment would strengthen their bill, not damage it, and \n     certainly should not provide an excuse for Daschle or other \n     Democrats to abandon it.\n       Political journalism lost a notable figure last week with \n     the death of Rowland Evans, for many years the co-author with \n     Robert Novak of one of the most influential columns in this \n     country. Like his partner and many others of us, Evans had \n     his biases, but his hallmark was the doggedness of his \n     reporting. A patrician by birth, he brought a touch of class \n     to his work, and he will be missed.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is noteworthy that nothing in the bill is going to \nquiet the votes of people with great wealth. Here is a full page ad \ntoday, in the Washington Post, paid for by a gazillionaire named Jerome \nKohlberg who firmly believes everybody's money in politics is tainted \nexcept his. His money, of course, is pure. This is the same individual \nwho spent $\\1/2\\ million in Kentucky in 1998 trying to defeat our \ncolleague, Jim Bunning, and I have defended his right, obviously, over \nthe years to do what he wants to do with his money.\n  It further points out that no matter what we do in the Senate, people \nof great wealth are still going to have influence. You are not going to \nbe able to squeeze that out of the system. The Constitution doesn't \nallow it. This is a classic example of how big money is financing the \nreform side in this debate, underwriting Common Cause, underwriting \nads.\n  Essentially, great people of great wealth are paying for the reform \ncampaign. They are free to do that. I defend their right to do it, but \nI think it is noteworthy.\n  I ask a reduced version of this ad in today's Washington Post be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           The Time Has Come\n\n       After two rejections by the Senate of a meaningful Campaign \n     Finance Reform Bill it is now time for the Congress to act.\n       This is not a Democrat or Republican problem. The two \n     operative parties of government now are ``those who give'' \n     and ``those who take,'' coupled with the exorbitant amounts \n     of money involved. This collaboration calls into question the \n     legitimacy of our elections and of the candidates in pursuit \n     of office.\n       Citizen voters are increasingly making it evident that they \n     are disgusted with the process, and questioning the integrity \n     of a system that flies in the face of equal representation. \n     They feel more certain with each election cycle that they are \n     getting a President or Congress mortgaged with ``due bills'' \n     that must be repaid by legislative favors.\n       It is a system that is inimical to our democratic ideals. \n     One that convinces citizens that their government serves \n     powerful organizations and individuals to their detriment. It \n     is this perception that any new legislation must finally \n     address.\n       The time has come for the Congress to demonstrate the \n     statesmanship that the people of our country expect and \n     deserve.--Jerome Kohlberg.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I see Senator Hagel is here and fully capable of \ncontrolling his time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield up to 15 minutes to my colleague \nfrom Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, a week ago yesterday Senator Hagel, our \ncolleague from Nebraska, took the floor of the Senate and with straight \ntalk said some things that made a great deal of sense. They bear \nrepeating at this point in this debate.\n  First, he said it was time for this debate. Our current campaign \nfinance laws make absolutely no sense. That is true. Since the \nproponents are bound and determined to take up their version of what I \ncall ``alleged reform,'' before we get to the business of tax relief, \nthe energy crisis, foreign policy, and national security concerns, not \nto mention a host of other pressing issues, it is time, certainly, to \ndispense with this issue. However, in so doing, let me remind my \ncolleagues of our first obligation. That is to do no harm.\n  Senator Hagel warned we must be careful not to abridge the rights of \nAmericans to participate in our political system and have their voices \nheard. He understood and underscored the paramount importance of the \nfirst amendment to the Constitution, that being the freedom of speech.\n  Second, the Senator from Nebraska then emphasized we should not \nweaken our political parties or other important institutions within our \nAmerican system. He stressed we should encourage greater participation, \nnot less.\n  I want my colleagues and all listening to listen to Senator Hagel.\n\n       I start from the fundamental premise that the problem in \n     the system is not the political party; the problem is not the \n     candidate's campaign; the problem is the unaccountable, \n     unlimited outside moneys and influence that flows into the \n     system where there is either little or no disclosure. That is \n     the core of the issue.\n\n  On that, Senator Hagel was right as rain on a spring day in Nebraska.\n  He went on to say political parties encourage participation, they \npromote participation, and they are about participation. They educate \nthe public and their activities are open, accountable and disclosed. \nAnd, then he nailed the issue when he said:\n  ``Any reform that weakens the parties will weaken the system, lead to \na less accountable system and a system less responsive to and \naccessible by the American people.\n  ``Why,'' Senator Hagel asked, ``Why do we want to ban soft money to \npolitical parties--that funding which is now accountable and \nreportable? This ban would weaken the parties and put more money and \ncontrol in the hands of wealthy individuals and independent groups \naccountable to no one.''\n  It makes sense to me, Senator.\n  Finally, Senator Hagel warned the obvious. In this regard, I simply \ndo not understand why Members of this body and the proponents of \nalleged reform--and all of the twittering media bluebirds sitting on \nthe reform windowsill--are so disingenuous with the obvious. It seems \nto me either they are blinded by their own political or personal \nprejudice or they just don't get it or they just don't want to get it.\n  Senator Hagel warned last week:\n\n       When you take away power from one group, it will expand \n     power for another. I do not believe that our problems lie \n     with candidates for public office and their campaigns. I \n     believe the greatest threat to our political system today is \n     from those who operate outside the boundaries of openness and \n     accountability.\n\n  Three cheers for Chuck Hagel. He has shined the light of truth into \nthe muddle of reform.\n  My colleagues, at the very heart of today's campaign law tortured \nproblems are two simple realities that cannot be changed by any \nlegislative cleverness or strongly held prejudice.\n  First, private money is a fact of life in politics. If you push it \nout of one part of the system it re-enters somewhere else within the \nshadows of or outside the law. Its like prohibition but last time \naround it was prohibition with temples, bedrooms, and labor union \npayoffs.\n  More to the point with members of this body deciding every session \nsome two trillion dollars worth of decisions that affect the daily \nlives and pocketbooks of every American, there is no way anyone can or \nshould limit individual citizens or interest groups of all persuasions \nfrom using private money, their money, to have their say, to protect \ntheir interests, to become partners in government--unless of course you \nprefer a totalitarian government.\n  Second, money spent to communicate with voters cannot be regulated \nwithout impinging on the very core of the first amendment, which was \nwritten as a safeguard and a protection of political discourse.\n  We got into this mess by defying both of these principles with very \npredictable results. Lets see now, here is a reform, let us place \nlimits on money spent to support or defeat candidates.\n  Whoops, those who want to have their say now run ads that are called \nissue advocacy, and we are running at a full gallop in that pasture--\ncan't stop that expression of free speech; it is constitutionally \nprotected, or at least it was until yesterday in Senator Wellstone's \namendment. When my colleagues placed tight limits on contributions to \ncandidates and called that reform, we went down the same trail again. \nWhoops, those who want to\n\n[[Page S2926]]\n\nhave their say in a democracy began giving to political parties with \nunregulated soft money.\n  So now we have hard regulated disclosed and soft unregulated \ndisclosed, and express advocacy and issue advocacy, and they are all \nwrapped up in a legalistic mumbo-jumbo that defies understanding or \nenforcement and has given reform and the Federal Election Commission a \nbad name.\n  My friends, this money-regulating scheme is bankrupt. Yet here we are \nagain with the same medicine show, same horse doctor, and the same old \nmedicine. But this time around we are to ban soft money given to \npolitical parties, and then to really make sure that works, we are \ngoing to restrict independent issue advocacy. We have solved the \nproblem. Right? Wrong.\n  Whoops, instead of less money, we will have more--lots and lots of \nmoney. Pass McCain-Feingold, or the bill that is the underlying bill \nnow, as amended, and interest groups will bypass the parties and \nconduct their own campaigns. Why give to individual candidates or their \npolitical party when you can run your own independent advocacy \ncampaign, especially given the amounts of money these organizations \nhave at their disposal? We are not talking thousands here, folks. We \nare talking millions. Talk about a negative ad Scud missile attack in \n2002. I will tell you what. With this bill, there will be no party \nmissile shield for those candidates trying to weather the storm.\n  This entire business reminds me of the times I would take my three \nchildren to a well-known fast-food pizza and entertainment center; I \nthink it is called Chuck E. Cheese's. As I recall, for the price of one \nticket, my kids would run amok from one game to the next, the favorite \nbeing called Whackamole, where kids would smack mole-like creatures \nwhose heads popped out of dozens of mole holes. Smack one down, and \nanother two would suddenly jump up. Well, campaign reform is a lot like \nWhackamole.\n  Well, not to worry now; we will fix that. Let's just add on another \nlayer of reform. We will just limit ads that mention candidates within \n60 days of an election. Now, last week, that ban was limited to \ncorporations and unions and by groups they support if the ad was run on \ntelevision and radio--not any mention of newspapers, posters, or \nbillboards, just radio and television. Yesterday, in a fit of \nconsistent unconstitutionality, we added another layer, making the ban \napply to all groups. Thus, now the bill limits free expression.\n  Good grief, Mr. President. How in the world can we say we will \nimprove the integrity of any political system by letting politicians \nrestrict political speech? Can you imagine how everybody concerned will \ntry to game the speech police?\n  By the way, there is an exemption for journalists. I used to be a \njournalist. Have we stopped to figure out who and what is a journalist \nand how we will get around that loophole? That is another story \naltogether. Hello, ACLU. How many court cases, indeed?\n  What a deal. Pass this so-called reform and candidates will spend \nmore time asking for contributions, the very thing they want to avoid, \nforced by the current low limits to beg every day. Our political \nparties will lose their main source of funds or become hollow shells, \nand if the speech controls are upheld, why, our political discussion \nwill be both chilled and contorted. Of course, the real campaigns would \nbe run by the special interests with independent expenditures rather \nthan by the candidates and the parties.\n\n  My colleagues, we have a choice. We can continue to go down this road \nof one party basically trying to unilaterally disarm the other and \ndestroying our two-party system and the first amendment in the process \nor we can really support something that truly deals with the real \nproblems within our campaign finance laws, and that ``something'' is \nthe legislation offered by my friend and colleague, Senator Hagel.\n  His reform does three basic things:\n  First, he protects the first amendment to the Constitution and calls \nfor full and immediate disclosure and identity.\n  Second, he addresses the basic reason that our campaign funds are \ngoing around, under, and over the public disclosure table today, the \nantiquated limit on the amount of contributions that citizens may give \nto candidates unchanged over two decades.\n  Third, he proposes a limit on soft money that is of concern to me, \nbut at least it is semi-reasonable. I will accept the cap given the \nfull disclosure and the increase of the amount of money that our \nindividual citizens could and should be giving to candidates.\n  Finally, if we are truly serious about getting a reform bill passed, \nif we want a bill signed by the President as opposed to an issue, it \nmight be a good idea to see if the base bill amended by Senator Hagel \nwould fit that description.\n  President Bush listed six reform principles:\n  First, protect the rights of individuals to participate in democracy \nby updating the limits on individual giving to candidates and parties \nand protecting the rights of citizen groups to engage in issue \nadvocacy. Hagel passes; the underlying bill, as amended to date, does \nnot.\n  Second, the President said we should maintain strong political \nparties. Hagel passes that test; the underlying bill without Hagel does \nnot.\n  Third, the President said we should ban the corporate and union soft \nmoney. I don't buy that, but under Senator Hagel, he does limit soft \nmoney.\n  Fourth, the President said we should eliminate involuntary \ncontributions. Hagel doesn't deal with that issue. The underlying bill \nas amended or, to be more accurate, as not amended, does not meet this \ncriterion.\n  Fifth, require full and prompt disclosure. The Hagel bill meets this \ntest.\n  Sixth, to promote a fair, balanced, and constitutional approach. \nHere, the President supports including a nonseverability provision, so \nif any provision of the bill is found unconstitutional, the entire bill \nis sent back to Congress for further deliberation.\n  Well, we still have that issue before us. However, the bottom line is \nthat if you want a campaign reform measure that President Bush will \nsign, you should support the measure I have cosponsored with Senator \nHagel.\n  There is one other thing. Too many times, common sense is an uncommon \nvirtue in this body. Here we have a paradox of enormous irony. \nLegislation that is unconstitutional, that endangers free speech, that \nadvantages independent special interests and the wealthy and that will \ncripple the two-party system and individual participation has been \nlabeled and bookshelved by many of the hangers-on within the national \nmedia and the special interests that are favored in the legislation as \nbeing ``reform.'' I just heard on national television before driving to \nwork that reform was being endangered. What is endangering reform, on \nthe other hand, is these same folks branding the effort by my colleague \nas a poison pill.\n\n  Well, colleagues and those in the media, all that glitters is not \ngold. All that lurks under the banner of reform is not reform. There \nare a lot of cacti in this world; we just don't have to sit on every \none of them. McCain-Feingold, the current bill, is another ride into a \nbox canyon. On the other hand, legislation I have cosponsored with \nChuck Hagel is a clear, cold drink of common sense, a good thing to \nhave on any reform trail ride.\n  I salute you, sir, and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I am overwhelmed with my colleague from \nKansas. I note that the senior Senator from Arizona was taking note, \nmaking reference to all of his hangers-on friends.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield for a 10-second comment?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As usual, the Senator from Kansas illuminated, \nenlightened, and entertained all at once, and I enjoyed it very much.\n  Mr. HAGEL. If he passes the Senator's test, then we are making \nprogress and we are grateful.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is present. I understand he would like to \nmake some comments. I ask Senator Thomas, how much time does he need?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I think 10 minutes, if that is satisfactory.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I yield 10 minutes to the senior Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, following the \nremarks of the Senator from Wyoming,\n\n[[Page S2927]]\n\nthe Senator from New York be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hagel for the time and \nalso thank Senator Hagel for the work he has put in on this bill. I \nsupported this bill in the beginning, last year--I was an original \ncosponsor--because I think it deals with the issue that is before us, \nand deals with it in a way that is relatively simple, that we can \nunderstand, and does the things that, in the final analysis, we want to \nhave happen.\n  I have the notion that after spending all last week and another week \nthis week on this whole matter of campaign reform, it is not very clear \nas to what has been done, what is being suggested, where we will be \nwhen it is over, which is the most important thing. What is it that we \nwould like to have happen? I must confess, it has been very confused. \nThat is why I supported the Hagel bill; it makes it rather clear that \nit does the things we want to do. It ends up providing an opportunity \nfor more participation in the election process and for a constitutional \nlimit, if there are some limits, and the strong parties which, of \ncourse, is the way we govern ourselves.\n\n  First of all is the constitutional importance of free speech. That is \nthe most important thing we have to protect. This country was founded \non the principle that people could express themselves and express \nthemselves in the political process and be able to participate in it.\n  Kids ask often: How did you get to be in politics? I can tell you \nhow. I got involved in issues. I got involved in agriculture, in \ntalking about the process. It became very clear as I worked in the \nWyoming Legislature that politics is the way we govern ourselves. The \ndecisions by the people are made in the political process, are passed \nthrough the governmental process, and that is how it works. That is how \nI became involved. I think it is a way many people have become involved \nand, indeed, they need to be involved that way.\n  The first amendment is based primarily on a premise that if free \nsociety is to flourish, there has to be unfettered access and \nwillingness to participate. McCain-Feingold, I believe, has unintended \nconsequences. It limits political expression, certainly specifically 30 \ndays before the primary and 60 days before the general election. We had \nsome amendments about that yesterday. We need to be very careful about \nthat in terms of our ability to participate and our ability to exercise \nthat right of ours that is constitutional--free speech.\n  The Supreme Court upholds laws which prevent ``the appearance of \ncorruption,'' but surely that doesn't mean the Congress ought to ban \nthe freedom of speech. In fact, in the Buckley case:\n\n       Discussion of public issues and debate on the \n     qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of \n     the system of government established by our Constitution. The \n     First Amendment affords the broadest protection to such \n     political expression in order ``to assure the unfettered \n     interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and \n     social changes desired by the people.''\n\n  That is what it is all about.\n  State parties would be limited. My background and involvement as I \nmoved through this process was being active in the State party. I was \nsecretary of our State party. State parties are out there to encourage \npeople to participate, to organize in counties, to bring county \norganizations and chairmen and young people into the party to represent \nthe views they share. That is what parties are for. To limit the \nopportunity for those parties to do those things seems to me to be very \ndifficult.\n  Parties cannot, under this process, use already-regulated soft money \nfor party building. I think that is wrong. McCain-Feingold, in my view, \nfederalizes elections. We already allow for a mix of Federal and State \nfunds to be used for basic participation. Parties would be able to \nassist challengers. We should not make it terribly advantageous to be \nan incumbent. There ought to be challengers so we can make changes. \nState parties do that.\n  These are the issues that are very important and we need to preserve \nthem and we need to understand them. We need to be clear about. It is \nmy view that McCain-Feingold would decrease voter turnout, would \ndecrease the interest in participation in elections. That is the \nstrength of this country, for people to come together with different \nviews and express those views in elections so the people, indeed, are \nrepresented. It would devastate the parties if McCain-Feingold were \npassed as it is proposed. It would devastate grassroots activity.\n\n  Political involvement ought not be limited only to professionals or \npeople who have expert legal advice on the intricacies of Federal \nlegislation.\n  I just came from a meeting with some folks who were talking about how \ndifficult it is for trade associations to deal with people within their \ntrade associations unless they get some kind of approval from the \ncompany and it can only last for 3 years and they can only do it in one \ncompany. Those are the kinds of restrictions that should not exist.\n  Frankly, I get a little weary of the corruption idea all the time, as \nif everyone in this Chamber votes because of somebody providing money. \nIn my view and in my experience, you go out and campaign and tell \npeople what your philosophy is, you tell people where you are going to \nbe on issues, and they vote either up or down to support you. The idea \nthat every time there is a dollar out there you change your vote is \nridiculous. I am offended by that idea, frankly. I do not think it is \nthe way it really is. In any event, McCain-Feingold fails on a number \nof points. It presents constitutional roadblocks regarding speech and \nrestricts State parties from energizing voters.\n  The Hagel bill deals clearly with many things. It increases the \nopportunity for hard money, brings it up to date for inflation. No. 2, \nit provides a limit to soft money at a level that can be controllable. \nMost important, it provides for disclosure. It provides the opportunity \nfor voters to see who is participating in the financial aspect of it. \nThen they can make their decisions.\n  I think it is something that brings accountability to campaign \nfinance. It is something the President will reform. I am very pleased \nto be a supporter of the Hagel bill. I urge my friends in the Senate to \nsupport it as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nsenior Senator from New York is recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment offered by Senator Hagel to deal with soft money, not by \nbanning it, as the McCain-Feingold bill does, but by capping donations \nto national parties at $60,000 per year per individual. Worse still, \nnot only does this amendment set an awfully high cap for soft money, it \nwould not limit soft money when given to State parties, even when the \nobvious purpose is to influence Federal elections.\n  Let me say right off the bat that I commend Senator Hagel for his \neffort in this area. He is sincerely concerned about the mess that our \ncampaign finance system has become and has offered the solution he \nbelieves is the best one. His integrity and his sincerity in offering \nthis amendment are unquestioned by just everybody in this Chamber.\n  But in my judgment, and with all due respect to my friend from \nNebraska, his amendment falls far, far short of what is needed to clean \nup our campaigns. This proposal is to reform what Swiss is to cheese: \nIt just has too many holes. Enacting it would be worse than doing \nnothing, in my judgment, for the simple reason that it would carry the \nstamp of reform and lead the public to expect a better system while \nfailing to live up to the label.\n  Should Hagel become law--which I hope it does not--people will say a \nyear after: They tried it. They tried to do something and it failed. \nAnd you can't do anything.\n  Their cynicism, their disillusionment with the system, will actually \nincrease, despite the sincere effort of the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The main problem with the amendment is how it treats soft money. \nImagine that candidate Needbucks wants to run for the Senate. The \nelection is 2 years away. He goes to his old friends, John and Jane \nGotbucks, who have done quite well in the booming economy of the last 8 \nyears, and asks them to donate soft money to the party.\n\n[[Page S2928]]\n\n  Under the Hagel amendment, Mr. and Mrs. Gotbucks can give $240,000 in \nsoft money--$60,000 limit per person, $240,000 per couple per cycle. \nUnder McCain-Feingold, that would not be allowed.\n  But that is not everything. Throw in the $300,000 in hard money that \nJohn and Jane can give under this amendment, and you know what they \nsay: Pretty soon we are talking about real money. The total that a \ncouple can give is $540,000 in hard and soft money to a candidate under \nthe Hagel legislation.\n  Mr. President, $540,000 a couple limits? That is reform? Give me a \nbreak. In fact, that is the kind of money that can't help but catch the \ngimlet eyes of our friend, candidate Needbucks, and his party.\n  Let's suppose, in addition, that John and Jane Gotbucks happen to run \na corporation. The Hagel amendment would allow their corporation, and \nall others like it, to give legitimate, regulated money to the parties \nfor the first time since the horse was the dominant mode of \ntransportation and women couldn't even vote. We are allowing corporate \nmoney back into the system after nearly 100 years when it was not \nallowed.\n  Maybe it is instructive to remember how all this came about. In 1907 \nTeddy Roosevelt was burned by revelations that Wall Street corporations \nhad given millions to his 1904 campaign. Of course, one of his famous \nwealthy supporters, Henry Clay Frick, came to despise Roosevelt for his \nprogressivism and commented, ``We bought the S.O.B. but he didn't stay \nbought.''\n  But Teddy Roosevelt rose above the scandal and, as he so often did, \nblazed the trail of reform. He signed the Tillman Act, which outlawed \ncorporate contributions, into law.\n  And now, for the first time in a century, this amendment would take \nus back to the Gilded Age when corporate barons legally--legally--could \ngive money directly to political parties.\n  My friend from Nebraska may say his amendment isn't perfect but at \nleast it keeps most of this corporate and union soft money out of the \nsystem. But even that modest claim really isn't accurate. Public \nCitizen has analyzed the $60,000 cap in the Hagel bill and determined \nthat 58 percent of soft money given to the national parties in the 2000 \nelection cycle would be permitted under these caps.\n  Even if this were pass-fail, 42 percent is an F. And we have not even \nreached the worst part of this amendment yet. Bad as it is to allow \nsoft money in $120,000 increments rather than get rid of it, the \namendment would do absolutely nothing to limit soft money flowing to \nthe State parties.\n  In short, the Hagel amendment is like taking one step forward and two \nsteps back--a step forward in terms of some limits, two steps back in \nterms of corporate contributions and soft money to parties. One step \nforward, two steps back. My colleagues, we are not at a square dance; \nwe are dealing with serious reform.\n  The public is clamoring for us to do something. The Hagel bill is so \nwatered down, has so many loopholes in it, it is like Swiss cheese \nthat, again, you may as well vote for no reform at all, in my judgment.\n  If you tell our friends, our givers, Mr. Gotbucks and his company, \nthat they can only give the minuscule sum of $60,000 a year to the \nnational parties but they can give unlimited amounts to State parties \nfor use in Federal elections, what do you think their lawyers are going \nto tell them to do? And when State parties get that money, they will \nuse it to run issue ads, to get out the vote, and do other things that \nclearly benefit Federal candidates, just as they do now.\n\n  Let's not forget how this works.\n  Just last year, as then-Governor Bush was gearing up his run for the \nnomination, he set up a joint victory fund with 20 State Republican \nparties. This fund raised $5 million for then-candidate Bush that was \nmeant to be used in the general election. The fund took in soft money \ncontributions ranging from $50,000 to $150,000 from wealthy individuals \nand their families. This scheme, clearly intended to legally get around \nthe limits, would continue unabated and could actually increase under \nthe amendment that my friend from Nebraska has proposed.\n  In short, regulating soft money without dealing with the soft money \nthat goes to State parties is like the person who drinks a Diet Coke \nwith his double cheeseburger and fries: It does not quite get the job \ndone.\n  It isn't enough to say the States will regulate soft money on their \nown. Mr. President, 29 States allow unlimited PAC contributions to \nState parties, 27 States allow unlimited individual contributions to \nState parties, and 13 States allow unlimited corporate and union \ncontributions to State parties. So the notion that States will take \ncare of soft money at the State level just does not stand up. There is \nno evidence that they will.\n  So then, if this amendment is so filled with holes, if it is, indeed, \nthe original Swiss cheese amendment, why is it being proposed?\n  Well, the proponents, including my good friend from Nebraska, say \nthey are concerned that banning soft money will doom our parties and \ndrive all of the money now sloshing around our campaign system into the \nhands of independent and unaccountable advocacy groups who will run ads \nand engage in other political activity.\n  In the first place, there is a glaring inconsistency at the heart of \nthis argument. On the one hand, opponents of McCain-Feingold--such as \nthe Senator from Kentucky, who has led the fight against reform for \nmany years--say they cannot support the bill because it treads on free \nspeech. On the other hand, they say we do not dare enact the bill \nbecause then all of these outside groups will be using their first \namendment rights in speaking out instead of the parties. And now on the \nthird hand they say, well, we have always said regulating soft money is \nunconstitutional, but now we support capping soft money.\n  That is like being a little bit pregnant. You either exalt the first \namendment above everything else and say there should be no limits or \nyou don't and you support real reform like my friends from Arizona and \nWisconsin have propounded.\n  As the New York Times put it this morning, my colleague from Kentucky \n``has flipped. He cannot now clothe himself in the Constitution in \nopposing real reform'' as long as he votes for the Hagel amendment.\n  For my part, I agree with Justice Stevens, who said Buckley v. Valeo \ngot it wrong. ``Money is property--it is not speech,'' he wrote in a \ndecision last year.\n\n       The right to use one's own money to hire gladiators, or to \n     fund speech by proxy, certainly merits significant \n     constitutional protection. These property rights, however, \n     are not entitled to the same protection as the right to say \n     what one pleases.\n\n  The more important response to this amendment, however, is not to \npoint out the proponents' contradictions on the first amendment but to \nchide them for greatly exaggerating the demise of our political \nparties.\n  Soft money isn't the cure for what ails the parties; it is the \ndisease. All of us in this business know the parties have become little \nmore than conduits for big money donations by a privileged few. The \nparties do not have any say. They are simply mechanisms which people \nwho want to give a lot of money go through to make it happen. If we \nkeep going down this road, we risk that parties will become empty \nshells. They are so busy channeling money in large amounts that they do \nnot do the get out the vote and the party building and the educating \nthat parties should do and did do until this soft money disease \nafflicted and corroded them, as it does our entire body politic.\n  The reality is, banning soft money will be good for our political \nparties, not bad. Banning soft money will strengthen our parties by \nbreaking their reliance on a handful of super-rich contributors and \nforcing them to build a wider base of small donors and grassroots \nsupporters.\n  Let me quote the former chairman of the Republican Party, William \nBrock:\n\n       In truth, the parties were stronger and closer to their \n     roots before the advent of this loophole than they are today. \n     Far from reinvigorating the parties themselves, soft money \n     has simply strengthened certain specific candidates and the \n     few donors who make huge contributions, while distracting the \n     parties from traditional grassroots work.\n\n  The fact is, the parties in this country got along just fine without \nsoft money in the 1980s, before this form of funding exploded, to say \nnothing of their 200-year history before that.\n\n[[Page S2929]]\n\n  Is my friend from Nebraska saying the great two-party tradition in \nthis country, which is one of the main causes of our political \nstability and the envy of the rest of the world, rests on the thin read \nof soft money contributions? I hope not. Let me tell the Senate, if \nthat is true, then we are way too late in terms of strengthening the \nparties.\n  Ultimately, the basic premise of Senator Hagel's argument, which is \nthat the donors who now give soft money to the parties will simply \nshift it to existing independent groups, is also way off base. \nCorporations and unions won't be able to just run their own ads \nfavoring a candidate in lieu of giving soft money or get 501(c)(4) \ngroups to run the ads for them because the bill prohibits campaign ads \nby corporations and labor within 60 days of an election. As Charles \nKolb, president of the Committee for Economic Development, a business \ngroup supporting reform, has said:\n\n       We expect that most of the soft money from the business \n     community will simply dry up.\n\n  Corporations that find it easy to give to a party are not going to \nset up their whole elaborate mechanism to try to get around reform. A \nfew will; most won't.\n  It is true that individuals will be able to make independent \nexpenditures supporting campaigns, but how many of them will really do \nthat? Writing a fat check to the party is vastly easier than trying to \nrun an ad or organize voters. As Al Hunt wrote in the Wall Street \nJournal last week:\n\n       The notion that Carl Lindner or Denise Rich is going to be \n     heavily into issue advocacy is comical.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to yield me an \nadditional 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 3 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. We all know that people such as Johnny Chung aren't \ngiving for ideological reasons. They are giving because to them our \nGovernment works ``like a subway--you have to put in coins to open up \nthe gate.''\n  But, of course, at the end of the day there is nothing we can do to \nstop independent political spending by individuals. That is clearly \nprotected by the first amendment. The important point is that after \nthis bill passes, any individuals or outside groups who want to support \nFederal candidates won't be able to coordinate their expenditures with \ncandidates. They will have to go at it alone, if they really want to, \nwithout the key information they need about strategy and timing that \nmake an ad campaign effective. So let them do it. The wall against \ncoordination will go a long way to keeping out special interest \ninfluence and is a vast improvement over the current system giving \ndirectly to the parties.\n\n  Mr. President, I quote the words of someone who has invested a lot in \nthis debate, someone who cares about reform, someone I greatly respect. \nLast year that person said:\n\n       The American people see a political system controlled by \n     special interests and those able to pump millions of dollars, \n     much of it essentially unaccountable and defended by \n     technicality and nuance. As our citizens become demoralized \n     and detached because they feel they are powerless, they lower \n     their expectations and standards for Government and our \n     officeholders.\n\n  I completely agree with that speaker whose name was Chuck Hagel. If \nwe agree that pumping millions of unaccountable dollars into the system \nthreatens public confidence, which is the lifeblood of any democracy, \nwe have to do something serious about it. We cannot say we are \nreforming when a couple can give $540,000 through soft and hard money \nto a candidate. That is not reform. That will not, I am afraid, bolster \npeople's confidence in the system.\n  I am afraid the Hagel amendment is more words than action. While the \nsystem continues its long agonizing slide into greater and greater \ndependence on the most fortunate few, if we simply pass Hagel, we will \ndo nothing to stop that slide. I urge defeat of the Hagel amendment and \nsupport of the original McCain-Feingold effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield my remaining time to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York. We \nhave had some rivalries when it comes to the dairy industry. I \nappreciate the use of the Swiss cheese analog. As a Cheesehead from \nWisconsin, that is the most persuasive thing he could possibly use.\n  Senator Schumer has brought forth the absolutely basic point. First \nof all, under the Hagel amendment, corporate and union treasuries will \nbe writing direct checks to the Federal parties, something we have \nnever allowed.\n  Secondly, every dime of soft money that is currently allowed can just \ncome through the State parties back to the Federal parties. No reform.\n  Third, when it comes to the limits that are raised, both soft and \nhard money under the Hagel amendment, any couple in America can give \n$540,000 every 2 years.\n  Finally, under the Hagel amendment, there is no prohibition on \nofficeholders and candidates from raising this kind of money.\n  Those are four strikes against the bill, and you only need three.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to my friend and \ncolleague, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Nelson.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from \nNebraska for the opportunity today to extend my full support for \ncampaign finance reform. Again, I convey my sincere appreciation for \nthe work of Senators McCain and Feingold and Senator Hagel, as well as \nall of my colleagues who are involved in this effort to reform the \ncampaign finance system.\n  As a veteran of four Statewide campaigns myself, and as a newly \nelected Senator fresh from the campaign trail, I believe, as many of my \ncolleagues do, that the current campaign finance laws are, in a word, \n``defective.''\n  Our country was founded on principles such as freedom and justice. As \nI see it, the present system for financing Federal campaigns undermines \nthose very principles.\n  I believe that in its present form the campaign finance system tends \nto benefit politicians who are already in office. Some folks call it \nincumbent insurance. I prefer to call it a problem. Thus, I \nwholeheartedly believe the time has come for meaningful campaign \nfinance reform.\n  There is an old adage we all know that goes: Don't fix it unless it \nis broken. Well, many aspects of our campaign finance system today are \nbroken, and they do need fixing.\n  Before us today we have several legislative remedies for this flawed \nsystem. Not one, though, as far as I am concerned, is a panacea for the \nmaladies afflicting our current campaign finance laws, nor can they be. \nBoth the McCain-Feingold bill and the Hagel bill include provisions \nwhich I support. I am a cosponsor of Senator Hagel's legislation \nbecause I am particularly sympathetic to the bill's provision to limit \nsoft money contributions rather than prohibit them.\n  In an effort to pinpoint the culprit for the faults in the present \ncampaign finance system, I believe soft money has become the scapegoat. \nAs my friend from Louisiana pointed out last night, there is a popular \nmisconception that the McCain-Feingold bill bans all soft money. This \nis not accurate. McCain-Feingold bans only soft money to the political \nparties.\n  While I agree that unlimited soft money contributions raise important \nquestions, I also believe that banning soft money to the parties would \nonly be unproductive and ultimately ineffective. Chances are, if we \nsucceed in blocking the flow of soft money from one direction, it will \neventually be funneled to the candidates from another. Furthermore, \nsome soft money contributions are used for valuable get-out-the-vote \nefforts and for the promotion of voter registration and party building, \nall very valuable efforts that promote our system.\n  A more realistic approach in lieu of banning soft money would be to \ncap the contributions at $60,000, as prescribed by the Hagel bill. \nThus, I favor the provision to limit soft money in Senator Hagel's \nbill. Also, I strongly support the provisions on disclosure outlined in \nMcCain-Feingold, that are also included in the Hagel amendment.\n\n[[Page S2930]]\n\nA lack of accountability within the current system is at the core of \nthe problem. As a matter of fact, if we could enact substantive changes \nto disclosure laws and remove the facades which special interest groups \nhide behind, we, at the very least, will be heading in the right \ndirection. This action to increase disclosure, combined with \nlimitations on soft money contributions, will not only refine our \ncurrent system, but will reform it.\n  As an individual who spent the majority of the past year on the \ncampaign trail, I have put a great deal of thought into what I believe \nis the right direction for campaign finance reform. My Senate race has \nmade me all too familiar with the shortcomings of the current system. \nMy campaign experience with one group in particular has bolstered my \nsupport for efforts to limit so-called issue ads. This organization \nfunded by undisclosed contributors ran soft-money issue ads throughout \nmy campaign criticizing my stance on one issue, which was unrelated and \nirrelevant to their purported cause.\n  Unfortunately this is not the only example of issue-ad tactics I \nencountered during my most recent campaign. So it only follows that I \nam pleased with the Snowe-Jeffords provision, which addresses these so-\ncalled issue ads funded by labor and corporations. This provision will \nhold labor and corporations more accountable for these ads by imposing \nstrict broadcasting regulations and increasing disclosure requirements.\n  I was very encouraged last night by the passage of Senator \nWellstone's amendment, which expands the Snowe-Jeffords provision to \nalso cover the ads run by special interest groups, whose sole purpose \nis to mislead voters. This leads me to my final point and the reason \nwhy I have come to the floor this morning. I want to express my strong \nsupport for this Hagel amendment we are currently debating. The passage \nof this amendment is crucial for the improvement of our campaign \nfinance system. I commend Senator Hagel for introducing a measure that \nrealistically addresses soft money contributions. Additionally, the \nHagel amendment does not supersede the critical aspects of McCain-\nFeingold--most notably the Snowe-Jeffords, and now Wellstone, issue-ad \nprovisions, which are imperative if our goal is true reform. The Senate \nhas the opportunity to repair our flawed campaign finance system. And \nif we don't seize the moment and take action now, it will always be a \nflaw in our democracy.\n  Again, I commend my colleagues on their efforts, and I am hopeful \nthat we will succeed in approving this amendment and ultimately in \napproving a meaningful campaign finance reform package this session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 54 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 15 minutes to my colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member of the Rules \nCommittee. I join my colleagues in opposing the Hagel amendment, and I \ndo so reluctantly on a personal level, but not on a substantive level. \nI have enjoyed working with the Senator from Nebraska on many issues. I \nrespect and like him.\n  I regret to say that the amendment he brings to the floor today is \nsimply not reform. I should say that again and again and again. It is \nnot reform. It is not reform.\n  You don't have reform when you are institutionalizing for the first \ntime in history the capacity of soft money to play a significant role \nin the political process, when the McCain-Feingold goal and objective, \nwhich I support, is to eliminate altogether the capacity of soft money \nto play the role that it does in our politics. So it goes in the exact \nopposite direction.\n  I will come back to that in a moment because I want to discuss for a \nmoment where we find ourselves in this debate and really underscore the \nstakes in this debate at this time.\n  Last night, I voted with Senator Wellstone, together with other \ncolleagues who believe very deeply in a bright-line test and in the \ncapacity to have a constitutional method by which we even the playing \nfield. I regret that some people who oppose the bill also chose to vote \nwith Senator Wellstone because they saw it, conceivably, as a means of \nconfusing reform and creating mischief in the overall resolution of \nthis issue which Senator Feingold and Senator McCain have brought \nbefore the Senate.\n  Let me make it clear to my colleagues, to the press, to the public, \nand to people who care about campaign finance reform, the next few \nvotes that we have on this bill are not just votes on amendments, in my \njudgment; they are votes on campaign finance reform. They are votes on \nMcCain-Feingold itself. There will be a vote on the so-called \nseverability issue which, for those who don't follow these debates that \nclosely, means that if one issue is found to be unconstitutional, we \ndon't want the whole bill to fall. So we say that a particular \ncomponent of the bill will be severable from the other components of \nthe bill, so that the bill will still stand, so that the reforms we put \nin on soft money, or the reforms we put in on reporting, or the reforms \nwe put in on the amounts of money that can be contributed, would still \nstand even if some other effort to have reform may fall because it \ndoesn't pass constitutional muster.\n  Now, opponents of this bill, specifically for the purpose of \ndefeating McCain-Feingold, specifically for the purpose of creating \nmischief, will come to the floor and say: We don't want any \nseverability. The whole bill should fall if one component of it is \nfound unconstitutional, which defeats the very purpose of trying to put \nto a test a new concept of what might or might not pass constitutional \nmuster. It is not unusual in the Senate for legislators, many of whom \nare lawyers, to make a judgment in which they believe they have created \na test that might, in fact, be different from something that previously \nfailed constitutional tests.\n  And so, as in this bill, we are trying to find a way to create a \nplaying field that is fair, Mr. President. Fair. Many people in the \nSenate legitimately believe that it is not fair to have a limitation on \ncorporations and unions, but then push all the money into a whole \nseries of unregulated entities that will become completely campaign \noriented and, in effect, take campaigning out of the hands of the \ncandidates themselves. They won't be regulated at all, while everybody \nelse is regulated.\n  That is what Senator Wellstone and I and others were trying to \nachieve last night--a fairness in the playing field. I understand why \nSenator Feingold and Senator McCain object to that. I completely \nunderstand it. They want fairness. They understand that that is \nimportant to the playing field, but they have tried to cobble together \na fragile coalition here that can hold together and pass campaign \nfinance reform.\n  Some people suggest they would not be part of that fragile coalition \nif indeed they were to embrace this other notion of a fair playing \nfield. However, the Senate is the Senate. It is a place to deliberate, \na place for people to come forward and put their ideas, legislatively, \nbefore the judgment of our colleagues.\n  Last night, the Senate worked its will, albeit, as in any legislative \nsituation, with some mischief by some people who seek to defeat this. \nBut we are in a no worse position today than we were before that \namendment passed last night, because if we defeat the notion that this \nshould be non-severable, we can still go out of the U.S. Senate with \nlegislation and we still can put this properly to test before the \nSupreme Court, which is, after all, the business of our country.\n  That is the way it works. Congress passes something, and the Supreme \nCourt decides whether or not it is, in fact, going to meet \nconstitutional muster.\n  That said, I believe it is vital for us to proceed forward on these \nnext votes with an understanding of what is at stake. The Hagel \namendment would gut McCain-Feingold. Effectively, the vote we will have \nthis morning will be a test of whether or not people support the notion \nof real campaign finance reform and of moving forward.\n  Let me say a few words about why the amendment Senator Hagel has \noffered really breaches faith with the concept of reform itself.\n  The Hagel amendment imposes a so-called cap on soft money \ncontributions of $60,000. That would be the first time\n\n[[Page S2931]]\n\nin history the Congress put its stamp of approval on corporate and \nunion treasury funds being used in connection with Federal elections. \nThe Hagel amendment would legitimize soft money, literally reversing an \nalmost century-long effort to have a ban on corporate contributions and \nthe nearly 60-year ban on labor contributions. That is what is at stake \nin this vote on the Hagel amendment.\n  The Hagel amendment would institutionalize a loophole that was not \ncreated by Congress, but a loophole that was created by the Federal \nElection Commission.\n  Worse--if there is a worse--than just putting Congress' seal of \napproval on soft money is the impact the amendment would have on the \nrole of money in elections. What we are seeking to do in the Senate \ntoday is reduce the impact of money on our elections.\n  I will later today be proposing an amendment that I know is not going \nto be adopted, but it is an amendment on which the Senate ought to \nvote, which is the best way to really separate politicians from the \nmoney. I will talk about how we will do that later. It is a partial \npublic funding method, not unlike what we do for the President of the \nUnited States.\n\n  George Bush, who ran for President, did not adhere to it in the \nprimaries, but in the general election he took public money. He sits in \nthe White House today partly because public funding supported him. \nRonald Reagan took public money. President Bush's father, George Bush, \ntook public money. They were sufficiently supportive of that system to \nbe President of the United States, and we believe it is the cleanest \nway ultimately to separate politicians from the money.\n  That is also what we are trying to do in the McCain-Feingold bill. It \ndoes not go as far as some would like to go, but it may be the furthest \nwe can go, given the mix in the Senate today. It seeks to reduce the \nrole of influence of money in the American political process.\n  The Hagel amendment would actually undo that and reverse it. It would \nenable a couple to contribute $120,000 per year, $240,000 per election \ncycle, to the political parties. In the end, the Hagel amendment would \nallow a couple to give more than $500,000--half a million dollars--per \nelection cycle to the political parties in soft money and hard money \ncombined.\n  We have heard the statistics. Less than one-half of 1 percent of the \nAmerican population give even at the $1,000 level. Let me repeat that. \nLess than one-half of 1 percent of all Americans give even at the \n$1,000 level, and here is the Hagel amendment which seeks to have the \nSenate put its stamp of approval on the rich, and only the rich, being \nable to influence American politics by putting $500,000 per couple into \nthe political system. That increases the clout of people with money, \nand it reduces the influence and capacity of the average American to \nhave an equal weight in our political process.\n  Looked at another way, the amendment would allow five senior \nexecutives from a company to give $60,000 per year for a total of \n$300,000 of soft money annually. That could be combined with an \nadditional $60,000 straight from the corporate treasury. That is hardly \nthe way to get money out of politics.\n  Even with its attempted cap of soft money, the Hagel amendment leaves \nopen a gaping loophole through which unmonitored soft money can still \nflow. It does nothing to stop the State parties from raising and \nspending unlimited soft money contributions on behalf of Federal \ncandidates.\n  It is absolute fantasy to believe the State parties are not, as a \nresult of that, going to become a pure conduit for the money that flows \nin six-figure contributions from the corporations or the labor unions \nor the wealthiest individuals.\n  It simply moves in the wrong direction. It codifies forever something \nwe have restricted and prevented. It is the opposite of reform. It \nundoes McCain-Feingold, and I urge my colleagues to keep this reform \ntrain on its tracks. We need to complete the task, and we must turn \naway these efforts to overburden this bill or to directly assault its \nfundamental provisions.\n  I yield back whatever time remains to the manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield to my friend and colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee, 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Hagel amendment \nand would like to take a few minutes to paint the larger picture of \nwhere we are in campaign finance and show the critical importance, I \nbelieve, of adopting this amendment today, especially in light of what \nI hope to have a chance to do later this week, which is to talk a \nlittle bit more about the effects of the McCain-Feingold legislation.\n  I stress now the absolutely critical importance of adopting the Hagel \namendment really for three reasons. I will come back to these charts \nbecause they give an overall perspective that I found very useful in \ntalking to my colleagues and in talking to others to understand the \ncomplexities of campaign finance and the critical importance of \nmaintaining a balance between Federal or hard money and soft or non-\nFederal money.\n  The Hagel amendment really does three things: No. 1, it gives the \ncandidate more voice; yes, more amplification of that voice. I think \nthat is what bothers most people. If we look at the trend over the last \n20 years, that individual candidate, Joe Smith, over the years has had \na voice which stayed small and has been overwhelmed by the special \ninterests, the outside money coming in, the unions, to where his voice \nhas gotten no louder.\n  There is nothing more frustrating than to be an individual candidate \nand feel strongly about education, health care, the military, and say \nit on the campaign trail, but have somebody else giving a wholly \ndifferent picture because you have lost that voice over time. The Hagel \namendment is the only amendment to date that addresses that loss of \nvoice over time.\n  No. 2, disclosure. Most people in this body and most Americans, I \nbelieve, understand the critical importance of increased disclosure \ntoday. What makes people mad is the fact that money is coming into a \nsystem and nobody knows from where it is coming. In fact, we saw in \npast elections the amount of money that came from overseas. It comes \nthrough the system and flows out, and nobody knows where it is going or \nwho is buying the ads on television. How do you hold people \naccountable?\n  Those are what really make people mad: No. 1, the candidate has no \nvoice; No. 2, the lack of accountability of dollars coming into the \nsystem and out of the system.\n  Does that mean we have to do away with the system? I do not think so. \nWe have to be very careful how we modernize it and reform it, but let \nus look at the candidate's voice and let us look at disclosure.\n  The fundamental problem we talked about all last week, money in \npolitics--is it corrupt, is it bad, is it evil? I say no, that is not \nthe problem. I come back to what the problem is--the candidate, the \nchallenger, the incumbent does not have the voice they had \nhistorically.\n  Let me show three charts. They will be basically the same format. It \nis pretty simple. There are seven funnels that money, resources, can be \nchanneled through in campaign financing. I label the chart ``Who Spends \nthe Money?'' I will have these seven funnels on the next three charts.\n  First, I have Joe Smith, the individual candidate who is out there \ncampaigning. I said his, or her, voice over time has been diminished. \nWhy? Because you have all of these other funnels--the issue groups: We \ntalked about the Sierra Club, the NRA, the hundreds of issue groups \nthat are out there right now spending and overwhelming the voice of the \nindividual candidate.\n  Why does the individual candidate not have much of a voice today, \nrelatively speaking? We see huge growth in these three funnels--\ncorporations, unions and issue groups--but we have contained for 26 \nyears, since the mid-1970s, how much this individual candidate can \nreceive from an individual or from a PAC. We have contained the voice \nbut have seen explosive growth in certain spending.\n\n  What makes the American people mad is indicated across the top. \nIndividual candidates is one way for money\n\n[[Page S2932]]\n\nto come to the system; political action committees is a very effective \nway. The parties in the box, the Republican Party, the Democratic \nParty, and other parties can raise money two ways: Federal dollars and \nnon-Federal dollars. Notice all of this money in the yellow and green \nis ``disclosed.'' The American people want to know where the money \ncomes from and where it goes. This is all disclosed. There is control \nover that.\n  However, the explosive growth has occurred in corporations, unions, \nand issue groups. The problem--and the American people are aware of \nthis, and we have to fix it--there is no disclosure. Nobody knows from \nor to where money is coming and going. I should add there is money \ncoming into the system from overseas and China. We have to address \ndisclosure.\n  The contribution limits right now apply just to the individual \ncandidates. An individual can only give so much to an individual \ncandidate. A PAC can only receive so much and give so much.\n  With the party hard money, the Federal money, again, there are \ncontribution limits. Some people argue, as Senator Hagel argues: Let's \nfix this and address the disclosure issue. The Hagel amendment does \nthat. Let's address contributions limits; instead of stopping here with \nindividual candidates, PACs and party hard money, extend it so that all \nof the party, the hard and the soft money, has contribution limits.\n  I said I will use the seven funnels from the chart. Money flows into \nthe system at the top and goes out of the system below, the problem \nbeing the individual candidates do not have much of a voice.\n  The next chart looks complicated, but it is useful for understanding \nfrom where the money comes. I show how money flows into the funnel. On \nthe left side of the chart, the funnels are the same. There are seven \nways money gets to the political system. The problem is the individual \ncandidate's voice has not been amplified in 25 years. We have to fix \nthat, and we can, through the Hagel amendment.\n  Individuals can give to individual candidates. PACs can give to \nindividual candidates, such as Joe Smith out there. Party hard money, \nthe Republican Party, the Democratic Party, independent, they can give \nto individual candidates, and that is the only way an individual \ncandidate can receive money to amplify his or her voice.\n  PACs can receive money from individuals, but they can also receive \nmoney, or be set up by corporations through sponsorships, by unions \nthrough sponsorships, and issue groups can establish PACs.\n  I happen to be chairman of the National Republican Senatorial \nCommittee, and I can receive money as part of the senatorial committee \nfrom PACs, from individuals, party non-Federal money from individuals, \nbut also corporations, unions, and issue groups can give party soft \nmoney.\n  Corporations receive money from earnings, and unions receive money \nfrom union dues. We tried to address this. I think it needs to be \naddressed.\n  Now straight to the Hagel amendment. There is not enough of a voice \nhere. Contribution limits probably are too narrowly applied, and we \nneed to move them over.\n  No. 3, we don't have enough in terms of disclosure. This is what the \nHagel-Breaux amendment does and why it is absolutely critical to \nmaintain balance in the system.\n  Next, disclosure and no disclosure. In this area, the Hagel amendment \nincreases disclosure by requiring both television and radio media buys \nfor political advertising to be disclosed. You would be able to know \nwho, on channel 5 in Middleton, TN, purchased ads and for whom they \npurchased those ads. Again, much improved disclosure on this side.\n  Contribution limits: Party soft money had no contribution limits. \nUnder the Hagel amendment, there is a cap, a limit on how much an \nentity contributes to the Republican Party or to the Democratic Party \nor to the Republican Senatorial Committee or to the Democratic \nSenatorial Committee. The contribution limits have been extended.\n  Third, and absolutely critical if we agree that the individual \ncandidate's voice has been lost by this input on the right side of my \ndiagram, we absolutely must increase the hard dollar limits, how much \nindividuals can give individual candidates and how much PACs can give \nindividual candidates. It has not increased in 26 or 27 years, since \n1974. It has not been adjusted for inflation. If it is adjusted for \ninflation, you come to the numbers that Senator Hagel put forward, the \n$3,000.\n  It increases the voice of the individual candidate. If you increase \nthe voice of the individual candidate, you return to that balance where \nthe candidate Joe Smith out there all of a sudden has more of a voice, \nagain, with contribution limits.\n  An additional advantage is a challenger out there or an incumbent \nwill have to spend less time. Now it requires so much money to amplify \nthat voice of the candidate out there trying to get $1,000 gifts from \nhundreds and hundreds of people at 1974 levels; only worth about $300 \ntoday in terms of value, it lets you spend less time on the campaign \ntrail doing that.\n  In summary, I urge support of the Hagel amendment because it \naddresses the fundamental problems we have in our campaign system \ntoday. Not that money in and of itself is corrupt or even corrupting, \nbut the fact is that the individual candidate does not have sufficient \nvoice. The Hagel amendment raises those limits from both individuals \nand PACs. It addresses the issue of soft money coming into the party \nsystem by capping soft money given by both individuals as well as other \nentities coming into the system at a level of $60,000. It improves \ndisclosure by requiring television and radio media buys for political \nadvertising to be fully and immediately disclosed.\n  I urge support of this amendment. I know it will be very close. I \nhope this placement of balance, this understanding of balance, will in \nturn attract people to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. If the Chair will notify me when 10 minutes expires.\n  I say to my colleague from Tennessee, his chart looks like a chart \nmade up by a heart surgeon. It looks like a pulmonary tract following \nvarious arteries and capillaries.\n  Let me repeat what I said last evening to my friend from Nebraska. I \nhave great respect for him, as I do the junior Senator from Nebraska, \nthe Presiding Officer. I disagree with them on this amendment.\n  There is a fundamental disagreement here. Aside from the mechanics of \nthe amendment and how much hard money is raised and how much soft money \nyou cap and who gets disclosed or not disclosed, it seems to me to be \nan underlying, fundamental difference in not only this amendment but \nothers that have been considered and will be considered. That \nunderlying difference is whether or not you believe there is too much \nmoney already in politics or not.\n\n  If you subscribe to the notion that politics is suffering from a lack \nof money, then the Hagel amendment or various other proposals that will \nbe offered are your cup of tea. I think that is the way you ought to \ngo. If you truly think there is just not enough money today backing \ncandidates seeking public office, truly you ought to vote for this \namendment or amendments like it. If you believe, as I do as many \nMembers on this side that there is too much money in the process--that \nthe system has become awash in money, with candidates spending \ncountless hours on a daily basis over a 6-year term in the Senate, over \na 2-year term in the House, literally forced to raise thousands of \ndollars every day in your cycle to compete effectively in today's \npolitical environment then you believe as I do that we must move to put \nsome breaks on this whole money chase.\n  It has been pointed out in my State, the small State of Connecticut, \nyou have to raise something like $10,000 almost daily in order to raise \nthe money to wage an effective defense of your seat or to seek it as a \nchallenger. In California, in New York, the numbers become \nexponentially higher. I happen to subscribe to the notion that we ought \nto be doing what we can to slow this down, to try to reduce the cost of \nthese campaigns and to slow down the money chase that is going on. But \nall these amendment are just opening up more spigots, allowing more \nmoney to flow into a process that is already nauseatingly awash in too \nmuch money. I\n\n[[Page S2933]]\n\nbelieve that, and I think many of my colleagues do as well. I know most \nof the American public does.\n\n  If you want to know why we are not getting more participation in the \npolitical process, I think it is because people have become disgusted \nwith it. Today it is no longer a question of the people's credibility \nor people's ability, but whether or not you have the wealth or whether \nyou have access to it.\n  My concerns over the Hagel amendment are multiple. First of all, as \nhas been pointed out by Senators Feingold, Schumer, and Kerry, and \nothers who have spoken out on this amendment, this is codifying soft \nmoney by placing caps on it. Caps which we all know are rather \ntemporary in nature. Caps that are only to be lifted. So even if you \nsubscribe to the notion that you are going to somehow limit this, the \npractical reality is we are basically saying we ought to codify this. \nThat as a matter of statute, soft money ought to be allowed to come \ninto the process, most of it unlimited, unregulated, and unaccountable. \nI think that would be a great mistake.\n  We are allowing a $60,000 per calendar year cap on soft money \ncontributions from individuals to the national parties. It would be the \nfirst time in literally almost 100 years, since 1907, when Teddy \nRoosevelt, a great Republican reformer, thought there was just too much \nmoney coming out of corporations into politics. So Congress banned it. \nIt was one of the great reforms of the 20th century in politics.\n  For the first time since 1943, with the passage of the Smith-Connally \nAct, and again in 1947 with the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, \nCongress would be allowing the use of union treasury money in Federal \nelections. For almost 60 years we banned such funds from unions, almost \n100 years from corporations. Now we are about to just undo all that. We \nare suggesting that we allow it up to $60,000 per year. We will cap \nthat right now in the Hagel bill, but there are also proposals here \nthat would allow for indexing the hard money limits for future \ninflation.\n  It is stunning to me we would include the indexed for inflation \nfactor in politics. We index normally in relationship to the consumer \nprice index, for people on Social Security or for people who are \nsuffering, who are trying to buy food, medicine, clothes or pay rent, \nso we index it to allow them to be able to meet the rising cost of \nliving. We are now going to index campaign contributions so the tiny \nminority of wealthy Americans can give more than $1,000--in this case, \n$3,000 per election or $6,000 per election cycle. Such indexing will \nenable the wealthy to have a little more undue access and influence in \nthe political process.\n  That is turning the consumer price index on its head. The purpose of \nit was to help people who are of modest incomes to have an increase in \ntheir benefits to meet their daily needs. We are now going to apply it \nto the most affluent Americans. Those contributors who want more access \nand more control in the political process will get the benefit of the \nconsumer price index. That, to me, is just wrong-headed and turning \nlegitimate justification for such indexing on its head.\n  The hard money provisions are also deeply disturbing to me. Here we \nare going to say that no longer is a $1,000 per election limit the \nceiling. We are going to raise that per election limit. Under the Hagel \namendment, the individual hard dollar limit for contributions to \ncandidates has been increased to $3,000 per election. This means an \nindividual may contribute $6,000 per election cycle. A couple could \ncontribute double, or $12,000 per election cycle.\n  Let me explain this to people who do not follow the minutiae of \npolitics. All my colleagues and their principal political advisers know \nthis routinely. There we say $3,000 per individual per election. What \nwe really mean is that an individual may contribute $6,000 per election \ncycle, because it is $3,000 for the primary and another $3,000 for the \ngeneral election. Normally when we go out and solicit campaign \ncontributions we do not limit it to the individual. We also want to \nknow whether or not their spouse or their minor or adult children would \nlike to make some campaign contributions. As long as such contributions \nare voluntary, then those individuals may contribute their own limit, \nall the way up to the maximum of $6,000 per year.\n  So here we are going from $1,000 or $2,000--because the ceiling is \nreally not $1,000, it is a $2,000 contribution that an individual may \nmake to both a primary or general election--and we are now going to \npump this up to $6,000 per year. Basically, that is what it works out \nto be. It could also be $12,000 per year for a couple. How many people \nget to make these amounts of contributions?\n  I find this stunning that we are talking about raising the limit \nbecause we are just impoverished in the process. It is sad how it has \ncome to this, that we are hurting financially. A tiny fraction of the \nAmerican public--it has been pointed out less than one-quarter of 1 \npercent--can make a contribution of $1,000 per election. Last year, \n1999-2000, there were some 230,000 people out of a nation of 80 million \nwho wrote a check for $1,000 as a contribution for a campaign; a \nquarter of a million out of 280 million people actually made \ncontributions for $1,000.\n  There were about 1,200 people across the country who gave $25,000 \nannual limit. That is the present cap, by the way under current law.\n  Let me go to the second case. Under present law, you can give a total \nof $25,000 per year. Again, I apologize to people listening to this. \nThere are actually people out there who write checks for $25,000 to \nsupport Federal candidates for office. Understand, we think this is \njust too low. This is just too low. We are struggling out here; I want \nyou to know that. We are impoverished. We need more help. So $25,000 \nfrom that individual, 1,200 of them in the country--1,200 people out of \n280 million wrote checks for $25,000. But, you know, we do not think \nthat is enough. This bill now raises it to $75,000. How many Americans \ncan write checks for $75,000 per year?\n  There is a disconnect between what we are debating and discussing and \nwhat the American public thinks about this. The chasm is huge. We are \ntalking about people writing checks that are vastly in excess of what \nan average family makes as income a year to raise a family. And our \nsuggestion is there is too little money in politics. We spend more \nmoney on potato chips, I am told.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I am told by one of my colleagues we spend more money on \npotato chips than we do on politics.\n  Maybe that is a good analogy, because I think too many Americans \nthink this has become potato chips, in a sense. It has almost been \ndevalued to that as a result of this disgusting process. I regret using \nthe word ``disgusting,'' but that is what it has become, when we are \nliterally sitting around here and debating whether or not--with some \ndegree of a notion that this is a reasonable debate--to go from $25,000 \na year to $75,000 a year.\n  If you take this amendment in its totality, that same individual with \nsoft money contributions and hard money contributions could literally \nwrite a check for $540,000 to support the candidate of their choice in \nany given year. That is, in my view, just the best evidence I could \npossibly offer that this institution is out of touch with the American \npublic, when it tries to make a case that there is too little money in \npolitics today.\n  Put the brakes on. Stop this. Reject this amendment. We can live with \nthese caps that we presently have. There is absolutely no \njustification, in my view, for raising the limits. What we need to do \nis slow down the cost and look for better means by which we choose our \ncandidates and support them for public office.\n  This is about as important a debate as we will have. I know the \nbudget is coming up. I know health care and education are important, \nbut this is how we elect people. This is about the basic institutions \nthat represent the people of this Nation. We are getting further and \nfurther and further away from average people, and they are getting \nfurther and further away from us.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and support the McCain-\nFeingold proposal. It is not perfect, but it is a major step in the \nright direction. I urge rejection of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n[[Page S2934]]\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield to my friend and colleague, the \noriginal cosponsor of this amendment, 10 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nebraska for \nyielding me time. I rise in strong support of the Hagel amendment to \nthe McCain-Feingold bill.\n  Let me make two points this morning in reference to two arguments on \nthe side that opposes the Hagel amendment.\n  The first argument I have heard on the floor by my colleagues and \nfriends is that somehow the Hagel amendment institutionalizes soft \nmoney going to political parties, as if it makes it legal or something.\n\n  I would say to people who make that argument, where have you been? \nBoth political parties receive huge amounts of unregulated, \nunrestricted money in terms of amounts that can be given to both \npolitical parties.\n  I have in my hand a list. The first page is of soft money \ncontributors to Democrats in our Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, \nand the second page lists over 100 soft money contributors to the \nNational Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. There is an exactly \nsimilar list that could be made for the House of Representatives, the \nother body, which would list all the soft money contributors to the \nHouse's respective political committees. The same is true for the \nNational Democratic Committee and the National Republican Committee.\n  The Hagel amendment restricts their ability to do what they are doing \nto $60,000 a year. Now, you don't think that is going to be one large \nrestriction on the current practice which is legal under the Supreme \nCourt decision? You bet it is.\n  Let me give you an example of what is occurring now without the Hagel \namendment. On my side of the aisle, just to the Senate Campaign \nCommittee, in the last cycle, the American Federation of State and \nCounty Municipal Employees gave our side $1,350,000. On the Republican \nside in relation to soft money going to their campaign committee, \nFreddie Mac gave them $670,250. Philip Morris gave them $550,000. On \nour side, the Service Employees International Union gave us $1,015,250.\n  So the arguments somehow that the Hagel bill institutionalizes or \nlegitimizes or makes legal the concept of soft money contributions to \npolitical parties is nonsense. What it does do is restrict it for the \nfirst time by an act of Congress to no more than $60,000 contributions. \nEvery one of the contributors shown on these two pages is substantially \nin excess of $60,000. In fact, the lowest one--they quit counting them \nat $100,000. They do not even bother to list them below $100,000. There \nare two pages of over 100 soft money contributions currently going to \nthe political parties to do voter registration, to do party-building \nactivities, get-out-the-vote activities. For the first time an effort \nby Congress will say that they cannot give $1,350,000 to Democrats and \nthey cannot give $670,000 to the Republican Senate Campaign Committee; \nthey are limited to $60,000 for party-building activities.\n  So the concept that somehow the Hagel legislation makes something \nlegitimate that is not legal already is simply nonsense. It is already \nlegal. For the first time, the Hagel bill restricts it, and in a major, \nmajor way.\n  The second point I will make is the following. The popular concept \nand the argument that I read daily in the press and listen nightly to \nin the news is that McCain-Feingold somehow eliminates soft money in \nFederal elections. Nothing could be further from the truth. I get \ndeeply upset by people in the press reporting this issue when they say \nthat somehow the debate is over eliminating soft money in Federal \nelections. It does not do that. It limits it only to the political \nparties that can best use the money in a fair and balanced manner.\n  The list behind me, which has been floating around for several days \nnow--and I think it has caught the attention of many of our \ncolleagues--is a list of advocacy groups that are not restricted by the \nsoft money contributions that will be able to continue to be spent \nright up to the election--unrestricted, unreported, and are not \naffected in any way by this so-called soft money ban.\n\n  You all remember some of the names on this list because you have seen \nthem time and again on the airways in your States attacking you. And \nnot being able to respond to these types of groups is the real fallacy \nof this legislation. Do you remember Charlton Heston? Do you remember \n``Moses'' campaigning against many people on my side of the aisle, \nthrough the National Rifle Association? Well, if the McCain-Feingold \nbill passes, they would still be on the air; they would still have \nCharlton Heston, and they would still be attacking Democrats for their \nsupport of gun control. They could not be affected by the legislation \nthat is working its way through the Senate. They use soft dollars. If \nanyone thinks somehow prohibiting Members from helping them raise money \nis going to have an effect on them, believe me, it will not. They have \nplenty of sources without anybody helping them. They have enough money \nto continue to run the ads, primarily against Democrats who support gun \ncontrol.\n  Do you remember the ``Flo'' ads on Medicare, Citizens for Better \nMedicare? Old Flo was there almost daily going after people who did not \nsupport what they thought was an appropriate Medicare reform bill and \nMedicare modernization. They will continue to have Flo on television. \nFlo will continue to be supported by soft money dollars, unrestricted, \nin any amount.\n  Do you remember Harry and Louise? The Health Insurance Association of \nAmerica would totally be unaffected by the McCain-Feingold bill. They \nwould continue to do their ads right up to the election.\n  Believe me, anyone who has the idea that 60 days before the election \nis going to adversely affect their activities has not been around very \nlong. These groups do not wait until 60 days before the election. They \nstart 2 years before an election. They are on the air in many of our \nStates right now, today, going after incumbents that they do not like. \nThey are unrestricted in how they can raise their money or how much \nthey can spend. They don't care too much what happens 60 days before an \nelection because their damage is already done. They will spend a year \nand 10 months beating you up. The only groups that are able to help in \nresponding in kind is our State parties and our national parties.\n  So my argument is simple. No. 1, the McCain-Feingold bill does not \nrestrict soft money where it should be restricted: Special interests, \nsingle interest organizations, which could continue to operate, going \nafter candidates every day right up to an election. I know that most of \nthese groups also do not have a lot of moderates. By definition, \nspecial interest groups generally are not moderate-type organizations. \nThey generally reflect the hard-core positions of both of our parties.\n  Therefore, moderate Members who find themselves in the center of the \npolitical spectrum do not have any of these groups that are going to be \nout there defending their positions of moderation on particularly \ncontroversial issues. But the extreme wings of both of our parties, in \nmany cases, will continue to be out there using unlimited amounts of \nsoft money.\n  If we are talking about Members being somehow beholding to these \norganizations, if you have these groups on your back for 2 years, see \nif they do not have an affect on how you vote and what your positions \nare going to be, particularly if the only groups that can help you in \norder to defend your position are the State parties which will not have \na level playing field and the same ability to run ads. These groups are \nnot keeping with what the American people would like to see us do.\n\n  Therefore, my point is that the Hagel bill is a legitimate \ncompromise. No. 1, it restricts the amount of soft money to $60,000 \nthat can go to parties. That is a major restriction to both of our \nparties over what we currently are getting in terms of the millions \nfrom individual groups and individuals that the Hagel amendment would \ndramatically bring down to a more reasonable amount.\n  Secondly, I think it is incredibly unfair. It creates a very serious \nunlevel playing field to say to Members in the real world that we will \nallow all of the special interest, single-issue organizations to \ncontinue to use soft money--\n\n[[Page S2935]]\n\nunrestricted in terms of the amount, unrestricted in how they can spend \nit--and yet we will be defenseless in terms of the parties coming to \nour defense.\n  I urge the support for the Hagel amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina, Mr. Edwards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, last night we voted on an amendment that \nwas adopted by the Senate, the Wellstone amendment. I will add a few \ncomments about that briefly and then talk about Senator Hagel's bill.\n  First, I want to make clear that the idea of leveling the playing \nfield and doing something about these 501(c)(4) advocacy groups is an \nidea I support. It makes a great deal of sense. So it is a substantive \nmatter. I support the reasoning behind the Wellstone amendment, but I \nremain concerned about the serious constitutional questions raised by \nthe Wellstone amendment given the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court, in \n1984, ruled that these corporations, these advocacy groups, 501(c)(4) \nadvocacy groups are treated differently than unions and for-profit \ncorporations for purposes of electioneering.\n\n  That serious question still remains, but I don't think that amendment \nor the fact that it has passed should in any way undermine our effort \nto pass McCain-Feingold, to support McCain-Feingold, and to do what is \nnecessary to change the campaign finance system in this country.\n  With respect to Senator Hagel's bill, first, I thank him for his work \nin this area. I know he is trying to do a positive thing. There are \nsome fundamental problems with his bill.\n  No. 1, not only does it not solve the problem of soft money, it \narguably makes it worse. Although he places limits on soft money \ncontributions to national parties, all that has to be done to avoid \nthat problem is to raise the money through State parties. In addition, \nhe does absolutely nothing about the fundamental issue, which is the \nappearance that candidates and elected officials are raising unlimited, \nunregulated contributions in connection with elections. There is \nnothing under his amendment that would prevent a candidate for the \nSenate from calling to a State party, raising $500,000, $1 million \ncontributions that can then be used for issue ads in connection with \nthat candidate's election. There is a fundamental flaw in the bill.\n  In addition to that, it legitimizes what has been used to avoid the \nlegitimate Federal election laws, which are soft money contributions \nthat are flowing into these issue ads. We should not put our stamp of \napproval on the soft money process.\n  Furthermore, we should not have candidates for Federal office, \ncandidates for the Senate, continuing to be allowed to call \ncontributors, ask for these huge contributions to be made to State \nparties, and that money can then be spent on that candidate's election. \nThe problem is not solved and arguably the problem, in fact, is made \nworse.\n  With respect to Senator's Breaux's argument that this long list of \ninterest groups can continue to raise soft money and spend soft money, \nthe response to that argument is that the McCain-Feingold bill \nprohibits any of us, an officeholder or a candidate for office, from \ncalling and asking for unlimited soft money contributions from those \nspecial interest groups. It removes us, the elected officials, which is \nultimately what this is all about, the integrity of the Senate, the \nintegrity of the House of Representatives, the integrity of the \nCongress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I ask for another 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Make it 1 minute.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I will do it in 1 minute.\n  It removes us from that process, which is a critical fact, because \nwhat we are trying to do is restore the integrity of the candidates, \nthe integrity of the election process, and the integrity of the \nCongress. No longer would we be able to call and ask a contributor to \nmake a large contribution to the NRA or some special interest group, \nfor that money to be used in connection with our campaign.\n  Fundamentally, the Hagel bill does not solve the problem. The problem \ncontinues to exist. McCain-Feingold moves us in the right direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes of my time to my friend \nand colleague, the senior Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from Nebraska \nfor the work he has done in this area. You have not heard my voice on \ncampaign finance reform in the last several years, largely because I \nbelieved the legislation that was on the floor was not campaign finance \nreform. I do believe now that the Hagel amendment brings to the floor \nthe kind of reasonable and appropriate adjustment in the campaign \nfinance law that fits and is appropriate for the political process.\n  Just for a few moments, I will address some of the comments of my \ncolleague from Connecticut a few moments ago, when, in a rather \nemotionally charged way, he suggested that the political process is \nawash in money. I only can judge him by his statement, but I have to \nassume that the perspective he has offered is from a 1974 view.\n  If you step back into 1974 and look forward into the year 2000, that \njudgment can be made, that the political process is awash in money. But \nyou cannot buy a car on the street today for a 1974 price, as much as \nyou or I might wish. You cannot buy a house today at a 1974 price. Is \nhe alleging that the auto industry and the real estate industry and all \nother industries of our country are awash in money? He has not made \nthat statement, nor should he.\n  This is the reality: In 1980, I ran for political office in the State \nof Idaho as a congressional candidate for the first time. I spent about \n$185,000 on that campaign. At that time a campaign for Congress was \nabout $175,000. Today that same campaign costs about $800,000 or \n$900,000. Why would it cost so much? At that time I was paying about \n$5,000 for polling advice. Today that same candidate would pay $13,000 \nor $14,000. At that time I was paying $400 or $500 for a political ad. \nToday in Idaho, I would pay $3,000 or $4,000 for a political ad. Does \nthat mean politics is awash in money or does it simply mean you are \nhaving to pay for the cost of the goods and services you are buying for \nthe political process today in 2000 dollars and not 1974 dollars?\n  I do believe that is what the Senator from Connecticut meant, but \nwhat he alleges is that there is all of this money out there when, in \nfact, it is the money that comes to the system based on what the system \nhas asked for and what it believes it needs to present a legitimate and \nresponsible political point of view.\n  There is nothing wrong with that. What is wrong or what needs to be \nadjusted is how that money gets directed and how that money gets \nreported so the public knows and can make valid and responsible \njudgments when they go to the polls on election day whether candidate X \nor candidate Y has played by the rules and is the kind of person they \nwould want serving them in public office.\n  I do believe that is what the Hagel amendment offers. It offers to \nshape and control and disclose in the kind of legitimate and \nresponsible way that all of us should expect, and that is important to \nthe credibility of the political process.\n  It is tragic today when politicians malign politicians and suggest \nthat there is corruption and evil in the system. Not all of us are \nperfect, but about 99 percent of us try to play by the rules. We are \njudged by those rules. For any one of us to stand in this Chamber and \nsuggest that the system is corrupt and therefore, if we are in it, we \nare also corrupt or corruptible is a phenomenal stretch of anyone's \nimagination and should not happen. It is too bad it does happen. Only \non the margin has it happened in the past. Usually those individuals \nwho fail to play by the rules ultimately get destroyed by those rules.\n\n  What we are trying to do is to adjust those rules in a right and \nresponsible\n\n[[Page S2936]]\n\nfashion that brings clarity to the process, that reflects the fact that \nyou cannot run a 2002 campaign in 1974 dollars or cents, for that \nmatter. You cannot reach back well over a quarter of a century and \nexpect that you can find the goods and services that you once purchased \nback then as something you will employ now in the political process.\n  So when the Senator from Connecticut gets so excited about the money \nthat is in politics, why don't we be more concerned about directing it \nand clarifying it instead of trying to step back a quarter of a century \nto buy the goods and services that he bought then and that I bought \nthen for the political process that have gone up by at least 25 or 30 \npercent in the interim?\n  Let me talk for a few moments on disclosure. Without question, \ndisclosure is critical. The public clearly deserves to know and we have \nthe tools and the technology today to disclose almost on a daily basis, \ncertainly within a weekly process. Everyone should have their Web page \nand be up on the Internet and allow the world to know where their money \nis coming from and who is giving it. What is wrong with that? Nothing \nis wrong with that. And we should all be held accountable for it. The \nsoft money issue--well, I think my colleague from Louisiana painted it \nvery clearly: Disarm the political party, but let the open and \nuninhibited speech on the outside go unfettered. We can't touch that. \nThe Constitution has said so. And we should not touch it.\n\n  What is wrong with a full, open, and robust political process? \nNothing is wrong with that. That is how we make choices in this \ncountry, how we decide who will represent us in a representative \nrepublic. That is the way our system works. Those are the kinds of \njudgment calls the public ought to be allowed to make, and the Hagel \namendment, in a very clear, clean, and appropriate fashion, makes those \nkinds of determinations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to Senator Dodd that I believe he gave one of \nthe best speeches I have ever heard on the floor on this question.\n  I have two colleagues on the other side whom I like very much. I \nthink Senator Hagel commands widespread respect, as does Senator Craig. \nI want to pick up, so I don't go with some rehearsed remarks, with what \nSenator Craig said. He talked about he didn't understand what the \nSenator from Connecticut was saying because we have this open and full \nprocess. That is on what we really ought to be focusing.\n  The fact of the matter is, that is the issue, I say to my colleague \nfrom Idaho. The vast majority of the people in the country don't \nbelieve this is an open and full process. Too many people in the \ncountry believe if you pay, you play; if you don't pay, you don't play. \nToo many people believe that their concerns for themselves and their \nfamilies and their communities are of little concern to Senators and \nMembers of the House of Representatives because they don't have the big \nbucks and because they are not the big players or the heavy hitters. \nThat is exactly the point.\n  When we talk about corruption, I want to say again that I don't know \nof any individual wrongdoing by any Senator of either party. I hope it \ndoesn't happen. But I do think we have systemic corruption, which is \nfar more serious. That is when you have a huge imbalance between too \nfew people with too much wealth, power, and say, and the vast majority \nof people who feel left out. If you believe the standard of \nrepresentative democracy is that each person should count as one, and \nno more than one, we have moved dangerously far away from that. I think \nthat is what my colleague from Connecticut was saying.\n\n  It is within this context that I have to say to my good friend from \nNebraska that I do not believe the American people will believe this is \na reform amendment if they should see a headline saying ``U.S. Senate \nVotes to Put More Big Money into American Politics.''\n  We now have, with the Hagel proposal, a huge loophole, unlimited soft \nmoney that now goes directly into State parties, and in addition we are \ntalking about going from $1,000 to $3,000 and $2,000 to $6,000, when it \ncomes to individual contributions.\n  Again, I was so pleased to hear my colleague from Connecticut say \nthat when one-quarter of 1 percent of the population contributes $200 \nor more and one-ninth of 1 percent contributes $1,000 or more, why do \nwe believe it is a reform to put yet more big money into politics and \nto have all of us more dependent upon these big givers, heavy hitters, \nor what some people call the ``fat cats'' in the United States? It \ndoesn't strike me that this represents reform. I think it really \nrepresents more deform. And I am not trying to be caustic, but I just \nthink this proposal on the floor of the Senate now is a great step \nbackward. I hope my colleagues will vote against it.\n  Finally, I realize that with the proposal of my good friend from \nNebraska, one individual would be authorized--if you are ready for \nthis--to give a total of $270,000 in hard and soft money to a national \nparty in an election cycle--$270,000? People in the Town Talk Cafe in \nWillmar, MN, scratch their heads and say: That is not us. We can't \ncontribute $270,000 to a party in one cycle. We can't contribute \n$1,000, going to $3,000, or $3,000 going to $6,000. This is not reform. \nWe want you to pass McCain-Feingold with strong amendments, which will \nbe a bill that represents a step forward.\n  This proposal of my friend from Nebraska is not a step forward. It is \na great leap, not even sideways but backward. I hope Senators will vote \nagainst it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my friend, the Senator \nfrom Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think everybody knows I would prefer \nnot to have restrictions on soft money contributions to parties. The \nreason for that is I would like for the parties to be able to defend \ncandidates and compete with these outside groups, that I confidently \npredict are not going to be restricted by anything we do here in this \ndebate under the first amendment to the Constitution.\n  But legislating is always a matter of compromise. It seems to me the \nHagel proposal casts a middle ground between people such as I who would \nnot restrict the parties' ability to compete with outside groups, and \npeople such as the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin \nwho would take away 40 percent of the budget of the RNC and the DNC and \n35 percent of the budget of the two senatorial committees--a middle \nground. We have the prohibitionists on one side who want to completely \ngut the parties, and those such as I who would like to see the parties \ncontinue to have an unfettered opportunity to compete with outside \ngroups. What Senators Hagel and Breaux have done is try to strike a \nmiddle ground.\n  In addition, they deal with what I think is the single biggest \nproblem in politics, the hard money contribution set back in 1974 when \na Mustang cost $2,700. Let's look at campaign inflation, which has been \nmuch greater than the CPI for almost everything else. For a 50-question \npoll, over the last 26 years, the cost has increased 150 percent. The \ncost of producing a 30-second commercial, over the last 26 years, has \nincreased 600 percent. The cost of a first-class stamp, over the last \n26 years, has increased 240 percent. The cost of airing a TV ad, per \n1,000 homes, over the last 26 years has increased 500 percent. \nMeanwhile, the number of voters candidates have to reach--which is the \nway they charge for TV time--has gone up 42 percent over the last 26 \nyears.\n  Back in 1974, when this bill was originally passed, the Federal \nElection Campaign Act, we had 141 million Americans in the voting age \npopulation. In 1998, it was 200 million in the voting age population. \nAn individual's $1,000 contribution back in 1980 to a $1.1 million \ncampaign represented only .085 percent of the total. That was the \naverage cost of a campaign in those days. If the contribution limits \nhad been tripled for the last election to adjust for inflation since \n1974, an individual's $3,000, which would have been allowed had we \nallowed indexation initially, to the average $7 million campaign would \nhave been only .04 percent of the\n\n[[Page S2937]]\n\ntotal--less as a percentage of the campaign than it was 26 years ago. \nThere is no corruption in that.\n  In addition to that, raising the contribution limits on hard money \ngives challengers a chance. They typically don't have as many friends \nand supporters as we do. To compete, they have to pool resources from a \nmuch smaller number of people. One of the big winners, if we indexed \nthe hard money limit, would be challengers. The contribution limits \ndate to a time of 50-cents-a-gallon gasoline and 25-cent McDonald's \nhamburgers.\n  This is absurd. That is the single biggest problem we need to deal \nwith. Michael Malbon, one of the professors active in this field, said:\n\n       We expected thousand-dollar contributors to include many \n     lobbyists who would favor incumbents. That is not what we \n     found. In Senate races in 1996 and 2000, 70 percent of the \n     thousand-dollar contributions went to non-incumbents.\n\n  With regard to constitutionality, let me say again that I am not wild \nabout limiting the party's ability to speak while allowing outside \nspecial interest groups to use large, unregulated, undisclosed \ncontributions.\n  There is a legitimate constitutional question as to whether the \ncourts will uphold the restrictions on the ability of political parties \nto engage in free speech.\n  The all-or-nothing debate over banning soft money has grown a bit \ntired and stale for many in the Senate--and, I would guess, many in the \npress who have had the misfortune of covering this issue for the past \nseveral years.\n  Senator Hagel and Senator Breaux along with their cosponsors have \nsought a middle ground that leaves neither side particularly happy--\nwhich leads me to believe that they have probably gotten it about \nright.\n  Those like myself who want to see our great political parties prosper \nand compete with unregulated outside special interest groups prefer no \nadditional restrictions on soft money.\n  Those, like my colleague from Arizona or my colleague from Wisconsin, \nwho want to take away 30 to 40 percent of the budgets of the great \npolitical parties by banning all non-Federal money are adamant that it \nmust be their way or no way. A total ban on party soft money is their \nstarting point in the negotiation and, unfortunately, their ending \npoint.\n  I say to my friend from Nebraska, he has probably hit it about right. \nHe is somewhere in the middle between me and my colleague from Arizona, \nJohn McCain.\n  I commend the cosponsors of Hagel-Breaux for their thoughtful effort \nto find a third way, a middle ground between those who want a total \nban--the prohibitionists, you might call them--and those who want \nunfettered speech by America's political parties.\n  I want to briefly touch on two points in discussing the bipartisan \nHagel-Breaux compromise. First, I want to talk about the dire need to \nincrease the hard money limits, and, then I will offer my thoughts as \nto why the Hagel-Breaux compromise is more likely to be upheld as \nconstitutional than McCain-Feingold.\n  I must state again that I am not wild about limiting the parties' \nability to speak while allowing the outside special interest groups to \nuse large, unregulated, undisclosed contributions to drown out the \nvoices of parties and candidates.\n  There is a legitimate constitutional question as to whether the \ncourts will uphold restrictions on the ability of political parties to \nengage in issue speech.\n  Ultimately, however, I believe that Hagel-Breaux is far more likely \nto be upheld than McCain-Feingold.\n  First, and most importantly, McCain-Feingold completely bans party \nsoft money from corporations and unions. The Hagel-Breaux compromise, \nhowever, only places a cap on party soft money from unions and \ncorporations, thus leaving unions and corporations with a meaningful \navenue for supporting America's political parties.\n  There is a significant qualitative and constitutional difference \nbetween a ban and a cap. For example, the Supreme Court in Buckley \nupheld a contribution cap in the 1974 law. The legacy of Buckley is \nreasonable caps, not bans. A cap sets limits on the right to speak. A \nban completely forecloses the right to speak. I would argue that we \nshould have neither. But, if you have to choose one, then the lesser \nrestriction has a far greater chance of being upheld under first \namendment analysis.\n\n  In short, there is clearly a constitutional difference between a \nreasonable cap and a total ban. It is the difference between \nprohibition and moderation. I submit to my colleagues that corporations \nand unions participating in American politics and supporting our great \nparties is a virtue, not a vice. It may be wise--as Senators Hagel and \nBreaux suggest--to moderate that influence, but it is certainly unwise \nto prohibit it.\n  Let me touch on one other point--a myth, really. We have heard some \nin the Senate argue that corporations and unions have been banned from \npolitics for the better part of the 20th century. No myth could be more \npervasive or more untrue. Corporations and unions have never been \nbanned from participating in politics in America. Anyone who knows the \nhistory of labor unions will tell you that the unions have been and \ncontinue to be one of the most significant players in American \npolitics. Regardless of what you think of the labor unions, what they \nare doing today with non-Federal money is not illegal activity. I hear \nspeaker after speaker on the other side get up and directly imply that \nlabor unions are somehow doing something illegal by participating in \npolitics. I may disagree with the unions on some of their issues, but I \nwill firmly and proudly defend there right to participate in politics. \nThe often-repeated and implicit statement that big labor is engaging in \nillegal activity by participating in politics is just plain wrong, and, \nthat implicit and pervasive allegation should stop.\n  There is absolutely nothing in the Tillman Act or the Taft-Hartley \nAct that prohibits corporations and unions from giving to political \nparties. This is a gross misstatement and misreading of the plain \nlanguage of well-established law.\n  Of course, the Hagel-Breaux compromise--unlike McCain-Feingold--seeks \na constitutional middle ground on regulating outside groups by \nrequiring that files on ad buys be available for public inspection. \nThis increases accountability without requiring donor disclosure and \nmembership lists of outside groups who dare to speak out on public \nissues in proximity to elections. The McCain-Feingold, Snowe-Jeffords \napproach has been struck know as recently as last year by the Second \nCircuit Court of Appeals. I commend my colleagues for recognizing the \nboundaries of the first amendment's guarantee of free speech and free \nassocaiton.\n  Finally, unlike McCain-Feingold, Hagel-Breaux recognizes that there \nis not only a first amendment, there is a tenth amendment. The tenth \namendment limits the Federal Government's powers to mandate and dictate \nto States. McCain-Feingold tramples the tenth amendment almost as \nvigorously as it does the first amendment.\n\n  For example, McCain-Feingold would tell State and local parties that \nthey must follow Federal law and Federal contribution and expenditure \nlimits for a whole host of activities in years where there happens to \nbe a Federal candidate on the State or local ballot.\n  Let me give you an example: Under McCain-Feingold, if the Sioux City \nRepublican Party decided next year that it wanted to register voters in \nthe final 4 months before election day to increase turnout for the \nSioux City sheriff's race, then it would have to pay for the voter \nregistration with money raised under strict Federal contribution \nlimits. The same would be true if the local party in Sioux City wanted \nto print up buttons and bumper stickers that said ``Vote Republican'' \nto increase turnout for the local jailer's race. The Sioux City \nRepublicans would have to operate under Federal law on contribution \nlimits.\n  Hagel-Breaux, on the other hand, avoids understands the varied and \ndiverse role of political parties at the national, State and local \nlevel and avoids such massive, overbearing, and unwise Federal \nregulation.\n  Finally, the Hagel-Breaux compromise provides a rational \njustification for its limits. The Hagel-Breaux compromise takes the \nexact contribution limits upheld by the Supreme Court in Buckley and \nadjusts those\n\n[[Page S2938]]\n\nlimits for a quarter-century of inflation. I believe there is a good \nchance that the courts would view that sensible rationale as reasonable \nand constitutional.\n  In closing, let me say that I am not wild about this legislation, but \nI think it seeks and finds a middle ground, a third way for Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle to come together and move forward in the spirit \nof bipartisan compromise. I commend my colleague from Nebraska and my \ncolleague from Louisiana for their willingness to step into the breach.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Connecticut. \nLet us start with a few basic truths. We are supposed to have limits. \nThey have been completely evaded, destroyed by the soft money loophole. \nThe current law says no individual is supposed to give more than \n$1,000, or give more than $25,000 in a year totally, and because of the \nsoft money loophole, there are no limits. That is a given. The question \nis whether or not we want to close the soft money loophole.\n  It seems to me, unless we close this soft money loophole, we are \ngoing to destroy public confidence in the election process in this \ncountry, and the cynicism which exists and the impact and effect of \nlarge money on politics is simply going to grow.\n  How do we close the soft money loophole? In McCain-Feingold we close \nit. We simply end the soft money loophole, not just for national \nparties, but also to make sure that Federal officials and officeholders \nand candidates do not raise money for State parties in a way to avoid \nour new prohibition. That is missing from the Hagel amendment.\n  We have to be clear on that critical point because we have seen \ncharts which say: Look, we are going to reduce the amount of soft money \nin the campaigns because we are going to put a cap on the amount of \nsoft money. Putting aside the fact that this goes exactly opposite the \nprinciples in McCain-Feingold and putting aside the fact that Hagel \nthen would enshrine soft money into our national law, it also means \nthat unless you close the possibility and end the possibility of \nFederal candidates, Federal officeholders, and national parties just \nsimply raising money for State parties in Federal elections, you leave \nthe loophole open.\n  What the Hagel amendment does is shift the loophole. It does not \nclose it. It continues to allow Federal officeholders, Federal \ncandidates, and national parties to raise the money for State campaigns \nand State parties that will in turn continue to use that money in \nattack ads and in so-called sham issue ads. It does not close the soft \nmoney loophole, it shifts the soft money loophole.\n  That is simply not good enough. That is not campaign finance reform. \nThat is sham reform.\n  The other thing it does, relative to hard money limits, is it raises \nthe hard money limits to $75,000 per year per individual which means \nthat a couple can give in a cycle of 2 years $300,000 in hard money \ncontributions. That is not reform. That simply says that big money, big \nbucks, and big contributions will continue to be solicited by those of \nus who are in office, those of us who seek office, and those of us who \nare in the national parties. That means that the role of big money in \nthese campaigns is going to continue.\n  I close by quoting something the Supreme Court said in the Missouri \ncase, in the Shrink Missouri Government PAC case a year or two ago. \nThis is what the Supreme Court said about the appearance of \nimpropriety, the appearance of corruption created by big contributions:\n\n       While neither law nor morals equate all political \n     contributions, without more, with bribes, we spoke in Buckley \n     of the perception of corruption ``inherent in a regime of \n     large individual financial contributions'' to candidates for \n     public office as a source of concern ``almost equal'' to quid \n     pro quo improbity. The public interest in countering that \n     perception was, indeed, the entire answer to the overbreadth \n     claim raised in the Buckley case. This made perfect sense. \n     Leave the perception of impropriety unanswered, and the \n     cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could \n     jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in \n     democratic governance. Democracy works ``only if the people \n     have faith in those who govern, and that faith is bound to be \n     shattered when high officials and their appointees engage in \n     activities which arouse suspicions of malfeasance and \n     corruption.''\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my good friend from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, in 1971 when the Senate last visited this \nissue in earnest, it did so with every belief that the legislation that \nwould be produced would end abuses of our Federal electoral system. It \nhelped for a time until loopholes came to light and new abuses \nsurfaced.\n  In every series of actions on this issue, there have been unintended \nand unexpected consequences. I want to talk about one of those \nconsequences, and that is the effect that the current Federal campaign \nfinance law has had on American politics.\n  It has converted American politics by requiring and facilitating a \nfundamental alteration in the conduct of campaigns. It takes candidates \ninto the shadows--the closeted shadows--of an office dialing for big \ndollars and the flickering shadows of a television studio spending \nthose big dollars on self-serving or, more frequently, attack ads \ndisparaging the opponent.\n  What is given up by going into the shadows? What is given up is the \npublic's open participation in the critical purposes of a political \ncampaign. Let me suggest three of those purposes.\n  First, a purpose of a political campaign is mutual education. Both \nthe voter and the candidate should conclude the campaign with a better \nunderstanding of each other. I cite as an example of that mutual \neducation a former colleague and very close personal friend, Senator \nand then-Governor Lawton Chiles of my State of Florida.\n  In 1970, he commenced a campaign for the U.S. Senate as the most \ndistinct long shot in a large field of candidates. He had no money. He \nhad almost no statewide name recognition. He had no organization. But \nwhat he did have was a powerful desire and an idea. His idea was that \nhe was going to take 3 or 4 months in the middle of the campaign, not \nto dial for dollars or to make TV spots, but to get to know the people \nof Florida in a very intimate way. He did it by walking almost 1,000 \nmiles from the northwest corner of the State to the Florida Keys.\n  In the course of that walk, Lawton Chiles became a different human \nbeing. He had learned from the people of Florida, and then they \nresponded to what he had done by electing him, and he in turn responded \nby 18 years of outstanding service in the Senate.\n  That is eliminated as people rush to the shadows to both dial and \nthen produce TV ads.\n  A second purpose of a political campaign is to establish a contract \nbetween the candidate and the voters as to what is expected once \nelected.\n  I suggest this contract is especially important in our form of \ngovernment. We do not have a parliamentary government where, when the \npeople believe that the party elected has drifted away from its \ncommitment, they can overturn that government and install a new \ngovernment. We are all elected for a fixed term, so it is important \nthat as that term commences and in the process of the development of \nthe relationship between citizen and candidate, there is a clear \nunderstanding of what that candidate is going to do if he or she is \nelected.\n  That contract development is largely abrogated by the process of \nfocusing the campaign exclusively on raising money in order to support \n30-second television ads.\n  Finally, a purpose of a political campaign is to test the aptitudes, \nthe character of the candidate should he or she be elected. I believe \none of the most telling statements of what kind of a person one would \nbe in office is how they conduct themselves as a candidate. Do they \nmake quality decisions in public, under pressure? Do they exercise \nself-discipline? The kind of people they surround themselves with in \nthe campaign will be a telling commentary on the kind of people they \nare likely to surround themselves with in office.\n  Again, what do we learn about the character and aptitude of a \ncandidate if all we see is their own self-financed and self-produced TV \nads? The public is\n\n[[Page S2939]]\n\ntelling us of its disgust with the move of the campaigns from the \nsunshine to the shadow. The American voters are shouting, particularly \nyoung voters. How are they shouting? They are shouting by their \nnonparticipation. Ever since the Constitution was amended to allow 18-\nyear-olds to vote, the message of those 18-year-old voters has gone \ndown at every Presidential election. If that is not telling us what the \nnewest generation of American citizens has to say about the current \nprocess, we are deaf.\n  The Hagel amendment would increase the torrent of money into \npolitics. It would increase the time and effort spent on raising and \nspending money on television ads. It would accelerate the slide of \npublic involvement and interaction in a political campaign. We need to \nreject this amendment and adopt the legislation offered by Senators \nMcCain and Feingold.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I should offer an amendment that says: on \npage 3, between line 27 and line 28, insert the following: 30 days \nafter enactment of this Act, the starboard deck chairs of the R.M.S. \nTitanic shall be moved to the port side, and vice versa.\n  Because if we step back and examine the campaign finance issue, I \nbelieve that in the end all this legislation affecting details of the \ncampaign finance system is doing just that rearranging deck chairs on \nthe Titanic. If I can just stretch this metaphor a bit farther, the \niceberg looming out there in front of us is not soft money, or \ndisclosure requirement, or compulsory union dues, but rather the simple \nfact that our federal government is so bloated and intrusive that \nAmericans are desperate to find ways to affect it's actions.\n  I believe the absolute best ways to ensure there are no undue special \ninterest influence is to suppress and reduce the size of government. If \nthe government rids itself of special interest funding and corporate \nsubsidies, then there would be less of a perception of any attempts to \nbuy influence through donations. A simplified tax code, state \nregulation flexibility, free markets, local education control--these \nare less government approaches to problems that would also lower the \ndesperate need for influence.\n  I am not alone in that belief. The Colorado Springs Gazette ran an \neditorial on Thursday, March 22 saying that ``The best way, and the \nconstitutional way, to limit campaign contributions is to reduce \ngovernment itself, and thus the need interests have to manipulate \ngovernment to their advantage.''\n  That editorial is proof that perhaps those outside the beltway see \nthe forest instead of all the individual trees we keep getting caught \nup by here on the Senate floor. They know that all we are doing is \naddressing symptomatic, not causal, problems.\n  There are two reasons why McCain-Feingold is ineffective. One of \nthose reasons is the United States Supreme Court, and I will address \nthat later. The other reason speaks to the futility of these alleged \nreforms--these various deck chair amendments. That reason is human \nnature. Even if we could constitutionally ban soft money, human nature \ndictates that people whose interest, both financial and otherwise, are \nconstantly and severely being abused or threatened by our 1.9 trillion \nin federal spending will continue to seek to influence the government, \nsome out of just basic self defense.\n  In the Eighties the complaint was against the PACs. In the Nineties \nand now, the complaint is against soft money. Even if there was a \nconstitutional soft money ban, there will be something else later. What \nneeds to be done is to address the problem, not try and hide the effect \nof the problem. But, since we are here, moving our chairs around, I \nmust say that I favor certain chair arrangements. And so do my \nconstituents.\n  Then Denver Rocky Mountain News, for instance, ran an editorial \nduring the last Congress in response to the passage of the Shays/Meehan \nbill, expressing the paper's belief that soft money campaign \ncontributions are a form of political expression and, as such, are \nprotected by the First Amendment.\n  In the editorial they use an example of an average citizen who might \ndecide to distribute leaflets against a city pot hole problem. If this \nhypothetical citizen is stopped from doing so by a city council, it \nwould be a clear-cut violation of freedom of speech. The editorial then \ngoes on, correctly, to explain that the difference between this simple \nform of election activity control and the kinds contained in McCain-\nFeingold is merely a difference of degrees, not type. Donors who want \nto give to the Republican National Committee or the Democrat National \nCommittee are expressing their political views. As the Supreme Court \nhas ruled, political spending equals political expression. Attempting \nto completely ban this political expression, however distasteful some \nmight find soft money, is an attempt to stifle activities protected by \nthe constitution. And so it is our duty as legislators to find a better \nway.\n  Let me explain also that I feel that a soft money ban is biased. It \nmight just be coincidental that the McCain-Feingold has 34 Democrat co-\nsponsors and 6 Republican ones, but it might also have something to do \nwith the fact that a ban on party soft money will ultimately benefit \nDemocrat candidates over Republican ones. If political parties are \ncurbed, the Democrats already have a cohesive constituency ready and \nable to step up and assume party functions. Organized labor is just \nthat--coordinated people ready to work. They are also ready to spend. I \ndon't begrudge the Democrat National Committee this labor and funding \nbase, but it is unbalanced and blatantly partisan to attempt to shield \nthis type of spending--which has been done in amendment after amendment \non this floor--while attacking its counterbalancing force, the areas \nwhere the Republican National Committee instead has the advantage.\n  I have cosponsored Senator Hagel and Landrieu's legislation because \nit shared some aspects of what I have previously proposed for campaign \nfinance reform. The bill calls for increased disclosure, aspects of \nwhich we have embraced here already. Sunshine is a strong disinfectant. \nThe bill calls for an increase to campaign donor limits. Hard money is \ncalled for a reason, and so we should encourage as much campaign \nspending as feasible to move into that category, where the rules are \ntighter and more defined.\n  The Hagel-Landrieu legislation is one of the best deck chair \narrangements before us. I urge its passage.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the Hagel \namendment to the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. This \nlegislation is similar to legislation that I introduced in each of the \nlast two Congresses, ``The Constitutional and Effective Reform of \nCampaigns Act,'' or ``CERCA.'' My bill has proven to be a good faith \neffort to strike middle ground in this important debate and offered an \nalternative to the bills that have been debated before the full Senate \nin the past. The principal points in my bill were enhanced disclosure, \nincreased contribution limits, a cap on soft money and paycheck \nprotection. Senator Hagel's amendment does much the same thing.\n  As Chairman of the Rules Committee during the 105th Congress, I had \nthe honor of presiding over at least twelve hearings on campaign \nfinance reform. My legislation was a result of these two years of \nhearings, discussions with numerous experts and colleagues, and the \nresult of over two decades of participating in campaigns and campaign \nfinance debates.\n  It is well documented the growth of soft money in recent years is an \nissue of public concern. The $60,000 soft money cap found in the Hagel \namendment addresses the public's legitimate concern over the propriety \nof large soft money donations while allowing the political parties \nsufficient funds to maintain their headquarters and conduct their \ngrassroots effort.\n  In addition to the issue of soft money, there is the issue of raising \nthe hard money caps. Politicians spend too much time fundraising at the \nexpense of their legislative duties for incumbents, and, for both \nincumbents and challengers, at the expense of debating the issues with \nvoters. The current individual contribution limit of $1,000 has not \nbeen raised, or even indexed for inflation for over 20 years. This \nsituation requires candidates to spend more and more time seeking more \nand more donors. The Hagel amendment triples the individual \ncontribution limits to $3,000 and indexes that limit for inflation. My \ncampaign finance legislation contained the exact same provision.\n\n[[Page S2940]]\n\n  These are issues that I believe can be solved in a bipartisan \nfashion. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact \nmeaningful campaign finance reform, and I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport the Hagel amendment as a mechanism to reach bipartisan \nconsensus on campaign finance reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, please notify me when I have used 5 minutes \nof the remaining time.\n  Mr. President, as I have listened this morning and throughout the \ndays of last week about the dynamics of campaign finance reform, I \nbelieve it is well summarized in a piece that appeared in the New York \nTimes on Sunday. I will read part of that piece because it does strike \nto the essence of real reform of campaign finance.\n  Joel Gora, general counsel to the New York Civil Liberties Union, and \nPeter Wallison, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote \nthis thoughtful op-ed in last Sunday's New York Times. This is some of \nwhat they had to say:\n\n       Despite all the noise [about campaign finance reform] soft \n     money is not the monster it's made out to be. By definition, \n     it consists solely of contributions to political parties for \n     such things as party building, getting out the vote and issue \n     advertising; it cannot be used for direct support of \n     candidates. . . . But eliminating soft money contributions to \n     parties sacrifices other values that we believe are \n     fundamental to our democratic system. . . .\n       Political parties are groups with broader interests, more \n     intertwined with the electoral process. . . . Banning soft \n     money denies parties the rights that we would not think of \n     denying to other organizations. . . .\n       The National Abortion Rights Action League can attack the \n     Republican Party with money it raises from any source and in \n     any amount; the National Rifle Association can attack the \n     Democratic party with the same unlimited resources; however, \n     if soft money is eliminated, neither political party will \n     have the resources to counter these attacks. . . .\n       There is also the free-speech guarantee of the First \n     Amendment. Can there be any doubt that the core of the \n     Constitution's protection of free speech and a free press is \n     to inform the electorate? . . .\n       The McCain-Feingold bill goes beyond even limiting \n     contributions. It actually prohibits speech. . . .\n       There are no real winners in this situation, but there are \n     real losers--the voting public.\n\n  And so said the New York general counsel to the New York Civil \nLiberties Union.\n  I think Mr. Gora said it well.\n  In these final minutes of debate, I go back to the basics that \nbrought us here. We are here to reform our campaign finance system. My \nfriends from Arizona and Wisconsin have offered one alternative. I \nbelieve it is the wrong approach. Their intentions are good, but the \nunintended consequences of their legislation would weaken our political \nsystem at the point where it should be the strongest. The McCain-\nFeingold bill would not open the process to more people; it would \nrestrict the process to those who can afford to play outside the \nprocess.\n  What do we gain by weakening the vital dynamic institutions of the \npolitical process, the political parties, the one group of institutions \nthat is accountable to the American public and the only institution \nthat will help a challenger take on an incumbent?\n  We have heard an awful lot in this body in the last few days about \nincumbent protection, a lot of incumbent protection debate and \namendments passed to protect our jobs.\n  My bipartisan colleague and I have offered an alternative. It is real \nreform. It will change our campaign finance system. It will make it \nbetter, more accountable, more responsible.\n  Our amendment provides more disclosure. It limits soft money. It \nincreases the ability of individuals to participate by increasing the \noutdated 1974 limits on soft money. My goodness, where were all my \ncolleagues in 1974 when this terrible corrosive corrupting factor of \n$1,000 was out there? I went back and read that debate. I was in \nWashington in 1974. There were Members of this body today who voted for \nthat. Not a peep was made in 1974 about any corrupting influence. This \nis the same dollar amount. So how is that bad or how is that some way \nmore corrupt?\n  We face serious questions today. Are we going to reform our campaign \nfinance system? I think we can. I encourage my colleagues to vote for \nthis amendment that amends the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Parliamentary inquiry: The opponents have 8 minutes \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Your side has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island. I \nbelieve Senator Thompson of Tennessee would like to be heard and we \nwill close with 3 minutes from the Senator from Arizona, just to inform \nmy colleagues of the remaining allocation.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Hagel amendment. \nI respect Senator Hagel immensely and compliment him for his efforts, \nbut I think it is the wrong direction for campaign finance reform. The \ncore of our debate about campaign finance reform is to restore the \nconfidence of the American people in our political system--to make them \nbelieve, as we hope they once did, that their vote is the most \nsignificant aspect of a Federal election. Today I fear they believe \ntheir vote is less important than the contributions of special \ninterests or economic elites.\n  The Hagel amendment would amplify significantly the bankrolling of \neconomic elites in elections by raising the limits on contributions \nthat these individuals can make.\n  I think it is very important to point out today the limits on \ncontributions are only reached by approximately one-ninth of 1 percent \nof our country's citizens. This infinitesimal fraction of individuals \nare donating significant amounts of money to political campaigns. This \ndoes not represent, as a result, this effort to raise the limits, an \nattempt to reach out to the broad spectrum of American voters. It \nwould, in fact, increase and enhance the role of a very small minority \nof America.\n  That is not the direction we should take for campaign finance reform. \nWe should not increase the amount of dollars going to the system. We \nshould create a system in which people again believe their vote, rather \nthan any contribution by a special interest or a wealthy American, is \nthe most important part of our system.\n  The other aspect of the Hagel amendment which is troubling is the \ninstitutional savings of soft money. His proposal allows wealthy \nindividuals to donate $60,000 per calendar year to a political party, \ncongressional campaign committee of a national party and others. This \ninstitutionalization once again exacerbates the role of money in \ncampaigns and once again focuses away from the individual voter to the \nvery wealthy contributor.\n  I think it is the wrong direction to take. As I said, the perception \nof our constituents is that this system is not working for them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I focus for a moment on the State party loophole and \naddress the new provisions of the Hagel amendment concerning party soft \nmoney. I also want to respond to the argument that the new provisions \nof the Hagel bill are necessary because the McCain-Feingold bill will \nstarve the parties or will, in their minds, federalize State elections. \nThese charges are just untrue.\n  I talked yesterday about the Hagel amendment legitimizing and \nsanctioning the soft money system. I was referring primarily to the \n$60,000 cap on corporate, labor, and individual soft money \ncontributions. The same can be said about the State soft money \nloophole, and even more so after the changes Senator Hagel made in his \namendment before he offered it yesterday. The amendment codifies the \nFEC's allocation rules used for soft money expenditures by the State \nparty. The FEC currently requires expenditures on certain activities \nincluding get-out-the-vote and voter registration efforts to be paid \nfor with a combination of hard and soft money. What the Hagel amendment \ndoes is write these allocation formulas into law. It takes the soft \nmoney system started in the States and makes it permanent.\n\n  We support the kinds of activities for which soft money now pays. It \nis not that we think get-out-the-vote or voter registration activities \nare somehow corrupt. Quite the contrary, we believe these activities \nare extremely important to the health of our democracy. But the \napproach of the McCain-Feingold bill is to get more hard money to\n\n[[Page S2941]]\n\nthe States, not to allow soft money to live on.\n  Senator McCain and I strongly support vital political parties at both \nthe State and national level. What we don't support is using unlimited \nsoft money from corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals to elect \nFederal candidates.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill doubles the amount of hard money an \nindividual can give in hard money to state and local parties--to \n$10,000 per year, or $20,000 per cycle. That is a little-noted \nprovision in our bill. To hear the Senator from Nebraska tell it, you \nwould think that we were looking to severely restrict party activity in \nthe States. Far from it.\n  All our bill says is that when a State party is spending money on \nFederal elections, it has to be hard money. That includes voter \nregistration activities within 120 days before a Federal election. We \nall know that voter registration in States helps Federal candidates. \nLikewise, get out the vote activity and generic campaign activity--like \ngeneral party advertising--when Federal candidates are on the ballot. \nThose kind of activities, regardless of how laudable they are and how \nmuch we want to encourage them, assist Federal candidates in their \nelection campaigns. So we believe they must be paid for with Federal \nmoney. Obviously, so should public communications that refer to a \nclearly identified federal candidate and support or oppose a candidate \nfor that office.\n  Does that mean that we are trying to weaken the parties? Not at all. \nWe simply ensure that soft money raised by the states cannot be spent \non federal elections. As I have said, to leave that State soft money \nloophole wide open cannot be considered reform. And at this point I \nwould remind my colleagues that both parties consistently raise more \nhard money than soft money. It is not true that if you can't spent soft \nmoney on an activity, that activity won't take place. The parties \nraised more than $700 million in hard money in the 2000 cycle. The idea \nthat we are somehow shutting down State party activities because they \nmust now use hard money for certain activities--those connected to \nFederal elections--is simply untrue.\n  My colleagues might recall that the parties did just fine without a \nsignificant amount of soft money for many years. In the 1984 election \ncycle, soft money accounted for roughly 5 percent of the total receipts \nfor the political parties, and voter turnout in the 84 elections was 53 \npercent. In the 2000 cycle, soft money accounted for 40 percent of the \nparties' receipts, and voter turnout was 51 percent. Soft money does \nnot get out the vote any better than hard money. Soft money doesn't \nprovide some kind of magic bullet that States need to conduct get out \nthe vote activities, or other activities surrounding Federal elections. \nThe States just need adequate funds to conduct those activities, and \nMcCain-Feingold makes sure that they have the money--we double the \namount of hard money an individual can give to a state party and \nincrease the aggregate annual limit a commensurate amount.\n  We want to help state parties stay a vibrant part of our politics. \nAnd there are plenty of activities where States can spend whatever soft \nmoney they might raise through their State party. We don't attempt to \nexert any control over what a State party spends on election activities \nthat are purely directed at State elections. But we do say--a million \ndollar contribution to the party from Philip Morris, or the AFL-CIO, or \nRoger Tamraz, or Denise Rich has the appearance of corruption, whether \nthe money is used for phony issue ads attacking candidates, or voter \nregistration.\n  Mr. DODD. Senator Thompson of Tennessee was going to try to get to \nthe floor but is unavoidably detained. He would oppose the Hagel \namendment on constitutional grounds.\n  Mr. President, what time remains now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. The remaining time I yield to my colleague from Arizona, \nthe author of the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the hard work and sincere \nconviction that my friend--my dear friend and comrade--the Senator from \nNebraska has invested in his amendment. I would, as always, prefer to \nbe on the same side of the fight with him, as we have been so many \ntimes in the past, and as we will be again. He is a man of honor and a \npatriot. I admire him and consider his friendship to be a treasure of \ninestimable value to me. And whatever faults I might have as a human \nbeing and as a legislator, I hope it could never be fairly said of me \nthat I was ungrateful to men and women of character who have honored me \nwith their friendship.\n  I should also acknowledge that there are provisions of Senator \nHagel's amendment that I could support, or that, at least, could \nprovide the basis for bipartisan negotiations. The Senator's broadcast \nprovision, for instance, merits support. And I believe there are ways \nthat Democrats and Republicans could come together to address Senator \nHagel's central concern about making sure that our legislation does not \nweaken the two political parties even more than, what I believe, is the \ncase today.\n  But recognizing both the Senator's hard work and sincere concern, I \nmust oppose this amendment. I must oppose it because it preserves, \nindeed, it sanctions the soft money loophole that has made a mockery of \ncurrent campaign finance law, and which has led directly to the many, \noutrageous campaign finance scandals of recent years that have so badly \ndamaged the public's respect for their government, and for those of us \nwho are responsible for protecting the public trust.\n  As I said in my opening statement, I believe it is self-evident that \ncontributions from a single source that run to the hundreds of \nthousands of dollars are not healthy to a democracy. And I believe that \nconviction is broadly shared by the people whose interests we have \nsworn an oath to defend. My friend's amendment would allow this \nterribly damaging flaw in our current system to remain. It would, in \nfact, sanction it.\n  Thus I cannot support it. Even if every other provision of our bill \nwere to be struck down by the opponents of campaign finance reform, \nalong with all the good work done by both sides last week in reaching \ncompromises on related issues, even if it were all to fall, a ban on \nsoft money--the huge unregulated six and seven figure checks that come \nfrom corporations and unions, from Democrats and Republicans, from \nDenise Rich and Roger Tamraz--a ban on soft money, while not perfect \nreform, or comprehensive reform would still be good service by this \nbody toward alleviating the appearance of corruption that afflicts our \nwork here.\n  A cap of $120,000 per individual per campaign, along with absolutely \nno limits on soft money used by state parties for the benefit of \ncandidates for federal office, will do little to address this problem. \nIn fact, and I say this with the greatest respect and affection for my \nfriend, it will do nothing but give this much abused system the \nSenate's stamp of approval.\n  Mr. President, at the end of debate, I will move to table the Hagel \namendment, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in opposing it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Am I correct that at the end of my 5 minutes we go to \nthe vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, over the last few days many of my \ncolleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, including many of my \ncosponsors, have expressed a desire to vote on each of the three main \nissues in our amendment to McCain-Feingold. I note that my dear friend \nJohn McCain mentioned that there might be some areas in my bill, which \nnow is in the form of an amendment to McCain-Feingold, where we could \nfind some agreement. The senior Senator from Arizona mentioned \nspecifically that the disclosure part of my bill might be something on \nwhich we could find some common ground.\n  Therefore, in order to allow my colleagues to vote on all three of \nthe main issues of my amendment, I demand a division of my amendment \ninto three parts by subtitle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nso divided.\n\n[[Page S2942]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: What was the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield for a parliamentary \ninquiry?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am happy to yield for a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. DODD. What was the request of the Senator from Nebraska?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator demanded a division of his \namendment into three parts, and it has been so divided.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has the floor and \ncontrols the time.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, what the Senator from Nebraska has \nprovided us is an opportunity to have three votes on the three \ncomponent parts of his amendment. That is allowed under the rules of \nthe Senate. It gives us an opportunity to deal with the core issues the \nSenator from Nebraska has laid out here: The increase in hard money, \nincreased disclosure, and the soft money cap. It is my understanding \nthat when I yield back my time, we will go to the vote on those three \namendments. I therefore yield back my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, may I make a further parliamentary inquiry? \nI ask unanimous consent I be allowed to address the Chamber for 1 \nadditional minute.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, let me just say all \nthis provides is an opportunity for three separate votes, as the \nSenator from Nebraska has pointed out: On the hard money contribution \nlimit, increased disclosure, and the soft money provisions. Mr. DODD. I \nappreciate that. All I want to inquire is: There was a unanimous \nconsent agreement entered into for the consideration of this bill, with \nno second-degree amendments, no intervening motions. Is it the \nunderstanding of the Senator from Connecticut, then, that that \nunanimous consent agreement entered into for the consideration of this \nbill did not include a motion to divide? That is the first question.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Division is not a motion; it is a right of any \nSenator.\n  Mr. DODD. Second, are motions to table in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The first division will be open to a motion to \ntable, followed by the second division, followed by the third division.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair and thank my colleague.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield for another parliamentary \ninquiry, and that would be simply----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe the time has basically run out. I think the \nChair has explained there would be three votes, each subject to a \ntabling motion should the Senator from Nevada----\n  Mr. REID. Mine has to do with scheduling, if the Senator will yield \nfor that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield for that sole purpose.\n  Mr. REID. We have our party conferences at 12:30. If we have three \nvotes, that will not work. I am wondering what the Senator's idea is.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest to the distinguished Democratic whip we have \na 15-minute rollcall vote on the first vote and then 10 minutes on each \nof the next two. We should not have any problem getting to our policy \nluncheons.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as I said earlier, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time on the first vote be 15 minutes, and the two \nsubsequent votes be 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to table and ask unanimous consent that that be \nfor all three divisions. I move to table all three.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n          Vote On Division I, Subtitle A, Contribution Limits\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The Chair, in his capacity as a Senator from \nthe State of Oklahoma, suggests the absence of a quorum. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased at the progress we have \nmade. We have disposed of a number of amendments. I think we have had a \nlevel of debate with which Americans are pleased, as are certain \nMembers of the Senate, by the significant participation that has taken \nplace.\n  We really only have two major issues remaining. One is the issue of \nseverability, which is, if there is a constitutional challenge to this \nlegislation, if one part falls, whether or not all of it falls. The \nother is the hard money issue, with lots of negotiations and \ndiscussions going on as I speak.\n  It was agreed at the beginning we would spend 2 weeks on this issue, \nand that was my understanding. It is now my understanding that there \nare some Members who think perhaps we would not move to final passage. \nI am committed to moving to final passage.\n  As I have said before, it is not the 2 weeks that counts; it is the \nfinal disposition of this legislation which I think not only I but the \nAmerican people deserve.\n  As I say, we have disposed of the major issues with the exception of \ntwo. Therefore, in regard to further consideration of the bill before \nthe Senate, I ask unanimous consent that first-degree amendments be \nlimited to 10 each for the proponents and opponents of the bill; that \nrelevant second-degree amendments be in order, with 1 hour for debate \nper second-degree amendment; and after all amendments are offered, the \nbill be immediately advanced to third reading for final passage, with \nno intervening action or debate.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, and I will object, let \nme say to my friend from Arizona, he knows, and we worked on it \ntogether, the consent agreement under which we took up this legislation \nscripted the beginning of the bill. It did not script the end.\n  The Senator from Arizona made very plain from the beginning he wanted \nthis debate to end in an up-or-down vote. It may well end in an up-or-\ndown vote, but the consent agreement did not determine that, and it \nwould not be possible to get consent to structure the end at this time.\n  Let me say this to my friend from Arizona. I agree with him the only \nbig issues left are the hard money limits and the nonseverability \nquestion. I do not think it is likely we would go beyond Thursday \nnight, in any event.\n  However, Mr. President, to the unanimous consent request, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the thoughts of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky. It is hard for me to understand now, with just 2 full \ndays, 2\\1/2\\ days, why we wouldn't, as is our practice around here once \nwe have considered a lot of amendments and a lot of proposals, as we \nreach the end, narrow down amendments. One, then, has to wonder what \nthe intentions are.\n  I don't perhaps disagree with the Senator from Kentucky about the \nlanguage of the unanimous consent agreement. I believe everyone was \nlaboring under the impression that we would reach final resolution of \nthis issue with an up-or-down vote. There are some Senators who now \nquestion that.\n  So I will be back with another unanimous consent request, and if that \nis not agreeable, then one can only draw the conclusion that there is \nan objection to a final disposition of this issue and that, obviously, \nwould be something we would have to then consider.\n  I want to make perfectly clear again what I said at the very \nbeginning, and I will be glad to read the Congressional Record when the \nunanimous\n\n[[Page S2944]]\n\nconsent was entered into with this distinguished majority leader. No \nmatter how long it takes, as long as I can maintain 51 votes, we will \nnot move to other legislation until we dispose of this legislation. For \nyears we were blocked. For years we were not allowed to have this \nprocess which we now all agree has been valuable and helpful. But we \nneed to take it to a final vote. I will be back with further unanimous \nconsent requests so that we can fully bring this issue to closure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join in the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Arizona. I am pleased to see the distinguished majority leader on \nthe floor, whom I have heard say on a number of occasions with regard \nto this process that he would not support a filibuster or an approach \nthat would involve preventing us from getting to final passage on this \nbill. I appreciated those assurances, and I assume they still hold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me make it clear once again, there would have been \nno consent agreement at all had the end been dictated by the agreement. \nI fully understood from the beginning that it was the desire of the \nSenator from Arizona to press for an up-or-down vote at the end of this \ndebate. No one has been more aggressive than he has. Had it not been \nfor the Senator from Arizona, we would not have been on this issue at \nall, at this point, which would have been my preference given the fact \nwe have an energy crisis in the country, we have a stock market that is \nin trouble, and I, frankly, am somewhat stunned that we have spent 2 \nweeks on this issue.\n  Having said that, we have been on this issue because of the tenacity \nof the Senator from Arizona. The consent agreement was entered into \nbecause of the tenacity of the Senator from Arizona. But let me assure \nthe Senate it was not just the Senator from Kentucky who would not have \nagreed to a consent agreement that dictated how this debate ends. So \nthat is why I objected, not just for myself but for others.\n  It could well be that in the next day or so I will have a different \nview of that. But there are important votes yet to be cast, and I am \nsure we will be consulting--the Senator from Arizona and I--on the end \ngame as we move along.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Dodd has worked tirelessly with the \nSenator from Kentucky. He spent long hours here. I think we are \narriving at a point where perhaps this evening or tomorrow sometime we \ncan get a finite list of amendments. We have been working on that. We \nhave a number of people on both sides who believe very strongly in \ntheir amendments and would not want to be told they are not important.\n  I have virtually been with my friend from Wisconsin on every vote we \nhave taken this past 10 days. I think the leadership from Senator \nFeingold, with his partner, the Senator from Arizona, has been \nexemplary. But the fact is, we have spent a lot of time on this bill. I \ndo not expect at this time we should rush on some program to suddenly \nend it. As I said, there are a number of people who have submitted \nrequests to Senator Dodd about amendments that need to be offered. We \nexpect to offer those amendments. I think we should move along as \nquickly as we can, and we certainly have tried to do that.\n  As I said, I think one way we can expedite things is to come up on \nboth sides with a finite list of amendments and have that locked in. I \nhope to have that, after conferring with the leader and Senator Dodd, \nat the earliest possible date.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me just comment before I introduce an \namendment and start the process of the clock.\n  With respect to the question of how this issue finishes, I hope the \nleader on the other side, and those who oppose this, will not move back \nfrom what I think was an understanding by most people who entered into \nthat agreement that we were in fact going to have an opportunity to \ncome to final resolution on this bill.\n\n  Obviously, if we are deprived of that, then I suspect many of us are \ngoing to try to find every opportunity the Senate presents us over the \ncourse of the next months. There is a long schedule yet ahead of us. It \nwould be a waste of the time of the Senate and an insult to the process \nto somehow try to sidestep an appropriate, complete, and total \nresolution, having invested the time we have in the last days. I think \neverybody has moved in good faith in an effort to present the \namendments that represent bona fide efforts to improve campaign \nfinance. But I certainly will join with a number of other colleagues, I \nam confident, if there is some sidestepping procedural effort to \ndeprive us of the appropriate voting conclusion. We will tie up the \nSenate, I am confident, for some period of time in an effort to try to \nresolve it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 148\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Biden, Senator Wellstone, and Senator Cantwell. I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] for himself, Mr. \n     Biden, Mr. Wellstone, and Ms. Cantwell, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 148.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.''\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this amendment is one that I think Senator \nBiden, Senator Cantwell, Senator Wellstone, and I understand is not \ngoing to pass today. I hate to say that. I regret to say that. But it \nis a vote that we ought to have in the Senate. It is a vote that, in \nour judgment, represents the best of what could be achieved in the \ncontext of campaign finance reform. It is steps beyond Senator McCain \nand Senator Feingold, both of whom, I might add, have great sympathy \nfor it notwithstanding the fact that they know, if it were to pass, you \nwould have a very different mix in terms of what they began with as \nsort of a legislative agreement, if you will. I know Senator Feingold \nis a strong supporter nevertheless.\n  What we are proposing is something the Senate has visited before. We \nhave voted on this before. In fact, the Senate in 1994 passed, by a \nvote of 52-46, a campaign reform bill. It never got out of the Senate \nin 1994. This particular one fell victim to the House of \nRepresentatives and to the delay of the schedule. Nevertheless, it \nreflected the willingness of colleagues in the Senate to embrace a \npartial funding by the public, a partial match funding in order to \nreduce the dependency of politicians on going out and becoming \nsupplicants in their search for funds.\n  This is, in effect, translating to the Senate races the same \nprinciple that has been in place and has been used, even through the \ncurrent election for President of the United States, in our national \nelections. It is a partial funding, a match, if you will, that seeks to \naddress the extraordinary amounts of money that are in our campaigns \ntoday.\n  We bring this particular amendment because this effort of campaign \nfinance reform is not just to create a regulation on how much money you \ncan raise in a particular request from a particular person, not just an \neffort to put limits on. There is a larger purpose that brings us here. \nThat purpose is to undo the appearance of impropriety that comes with \nthe linkage of money to the fact of getting elected, the act of getting \nelected. Most people in the Senate who have been here for awhile have \nwatched colleagues sometimes squirm with discomfort because questions \nhave been raised about those linkages.\n  We have had investigations, both of the Senate, of the Ethics \nCommittee, and of outside groups, that have often been pointed at the \nway in which we are forced to raise money. I think most people in any \nhonest assessment would be prepared to say when somebody sitting on a \nparticular committee has to\n\n[[Page S2945]]\n\ngo out and raise money from people who have business before that \ncommittee, or when someone in the Senate has to ask for money from \npeople who have legislative interests in front of them on which they \nwill vote, there is almost an automatic cloud. It is not something we \ndefine for ourselves, it is something that is defined by the system \nitself. It is there whether we like it or not.\n  I do not think there is one of us in the Senate who has not been \nasked at one time or another: Gee, did those people who contributed to \nyou somehow have an influence on the way you voted? For most people in \nthe public, it is a natural connection. If people see the milk \nindustry, or the insurance industry, or the banking industry, or the \nfarmers, or the truckers--you could name any group. I am not being \npejorative in naming any of those I named. Name any interest in America \nthat conglomerates its money, and then look at the people who are \nelected, and you have an automatic connection, like it or not, of the \nmoney and the election process.\n  When you measure the fact that most of America does not contribute, \nmost of America does not have the money to contribute--we have one-half \nof 1 percent of the people in this country who give the $1,000 \ndonations. I think all of the soft money in this country was given by \nabout 800 people in the last election cycle. Think of that--800 \nAmericans out of 280 million giving tens of millions of dollars to \naffect the political process.\n  Most of the average citizens sit there and say: I can only afford \n$10, or maybe I can afford $15 or $20 or $50. But they know; they sort \nof say to themselves: Boy, my $50 is not going to do much to alter the \nimpact of $50,000 from some big, large interest, et cetera. They feel \npowerless and they turn off the system. They go away. They look at the \nsystem and they say: It doesn't represent me.\n  I don't know how many of my colleagues have stopped to ask, but why \nis it that a majority of the Senate is made up of millionaires? Are we \nrepresentative of the United States of America as a group? The answer \nis no. But most people cannot afford to run for office, particularly \nfor the Senate. So the question is, Do we have the guts, do we have the \ncourage to come here and fight for real campaign finance reform that \naffords a more even playing field?\n  Is it a perfect playing field? The answer is no. We do not do that. \nAnd I understand that. But we can try to make it fair so a lot of \npeople can get involved in the process.\n  Let me share with my colleagues this idea that we are submitting to \nthe Senate today comes from a group of business leaders. This is not an \nidea that has been created by some sort of interest group that might \narouse the normal suspicions of those who oppose campaign finance \nreform. This idea has been put together by a group called the Committee \nfor Economic Development. Over 300 business leaders have endorsed this \nproposal. They include top executives of Sara Lee, Nortel Networks, \nState Farm, Motorola, Bear Stearns, American Management Systems, \nHasbro, MGM Mirage, Guardsmark, Kaiser Permanente, Prudential, Saloman \nSmith Barney. They also include retired chairs or CEOs of AlliedSignal, \nBank of America, GTE, International Paper, Union Pacific, General \nFoods, Monsanto, Time, CBS, Fannie Mae, Dow Chemical, and B.F. \nGoodrich.\n  I suppose the question might be asked, Why would past CEOs, why would \ncorporate chieftains, why would corporations themselves be so \ninterested in supporting a campaign finance mechanism that includes \nsome public funding?\n  The reason is, these are the corporate entities that keep getting \nasked to contribute and contribute and contribute, that keep feeling as \nif they are dragged into a process that they themselves know is not in \nthe best interests of the democracy of our country.\n  We are supposed to be, as Senator Byrd reminded us in our caucus a \nfew minutes ago, a republic. A republic means we are people who \nrepresent the people who elect us--not the money that puts us here, the \npeople who elect us.\n  The question is, Are we prepared to pass a campaign finance reform \nregime that distances us, to the maximum degree possible, from the \nfundraising and connects us, to the maximum degree possible, to the \npeople who elect us? That is the purpose of this particular amendment.\n  This amendment is voluntary. I emphasize, it is voluntary. There is \nno mandate that anybody in the country has to follow this particular \nway of campaign financing. So there is no constitutional challenge \nhere. You can choose to go in and live by a limit that you are given as \na matching amount of money.\n\n  I want to explain exactly how it works. We want to encourage the \nsmall donor to participate in America again. We want to emphasize that \nit is the smaller contribution that is the most important contribution. \nSo what we do is provide a matching amount of money doubled by the \nFederal Treasury for those small contributions up to $200. That means \nif somebody contributes anywhere up to $200 to a candidate, they would \nget up to $400 in a matching amount of money. And they would agree to \nlive by a specific formula limit for each State in the country. That \nformula is: $1 million, plus 50 cents, times the number of voters in \nthat particular State.\n  We did an analysis of the last two election cycles. When you compare \nthe amounts that would be provided to candidates under this formula, it \ndemonstrates that in only three races in the last cycle would you not \nhave had enough money under this formula to be able to meet what \nhappened in those races. The spending limit formula in 23 States would \nhave provided candidates with more money than they had to go out and \nhock the system in order to be able to run. In an additional seven \nStates, the formula would have brought candidates within $500,000 of \nthe average amount that was spent in the last Senate election in that \nState.\n  Given what we have already passed in McCain-Feingold with respect to \nlowest unit charges, in effect, this formula would allow people to be \nable to spend more, if not the same, because they would be able to get \nmore media buy for the dollars spent; and that result would be that \nthey would be, in fact, greatly advantaged by this kind of formula.\n  What they also allow them to do is: If a candidate is not able to \nraise up to their limit, we allow the parties, through their hard money \ncontributions, to be able to make up the difference to that candidate, \nmuch as they do today through the section 441(a)(d) contributions.\n  The virtue of this particular approach is that it does the most that \nwe believe we can do to separate candidates from the fundraising \nprocess, to reduce the capacity of people to question the large \ncontributions. We would still allow contributions up to the amounts of \nMcCain-Feingold. So if that amount remains $1,000 in the primary and \n$1,000 in the general election, you can still raise it, but you only \nget credit for the first $200 toward your match. That means you would \nbe encouraged to go out and bring people into the system for low-donor-\namounts of contributions.\n  In every other regard we stay with McCain-Feingold. We want to see \nthe ban on the soft money. We want to see the increased scrutiny, \nincreased transparency, but we are trying to provide people with an \nability to avoid the extraordinary arms race of fundraising that takes \nplace in this country and to begin to restore every American's \nconfidence that we are not in hock to the interests that support the \ncampaigns.\n  There is a reason for having to do that. I remember when I was \nchairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 1988. As \nChairman, I refused to take soft money back in 1988. We did not take \nany soft money in the committee. That was the last year the campaign \ncommittee did not take soft money because they could not in order to \ncompete. From that time until now, we have seen this extraordinary \ngrowth in the amount of soft money being raised, so that there was \nalmost $\\1/2\\ billion of soft money in last year's campaigns. Think \nabout that--an extraordinary amount.\n  But for 1992, the Republican Party raised $164 million in hard money, \n$45 million in soft money. In 1996, the $164 million jumped to $278 \nmillion in hard money; and it went from $45 million to $120 million in \nsoft money. And this year, it went from the $278 million to\n\n[[Page S2946]]\n\n$447 million in hard money; and the $120 million went up to $244 \nmillion in soft money. This is so far outside of inflation or any \nlegitimate costs with respect to campaigning, it is insulting. The only \nway we are going to end that is to put in place a system where we bring \nAmericans back into the process of contributing smaller amounts of \nmoney.\n\n  It is interesting that corporate contributions outnumbered the amount \nof small and union contributions by 15 to 1. Americans are currently \nlooking at a political system that is effectively a corporately \nsubsidized, corporately supported system. If you were the leader of any \ncorporation in America--there are a few who are making a different \ndecision--some of them have decided spontaneously they are simply not \ngoing to contribute, but unfortunately, an awful lot of them still \ndecide: I can't be left behind, I can't suffer the vagaries of the \nsystem unless I can weigh in, unless I get sufficient access. So most \nof them, answerable to their board of directors and their shareholders, \nas a result, play the system as hard as they can.\n  Most of them will also tell you privately, they pray and hope the \nSenate will have the courage to change that system because they don't \nlike it any more than many of us do.\n  The one thing we are going to hear from the opponents--and you can \nhear it right now--we have politics that are really good right now in \nusing little phrases: ``It is not the Government's money; it is your \nmoney. You deserve a refund.'' That is a quick, easy hit. People get \napplause. Everybody feels good and they forget about the fact that \nthere are a whole lot of other issues.\n  We are going to hear them say: Gee whiz, politicians shouldn't depend \non the public treasury to run for office. They are going to say this is \nwelfare for politicians, ``welfare for politicians'' because somehow \nthe Federal Government contributes. Ronald Reagan was elected using \nthis Federal money. George Bush, in 1988, was elected using this money. \nEven the current President Bush was elected using Federal money. Bob \nDole ran for President using Federal money. Countless numbers of \ncandidates have run using Federal money.\n  It is not welfare for politicians. What it is is protection for \npoliticians. That is what they want. They are afraid of a system that \nallows the average American to have a full voice. They are afraid of a \nsystem which requires them to go out and do anything except play \nsweetheart with a whole bunch of givers who give them big amounts of \nmoney so they can just swamp the average person who wants to run for \noffice.\n  The fact is, if you analyze the amount of Federal dollars that are \nwasted and spent only because those interests are able to get the laws \nthey want and ride roughshod over a broader consumer interest, there \nare billions upon billions of dollars that are spent as a result of the \ncurrent system.\n  What this represents is liberty money for people in this country, \nfreedom, the ability to be able to cut the cord of the system we have \ntoday and free themselves to be able to go out and have a fair system \nin which Americans can have confidence. Most Americans, if they were \npresented with that argument fair and square, would say: That is \nprecisely what I want. I am willing to pay a $400, $500 amount to cover \nthe cost of elections in this country in order to guarantee that people \nare free from the kind of special interest process today.\n  Moreover, you might see a lot more of your Senator and your \nCongressman because they wouldn't have to travel all around the country \non weekends and weeknights to raise money from fundraisers in States \neverywhere other than their own.\n  It doesn't make sense. That is what this is an effort to try to \nachieve. I hope my colleagues will think hard about it. Fifty-two \nMembers of the Senate in 1994 voted for a bill that had a partial \ncomponent of public funding in it. Many people have acknowledged that \nultimately this is the only way for us to free ourselves from the \ncurrent system. While we can't deal with the primaries, that is too \nexpensive and it doesn't work. What we do is set up a structure where \nin the general election, there is a clear ability of people to spend a \nlimited amount of money, commensurate with the amounts of money and in \nsome cases more than even the amounts they spend today.\n  I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. It seems as though the Senator from Massachusetts and I \nhave been doing this a long time. We lost one of the musketeers in \nSenator Bradley. I don't know how many times we have come to the floor \nto talk about this issue. What is discouraging is, we seem to be moving \nbackwards now instead of forward.\n  I have a reputation that doesn't always serve me well of being \nrelatively blunt. I am going to continue to exacerbate that a little \nbit today and depart from my prepared remarks at the outset and speak \nto the last point the Senator from Massachusetts was talking about.\n  Our friends who oppose this will say to any idea of any public \nfinancing: Why should the public pay for bumper stickers and billboards \nand the like? I will bet you if you sat down with every American, and \nwere able to do it one on one, and said: Here is the deal: Do you want \nme taking money from a checkoff system on your income tax, as the \nPresidential campaign is run, or from a direct appropriation that may \ncost you a couple bucks a year? Would you feel better about me and my \nindependence if you did that and I had a limited amount of money if I \nwere the nominee that I could spend, a limited amount of money based on \nthe size of my State? Or would you rather have me hanging around in \nHollywood, New York, Detroit, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, the \nmajor money centers of the world, sitting down with investment bankers \nand with corporate heads and union leaders and listening to them \ntelling me what they think is important for the future of America and \nmy knowing full well if I disagree with what they think is important \nfor the future of America, that they are not likely to contribute to me \nand, therefore, if I have to rely totally on the people with the big \nmoney, that I may very well find myself rationalizing that, well, maybe \nit is not such a bad idea to be for that idea because it is better for \nme to get elected intact with most of my views in place than it is for \nme to be pure about this and not be able to run. I think the American \npeople understand.\n  I may be mistaken, but I believe Dick Clark, a former Senator from \nIowa, and I, were the first two to introduce public financing as an \nidea back in 1974, in the middle of the Watergate scandal, to try to \ntake polluting influence out of the system--I don't think there is an \nAmerican out there who thinks if they get a chance to come up and lobby \nme on a particular issue and say, Senator, I sure hope you will vote \nfor this tax cut or that tax cut or vote for or against something, that \nthey have as much influence on me as somebody who walks in having \ncontributed $10,000 to my campaign through two PAC contributions. I \nwonder what the American people think. I wonder do they think their \nvoice is as easily heard as the rest of those folks.\n  The thing that has surprised me over the years that I have been \npushing this idea, along with others, is that we who hold public office \naren't tired of this, aren't worried, why it doesn't bother us, whether \nwe are lily pure or not, why it doesn't bother us being associated with \nthe notion that what we do is a consequence of the financial influence \nplaced upon us.\n  For example, I don't think there is anything morally wrong, per se, \nabout PAC money. That is an organization getting together and \nrepresenting a particular interest--whether it is a labor organization, \nbusiness organization, social organization--and giving a candidate \n$5,000 at a crack. I admit that is no more debilitating, no more \nimmoral, no more unsavory than five people getting together in one \nfamily and coming up with $1,000 apiece to give $5,000. But I don't \naccept PAC money, and I haven't accepted PAC money--not because I think \nit is immoral or wrong, and I don't question the morality or judgment \nof those who accept it. I think I am one of the few people who don't \naccept it, and maybe one of the few in the whole Congress.\n  The reason I don't accept it is that I like the fact that no one \ncan--and I am a pro-labor Senator--question my pro-\n\n[[Page S2947]]\n\nlabor votes because labor gives me any money. They don't. I can stand \nup and say I like the feeling at home that when I am for something that \nmaybe not all my constituents like, but labor likes, nobody can use the \nargument that Biden has been bought off by labor because the following \nlabor groups got together and contributed to him X amount of dollars.\n  A lot of Senators who talk about being lily white and pure accept PAC \nmoney. That is OK. But the only reason I don't is I don't like looking \nat my constituents and them thinking that I have taken a position \nbecause somebody contributed to me. That just bothers me. That just \nbothers my independence. There may come a day I have to take PAC money. \nI may run against somebody who raises $5 million in PAC money and I \ncan't raise the money, so I have to take it to compete. But I don't \naccept it simply for my own gratification. I love walking into a \nmeeting with a businessperson, or a business organization, or labor \norganization, and deciding for or against them based on the merits and \nnever having to talk about money. I feel liberated. It is my sort of \nself-imposed, tiny victory against this system that I rail against all \nthe time.\n  What has surprised me is why people of this body would not want \nlimits on spending. Do you think the majority of us like traveling two-\nthirds of the way across the country to sit down at a fundraiser in the \nhome of somebody who is going to ask us stupid questions, who may be an \nabsolute idiot, and is going to raise us $20,000, and we have to sit \nthere and listen. Now I'll have everybody who has ever done a \nfundraiser for me saying, ``Is he talking about me?'' If anybody likes \nthat, you probably should be doing something else because you can't be \nthat bright.\n  So I don't get this. I don't get it. I don't get why we haven't \ngotten to the point that just for our own living standard, so that we \ndon't have to get on planes at 7:30 at night and sit in an airport, and \nthen miss it, and 47 thank-you notes why we could not be there and \napologize and set a new date, and you miss your kid's first communion, \nor you miss your daughter-in-law's birthday, or something because you \nare out raising money. I don't think anybody sitting in here has any \nidea how much of our time is spent raising money. The more scrupulous \nyou are about how you raise it, the more hurdles you place in your way \nto make sure everybody knows that you are clean and you are not like \nwhat people think you are, the harder it is--the harder it is.\n  We all do it. We all sit here and say, wait a minute now; we just \nvoted on a bill that will affect some of the people who are going to be \nthere. I can't go to that fundraiser now. It will look like I did it \nfor the wrong reason. I don't want them thinking that is why I did that \nbecause that is not why I did that. All Members here are moral, decent \npeople. The irony is, this place, in terms of personal rectitude is \nprobably squeakier than any Congress in the last 200 years because of \nall the disclosure rules. That is the irony. You used to have a person \nstanding at a desk right over there--one of the leading Senators in \nhistory--who would write letters to the railroad company saying, ``By \nthe way, I just defeated a thing that would have hurt you. Send more \nmoney or I won't do it next time.'' The money that was being sent was \nin his pocket.\n\n  When I ran for the Senate in 1972 and won, there were no limits on \nwhat you could spend or what could be given to you. My goodness, you \nwould think by now the irony of all ironies is that I would be \ndumbfounded if any Member of this body was taking money under the table \nor doing anything illegal. They are the cleanest bunch I have dealt \nwith. Yet we are viewed as being among the dirtiest bunch. Why? Because \nwe are associated with all this money.\n  My mom had an expression when I was a kid. I would say, ``Mom, can I \ngo hang out on the corner by Buffington's with the rest of the guys?'' \nShe would say, ``Those guys get in trouble.'' And I would say, ``But I \nwon't.'' She would look at me and say, ``Joe, if it walks like a duck \nand quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is a duck.'' I used to \nsay, ``What does that have to do with anything?'' She would say, \n``Those boys down there are not good boys. When you hang with them, \neven if you are not doing anything wrong, you are going to be presumed \nto be.''\n  What happens now when anybody within earshot, not holding public \noffice, hears your child say, ``Mom, I want to be a politician.'' I am \nnot allowed to reference the gallery, but I bet if I looked at their \nexpressions right now, they would all have the same expression: Oh, no, \nno, you don't want to do that. Why, when in fact they have more honest \nmen and women in the business now than have ever have been in it? The \nlikelihood of people doing untoward things relative to financial gain \nis almost unheard of now. When you have a billion plus dollars spent on \nelections, the conclusion to the American people is that if it looks \nlike it is corruption, sounds like it is corrupt, it appears to be \ncorruption, then it is probably corrupt.\n  So this has always amazed me. I would have thought by now that we \nwould be so afraid of being burned by our association, unintentionally, \nwith unsavory notions, causes, or people, through contributions, that \nwe would say let's get out of this. I will tell you right now. I don't \nthink anybody here would disagree. I would rather be beholden, or \nthought to be, to 280 million Americans than to 200 contributors. I \nwould think they would want me to be beholden to them, not only in fact \nbut in perception.\n  So what have we done? As my friend from Massachusetts has said--and \nwe have been allies in this for a long time, and I am a great admirer \nof his--just since 1976, the total congressional campaign spending has \ngone up eightfold. In 1976, the average race for the House of \nRepresentatives cost $87,000. Today, it cost $816,000. Where are you \ngoing to get that money? Where are you going to go for that money? Do \nyou think there is $816,000 worth of folks out there saying: Just \nbecause I love this system, I don't care what your positions are on any \nissues. I just want honorable men and women like you involved, so here \nis a contribution.\n  What do you think? Do you think that is how it happens? You know what \nit is for Senate races? In 1976, the average cost of a Senate race was \n$609,000. Now it is $7 million.\n  So I have gotten to the point where I am even more concerned about \nthe amount than I am about the source--more about the amount than I am \nabout the source. Let me explain that. If, in fact, we are going to \never do anything about the influence of money and the ability of people \nlike me to be able to get involved in politics--I say people like me. \nNo one who ever held State office, no one with any personal fortune or \nmoney, and who has a dubious distinction along with one other Senator \non the floor being listed as one of the poorest men in the Senate.\n  How can a guy like me get involved today knowing that for me to get \nout of the box, I am going to have to raise, even in a tiny State such \nas mine, potentially $4 million to $5 million? How does one start that? \nWhere does one go?\n  Why are we surprised with a lot of millionaires? Do you know what a \nlot of us Democrats do, as Dale Bumpers, one of the best speakers I \nheard on the Senate floor in past years, used to say, in the bosom of \nthe lodge here? Because we cannot match their money, do you know what \nwe do? When we recruit candidates, whom do we look for, I say to the \nSenator from Connecticut? We try to find millionaire Democrats. We try \nto find Democrats who are millionaires to front their own campaigns \nbecause we do not have enough money around to front all the campaigns. \nWe try to find people who are millionaires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask for 5 minutes more.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-four minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the fact of the matter is, we are never \ngoing to make any really fundamental change in the system until we \nadopt the position of setting limits on the total amount of money that \ncan be spent in a single State on a single election.\n  Our approach provides the candidates with partial public financing \nwhen they commit to voluntary limits, and if the other person does not \ncommit to\n\n[[Page S2948]]\n\nthose voluntary limits, then we allow that funding to go up so that \nperson can keep in parity with the person against whom they are \nrunning.\n  It is a simple, basic proposition. By the way, it is complementary to \nthe so-called soft money ban. It is not contrary to, it does not \nundermine it; it is complementary to the ban on soft money.\n  The spending limits for the Senate candidates are different in each \nState based on a rather simple formula that my friend from \nMassachusetts pointed out: A million bucks to start and then, on top of \nthat, 50 cents for each person of voting age in that State. In my State \nof Delaware, that means one could not spend more than $1.3 million. In \na State such as Illinois, where there are 9 million potential voters, \none could spend $5.5 million.\n  I will not go through all the detail beyond that except to say that \nour amendment also includes a provision to counter those last-minute \nsham ads that have become all too common in the closing weeks of \ncampaigns. Our amendment says if your campaign is a victim of one of \nthose drive-by sham ads, you will receive additional public funding to \nenable you to respond to keep you in the game.\n  I have been calling for public financing for congressional campaigns \nfor a very long time, since 1973, my first year in this body. I thought \nWatergate would have been enough to take us to the brink of trying to \ndo something serious about campaigns. We did make some initial progress \nuntil the Supreme Court ruling in Buckley v. Valeo which set everything \non its head, and now here we are back again.\n  The time has come, as my old math teacher would say, to work the \nproblem and to stand at the blackboard until we come up with an answer \nthat will pass the test of public confidence. The amendment we are \noffering today I think passes that test, and I urge all of my \ncolleagues, for once and for all, do something that really will impact \nupon who can run, their ability to stay in the game, the ability to \ncompete and reengender some confidence in the American people.\n  My closing remark is this: We have gotten to the point, as my friend \nfrom Massachusetts pointed out, of businesspeople dreading this funding \nprocess because they get held up for contributions. Beyond that, we \nhave reached a point where, because we have had to become so brazen in \nthe way in which we raise money, those who used to contribute to us who \nnever were brazen in return are now equally brazen, suggesting they \nwant to know more about what we will do before they give us the money.\n  It is a bad system. This could go a long way to changing it. I have \nno hope that it is likely to be adopted this time, but someday--\nsomeday--it will, and I suspect only after some additional major \nscandal occurs. I want to make sure for my own safety's sake I am \nrecorded on the right side of this argument again so no one \nmisunderstands what I think we should be doing.\n  I thank my friend for his leadership, and I thank him for yielding \nthe time he has. I yield back whatever time is remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for his \ncomments. As he said, he started this crusade back when he was elected \nin 1972. We had a high water mark in the Senate when we actually passed \nit. We also had 49 votes at one point in time. We know we are not at \nthat high water mark today for a lot of different reasons.\n  It is very interesting what the Senator just said about \nbusinesspeople. I cited the types of businesspeople who support this--\nmajor executives of major companies in the country. Here is what they \nsaid when they announced it:\n\n       As business leaders, we are . . . concerned about the \n     effects of the campaign finance system on the economy and \n     business. . . . A vibrant economy and well functioning \n     business system will not remain viable in an environment of \n     real or perceived corruption, which will corrode confidence \n     in government and business. . . . In addition, the pressures \n     on businesses to contribute to campaigns because their \n     competitors do so will increase. We wish to compete in the \n     marketplace, not in the political arena.\n\n  I applaud these business leaders for recognizing the truth that a lot \nof the opponents of reform refuse to acknowledge.\n  The fact is that even the Supreme Court in the cases we so often \ncite--Buckley v. Valeo, Colorado, and others, all of those cases--talks \nabout the legitimate right of Congress to try to curb the perception of \ncorruption which they acknowledge on the Supreme Court is a component \nof trying to have good campaign finance reform.\n  What they have deemed to be constitutional, they have deemed to be \nconstitutional partly making the judgment that it was necessary to \ncombat that concept of corruption.\n  Moreover, I point out to my colleagues, sometimes we all know \nCongress does not do what the American people think it should do or \nwant it to do, but the American people want us to put together a better \nsystem. A national survey conducted by the Mellman Group in April last \nyear found that by a margin of 68 percent to 19 percent, voters favored \na proposal that eliminates private contributions, sets spending limits, \nand gives qualifying candidates a grant from a publicly financed \nelection fund.\n  In other words, every time the Congress votes against public funding, \nthe Congress is explicitly denying what the majority of the American \npeople want, which is the capacity to separate the people they elect \nfrom the fundraising process.\n  That same survey found that 59 percent of voters agree that we need \nto make major changes to the way we finance elections. But perhaps the \nmost telling statistic was the fact that overwhelming majorities think \nspecial interest contributions affect the voting behavior of Members of \nCongress.\n  Eighty-seven percent of voters believe that money impacts Members of \nCongress, with 56 percent expressing the belief that it affects Members \na lot. We ought to want to do something to eliminate that perception \nand to restore people's confidence in this institution.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, assuming all the time is used on both \nsides, when would the vote occur?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 5:55 p.m.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. This should be such an easy vote that I don't think I \nwill need all my time. I will withhold it for the moment to see how \nmany speakers there are on the other side. Suffice it to say, that \ntaxpayer funding of elections is about as unpopular as voting to raise \ncongressional pay.\n  We have the most complete poll ever taken on any subject, every April \n15, when taxpayers get an opportunity to check off on their tax return \nthe diversion of $3 to the Presidential campaigns and to help subsidize \nthe conventions. It doesn't add to their tax bill. It is just diverting \n$3 of their tax money to politics.\n  The high water mark of the checkoff was back in 1980 when 29 percent \nof taxpayers checked off. Last year it was 12 percent. In fact, the \nlack of taxpayer interest in checking off some of the tax dollars \nalready owed to this cause, the drop off was so alarming that in the \nearly 1990s when the opposition party controlled the House, the Senate, \nand the Presidency, they upped the checkoff from $1 to $3, so fewer and \nfewer people could check off more money.\n  Clearly, this is an idea that is overwhelmingly unpopular with the \nAmerican people. We had a vote the other day on the Wellstone \namendment. The Wellstone amendment gave States the option of having \ntaxpayer funding of elections of congressional races. It was defeated \n64-36. Maybe you could have argued on that vote that it wasn't really a \nvote for taxpayer funding of elections because it only gave to States \nthe option--the option--to have taxpayer funding of elections, yet only \n36 Members of the Senate supported that.\n  This is the real thing before the Senate now. This is not giving any \nState the option to have a taxpayer-funded system. This is the real \nthing, taxpayer-funded elections for Senate races.\n  I have been somewhat chagrined and mystified that we have spent 2 \nweeks on the whole subject we have been on when the stock market is \ntanking, we have an energy crisis in this country. What are we doing in \nthe Senate? We\n\n[[Page S2949]]\n\nare talking about campaign finance reform. At the very least, the \nunderlying bill didn't have taxpayer funding of elections in it, but \nthere have been first one, and now the second effort to add that to \nthis underlying bill.\n  So I don't think the American people would be particularly amused if \nthey were paying any attention to this debate, which they are not--I \ndon't think they would be particularly amused to find out what we are \ndoing while we have these emerging problems in our country of energy \nand the stock market.\n  The argument over taxpayer funding of elections is a blast from the \npast. This debate over taxpayer financing is an idea whose time has \ncome and gone. One of the huge victories on my side of this debate that \nwe can savor is that reformers gave up on the horrible notion of \ntaxpayer funding of elections some years ago. That is, most of them. We \nstill have some people offering these amendments, and that is what is \nbefore the Senate at the moment.\n  It may surprise some of the people who are watching C-SPAN that we \nactually have had taxpayer financing of Presidential elections since \n1976. This system has squandered over 1 billion tax dollars. In the \n2000 Presidential race alone, taxpayers kicked in $238 million; 30 \nmillion of those dollars went toward the conventions in Philadelphia \nand Los Angeles. Fun weeks for those of us who were privileged to \nattend, but most taxpayers could surely come up with a better use of \ntheir tax dollars than underwriting political conventions.\n  Proponents of using taxpayer money for political campaigns get very \ncreative in devising their polling questions so they can get results \nsuggestive of some reservoir of support for this notion.\n  First off, they never refer to the money as the ``taxpayers money.'' \nYou will never see that in a polling question asked by a proponent of \nusing tax money for buttons and balloons and TV commercials. They \nalways call it ``public funding,'' sort of like a public beach, public \npark, or public parking, leaving out the fact that the money started \nout in the taxpayers' private pockets.\n  Then they link the concept of public financing of campaigns to \nreducing special interest influence. Gee, that sounds like a bargain, \nexcept they can still get their numbers over 50 percent when they call \nit public funding and when they say it is for the purpose of reducing \nthe nasty special interest. We all know the definition of a special \ninterest. That is somebody against what I am trying to do. Those groups \non my side are great Americans pursuing a wonderful cause. Those nasty \nspecial interests are the guys on the other side.\n  When someone such as myself frames a polling question in a more \nstraightforward fashion, such as, do you support using taxpayer dollars \nfor political campaigns--very straightforward and very truthful--\nrespondents are decidedly less receptive than in the gimmicky polls \nthat I suspect we have heard cited on the other side of this debate.\n  A reform group study in 1994 concluded that Americans remain \nskeptical of public funding for congressional campaigns. Remember, they \nwere using that good word ``public.'' Moreover, a careful examination \nof the core coalitions both in favor and against leads us to conclude \nthat this proposal tends to be a hot button for a group that is not \nexactly a microcosm of America. Who is interested in this issue of \ntaxpayer funding of elections when you call it ``public funding''? It \nis a hot-button issue for liberals who are postgraduates, people who \nwent to graduate schools. Liberals who graduated from graduate school \nthink this is a great issue, that is, about 2 percent of the public--\nnot, I submit, a microcosm of America or anywhere near the average \nAmerican.\n  When we look at the biggest poll of all that I referred to earlier, \nthe checkoff on the 1040 tax forms which allows filers to divert $3 \nfrom the U.S. Treasury to the Presidential election campaign funds--\nremember, this is money they already owe; if you ever change the law to \nmake people actually cough up an additional $3, this fund would \ndisappear entirely. It would be gone with the wind. It would be out of \nhere. We would have to appropriate dollars to make up for the zero \nbalance in this fund--nearly 90 percent of Americans choose not to \ncheck yes to the use of taxpayer dollars for Presidential elections. \nLast year's forms, 11.8 percent checked ``yes.''\n  As I said earlier, at its peak popularity in 1980, less than 30 \npercent checked yes. Imagine the results if the checkoff was for a \ncongressional election campaign fund, which is what this amendment is \nabout. Imagine the question on the tax form if it were crafted \n``congressional election campaign fund.'' People would not confine \nthemselves to checking no. They would no doubt be compelled to include \ncommentary in the margins on their tax returns. Such is the disdain for \ntaxpayer funding of elections.\n  We haven't even gotten to another essential part of this whole issue. \nThe Supreme Court does not allow us to just provide tax funding to the \ngood guys, the Republicans and the Democrats. No, no. If you are going \nto provide tax dollars for campaigns, you can't constitutionally limit \nthose taxpayer-funded schemes to the Republicans and to the Democrats--\nwhich is all of us in here. No, the Reform Party, Ralph Nader's Green \nParty, and for that matter, any individual eager for some name \nidentification paid for by the taxpayers would be eligible to qualify.\n  Let me give a couple of examples. That great American, Lenora Fulani, \nof many parties over the years, and most recently the Reform Party, has \ncollected 3.5 million of our tax dollars for her in 1984, 1988, and \n1992 Presidential campaigns. The taxpayers of America have given Lenora \nFulani $3.5 million to run for President of the United States.\n\n  In 1992, in fact, Ms. Fulani was the first in line to receive \nmatching funds, even beating Bill Clinton to the funds.\n  Lyndon LaRouche got taxpayer funds for the 1992 Presidential \ncampaign. It was a little difficult for him to function that year \nbecause he was in jail. It was something of an inconvenience. But the \nfact that he was in jail did not prevent him from getting tax dollars \nto run for President. He was in the middle of serving a 15-year \nsentence for fraud. But, by golly, we got him some tax money to run for \nPresident of the United States.\n  Imagine, if we extend this great idea to congressional races, we are \ngoing to have Lenora Fulanis and Lyndon LaRouches running in every \nHouse and Senate race in America. Every crackpot who got up in the \nmorning, looked in the mirror, and said, ``By golly, I think I see a \nCongressman,'' is going to get a subsidy from the taxpayers to go out \nand see if he can pull this thing off.\n  LaRouche has received over $2 million for his 1980, 1984, 1988, and \n1992 Presidential campaigns. If you take out the 2 percent of Americans \nwho are liberal postgraduates, there is not a lot of enthusiasm out in \nthe hinterlands for this kind of reform. Indeed, there is disdain for \nthis kind of reform. I suspect there is not a whole lot of support in \nthe Senate.\n  Looking at the Wellstone amendment the other day, which got 36 votes, \nmaybe I will be surprised, but I will be surprised if there are 36 \nvotes there to have this proposal replace the current system of \nelecting Members of Congress.\n  Let me say again, I can't think of anything that would frost the \naverage taxpayer more than the idea of fringe candidates, maybe even in \njail, running for Congress, running for the House and Senate.\n  I do not know how this amendment is crafted, but I can tell you, you \ncannot constitutionally restrict public funds, taxpayer funds, to just \nthe people we would like to get it, which is people such as us who are \nRepublicans or Democrats. We can't do that. It has to be crafted in \nsuch a way that these funds are not unreasonably denied to people who \naspire, regardless of their ideas or present circumstance, such as \nbeing in jail--their present circumstance--you cannot unreasonably deny \nthem their opportunity to have their say with our tax money.\n  I do not know how much more debate is needed on this idea from the \npast. But, not knowing yet, I will just retain the remainder of my time \nfor the moment. How much is that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 76 minutes.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S2950]]\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I listened with interest to my colleague \nfrom Kentucky. I listened to him label this as an idea from the past. I \nam interested in that because it always struck me that the idea of the \npast was the perception of corruption of the Congress. The idea that \nought to be passed is the notion that unlimited funds and unlimited \namounts of money in our system corrupt and corrode the system.\n  If you were to ask the American people what they would like to see be \nthe idea of the past, they would resoundingly, overwhelmingly tell you, \nas they have in every indication in the country, that they want us \nseparated from these large sums of money.\n  It is no surprise my opponent comes to the floor and derides the \nconcept of public funding as some sort of thing from the past which \ndoesn't command a lot of votes. I understand that. I know we are not \ncoming to the floor from a great position of strength. But we have to \nstart from somewhere again on this effort.\n  We once passed it in the Senate, and we passed it once because it was \nthe right thing to do and it was a good idea. I believe that the \njudgment made by those Senators who were then here is not now out of \ndate; it is not now outmoded; it is not a judgment of the past. It was \nsound thinking. Once again, this body will one day come to understand \nthat we need to separate ourselves from this money.\n  Senator McCain above all set a standard for making clear that this is \nan idea of now, not of the past. My colleague does not even support \ncampaign finance reform. He doesn't think McCain-Feingold ought to \npass, let alone this amendment. It is no surprise he comes to the floor \nderisive about the concept of some level of public money being used to \nseparate the politicians from the perceptions that cloud this \ninstitution.\n  My colleague from Kentucky brought an amendment a few years ago, with \nother people, I believe, to terminate the funding process of the \nPresidential races. Guess what. He lost. The Senate said we want to \ncontinue to have our Presidential races funded the way they are, even \nif it means that a fringe candidate such as a Lyndon LaRouche may get a \ncouple of million dollars to run for office. That is the price in \nAmerica of having a system that is free from special interests. That is \nthe price.\n  The fact is, none of us can choose and pick who the candidates are. \nMy colleague from Kentucky just acknowledged he does not know how this \nbill is structured. Maybe it would help him if he understood to some \ndegree that it is structured in a way that not just anybody can run \nunder this bill. You do not get the public funding unless you raise \nsome money, and you can only raise some money if you have some kind of \nbase of support. You only get some funding for the larger numbers of \npeople you can entice to support you. So presumably there is a \nreflection in how much money you would ultimately get that is a \nreflection of what kind of candidate you are--whether you come with \nlegitimacy or you do not come with legitimacy; otherwise, you are not \ngoing to get much.\n  Second, contrary to what my friend from Kentucky said, we do not \nmandate this on anybody. If you do not want to do this, you do not have \nto do this. If you are more content to go out and raise millions of \ndollars from all the interests, go do it. This system is only for those \nwho choose to live by the limits. But the one differential would be \ninvolved if some multimillionaire is running against you, or someone \nwants to go out and court all the other interests and get $50,000, \n$150,000 at a whack, and have ads run that are completely outside of \nwhat even the 1974 election reforms tried to achieve. We are driving \nthrough the largest loophole we have ever seen in this process. I \nregret to say that began in 1996--not before. But the fact is, we have \nads run under the guise of being issue ads that everybody knows are \ndirected to either tear down someone's character or argue against their \nelection. They are completely outside the mainstream of the election, \nexcept to the degree that they have a profound impact on it.\n\n  What we are really talking about is whether or not you want to have a \nvoluntary system where, if somebody is spending those extraordinary \namounts of money, you get to raise an additional amount by virtue of \nthe public system.\n  I do not expect somebody who does not believe in any kind of campaign \nfinance reform, who thinks we ought to have more money in the system, \nnot less, and who equates money exclusively with the determination of \nelections and power--I do not expect that person to support or like \nthis amendment.\n  I guarantee that over a period of time, as Americans continue to be \ndisenchanted, as Senator McCain's campaign so aptly showed--and the \nreason Senator McCain's so aptly showed it is that what he did was he \nconnected the dots for people. People want prescription drugs in \nMedicare. People want health maintenance organizations to be \naccountable to them. They want to know a doctor will make a medical \ndecision about their potential illness or real illness if they have \none. What Senator McCain did was show them the reason they do not get a \nlot of these things that they want is that the money manages to \ncompletely cloud the issues and real choices.\n  Americans are subjected to this cacophony of funding which, frankly, \ncrowds out even the voices of the candidates themselves in many cases. \nThat is what this is about, a voluntary system giving people choice, \nallowing them to make up their own minds.\n  What are my colleagues so afraid of? What are they afraid of? That \nanother candidate might have the voluntary choice to decide to do this? \nThey don't have to do it. What are they afraid of? There is far more \ntaxpayers' dollars spent and wasted as a result of the campaign system \nwe have today than this system would cost any American.\n  Senator McCain always talks about an aircraft carrier being built \nthat the Navy did not ask for. That aircraft carrier alone would fund \n10 years of election cycles under this bill--that one alone. How many \ndifferent examples are there of things that get passed because of the \nmoney in politics, not because the voice of the American people asked \nfor it?\n  He talks about the $3 checkoff. Yes, he is right. The $3 checkoff has \ndiminished. But has anybody in America seen an advertisement asking \nthem to participate? Has anyone in America had any kind of public input \nsuggesting to them that if they were to check off, they could have a \nsystem that is perception-corruption free? The answer is no. We do not \nadvertise. We do not ask accountants to suggest to their clients that \nthey ought to check it off. There has been no effort whatsoever to try \nto bring Americans into the process of participation.\n  I will tell you, for most Americans who look at the system the way it \nis today, it is no wonder they do not check it off because they have no \nsense of the connection of that system to the potential that they would \nbe participating in something that actually works and that is free and \nclear from the kind of cloud they see today.\n  I know the Senator from Washington wants to speak. How much time \nwould the Senator like?\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I will be short.\n  I am in support of my colleagues and in support of the Kerry-Biden-\nWellstone-Cantwell amendment. I want to make three points today about \nthis amendment.\n  First, as you have heard earlier in the debate, it is an addition to \nMcCain-Feingold. We are trying to ban soft money, limit out of control \nissue ads, and increase disclosure on independent expenditures. But we \nalso want to give candidates the opportunity to try a system that will \nfree them, their time and their energy, to focus on the issues of the \npeople.\n  Second, counter to some of the things that have been said on the \nfloor today, this is a system that is supported by whom? Not just a few \nMembers of the Senate; it is supported by business.\n  You have heard some of the CEO's and officials of the businesses that \nare part of this Committee for Economic Development, the CED. Why are \nthey supporting such an amendment? Because they understand the world\n\n[[Page S2951]]\n\naround us is changing, that they live in an information age, and that \nas they make better decisions, with more information and a more-\ninformed public, they would like to see a better decision making \nprocess in the Senate.\n  Those businesses that have joined this effort to try to reform our \npolitical system, and to have a better decision making process, include \nNortel, State Farm, Bear Stearns, the Frank Russell Company, the Vista \nCorporation of Spokane, Allied Signal, GTE, Dow Chemical--a variety of \npeople who are not just a bunch of Members of the Senate.\n  This is a movement grabbing hold in businesses across America because \nthey know our decisionmaking process is flawed. And this will only grow \nif this amendment is defeated, and we will see this organization and \nits supporters back again.\n\n  The third point that I would like to make is that this is in the best \ninterest of the taxpayers. Do not be fooled. The discussion has been \nthat if you vote for public financing, that is a vote for the public's \npaying for this process. That somehow it is going to cost them in their \npocketbook.\n  We have heard a lot about the Presidential system and the checkoff. \nBut I would ask you to think for a minute, how much is this system \ncosting us when we do not get a prescription drug bill? How much does \nit cost senior citizens who live on a fixed income, who have to pay \nthousands of dollars a year for prescription drugs? Because we have \nbeen smart enough to figure out the new technologies for new drug \ntherapies--smart enough to figure that out in a new information age--\nbut not smart enough to make prescription drugs affordable.\n  Why is that? Because our campaign system does not reward that kind of \nthinking. It rewards a very short-term decision making process that \ndoes not discuss the fact that prescription drugs have become 30 \npercent of our overall health care costs, not 5 percent as they were 10 \nor 15 years ago. That is what is wrong with the decision making \nprocess.\n  The fact that we do not have a Patients' Bill of Rights, the fact \nthat we do not spend the time and energy debating a real Patients' Bill \nof Rights and getting that issue before the Congress in a more \naggressive way, and coming to terms and bringing the amendments and \nalternatives to the floor. That failure costs citizens of our country \nreal personal and great hardships. This issue of whether it involves \nthe public, I can tell you, it is costing us by not reforming our \nsystem.\n  What this amendment does today is to try to curb the amount of \nspending in our political campaigns and set limits. And it does so in a \nvery reasonable way, while at the same time giving people the \nopportunity to get their message out and to participate in the system \nas they so wish.\n  I have learned a lot in the last weeks about how deep the cynicism in \nWashington is when it comes to discussing campaign finance reform. I am \ndeeply committed to overcoming that cynicism and getting a whole \ngeneration of young people to take up this torch and change this system \nas opposed to thinking that government today is not as efficient in \ndealing with its issues.\n  But until we craft a campaign system with a shorter, more intensive \ncampaign period, funded with finite and equal resources available to \ncandidates, we will not govern well. Instead, the American public will \nbe subject to the kind of campaigning, the kind of special interest ads \ndeluging them in their living rooms with the discussions, not by the \ncandidates, but by these interest groups of what your choices in \nAmerica should be.\n  I am saying, follow the money back to the citizens of this country. \nNot until we have freed candidates from the time and energy drained \nfrom dialing for dollars will we improve the political discourse, play \ndown the dominance of polls, and render the attack-driven, negative 30-\nsecond spots ineffective.\n  I think that day will come. I hate to wait until we have Internet \nvoting, and an information age where citizens will look at all this \ninformation and find out exactly, in great detail, what their Senators \nand Members have been working on. I hope we can get it done sooner than \nthat.\n  I commend Senator Kerry and the other sponsors--Senators Biden and \nWellstone for their long-term vision on this issue because it is a \nvision that is headed in the right direction and it has articulated a \nbetter vision for campaign finance reform.\n\n  This amendment would make a real difference in how campaigns in this \ncountry are conducted. I hope, as the CED and Members join in this \neffort, we can reach a bipartisan consensus to take a step forward in \ncurbing the spending and improving the participation in our campaign \nsystem in America.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield myself a moment that I need, and then I will yield \nto my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for her support \nand for her comments and her understanding of the implications of this \ndebate.\n  Let me point out to colleagues--and I emphasize--this does not change \nMcCain-Feingold at all, No. 1. It embraces everything that is in \nMcCain-Feingold. No. 2, it is purely voluntary. But, importantly, \ncolleagues should note, 23 States in this country already have some \nform of public funding.\n  In the last few years, several States--Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, \nI think Arizona--have moved to embrace something called Clean \nElections, which have an even lower threshold than what I am supporting \ntoday.\n  I support the Clean Elections. Senator Wellstone and I have been \nadvocates of it. But what we are coming in with is something that has \nbroader bipartisan support, where businesses across the country--350 \nmajor business leaders and corporations--say: We have had enough of \nthis other system. Here is a way we think is fair that encourages small \ncontributions, encourages citizen participation, and provides some \nmeasure of public funding.\n  So I think the trend with the public in America is to move in this \ndirection. I think that further counters the idea that this is somehow \nan old idea.\n  This is passing in States, and inevitably it is going to continue as \na grassroots State movement where, once again, Washington, unless we \nchange, is going to be not leading but following the American people.\n  How much time would the Senator from Connecticut like?\n  Mr. DODD. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished manager of the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \nup to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a \ncosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Biden, Senator Wellstone, and our new Member, Senator Cantwell. \nI didn't hear all of the statements, but I listened to several of them. \nI was impressed with their astuteness and their level of articulation \nin support of this proposal.\n  This amendment, as my colleague from Kentucky knows, is not going to \npass. We don't have the votes for this amendment. The Senator from \nMassachusetts was fully aware of that the moment he stood up and \noffered the amendment. Unfortunately, that is the case. It doesn't \ndiminish the rationale or reason for offering the amendment and asking \nour colleagues to consider it and informing the American public about \nthe value this amendment offers.\n  Let me step back a little and make two points. The details of this \namendment have already been discussed. I think my colleagues and others \nmay be aware of specifically how the amendment would work. It is a \npartial public financing program. As the Senator from Massachusetts has \npointed out, some 23 States--almost half of the States--now have \nadopted some variation of this approach. The trend lines are clearly in \nthis direction.\n  We are not alone in the world. Most sophisticated allies of ours, the \nmost sophisticated democracies, industrialized nations around the \nglobe, have also adopted partial public financing, not asking people to \ncontribute more in taxation but a part of what they have contributed to \nsupport the underlying efforts of sustaining democratic institutions.\n\n[[Page S2952]]\n\n  Let me make two points that have some value. One is, the reason this \nis necessary is that the Supreme Court has ruled that money is speech. \nJustice Stevens argued in a minority opinion back in 1974 that money \nwas property, not speech. I agree with Justice Stevens. But he was of \nthe minority view when the Court ruled on Buckley v. Valeo. For that \nsimple conclusion that money is speech, we have been running this \nprocess out over the years where our ability to have some limitations \non the amount of dollars that are spent and raised in seeking Federal \noffice is significantly jeopardized because of the constitutionality of \nsuch provisions.\n  In the absence of having some public financing, we have had now for \nsome 25 years public financing of our Presidential elections. Every \nsingle candidate for the Presidency, every prevailing candidate for the \nPresidency--beginning with Gerald Ford through Ronald Reagan, through \nGeorge Bush 1 and 2, Bill Clinton--has taken public money. No greater \nconservative than Ronald Reagan took public money to run for the \nPresidency because, under that scheme, we could limit to some degree \nthe amount that would be spent.\n  I know we have spent a lot of money on races. I hate to think of what \nthe cost would have been in the absence of the public financing \narrangement which every candidate has accepted, almost without \nexception, since 1976.\n  What the Senator from Massachusetts and those of us who are \nsupporting his efforts are suggesting is that if it has worked fairly \nwell in Presidential contests, if it is working fairly well in 23 \nStates, if it is working fairly well in major democracies around the \nworld, is it such a radical idea to slow down the money chase of \nmultimillion-dollar campaigns to try something along the lines the \nSenator from Massachusetts is suggesting? I think not.\n  This is a modest proposal. In the absence of the constitutional \namendment that our friend from South Carolina offered, which would say \nthat money is not speech and amend the Bill of Rights--which many of \nour colleagues are reluctant to do, and I understand that; I happen to \nsupport him out of frustration because I don't know of any other means \nby which we can begin to try to slow down this exponentially growing \nfoot race to gather the millions of dollars to run for Federal office--\nin the absence of that, this is the only other way I know that we are \nreally going to make some difference in what is a growing and serious \nproblem in this country, where the cost of running for public office is \ngoing way beyond the means and reach of average citizens.\n\n  As Senator Kerry has pointed out--I don't recall exactly the numbers, \nbut roughly several hundred thousands of dollars, $300,000 to $400,000 \non an average Senate race 25 years ago to around $7 million today--the \ncost has gone from some $400,000 to $7 million in the last 25 years, \nwith no end in sight. How many Americans can even think about running \nfor the Senate or the House of Representatives, where the factor of \nincrease is almost the same?\n  This amendment is necessary. It is a reasonable one and one that is \nworthy of support.\n  The second thing I will mention about this: I heard my good friend \nfrom Kentucky talk about the diminishing response of the public to the \ncheckoff system on the 1040 forms that has gone from a high of 29 \npercent down to some 12 percent. That is troubling. I believe it has \nless to do with the fact that there is a checkoff on public financing \nfor Presidential races than the fact that those of us in public life \nare so devaluing public service, are so devaluing those who dedicate \npart of their lives or years of their lives to public service, that we \ndemean it. We ridicule it. We attack each other every year.\n  I am surprised there is any support left. If you were to transfer \nwhat we do to each other in the public debate in this country to the \nprivate sector, you would destroy most competing businesses.\n  Someone once drew the analogy of comparing what would happen to \nMcDonald's or Burger King if they engaged in campaigns against each \nother, competing for market share, with what we do as Democrats and \nRepublicans in competing with each other for the right to represent \nthem in public office. Someone suggested not only would they destroy \neach other, they would destroy franchised food.\n  If you look at campaign advertising, the attacks we wage against each \nother, the personal degradation we attach to and associate with our \npolitical competitors, what has happened is, we have so devalued public \nservice and the public life of elected office that the public has \nbecome understandably disgusted with the condition of politics in \nAmerica. We have no one to blame for that but ourselves. In no small \nmeasure that has occurred because of the rising amount of dollars that \nare spent being convinced by political consultants that the best way to \nwin office is not to convince anyone of the merits of your argument but \nif you can convince people that your opponent is somehow unworthy of \neven consideration for the office, let alone that his ideas or her \nideas may lack substance, then you can win a seat in the Congress of \nthe United States.\n  Thus we see, as we did last year, where, of the 200 million eligible \nvoters in America, only 50 percent voted; 100 million Americans cast \ntheir ballots for the Presidency of the United States, a decision that \nwas made by a handful of votes in one State, and 100 million of our \nfellow citizens did not even show up on election day, where a tiny \nfraction, had they shown up in one State, would have resulted in a \ndifferent outcome than what occurred as a result of the recounts and so \nforth that occurred in the State of Florida.\n  I suspect that a good portion of that 100 million didn't show up \nbecause they forgot or because they had something better to do that \nday.\n  I suspect a substantial portion didn't show up because they are \ndisgusted with the process; they are sick and tired of coming into \nSeptember and October after an election year and you can't turn on a \nsingle bit of programming without some mudslinging going on, attacking \nof one another, blistering one another. Whether it is through our own \nads, or the ads of outside groups just trying to destroy the \nreputations of people seeking public life, I suspect that has more to \ndo with the declining numbers of people checking off on the 1040 forms, \nthe resource to support Presidential public financing.\n  One of the reasons why McCain-Feingold deserves support, in my view, \nis because there is some hope that this will put the brakes on, slow \nthis down enough so we don't have an unending exponential growth of \ndollars pouring into the coffers of candidates and groups out there \nyear in and year out, destroying not only the candidates, but the \npublic's confidence in a political system that has contributed greatly \nto this great Nation over 200 years.\n  For those reasons, I applaud what the Senator from Massachusetts has \noffered. It is a worthwhile effort. I regret that he has to even go \nthis route, but in the absence of it there is not much hope that we can \ndo anything else in terms of getting the real numbers down. For those \nreasons, I support this amendment and urge its adoption.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 18 \nminutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me begin by thanking the Senator from Connecticut. He \nhas been at this for a long time. He has a voice of enormous \ncredibility on the subject, and he is well respected around the country \nfor his political wisdom and abilities. I think his voice is an \nimportant one, and I welcome it.\n  Very quickly--and then I will yield some time to the Senator from \nMinnesota--when we talk about these perceptions, I am not going to \nthrow names around at all, but I mentioned earlier prescription drugs \nand some of the health care issues. If you look at what the drug \nindustry spent in the last Congress--$8.7 million on political \ncontributions--the result in the 106th Congress was no prescription \ndrugs for seniors. But it is interesting, the industry got an extension \nof the R tax credit for those companies.\n  Most Americans would say: That is kind of interesting; I thought I \nhad an interest in getting something, but they got it. Likewise, the \njuvenile justice bill doesn't happen because the gun lobby doesn't like \nthe restrictions on gun show sales. The gun lobby spent $3.9 million in \npolitical contributions in the last cycle. Interestingly enough, the \njuvenile justice bill died in conference.\n\n[[Page S2953]]\n\n  You can go down a long list of these things. They may or may not be \nconnected, but the perception among the American people is very clear.\n  Without using any names at all, let me point out contributions from \nthe oil and gas industry. Three or four of the major proponents of oil \nand gas interests in the Senate received in the last cycle $129,921; \none received $146,779, another $286,000. But it is very interesting. \nOther people who were not so interested in the issue got figures in the \nrange of $1,500, $1,075. That kind of a range sends a message to the \nAmerican people about the impact of money in the system.\n  Mr. President, it is precisely the perceptions--leave alone \nrealities--of that kind of connection that distorts our existence and \nour ability to have the confidence of the American people.\n\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for \nup to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Kerry and Senator \nBiden and say I am proud to be an original cosponsor on this amendment.\n  My colleague has described the amendment, a 2-to-1 match for up to \n$200 worth of contributions. This is the public financing part that is \nin exchange for agreed-upon spending limits. I want to make two or \nthree points in less than 5 minutes.\n  First, very soon we are going to have an amendment to dramatically \nincrease hard money spending limits. The argument is that we really \nneed to do this. As Senator Dodd said earlier this morning, poor \nSenators, gee whiz, we need to be able to raise more money. There is \nnothing like that. When you do that, you are more beholden. It is the \nobscene money chase. You are more beholden to big money.\n  Most people in the country believe big money can pay so they can \nplay, but they can't pay so they can't play. This amendment Senator \nKerry has talked about, and Senator Biden spoke about, takes us into a \ndifferent direction. Candidates agree to spending limits, and you have \nsmaller contributions. You get your support from a lot of folks, little \nfolks, middle class people. What a better politics it is. It is an \nelection and a politics in which people can more believe.\n  The second point is, if you view this as a system--and I don't like \nsaying this because I am an incumbent. But I think it is wired for \nincumbents. Most people agree that, by and large, that is true. If you \nwant to move toward a more level playing field, in that direction, some \nsystem of voluntary, agreed-upon spending limits for public financing \nreally gives the challengers and the people who aren't as well known a \nmuch better chance.\n  It is important to have competitive elections in a representative \ndemocracy. I can just tell you, remembering back to 1990--and Senator \nKerry can go back to his first race--I certainly remember when it felt \nas if when people didn't know you or think you had a chance and you \ncould hardly raise any money, there was no kind of system that would \ngive you a chance. We lucked out. I won because of my good looks and \nbrilliance. If not for that, I would have lost.\n  I got the Presiding Officer's attention on that. I am kidding.\n  The third point I want to make is that I believe this amendment, if \nit were part of the McCain-Feingold bill, would be another one of those \nreform amendments. I hope colleagues will vote for it. I think it is so \nmuch a better way of having people believe in the process. It is so \nmuch a better way of making sure lots of people think they can run for \noffice as opposed to only a few. It is a better way of having people \nbelieve that these elections belong to them and believe they are more a \npart of politics.\n  I have heard my friend from Kentucky say more than once that any kind \nof public financing is ``food stamps for politicians.'' That, again, \npresupposes that elections belong to politicians. They don't. They \nbelong to the people in our States, to the people in the country.\n  This is a very good amendment. This is a strengthening amendment, and \nit is a very important vote. I hope we will have a strong vote for this \nKerry amendment. I am very proud to be an original coauthor. I thank my \ncolleague for allowing me to speak on this amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota. He is \none of those who doesn't just talk about these things; he really \npractices it. Everybody in the Senate respects the depth of his \ncommitment to reform and the principles that guide him in politics. I \nam very pleased to have him as a cohort in this endeavor.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 11 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are nearing the end of this debate. I \nwill take a couple minutes to summarize a few thoughts. I will then \nreserve the remainder of the time. I understand Senator McCain may be \ncoming to the floor.\n  I emphasize to my colleagues that this is voluntary. It is absolutely \nvoluntary. No one is mandated to live by this or to accept it. It \nsimply gives candidates an option of being able to choose a different \nway of trying to be elected to high public office. It does so in a way \nthat maximizes the effort to pull our fellow citizens who have less \namounts of income, who have less capacity to influence the system into \nparticipating.\n  It encourages small contributions. It provides a match only for the \ncontribution up to $200. Therefore, if you want to raise a large sum of \nmoney or even receive a large sum of money from the Federal Government, \nyou have to include a lot of people in your campaign.\n  What it does ultimately is end the extraordinary spiral of higher and \nhigher amounts of money governing the elections in our country, the \nstaggering increases of each election.\n  When I first ran for office, it was about $2.5 million or $3 million. \nMy last race was $13 million. That is why we see so many millionaires \nrunning, so many self-funded campaigns.\n  What we try to do is allow an adjustment against the self-funded \ncandidate. We do not preclude a millionaire who wants to run for office \nand spend his or her money from doing so. There is no restraint \nwhatsoever on somebody doing that, but what we try to do is level the \nplaying field a little bit for that person who does not have the \nmillions of dollars so their voice can also be heard in American \npolitics.\n  Most Americans would like to see a Senate that is more reflective of \nAmerica, that has more people who have varied experiences and who \nreflect more of the life and real concerns and aspirations of our \nNation.\n  It is important for us to move to reflect that Americans have a right \nto elect Senators the same way they elect the President of the United \nStates: by freeing them from the extraordinary burden of having to \nraise these large sums of money from those most interested in what we \ndo, when we do it, and how we do it.\n  I do not know one colleague who had an advertisement run against them \nor who lost an election because they voted for this in 1994 or because \nthey voted for this in 1986. I do not ever recall it being raised in \ncampaigns in this country.\n  The notion of voting for a voluntary system for people to participate \nin an election, the same way we elect the President of the United \nStates, that that would somehow trip them up in their reelection, is \nabsurd and completely unproven in the process. I reserve the remainder \nof my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat the time be charged against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is no particular need to prolong \nthis debate. I want to make a couple observations.\n  It has been suggested that because Republican candidates accepted \ntaxpayer funds to run for President, that is somehow an endorsement. It \nis noteworthy that President Reagan always\n\n[[Page S2954]]\n\nchecked ``no'' proudly on his tax return on the notion of using \ntaxpayer funding for Presidential elections. The reason he accepted the \nmoney is because he really did not have a choice, as a practical \nmatter, since the contribution limit was set at $1,000. All of his \nadvisers told him there was simply no way, not enough time to pool \ntogether enough funds at $1,000 per person to opt out of the \nPresidential system.\n\n  President Reagan, were he able to observe the last election, would \nhave been proud that our now President, George W. Bush, was able, \nduring the primary season where there is enough time to reach large \nnumbers of $1,000-and-under donors, to refuse to accept the spending \nlimits and the taxpayer funding prior to the convention.\n  Knowing the President as I do, if there had been enough time between \nthe convention and the general election to have avoided taking taxpayer \nfunds, I am confident he would then, too.\n  The problem is, when you have a contribution limit of $1,000 a \nperson, and your convention ends around August 1, there is just not \nenough time to pool together enough resources to run for President.\n  It is not appropriate to suggest that the Republican Presidents, at \nleast the two I have mentioned, endorse the idea of taxpayer funding of \nelections; certainly not for House and Senate races.\n  The other point I want to make is there was some suggestion that \nlarge segments of the business community--there was some discussion \nabout the underlying bill--that large segments of the business \ncommunity were supporting McCain-Feingold. That is clearly not the \ncase. I am only aware of one fringe group that supports the underlying \nbill. All the major business organizations oppose the bill: the Chamber \nof Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National \nAssociation of Business PACs, and BIPAC, which is widely known. All the \nmainline business organizations oppose McCain-Feingold, and any \nsuggestion to the contrary is not accurate.\n  I do not know who else may want to speak against the amendment. I \nknow Senator Feingold probably supports the principle but opposes the \namendment and wants to speak.\n  I see Senator Thompson is here. We have not had a lot of speakers on \nthis side. I think it is because just about everybody on this side has \nmade up their mind on this amendment. Does the Senator from Tennessee \nwant to speak against the amendment?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. No.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is Senator Feingold going to speak \nagainst the amendment? How much time does he need?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized for \nup to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I was candid with the Senator that I \nwould be opposing the amendment even though I agree with the \nprinciples, and I will use some of my time to speak about the bill \ngenerally.\n  I think the amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts is \nabsolutely the right policy. I have always believed completely in \npublic financing, and the mechanism proposed in this amendment is the \nway we should go.\n  I have also taken note of the enormous amount of interest around the \ncountry in moving toward public financing in a number of States. \nSenator Kerry is right; this is a new beginning on this issue. It is \nnot an old issue that has died. It is a rebirth that is occurring \nacross the country, and the Kerry-Biden amendment is an important step \nin that direction.\n  When Senator McCain and I began this process, coming to the final \nstages of trying to debate this bill, we agreed we would vote together \non all amendments to make sure we show we are unified and that this \nwill continue to be a bipartisan issue. So it is particularly painful \nfor me to have to vote against this amendment, but it is not because I \ndo not think it is the wave of the future and the ultimate solution to \nthis problem.\n  All the McCain-Feingold bill does is close an enormous loophole that \nhas made a mockery of our campaign finance system. It is the idea and \nprinciple behind the Kerry amendment that is ultimately the direction \nwe have to go as a country in campaign finance reform. I hope we can \nget started on it the day after we get this bill through.\n  I want to talk about one other issue to which the Senator from \nWashington, Ms. Cantwell, alluded. The time has come to talk about \ncommonsense and conventional wisdom in the business community. It is \ncommon sense to declare our campaign finance system is broken and needs \nto be fixed. It is conventional wisdom, however, to say members of the \nbusiness community must surely and monolithically oppose changes to the \ncampaign finance reform system that has made influence available to \nthem.\n  The common sense is right, but the conventional wisdom is wrong. Let \nus take a look at three items in last week's news.\n  First, we see the release of a list of names of 307 of our most \nprominent business leaders who have pledged their support for the \ncampaign finance proposals of the Committee for Economic Development, \nCED. CED is an organization of prominent business leaders which has \nendorsed the McCain-Feingold bill and issued its own proposal that \nincludes a soft money ban. This list of business leaders is a who's who \nof America's commerce. It includes CEOs and current or former top \nexecutives from Dow Chemical, Sara Lee, Motorola, Goldman Sachs, FMC, \nPrudential, and dozens of others.\n  Here is what CED President Charles Kolb had to say:\n\n       As reform nears, the inside-the-beltway cottage industry is \n     scrambling to oppose action, but this list provides real \n     evidence that a growing number of business leaders want \n     reform. They don't fear reform, but think it's desperately \n     needed. They are the leading funders of campaigns, and \n     they're tired of being hit-up for ever-increasing amounts of \n     cash. They know the system--or lack of one--is hurting the \n     business community and our democracy.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this list of business leaders and the \naccompanying release be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Business leaders have common sense and they are \nchanging the conventional wisdom about the need for real campaign \nfinance reform.\n  Look at the second item, the results of a poll of hundreds of senior \nexecutives conducted for CED. In the poll leaders of companies with \nannual revenues of $500 million or more overwhelmingly supported the \nprovisions of our bill, including strong support for a soft money ban.\n  The poll, conducted for CED by the respected Tarrance Group included \nthese findings: three in five top business executives back a soft money \nban; 74 percent say business leaders are pressured to make big \ncontributions. Half said they ``fear adverse consequences'' if they \nrefuse to contribute; more than 80 percent said that corporations give \nsoft money for the purpose of influencing the legislative process. And \n75 percent say that their contributions work--it gives them an edge in \nshaping legislation; 78 percent of business leaders agreed that the \ncurrent system is ``an arms race for cash that continues to get more \nand more out of control''; and 71 percent of executives in big \ncompanies say that all of these big dollar contributions are hurting \ntheir corporate image.\n  Business leaders believe that they are victims of a system that \nallows them to be shaken down. When asked why their companies give, the \nmost frequent answer, from 31 percent, was ``To avoid adverse \nlegislative consequences''. Twenty three percent say it is to buy \naccess to the legislative process.''\n  As a result, a full three-fifths of senior business executives said \nthat they support a complete ban on soft money. That number was about \nthe same, 57 percent, even in those companies that have been recent \nsoft money givers.\n\n  Those findings are grim but they shouldn't surprise anyone who has \nthought about the political environment businesses in America now face. \nBusiness leaders have had enough. They have abandoned the conventional \nwisdom about the benefits of this corrupt system, and they are \nbeginning to\n\n[[Page S2955]]\n\nlead the call for reform. I ask unanimous consent that a release \nsummarizing the results of this poll be printed in the Record following \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. A piece on the op-ed page of Monday's Washington Post \nentitled ``Why this Lobbyist Backs McCain-Feingold.'' It was written by \nWright Andrews, a long-time lobbyist, and a successful lobbyist, who \nhas used this system to the advantage of his clients, but has finally \nsaid: ``enough is enough.'' According to the conventional wisdom, Mr. \nAndrews is an unlikely advocate for reform. Not long ago, he was the \npresident of the American League of Lobbyists, so it is fair to say \nthat he was the lobbyists' lobbyist, but he seems to be a man of common \nsense as well, and there is what he had to say. He writes:\n\n       [A]s a Washington insider, I know that on the campaign \n     finance front, things have mushroomed out of control. . . . I \n     know that lobbyists, legislators and the interests \n     represented increasingly operate in a legislative environment \n     dominated by the campaign finance process, and its excesses \n     are like a cancer eating away at our democratic system. . . . \n     [M]illions of Americans are convinced that lobbyists and the \n     interests we represent are unprincipled sleazeballs who, in \n     effect use great sums of money to bribe a corrupt Congress.\n\n  Mr. Andrews has put his finger on something. This system, especially \nsoft money, taints everybody who is involved with it. Big money changes \nhands, things get done in Washington, and the American people think it \nis only common sense to conclude that corruption abounds. Mr. Andrews \nseems to understand, as the American business community now \nunderstands, that the appearance of corruption is just as bad for our \ndemocracy as actual corruption, because the American people don't see \nthe difference. Mr. Andrews candidly admits that he and his clients \nhave used money, within the system, to get legislative results. He \ncontinues:\n\n       Campaign-related contributions, and expenditures at today's \n     excessive levels increasingly have a disproportionate \n     influence on certain legislative actions. Unlimited \n     ``soft'' money donations and ``issue ad'' expenditures in \n     particular are making a joke of contribution limits and \n     are allowing some of the wealthiest interests far too much \n     power and influence.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Andrews' op-ed be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. This last quote from a Washington lobbyist is common \nsense and the new, emerging conventional wisdom. These three items make \na few things clear. The old conventional wisdom about the opposition of \nthe business community to real reform is wrong, and it is giving way to \nthe common sense of the movement for reform. To those who will strive \non this floor to beat back the reform America demands, I say, listen to \nthese business leaders who are saying that they realize that the \ncorrupt system in place does not serve their interests, or our \ncountry's. Listen to the corporate executives who say they are tired of \nthe constant fund-raising and the feeling that they are being shaken \ndown. Listen to this veteran lobbyist, and others like him, who are at \nthe center of the current system and can't stand its rotten influence \nany longer. And if you oppose reform, listen to the common sense of the \nAmerican people who today can take heart that the old conventional \nwisdom about the chances for reform is passing away, along with your \nremaining allies in this fight.\n  I can't think of anything more illustrative of the very issue that \nthe U.S. Supreme Court asked us to consider in these situations. Is \nthere an appearance of corruption? When the business leaders and the \nCEOs of this country believe they are being shaken down and that they \nare being intimidated into giving these contributions, at a bare \nminimum, this is the appearance of corruption that the U.S. Supreme \nCourt has identified as the basis for legislative action in this area.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nTop Executives and Civic Leaders Back Plan That Includes Soft-Money Ban\n\n       As the Senate begins to debate campaign finance reform, the \n     Committee for Economic Development (CED) today sent every \n     Senator the names of 307 prominent business and civic leaders \n     who have endorsed its sweeping reform plan, which includes a \n     soft-money ban. About 100 new executives have joined the \n     effort since the Senate last considered reform in October \n     1999.\n       ``As reform nears, the inside-the-beltway cottage industry \n     is scrambling to oppose action,'' said CED President Charles \n     Kolb. ``But this list provides real evidence that a growing \n     number of business leaders want reform. They don't fear \n     reform, but think it's desperately needed. They are the \n     leading funders of campaigns, and they're tired of being hit \n     up for ever-increasing amounts of cash. They know the sysem--\n     or lack of one--is hurting the business community and our \n     democracy.''\n       The endorsers include top executives of Sara Lee, John \n     Hancock Mutual Life Insurance, State Farm, Prudential, H \n     Block, ITT Industries, Motorola, Nortel Networks, Hasbro, the \n     MONY Group, Chubb, Goldman Sachs, Boston Properties, and \n     Saloman Smith Barney. They also include the retired chairmen \n     or CEOs of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, AlliedSignal, Bank of \n     America, GTE, International Paper, Union Pacific, General \n     Foods, Monsanto, Time, CBS, Fannie Mae, Dow Chemical, Texaco, \n     FMC, and BFGoodrich.\n       Other prominent Americans on the list include a former vice \n     President, former Republican Secretaries of Defense, \n     Treasury, and Labor, a former Senator and Republican National \n     Committee Chairman, and a former Securities and Exchange \n     Commission Chairman.\n       CED, the leading business group advocating reform, has \n     officially endorsed the legislation offered by Senators John \n     McCain and Russ Feingold, which the Senate will debate next \n     week. The CED proposal calls for a ban on soft-money \n     contributions, increased individual contribution limits (to \n     $3,000), partial public financing for congressional races, \n     and voluntary spending limits.\n       ``Business executives support reform in roughly the same \n     numbers as the rest of the nation's voters,'' Kolb said, \n     pointing to a poll of top corporate executives of the \n     nation's largest corporations that The Tarrance Group \n     conducted on behalf of CED last year. According to the \n     survey, 78 percent support reform, and 60 percent back a \n     soft-money ban. (Importantly, 57 percent of those from \n     companies that recently made soft-money contributions support \n     a soft-money ban.) Many business leaders have called the \n     current system a ``shakedown'' and half of the poll \n     respondents said they fear adverse legislative consequences \n     if they don't give.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n  First-Ever Corporate Poll Results--Senior Business Executives Back \n                        Campaign Finance Reform\n\n\n Poll of Big-Business Leaders Shows Support for Soft-money Ban, Other \nReforms Say Fear and Buying Access are Top Reasons for Corporate Giving\n\n       Senior executives of the nation's largest businesses \n     overwhelmingly say the nation's campaign finance system is \n     ``broken and should be reformed,'' and three-in-five back a \n     soft-money ban, according to the first-ever survey of \n     business leaders' views on political fundraising, which was \n     released today. The main reasons corporate America makes \n     political contributions, the executives said, is fear of \n     retribution and to buy access to lawmakers.\n       Nearly three-quarters (74 percent) say pressure is placed \n     on business leaders to make large political donations. Half \n     of the executives said their colleagues ``fear adverse \n     consequences for themselves or their industry if they turn \n     down requests'' for contributions.\n       The survey provides new evidence to demolish the myth that \n     corporations support the current campaign finance system. It \n     was conducted by The Terrance Group for the Committee, for \n     Economic Development (CED) a non-partisan research and policy \n     group that has emerged as the business community's leading \n     voice for campaign finance reform.\n       By a more than four-to-one margin, respondents said \n     corporations make soft-money contributions to influence the \n     legislative process rather than for more altruistic reasons. \n     And 75 percent say political donations give them an advantage \n     in shaping legislation.\n       Nearly four-in-five executives (78 percent) called the \n     system ``an arms race for cash that continues to get more and \n     more out of control,'' with 43 percent strongly agreeing with \n     that statement. Two-thirds (66 percent) said fundraising \n     burdens are reducing competition in congressional races and \n     the pool of good candidates. And 71 percent say stories about \n     big-dollar contributions are hurting corporate America's \n     image.\n       ``As the chase for political dollars has exploded, the \n     business community has increasingly called for reform,'' said \n     Charles E.M. Kolb, the President of CED. ``More executives \n     are saying they're tired of the `shakedown' and the \n     unrelenting pressure to give ever-increasing amounts--\n     something some say feels like `extortion.' ''\n       ``This poll demonstrates conclusively that these are not \n     just anecdotal accounts or minority opinions, but rather the \n     widely held views in the top echelons of major \n     corporations,'' Kolb said. ``The business community sees a \n     campaign finance system that's evolved into an influence- and \n     access-buying system that damages our democracy and the way \n     public policy decisions are made. And\n\n[[Page S2956]]\n\n     they increasingly feel trapped in a system that doesn't work \n     for anyone.''\n       When asked why corporate America contributes, the most \n     frequently given answer (31 percent) was to ``avoid adverse \n     legislative consequences,'' and nearly a quarter (23 percent) \n     said it was ``to buy access to influence the legislative \n     process.'' Another 22 percent said the business community \n     gives ``to promote a certain ideological position,'' and 12 \n     percent said it does so ``to support the electoral process.''\n       ``The numbers are compelling because the margins are so \n     wide. The poll leaves no doubt that corporate leaders support \n     significant reforms,'' said William Stewart, Vice President \n     of Corporate & International Research for The Tarrance Group, \n     a polling firm that specializing in working for corporations \n     and Republican candidates. ``In nearly all cases, a clear \n     consensus exists, and it exists across all demographic \n     subgroups. These executives feel the system is an escalating \n     arms race, they fear retribution for not giving, and they \n     describe contributions as being tied to legislative outcomes; \n     all of which helps explain why executives overwhelmingly \n     favor reform.''\n       Perhaps some of the most surprising results of the survey \n     are the levels of support for various reform proposals. Not \n     only do three-in-five executives support banning soft money \n     (the unlimited contributions from corporations, unions, and \n     wealthy individuals), but 42 percent expressed strong support \n     for the move. Even 57 percent of the executives who work for \n     companies that have made soft-money contributions over the \n     last three years, favor a ban.\n       In addition, the business leaders said they favored \n     voluntary spending limits (66 percent), a publicly financed \n     matching system for donations below $200 (53 percent), and an \n     increase in the current $1,000 individual-contributions limit \n     (63 percent).\n       ``When so many senior executives support spending limits \n     and a partial public-financing system, you know it's time for \n     reform,'' said Kolb. ``This is not a group that casually \n     supports government rules and spending, but they clearly see \n     that it is now vital to fix this broken system.'' \n     Additionally, nearly nine-in-ten (88 percent) said they were \n     concerned about the decline in voter participation, with 53 \n     percent saying they were ``very'' or ``extremely'' concerned \n     about it.\n       The Tarrance Group surveyed 300 randomly chosen senior \n     corporate executives (vice presidents or above) from firms \n     that had annual revenues of approximately $500 million or \n     more. The telephone survey was conducted between September 12 \n     and October 10. It has a margin or error or plus or minus 5.8 \n     percent.\n       Of those surveyed, 42 percent work for firms that have made \n     soft-money contributions since 1997. The vast majority (86 \n     percent) had made personal political contributions. A much \n     larger share identified themselves as Republicans (59 \n     percent) than Democrats (19 percent).\n       In March 1999, CED unveiled a reform proposal that would \n     ban soft money, institute public matching funds for small-\n     dollar donations and voluntary spending limits, and increase \n     individual contribution limit (to $3,000).\n       Founded 1942, CED is an independent, nonpartisan research \n     and public policy organization. Its Subcommittee on Campaign \n     Finance Reform was co-chaired by Edward A. Kangas, Chairman, \n     Global Board of Directors of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, and \n     George Rupp, President of Columbia University. CED's campaign \n     finance program is funded by grants from The Pew Charitable \n     Trusts and the Carnegie Corporation of New York.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 19, 2001]\n\n                Why This Lobbyist Backs McCain-Feingold\n\n                         (By Wright H. Andrews)\n\n       As a Washington lobbyist for more than 25 years, I urge \n     Congress to make a meaningful start on campaign finance \n     reform and pass the McCain-Feingold bill. While many \n     lobbyists privately express dismay and disgust with today's \n     campaign finance process and are in favor of reforms, most \n     have not expressed their views publicly. I hope more \n     lobbyists will do so after reading this ``true confession'' \n     by one of their own.\n       I am not an ivory-tower liberal, nor do I naively believe \n     we can or should seek to end the influence of money on \n     politics. I have engaged in many activities most reformers \n     abhor, including: (1) making thousands of dollars in personal \n     political contributions over the years, (2) raising hundreds \n     of thousands of dollars, including ``soft money,'' for both \n     political parties and (3) counseling clients on how to use \n     their money and ``Issue ads'' legally to influence elections \n     and legislative decisions.\n       Why, then, does someone like me now openly call for new \n     campaign finance restraints, at least on ``soft'' money and \n     ``issue'' advertising? Quite simply because, as a Washington \n     insider, I know that on the campaign finance front things \n     have mushroomed out of control. In the years I have been in \n     this business I have seen our federal campaign finance system \n     and its effect on the legislative process change \n     dramatically--and not for the better.\n       I believe that individuals and interests generally have a \n     right to use their money to influence legislative decisions. \n     Nevertheless, I know that lobbyists, legislators and the \n     interests represented increasingly operate in a legislative \n     environment dominated by the campaign finance process, and \n     its excesses are like a cancer eating away at our democratic \n     system.\n       There is no realistic hope of change until Congress \n     legislates. I readily admit that I will continue, and expand, \n     my own campaign finance activities--just as will most of my \n     colleagues--until the rules are changed.\n       Right now there is an ever-increasing and seemingly \n     insatiable bipartisan demand for more contributions, both \n     ``hard'' and ``soft'' dollars. The Federal Election \n     Commission has reported that overall Senate and House \n     candidates raised a record $908.3 million during the 1999-\n     2000 election cycle, up 37 percent from the 1997-1998 cycle. \n     The Republican and Democratic parties also raised at least \n     $1.2 billion in hard and soft money, double what they raised \n     in the prior cycle. Soft-money donations from wealthy \n     individuals, corporations, labor groups, trade associations \n     and other interests have shown explosive growth. In addition, \n     millions of dollars in unregulated ``non-contribution'' \n     contributions are being plowed into the system through \n     ``issue ads.''\n       Today's levels of political contributions and expenditures \n     are undercutting the integrity of our legislative process.\n       Ironically, congressional lobbyists in general are better, \n     more professional, more ethical and represent more diverse \n     interests than in the past. Our elected officials today also \n     are generally honest, hard-working and well-meaning. But \n     millions of Americans are convinced that lobbyists and the \n     interests we represent are unprincipled sleazeballs who, \n     in effect, use great sums of money to bribe a corrupt \n     Congress.\n       Many citizens believe that using money to try to influence \n     decisions is inherently wrong, unethical and unfair. While \n     supporting reforms and recognizing citizens' concerns, I \n     disagree; I find little problem with political interests \n     seeking to influence elected officials through contributions \n     and expenditures at moderate levels, provided this is \n     publicly disclosed and not done on a quid-pro-quo basis. The \n     First Amendment allows every individual and interest to use \n     its money to try, within reason, to influence Congress. And \n     influence comes not just from political contributions; it \n     also comes from using money, for example, to hire lobbyists, \n     purchase newspaper ads and retain firms to generate ``grass-\n     roots'' support.\n       I nonetheless think the time has come to temper this right. \n     We have reached the point at which other interests and rights \n     must come into play. Campaign related contributions and \n     expenditures at today's excessive levels increasingly have a \n     disproportionate influence on certain legislative actions. \n     Unlimited ``soft'' money donations and ``issue ad'' \n     expenditures in particular are making a joke of contribution \n     limits and are allowing some of the wealthiest interests far \n     too much power and influence.\n       Moreover, the ability of legislators to do their work is \n     being reduced by the demands of today's campaign finance \n     system. Many, especially senators, now must devote enormous \n     amounts of time to fundraising.\n       Any significant new campaign finance limits that Congress \n     adopts will have to survive certain challenges in the Supreme \n     Court. If Congress carefully crafts legislative restrictions, \n     the court will, I believe, uphold responsable limits by \n     following reasoning such as it used in the Nixon v. Shrink \n     Missouri Government PAC case, in which it noted that ``the \n     prevention of corruption and the appearance of corruption'' \n     is an important interest that can offset the interest of \n     unfettered free speech.\n       Some lobbyists continue to support the present campaign \n     finance system because their own abilities to influence \n     decisions, and their economic livelihoods, are far more \n     dependent on using political contributions and expenditures \n     than on the merits of their causes. Others feel strongly that \n     virtually no campaign contribution and expenditure limits are \n     permissible because of the First Amendment's protections. And \n     some, like me, believe additional restraints on campaign \n     finance are required and allowable if properly drafted.\n       As to those in the last category, I invite and encourage \n     them to work with me in Lobbyists for Campaign Reform, a \n     coalition to urge Congress to pass meaningful campaign \n     finance reforms, starting with the basic McCain-Feingold \n     provisions.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am not aware of any more speakers on this side.\n  Mr. KERRY. I will be brief and then I will yield back my time.\n  I thank the Senator from Wisconsin notwithstanding that he has to \noppose my amendment. I understand why. I appreciate the gentle and \nsensitive opposition that he made, and I particularly appreciate the \nremarks he made about the CED and the business leaders who support what \nI am attempting to do this afternoon.\n  I will answer quickly. I always enjoy my exchanges with the Senator \nfrom Kentucky. He is very good at what he does. He certainly is one of \nthe best in this body at making arguments. However, I must say I am a \nbit taken aback by the notion that President Bush made a judgment not \nto take the Federal money, or to take the Federal\n\n[[Page S2957]]\n\nmoney because he didn't have time to raise the other money. He raised \n$100 million in $1,000 contributions and Senator McCain suspended his \ncampaign in March.\n  The notion that President Bush, between March and the August \nconvention, did not have an opportunity through his rather formidable \nfundraising machine to reask everybody for $1,000 who gave almost $100 \nmillion in order to find the $46 million necessary for the general \nelection or some larger amount if he wanted to live by it is absolutely \nwithout merit. Everybody in this country who raises money knows he has \nthe ability to raise $1,000 contributions a second time from those same \n$100 million worth of people who had invested in his nomination and who \nwould not have quit on him and who would have wanted him elected \nPresident.\n  Likewise with President Reagan, the exact same circumstances existed. \nHe took the money because the money was there, but also because \nAmericans knew that is the way they expect to elect their President in \nthe general election. I don't think you could have sustained the \narguments that would have been made in the face of campaign finance \nreform advocates across the country who believe they don't want a \nPresident who, during the general election, has to raise that kind of \nmoney and be subjected to what we are subjected to here on an annual \nbasis. There is an enormous distinction here and it needs to be made.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I sum it up, this is an amendment about \nthe taxpayer funding of congressional elections, about as unpopular \nwith the American people as voting for congressional pay raises. We \nhave the most extensive poll ever taken on any issue on this subject \nevery April 15 when our taxpayers in this country get an opportunity to \ndivert $3 of the taxes they already owe into a fund to pay for the \nPresidential election and for the conventions. The resounding number, \n88 percent, choose not to divert money, although it doesn't add to the \ntax bill. They choose not to divert tax dollars into this discredited \nsystem during which one out of four of the tax dollars have been spent \non lawyers and accountants trying to comply with the act and, of \ncourse, in recent years, more money spent by outside groups and the \npolitical parties in issue ads than the amount of money spent in the \ncourse of the campaign.\n  Finally, let me say at the risk of being redundant, you can't \nrestrict tax dollars to the Republicans and the Democrats, as we have \nlearned in the Presidential system which has provided millions of \ndollars to Lenora Fulani and to Lyndon LaRouche who got tax dollars to \nrun for President while in jail. This is going to provide funding for \nfringe candidates for Congress and for the Senate all over America. Any \ncrackpot who wakes up in the morning and looks in the mirror and says, \n``Gee, I think I see a Congressman,'' is going to have hope under this \nthat he will receive tax dollars to help finance his campaign.\n\n  Let me just say for the information of all Senators, the next \namendment will be offered on our side of the aisle by the Senator from \nTennessee, Mr. Thompson, who is present and prepared to offer his \namendment as soon as this vote is concluded.\n  Am I correct that when I yield back my time, the vote will occur on \nthe Kerry amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, at this point I yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I just consulted with Senator Daschle, the \nmanagers of the legislation, and all interested parties. We believe the \nbest way to proceed tonight is to go ahead and have the next amendment \nlaid down, which is the Thompson-Collins amendment, and that be debated \ntonight for whatever time is necessary, 2, 2\\1/2\\ hours.\n  We will come in in the morning at 9:15, have 30 minutes of debate \nequally divided, and have the next recorded vote about 9:45 a.m.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the Thompson-\nCollins amendment and, following the debate tonight, there be 30 \nminutes equally divided for closing remarks tomorrow beginning at 9:15 \na.m., to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not disagree except to say it is the \nintention to have a Feinstein second-degree amendment immediately \nfollowing the vote which will be to table the Thompson amendment. It is \nmy understanding that is perfectly agreeable with the author of the \namendment to have that vote on a second-degree amendment as well.\n  I ask to amend the unanimous consent request that, following that \nvote, a Feinstein second-degree amendment be in order.\n  Mr. DODD. I object to that. Let me explain if the leader will yield. \nWe are going to debate the Thompson amendment, and there will be a vote \non the Thompson amendment. There has been no decision whether it will \nbe a vote up or down or to table.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I amend my unanimous consent request that in the event \nthe Thompson amendment is not tabled, a second-degree Feinstein----\n  Mr. DODD. I do not even want to agree with that. I understand where \nthe Senator is coming from. At this point, I think we ought to go to \nthe Thompson amendment, debate the Thompson amendment, and tomorrow get \na better sense rather than push beyond that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Arizona, I hope he \nwill do that because it will give everybody a chance to talk through \neverything tonight. In the morning, a whole new strategy may exist on \nthe Senator's behalf or somebody else's behalf.\n  If we can withhold that now, I assume that is the direction we are \ngoing to go, but I think the managers want\n\n[[Page S2958]]\n\nto have some further discussion about it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have to say that will be our intention \nin the event the Thompson amendment is not tabled, and I have discussed \nthis with the author of the amendment and many others, and unless there \nis some reason for not doing so, I hope that will be agreeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, the only request before the \nChair is that posed by the majority leader?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, I ask the majority leader \nto give us a general overview, those who have been waiting patiently to \noffer amendments, as we are going into Wednesday and Thursday of the \nsecond week. Are we going to continue on this bill as long as there are \namendments to be offered?\n  Mr. LOTT. There are some additional amendments I understand Senators \nwould want to offer. I don't have a finite list. I don't know whether \nthere are 2 or 3 or 10. The Senator may want to consult with the \nmanager on that side. I don't know that there are more than a couple--I \njust don't know.\n  Mr. DODD. We have 21 amendments.\n  Mr. DURBIN. My inquiry is, there is no understanding that we are \ngoing to end this debate on Thursday night or Friday; we are going to \ncontinue until we finish the job?\n  Mr. LOTT. We are enjoying this immensely and we don't want to rush to \nfinish this at a reasonable hour tomorrow. But if that is the will of \nthe Senate, we may want to consider that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. In light of the agreement, the next vote is at 9:45 a.m. on \nWednesday.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 149\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson], for himself, Mr. \n     Torricelli, and Mr. Nickles, proposes an amendment numbered \n     149.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n           (Purpose: To modify and index contribution limits)\n\n       On page 37, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, I think it would be appropriate at this \ntime to remind ourselves why we are here and to remind ourselves of the \nneed for changing the current system under which we operate in terms of \nfinancing campaigns for Federal elections. It has to do with large \namounts of money going to small amounts of people.\n  We have seen over the centuries problems with large amounts of money \ngoing to elected officials or people who would be elected officials. \nThat is the basis behind the effort to ban soft money from our system.\n  We have gone from basically a small donor system in this country \nwhere the average person believed they had a stake, believed they had a \nvoice, to one of extremely large amounts of money, where you are not a \nplayer unless you are in the $100,000 or $200,000 range, many \ncontributions in the $500,000 range, occasionally you get a $1 million \ncontribution. That is not what we had in mind when we created this \nsystem. It has grown up around us without Congress really doing \nanything to promote it or to stop it.\n  I think we are on the eve of maybe doing something to rectify that \nsituation. Many Members are tired of picking up the paper every day and \nreading about an important issue we are going to be considering, one in \nwhich many interests have large sums at stake and then the second part \nof the story reading about the large amounts of money that are being \npoured into Washington on one side or the other of the issue--the \nimplication, of course being clear, that money talks and large amounts \nof money talk the loudest.\n  Of course, that is a reflection on us. It is a reflection on us as a \nbody. As the money goes up, the cynicism goes up, and the number of \npeople who vote in this country goes down. That is not a system of \nwhich we are proud. That is not a system that many want to continue.\n  I read a few days ago about the problems our friends in France are \nhaving with their own big money scandal. I read in the newspaper where \nthe French are saying their politics have become Americanized--meaning \nit is now a system of tremendously large amounts of money.\n  We learned in 1996 that the President of the United States can sit in \nthe Oval Office and coordinate these large amounts of money on behalf \nof his own campaign. So the issue of whether or not making these large \ncontributions of the State party ever reaches the benefit of the \ncandidate is a moot issue. We know certainly that it does.\n  If we are able to do something about this soft money situation, where \nis this money that is in the system now going to go? I suggest we have \nseen the beginning of the phenomenon in electoral politics that will \ncontinue unabated, and that is the proliferation of independent groups, \nnonprofit groups, what have you, buying television ads in our system. I \nthink it is protected almost totally by the first amendment. There are \nsome modest restrictions one can make, but basically it is protected by \nthe first amendment and it will continue and there is nothing we can do \nabout it even if we wanted to. I am not sure we ought to. We ought to \nbe subject to discussion and criticism and robust debate.\n  Having said that, if we get rid of the soft money, it is going to go \nsomewhere--a good deal of it, anyway. Are we going to fuel that \nindependent sector out there even more or are we\n\n[[Page S2959]]\n\ngoing to allow the candidate, himself or herself, to have some voice in \ntheir own campaign? It will go to all these outside groups unless we do \nsomething about the hard money limits. Of course, we all know what we \nare talking about, but I hope the American people understand we created \na system of so-called hard money, which is the legitimate money that we \ndecided people ought to be able to contribute to Federal candidates for \ncampaigns.\n\n  Everybody knows it takes money. It takes large amounts of money, it \ntakes more and more money, and we will see in a few minutes how much it \nreally takes.\n  We said for an individual in one cycle or in one campaign, $1,000 \nindividual limit. That was back in 1974 when we passed that law. We had \nother limits for other activities. Individual contributions to parties \nwe capped at $20,000; individual contributions to PACs, $5,000; \naggregate individual limit of $25,000 a year. That has been the system \nwe operated under since 1974. The soft money phenomena was very small \nuntil the mid-1990s and the system worked pretty well.\n  It has all changed now. The soft money is there in droves. The \nindependent groups are out there energized on both sides, all sides, \nand we are still back here at these hard money $1,000 limitations that \nwe created in 1974--a limitation of $1,000 that would be worth $3,500 a \nday if adjusted for inflation.\n  That is the nature of the problem. All the other areas have increased \nexponentially, and these legitimate, the most legitimate, the most \ndisclosed, the most controlled, the area where nobody says there will \nbe any corruption involved because the amounts are so low, has not \nchanged. Inflation has tripled. It has more than tripled since 1974. \nThe costs of campaigns have gone up 10 times.\n  I have a chart showing the average cost of winning a Senate seat in \nthis country back to 1976. I wish we had 1974 numbers because it would \nprobably be $400,000 or $500,000. We know in 1976 it was $600,000. In \n1978, it came up to $1.2 million. The cost in the last election cycle \nthat we had in 2000, the average cost of winning a Senate seat was over \n$7 million.\n  That includes one or two very expensive seats and that boosts the \nnumber up, but they count, too.\n  The last cycle, in 1998, was about $4.5 million. So about any way you \ncut it, you can see the dramatic increase, about a tenfold increase \nsince 1974, of the cost of the election. That is the cost of \neverything: consultants, television is the biggest part of it, \npersonnel--everything from stamps to the paper that you write on, the \nmaterial that you send out. Everything has skyrocketed, has increased \ngreatly with regard to campaigns since 1974--10 times. Inflation has \nincreased over 3 times. And we are back at a $1,000 limit pretending we \nare doing something good by keeping the limit that low.\n  What has been the effect of that? What has been the effect of \neverything else running wild and our keeping this low cap on the most \nlegitimate money in politics? It means one thing: incumbents have to \nspend an awful lot of their time running and raising money in $1,000 \nincrements. In that respect, we get the worst of both worlds because, \nalso, once we get the money, it is an incumbent protection deal because \nthe great majority of Senators who run for reelection win because of \ninherent advantages that we have.\n  In the House last time, 98 percent of the sitting House Members to \nrun for reelection won reelection--98 percent--attesting to the fact \nthat by keeping these limits low, you are making it that much more \ndifficult for challengers. You are making it that much more difficult \nfor people who want to get into the system and reach that threshold of \ncredibility by raising enough money to be able to say they are going to \nbuy a few TV ads and such things as that, and tell their supporters: \nYes, I am credible; I have that much money in the bank.\n  It is extremely difficult under our present system to do that now. We \nhave an incumbent protection system in operation now. I do not think \nthat is good for our country. We have been criticized for some of these \namendments that have been passed during this debate in the last couple \nof weeks as, once again, doing something to protect incumbents. One of \nthe things we can do to answer that is to say we are not going to \ncontinue to stick with this antiquated hard dollar limitation.\n  Others have commented upon and made note of the difficulty that \nchallengers have in raising sufficient amounts of money to run. There \nwas an article recently by Mr. Michael Malbin, executive director of \nthe Campaign Finance Institute, a professor of political science in the \nState University of New York at Albany. In Rollcall last Monday, Mr. \nMalbin pointed out that the Campaign Finance Institute, affiliated with \nthe George Washington University, analyzed past campaign finance data \nand reached surprising conclusions about the role that large \ncontributions play in promoting competition in Federal elections. These \nconclusions are not arguments for or against McCain-Feingold or the \nHagel bill.\n  He points out the $1,000 limitation today would be worth $3,500 if it \nwas just indexed for inflation.\n\n       From a competitive standpoint, upping the individual \n     contribution limit would help nonincumbent Senate candidates, \n     while having little impact on the House.\n\n  He points out in races in 1996 and 2000, 70 percent of the $1,000 \ncontributions went to nonincumbents. He says nonincumbents rely more on \nthe $1,000 givers. He says:\n\n       These data do not point to a single policy conclusion. But \n     they do raise a yellow flag. Large givers and parties are \n     important to non-incumbents.\n\n  McCain-Feingold would shut off one source of soft money, the banning \nof donations, without putting anything in its place.\n  I suggest we should put something in its place. That is the amendment \nthat Senator Torricelli and Senator Nickles and I have submitted. We \ntake that $1,000 limitation that we have operated under since 1974 and \nwe increase it to $2,500. I, frankly, would prefer to raise it closer \nto what inflation would bear, which would be $3,500.\n  I have been talking about rounding it off to $3,000. I do not get the \nindication that we would have the opportunity to pass that nearly as \nreadily as what I am offering. Frankly, that is my primary motivation. \nI believe so strongly that we must make some meaningful increase in the \nhard money limit that I want to pare mine down to something that is \nsubstantially less than an inflation increase.\n  So, in real dollars, if we pass my amendment, we will be dealing with \nless than the candidate dealt with back in 1974 with his $1,000, not to \nmention the fact that all of the expenses have skyrocketed.\n  Individual contributions will go from $20,000 to $40,000; aggregate \nindividual limits would go from $25,000 to $50,000 aggregate individual \nlimits. People say $50,000, that is a lot of money. That is not $50,000 \ngoing to one person; that is $50,000 aggregate, going to all \ncandidates.\n  Look at the tradeoff. Again, what I said in the very beginning about \nthe reason we are here: large amounts of money, hundreds of thousands \nof dollars going to or on behalf of particular candidates. Here the \nindividual candidate would only get $2,500 for an election. In terms of \nthe aggregate amount, what is wrong with several $2,500 checks being \nmade out to several candidates around the country, if a person wanted \nto do that? No one candidate is getting enough money to raise the \nquestion of corruption. I think the more the merrier. In that sense, \nmore money in politics is a good thing. We have more people reach the \nthreshold of credibility sooner and let them have a decent shot at \nparticipating in an election and not have a system where you do not \nhave a chance unless you are a multimillionnaire or a professional \npolitician who has been raising money all of his life and has his \nRolodex in shape that he can move on, up, down the line.\n  So I doubled most of these other categories except for the \ncontributions to PACs. On individual contributions to PACs, we move \nfrom the current $5,000 a year to $7,500 a year. On PAC contributions \nto parties, we move from $15,000 a year to $17,500 a year; PAC \ncontributions to PACs, $5,000 to $7,500.\n  These are modest increments. I don't know the exact percentage--less \nthan half increase.\n  Some would say, I assume, that though we are not even coming close to \nkeeping up with inflation, and even though these prices are \nskyrocketing for everything that we buy connected\n\n[[Page S2960]]\n\nwith the campaign, that going from $1,000 to $2,500 is too rich for \ntheir blood. But I must say for those who read any of the articles, any \nof the treatments that have been out recently by scholars and \nthoughtful commentators and others, they have to see a pattern that \nmust convince them that they should take a second look at taking such a \nposition.\n  There is an article recently by Stuart Taylor in the National \nJournal, saying that increasing these hard money limits to $2,000 or \n$3,000 is certainly an appropriate thing to do.\n  There is no commentator, there is no writer, there is no reporter \nwith more respect in this town and hardly in the country than David \nBroder. Mr. Broder wrote recently that raising it to $2,000 or even \n$3,000 would be an appropriate thing to do. There is no corruption \nissue there. There is no appearance issue there. That is what we need \nto keep in mind. We are not just talking about money. Money is not the \nsame in one category as it is in the other. And more of it is not \nnecessarily all bad, if you are giving a little bit to various \ncandidates around the country. Let's not get so carried away in our \nzeal to think that all money is bad, that it doesn't take money to run \ncampaigns, when that kind of attitude is going to hurt people who are \nchallengers worse than anybody.\n  Let's get the amount up decent enough so it will not be so high as to \nhave a corrupting influence or a bad appearance problem, but high \nenough to make the candidate credible.\n  Recently, I got the benefit of some legislative history on this \nmatter with regard to this body and some comments that have been made \nover the years by former Senators who we all remember and we all \nrespect.\n\n  Back in August of 1971, they debated a piece of legislation. If you \nrecall, it was 2 years before Watergate. Senators Mathias and Chiles \nmoved to establish a $5,000 limit on a person's contribution to a \nFederal candidate. That amendment was rejected. But Senator Chiles \nsaid: ``to restore some public confidence on the part of the people [we \nneed this amendment].''\n  He said:\n\n       The people cannot understand, today, why a candidate \n     receives $25,000 or $250,000 from one individual, and they \n     cannot understand how a candidate is not going to be \n     influenced by receiving that kind of money.\n\n  He said what we need to do is raise the amount so that it is not so \nhigh that we have that kind of improper influence appearance, but raise \nit high enough to give them a decent chance; and to him, at that point, \nit was $5,000. Well, that is closer to $20,000 today.\n  Before a subcommittee in March of 1973--on March 8, 1973--there was \ndiscussion between Senator Beall and Senator George McGovern, former \nPresidential candidate. Senator Beall said:\n\n       [I]n Maryland, we don't have any limit on the total amount \n     that you might spend in an election but we do limit \n     contributions to $2,500.\n\n  This is, of course, the amount I am suggesting today.\n  Senator McGovern said:\n\n       I favor that, Senator. I think there should be an \n     individual limitation. I have proposed that in no race should \n     it go beyond $3,000 by a single individual.\n\n  So Senator McGovern was at $3,000, and in real dollars way above what \nI am proposing. Again, his $3,000 would be $10,000, $12,000 today.\n  Coming on further, in the Watergate year, 1973, Senator Bentsen, \nformer Senator from Texas, former Secretary of the Treasury, said:\n\n       I believe my $3,000 limit walks that fine line between \n     controlling the pollution of our political system by favor \n     seekers with money to spend and overly limiting campaign \n     contributions to the point that a new man simply does not \n     have a chance.\n\n  On the vote to amend the Proxmire amendment with the Bentsen \namendment, Senator Mondale voted yes. Senator Mondale and Senator \nBentsen voted for a $3,000 individual limit which, again, is--what?--\n$10,000 or so today. On the vote which carried to adopt the amendment \nas amended, both Senator Mondale and Senator McGovern voted yes. \nSenator Cannon summarized the contribution limit provisions, as amended \nby Bentsen's amendment, and stated: The maximum of $3,000 individual \ncontributions to congressional and Presidential candidates is what is \nin the bill, and the overall limit is $100,000. That is 100,000 1974 \ndollars. This is in the wake of Watergate that they were having this \ndiscussion at these amounts.\n  On March 28, 1974--after Watergate--which is the year that the last \nsignificant legislation in this area was passed, Senator Hathaway \nproposed an amendment to increase the amount from $3,000 to $6,000 that \norganizations may contribute.\n  During the debate, Senator Hollings--our own Senator Hollings--said:\n\n       I . . . support limiting the amount that an individual \n     can contribute to a campaign, and while I personally favor \n     a $1,000 ceiling, I would agree to a compromise that would \n     set $15,000 as the maximum contribution in Presidential \n     races and $3,000 in Senate and House races.\n\n  Again, that is substantially above what we are talking about today.\n  Senator Hathaway said:\n\n       [T]he President [President Nixon] advocated a $15,000 \n     limitation. It seems to me the $3,000 for individuals and \n     $6,000 for a group limitation, being considerably below the \n     amount recommended by the President, is realistic.\n\n  The Hathaway amendment carried, and, again, Senator McGovern voted in \nfavor. Again, it is substantially above what we are talking about \ntoday.\n  Finally, in June of 1974, the Watergate Committee issued its final \nreport. That is a committee I spent a few days and weeks assisting in \nthe writing. Recommendation No. 5 of the Watergate Committee report:\n\n       The committee recommends enactment of a statutory \n     limitation of $3,000 on political contributions by any \n     individuals to the campaign of each Presidential candidate \n     during the prenomination period and a separate $3,000 \n     limitation during the post-nomination period.\n\n  And the report also states:\n\n       [T]he limit must not be set so low as to make private \n     financing of elections impractical.\n\n  That had to do with Presidential elections. The Watergate Committee \ndid recommend substantially above what we wound up with regard to \nPresidential elections. What would they have recommended 25 years later \nwith inflation--knowing then what we know now, and that expenses were \ngoing to go up tenfold? The amounts would be much, much higher.\n  I say all of this to make one simple point. The increase in the hard \nmoney limits is long overdue and very modest. By trying to be holier \nthan thou--and no one has fought for McCain-Feingold harder than I have \nsince I have been here. When I first ran for political office--the \nfirst office I ever ran for--it just seemed to me that something was \nwrong with a system that took that much money, and it was a whole lot \neasier to raise money once you got in, and once a big bill came down \nthe pike that everybody was interested in.\n  In private life you get a little uneasy about things such as that. I \nwas not used to it. So I signed on. I became a reformer. And I have \ngone down to defeat many times because of it. So I take a back seat to \nno one in wanting to change the system so we can have some pride in it \nagain.\n  But I am telling you, by keeping this hard money limit so low, we are \nhurting the system. We are going to wind up with something, if we are \nnot careful, worse than what we have now. That is how important I think \nthe increasing of the hard money limitation is.\n  There is another question that we should ask ourselves. I heard one \nof the commentators refer to this last Sunday. I had not thought about \nit, frankly, but it makes a lot of good sense. It is a good question. \nAnd that is, wait a minute, we just passed a so-called rich, wealthy \ncandidate's amendment. I voted against it. I think it is \nunconstitutional. But the sentiment is a legitimate one. Everyone is \nfearful of the prospects of running against a multimillionaire who can \nput millions of dollars in of their own money. So what was adopted was \nan amendment that says, if the rich guy puts in money, you can raise \nyour limits to $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000, I believe $6,000. You \ncan take $6,000 from one person, I believe is what we wound up with. \nLet me ask you, if the $2,500 that I am proposing is corrupting, what \nabout the $6,000 you are going to be using against the rich guy?\n  The fact that you are running against a rich guy is not going to make \nyou any more or less susceptible to\n\n[[Page S2961]]\n\ncorruption, if that is the issue. How can we pass an increase for \nourselves based on what somebody else is spending against us, if we are \nconcerned about the corruption issue, unless we acknowledge that those \nlevels of dollars are not a corruption problem? It is something \nconsiderably lower than that, such as $2,500, I suggest.\n  The amendment also has the benefit of being clearly constitutional. \nWe have had a constitutional issue with regard to just about every \naspect of this bill that has been brought up so far. We will not have a \nconstitutional issue with this amendment. There is no question that we \ncan increase the hard money limits. The constitutional issues have \nalways been whether or not we could reduce the hard money limits.\n  I urge the Senate not to be so afraid to do something that is long \noverdue, and to not try to wear the mantle of reform to the extent that \nwe wind up creating more harm, to take a noble purpose and turn it into \na terrible result and have a situation where amendments such as mine \nare defeated and we go ahead and pass McCain-Feingold and do away with \nsoft money and wind up with a hollow victory, indeed, as we see the \ncandidate is unable to fend for himself, candidates who want to run \ncan't afford to raise the money to run on the one hand and all the \nindependent groups doing whatever they want to do in triplicate from \nwhat we have already seen in the future--that would be worse--and \ninflation continuing to increase and seeing that $1,000 limit continue \nto dwindle, dwindle down below the $300 that it is today.\n  I suggest to those who want to come in at some lower limit that we \nnot simply nibble away at this problem, that we face up to it, do what \nwe need to do, index these dollars, do what we need to do so we don't \nhave to revisit this thing every couple of years, so that we can get on \nwith our business. In a practical sense, look how long it has taken us \nto get here. It has taken us since 1974 to get here for these 2 weeks. \nA lot of blood has been spilt on the floor just to get here and get \nthis debate. It may be another 25 years before we have another debate \nsuch as this. Let's come up with some reasonable amount, index it for \ninflation, so we don't have to go through this again because, in fact, \nwe probably won't go through this again and nothing will be done about \nthe proliferation of the independent ads and the independent outside \ngroups as that goes on and on and on, and our puny little hard money \nlimitation, the most legitimate, the most disclosed, the most limited \npart of our whole system continues to dwindle and dwindle and dwindle. \nThat would be a bad result and a hollow victory indeed.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Thompson \namendment.\n  The fact is, the Senator from Tennessee was one of the very first \npersons to get involved in the McCain-Feingold effort. I am grateful \nfor the years of hard work he has put into our effort to try to reform \nthe campaign finance system. We have always had a disagreement about \nthis issue but a polite disagreement. Now the issue is finally joined.\n  I understand many Members of this body believe it is appropriate to \nraise the hard money limits. I have said many times that there must be \nsome flexibility on this issue. I have said, half seriously and half \nkiddingly, that I am willing to go up as much as $1,001 per election \nfor the individual limit. I prefer we not even do that.\n  When I say that, of course, at this point in the difficult process of \nbringing this bill together, I don't really mean that that is as far as \nI am willing to go, as much as I regret it. This is an area that now \nhas to be opened to negotiation, and there have already been several \ndays of discussions about this subject. That said, I don't think a \nsignificant increase in the limits is warranted.\n  In the 2000 election, according to Public Citizen, roughly 232,000 \npeople gave $1,000 or more to Federal candidates. That is just one-\nninth of 1 percent of the voting-age population. An elite group of \ndonors don't just dominate the soft money system, frankly; they \nactually dominate the hard money system as well. To most Americans, \n$2,000 is still a large sum of money. That is when an individual can \ngive to a single candidate $1,000 in the primary and then another \n$1,000 in the general election. If we talked about average Americans \ngetting a tax cut for that amount of money, we would say $2,000 is a \nvery sizable tax cut. Somehow when we talk about the same sum in the \ncontext of political giving, we act as if this is a small figure.\n  As I have said, I understand that raising the hard money limits does \nhave to be a part of a final stage of this debate, even though I am \nreluctant to do so. If we can agree on an increase that doesn't \njeopardize the integrity of the McCain-Feingold bill as a whole, I will \nsupport it.\n  I am afraid that this amendment, well-intentioned as it is, simply \nraises the limit too high by raising the individual limit to $2,500 and \nby doubling the other contribution limits, including the aggregate \nlimit, the total amount that people give. That is why I must oppose \nthis amendment and urge my colleagues to oppose it as well.\n  I understand that because this bill bans soft money, those of us who \nwould prefer to leave the limits at their current level may have to \ncompromise. I say to all my colleagues, increasing the individual limit \nby 150 percent is just not a compromise we should make. Such a small \nnumber of Americans can afford to give what the limits even allow now--\nquite often it is given the nickname of ``maxing out,'' giving the \nmaximum--that a vote to increase the individual limit to $2,500 does \nmean putting more power in the hands of an even more concentrated group \nof citizens, and few Americans have the wherewithal to give those kinds \nof contributions.\n  A recent study by Public Campaign found that Senate incumbents in \n2000 raised on average nearly three times as much as their challenges \ndid from donors of $1,000 or more. It is likely that raising the hard \nmoney limit will give incumbents an even bigger advantage than they \nalready have now. So whatever increase we might support, we need to \nconsider that aspect of this very seriously. We should carefully \nconsider any measure that increases an incumbent's advantage, which I \nam afraid is already so strong in our Federal elections. I am afraid \nthe Thompson amendment does just that.\n  On this point, the Supreme Court has said Congress may legislate in \nthis area in order to address the appearance of corruption. There is \nanother appearance that is important here, and that is how the bill we \nare trying to craft as a whole appears to the public at large. That is \nvery important. This bill started out, with the good help of the \nSenator from Tennessee, as a straightforward effort to ban soft money \nand address the phony issue ad problem.\n  We quickly added an amendment that raised individual limits when a \ncandidate faces a wealthy opponent on the first day of the debate. Now \nwe are looking at a doubling of most of the contribution limits for all \ncampaigns. If we keep going in this direction, as others have said, \npretty soon this bill starts to look as if it is aimed at raising \nlimits and really protecting incumbents rather than addressing the \nproblem of corruption. We need to pay attention to that perception \nbecause our goal here is to reestablish the American people's trust in \ngovernment, not to drive people further away.\n  I am afraid the Thompson amendment doesn't just increase the \nindividual limit to 150 percent; it doubles every other important hard \nmoney limit as well. For example, the aggregate of what an individual \ncan give to individual candidates would increase from $25,000 a year to \n$50,000 a year. So in the course of an election cycle, a couple--if \nthere happens to be a couple involved--could give $100,000 in \ncontributions. Now I was just talking about how $2,000 is a lot of \nmoney to most Americans. Well, $100,000 is, of course, a staggering sum \nto most people. I think it is too high to have the name ``reform.''\n  This bill is about lessening the influence of money on politics. It \nis not about increasing it. If we are going to raise the limits at all, \nwe must do everything we can to act in good faith with all the American \npeople, not that tiny number of Americans who can afford to open up \ntheir checkbooks and\n\n[[Page S2962]]\n\nmax out the candidate. We have to do everything we can to look out for \nthe Americans who could not even dream of writing a $1,000 check to a \ncandidate, no matter how much they supported what that candidate stood \nfor.\n  Although I know important negotiations are underway, this is why \nraising the limits has to give this body pause, because every time we \nact to empower the wealthy few in our system, we really do a disservice \nto our Nation. I believe the soft money ban in this bill does a great \nservice to the Nation by ending a system that allows completely \nunlimited contributions from corporations, unions, and individuals to \nflow to the party. The soft money ban helps empower the average voter \nin this country, and that is why it is the centerpiece, the bottom \nline, the reason to be of the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  With this bill, we are getting rid of hundreds of millions of \nunregulated dollars. So I am willing to consider a modest increase in \nregulated dollars. But this amendment goes too far. I oppose raising \nthe hard money limit 150 percent when only one-ninth of 1 percent of \nthe voting-age population gives $1,000. Increasing this figure by 150 \npercent would give an unprecedented new level of access to those who \nwould continue to max out under the new limit.\n  I must urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I do hope the \nMembers of this body can work together to reach an increase that will \nbe palatable to both sides of the aisle. I mean that sincerely. If we \ncan't come to an agreement, this bill will be seriously jeopardized. \nThis body has made laudable progress in the course of this debate. I \nhave never been more proud to be a Member of the Senate. I say to my \ncolleagues that we have come too far to let this reform debate stall, \neven over an issue as tough as this one.\n  I hope we can come to an agreement on this issue that I can support. \nUntil that time, I do have to oppose the Thompson amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. What does the Senator from Virginia need?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, and Members of the Senate, I rise in \nsupport of the Thompson amendment. I have listened to the debate on \nthis issue for the last several days, and I have listened to the many \ndifferent points of view expressed here. There is quite a spectrum of \nopinion. On one side of the spectrum, there are those--and they had 40 \nvotes--who want to limit First Amendment rights and, in fact, voted for \na Constitutional amendment to do just that. I actually commend the \nSenator from South Carolina, Mr. Hollings, for at least recognizing \nthat many of these proposals, including the McCain-Feingold bill, have \nthe effect of restricting First Amendment rights, which is part of the \nBill of Rights. Nevertheless, that is their view.\n  On that side of the spectrum, there are also those who want the \ntaxpayers to pay for elections, which would be the result if you \nactually limited First Amendment rights. They honestly believe that is \nthe approach to take. I find myself on the other end of the spectrum, \nas one who believes very much in the Bill of Rights. After all, it was \nfirst authored by George Mason in the Virginia Declaration of Rights. I \nthink the First Amendment, as well as all of the Bill of Rights, is \nvery important for all Americans. My view is that what we ought to have \nis more freedom; the maximum amount of individual freedom, and the \nmaximum amount of accountability and honesty in elections, and having \ncontributions made voluntarily as opposed to being taken out of tax \nmoney.\n  All the various amendments that have been offered today, and probably \nwill be offered in the next few days, have as their purpose various \nrestrictions or subterfuge to these two different points of view.\n  I have been a candidate for statewide office in Virginia twice. Last \nyear, I ran statewide for the U.S. Senate under the Federal election \nlaws. I also ran for Governor statewide, obviously, under Virginia's \nlaws that are based upon the principles of freedom. In my view, the \ncurrent Federal election laws are overly restrictive. They are \nbureaucratic, antiquated, and they are contrary to the principles of \nindividual freedom, accountability and, yes, contrary to the concepts \nof honesty.\n  I have been working on an amendment with the Senator from Texas, Mr. \nGramm, on what we call the Political Freedom and Accountability Act. I \ndon't know if we will offer that amendment, but this looks like an \nopportunity to be in support of something that is at least going in \nthat same direction. I have stood by my guiding principles on vote \nafter vote during this debate. Sometimes I do not agree with the \nSenator from Kentucky on an amendment; to his and my chagrin, because I \nconsider the professor someone very knowledgeable on this subject. \nNonetheless, I am trying to advocate greater freedom and greater \naccountability.\n  What I am trying to do is make sure that in this debate we are \nadvancing the ideas of freedom of exchange of ideas, freedom of \npolitical expression and increasing participation to the maximum extent \npossible. And equally important are the concepts of accountability and \nhonesty.\n  First, the issue of freedom. The current laws and limits are clearly \nout of date. There is no one who can argue that these laws, the current \nrestriction on direct contributions to candidates, are anything but \ncompletely antiquated and out of date. Let's take some examples. When \nTV reporters ask me what kind of reforms do I want, I tell them greater \nfreedom, greater accountability, and to get these Federal laws up to \ndate. I ask the TV reporters: Will you please, in your reporting of \nthis issue, say what it cost to run a 30-second ad in 1974 when these \nlaws were put into effect versus what you charge today for a TV ad.\n  Well, I am never home enough to watch TV anymore since I have joined \nthe Senate, so maybe they told us. Nevertheless, we did our own \nresearch. The average cost of just producing a 30-second commercial has \nincreased seven times, from $4,000 to $28,000. The cost of stamps--\nbecause we do send mailings out has increased. The cost of a first-\nclass stamp in 1974 was 10 cents. Today, it is 34 cents, and rising. So \nthat is over three times as much.\n  The cost of airing a 30-second television advertisement per 1,000 \nhomes has escalated from $2 in 1974 to $11 in 1997. That is fivefold \nincrease.\n  Candidates are today running in larger districts. There are more \npeople in congressional districts, obviously, than before. There are \nmore people in the United States of America. The voting-age population \nincreased from 141 million in 1974 to over 200 million in 1998.\n  The reality is that the limits in the Thompson amendment don't even \ncatch up with the increase in costs.\n  The Thompson amendment is a very modest approach of trying to get the \nFederal election laws more in line with what are the costs of \ncampaigns.\n  The accountability and honesty aspect of this amendment is important \nbecause I think the current situation has improper disclosure; very \npoor disclosure and subterfuge. As far as disclosure is concerned, one \ncan get a contribution of $1,000 on July 2 and it is not disclosed \nuntil late October under the current law. I very much agree with the \nefforts of the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, to get more prompt \ndisclosure, and that needs to be done.\n  The contribution limits also force a greater use of soft money. \nPeople are all so upset about soft money going to political parties. \nWhy is that being done? Because the cost of campaigns are increasing \nfor all those demographic features and facts I just enunciated. The \nfact is, you need more money to run campaigns to get your messages out.\n  If an individual desired to part with $5,000, which is right much \nmoney for most people, but they believe so much in a candidate that \nthey want to give $5,000, right now they would have to give $1,000 to \nthe candidate. That would be disclosed, maybe belatedly but it would be \ndisclosed. Then they would have to give $4,000 to a political party \nthat would run ads, run mailings, whatever they would do to help that \ncandidate.\n  The point is that $4,000, in this example, would not have the same \naccountability. It would not have the same scrutiny. Fred Smith may be \na controversial character. It is one thing for him to give $1,000 and \nthen $4,000 to the\n\n[[Page S2963]]\n\nparty, but it is all $5,000 to candidate B and you say: Gosh, candidate \nB has gotten all this money from Fred Smith. But really it only shows \nup as $1,000 because the rest has gone to the Democratic Party or the \nRepublican Party or some other organization. Therefore, you are losing \nthat accountability and the true honesty in a campaign that you want to \nhave and the scrutiny that a candidate should have for getting \ncontributions from individuals.\n  It is my view that we need to return responsibility for campaigns to \nthe candidates. We are getting swamped. At least we were swamped--and I \nknow this was not unique to Virginia last year--with these outside \ngroups that are contributing to our campaigns. Mr. President, $5 \nmillion, at least the best we can determine, was spent not just by the \nDemocratic Party running ads contrary to my campaign or Republicans \nrunning ads in favor of my campaign or in opposition to my opponent, \nbut these independent expenditures--handgun control, attack TV ads, \ndonor undisclosed; Sierra Club running attack ads, radio ads, voter \nguides, donors undisclosed; pro-abortion groups, dirty dozen ads \nagainst us--all these ads and they are all undisclosed. There are \npeople all upset with this. That is part of democracy. That is part of \nfree expression. It would be nice if there would be a constitutional \nway to disclose those individuals, but that is apparently \nunconstitutional.\n  The point is, you end up having to answer those ads. People think: \nYou want to do all sorts of sordid things I will not repeat, but \nnevertheless you have to get the money to make sure you are getting \nyour positive, constructive message out or setting the record straight.\n  With these limits, you end up having to raise money through political \nparties to combat these ads which, as much as I did not like them, they \nhave a right to do. And I will defend the rights of these groups or any \nother groups to run those ads and have their free expression and \npolitical participation.\n  The point of the Thompson amendment is people are allowed to \ncontribute more directly to a candidate. The candidate is held more \nresponsible and accountable, and to the extent that you can get more \ndirect contributions, it alleviates, negates, and diminishes the need \nto be using political parties as a subterfuge or a conduit to get the \nmoney you need to set the record straight.\n\n  Current Federal laws in many cases--one says: Look at how wonderful \nthey are. It is amazing to me people think that, but nevertheless that \nis their view. They are so unaccountable in so many ways, and by \nlimiting hard dollars, so to speak, or direct contributions, you are \nback with PACs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ALLEN. May I have an additional 5 minutes?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield an additional 5 minutes to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Senator from Tennessee.\n  I think the contribution limits definitely create a dependency on \nsoft money, thereby the corollary logically is that by increasing the \ndirect contributions on hard limits, it decreases the necessity. It is \npure commonsense logic, at least for those of us who have run under a \nsystem of freedom such as that in Virginia.\n  The other matter is contribution limits also prohibit candidates, \nexcept those with personal wealth, from acquiring a stake from which to \nlaunch a campaign. We went through this whole debate about what happens \nwhen you have millionaire candidates and thereby raise the limits for \nthose candidates, and so forth. Gosh, if you did not have any limits, \nyou would not have to worry about this.\n  Again, at least the amendment of the Senator from Tennessee addresses \nthat in that we want to encourage more political participation in \nspeech rather than limiting it. We ought to be promoting competition. \nWe ought to be promoting freedom and a more informed electorate, which \nwe would get with the amendment of the Senator from Tennessee. We want \nto enable any law-abiding American citizen to run for office.\n  Had the current limits been in place in 1968, Eugene McCarthy never \nwould have been able to mount his effort against President Johnson.\n  Today's system has failed to make the elections more competitive. The \ncurrent system hurts voters in our Republic by forcing more and more \ncommittees and contributions and political activists to operate outside \nthe system where they are unaccountable and, consequently, more \nirresponsible and less honest.\n  I, of course, want to repeal the hard limits, but nevertheless, by \nincreasing these limits, we can open up the political system. \nChallengers need to raise a great deal of money as quickly as possible \nto have any real chance of success. The current system, with its very \nstringent limits, prevents a challenger from raising the funds he or \nshe needs, and I saw that in 1993 when I was running for Governor.\n  One may say: Gosh, this is all wonderful theory from the Senator from \nVirginia. You can look at Virginia as a test case of freedom and \naccountability. People say, sure, they have plenty of disagreements \nbetween the legislative and executive branch and between Democrats and \nRepublicans, but you have honest Government in Virginia. If there is \nanybody giving large contributions, I guarantee you, boy that is \nscrutinized and there is a lot of answering to do for large \ncontributions. Indeed, it may not be worth the bad press you get for \naccepting a large contribution.\n\n  Again, if you look at Virginia--which has a system where we have no \ncontribution limits and better disclosure--Virginia right now has a \nGovernor whose father was a butcher. His predecessor was a son of a \nformer football coach. The predecessor to that Governor was a grandson \nof slaves. Virginia's system gives equal opportunity to all. Virginia \nhas a record of which we can be proud.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Tennessee, while not ideal and \nexactly like Virginia, it is one that at least increases freedom--\nfreedom of participation, freedom of expression, and coupled with other \namendments, such as the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana on \ndisclosure, brings greater honesty.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to support this amendment. It is a \nreasonable improvement, it is greater freedom, it is greater \naccountability, and it is greater honesty for the people of America. I \nyield back what moments I have remaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Virginia----\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the Senator from Virginia before he leaves \nthe floor, I hope he adds me as a cosponsor to the Allen-Gramm freedom \namendment and indicate my total agreement with the Senator from \nVirginia about the Virginia law.\n  As I understand the situation in Virginia, and correct the Senator \nfrom Kentucky if he is wrong, Virginia almost never has a situation \nwhere candidates cannot get enough money to run.\n  Mr. ALLEN. You can have that situation if you are not credible.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If you are not credible, you do not. The two parties \nare well funded. The candidates, if they are credible, are well funded. \nThey are able to raise enough money to get their message across because \nthey are not stuck under the 1974 contribution limit.\n  In fact, as the Senator from Virginia was pointing out, it has \nproduced rather robust competition with minimal or no accusations of \ncorruption; is the Senator from Kentucky correct?\n  Mr. ALLEN. The Senator from Kentucky is correct and there are no \nlimited contributions from corporations, which I am not arguing at this \npoint, but it is purely on Jeffersonian principles of freedom and \ndisclosure and honesty.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In fact, what a candidate does in Virginia is weigh, \nknowing the contribution will be disclosed, the perception of whether \nor not the candidate should accept the large contribution, knowing full \nwell it will be fully disclosed and people can make of it what they \nwill. Is that essentially the way it works in Virginia?\n  Mr. ALLEN. The Senator from Kentucky is correct. As I alluded in my \nremarks, sometimes you might as well\n\n[[Page S2964]]\n\nnot have been receiving a large contribution because the negative \nconnotations and everything wrong that person or corporation may have \ndone is somehow besmirching you. You have to be careful with it in \ntrying to get contributions, whether for yourself or for political \naction efforts.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the Senator from Virginia, I know it must be \nsomewhat depressing, given his philosophy, what we are doing here. But \nto make the Senator from Virginia feel better, not too far in the past \nthe reform bills we were dealing with had draconian spending limits on \ncandidates, taxpayer funding of elections.\n  As recently as 1992 and 1993 and 1994, majorities in the Senate were \nsupporting taxpayer funding of elections. It was noteworthy that only \n30 Senators in this body supported taxpayer funding of congressional \nraces--the Kerry amendment earlier today. We have made some progress. \nWe are now down to arguing over the impact of campaign finance reform \non parties and outside groups. It used to be a lot worse. The whole \nuniverse of expression was balled together in these reform bills as \nrecently as 1994.\n  I say to my friend from Virginia, add me as a cosponsor to the \nfreedom amendment. We have come a long way. We are not quite there yet. \nThe wisdom he has imparted tonight is certainly good to hear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will speak for a few minutes. I thank \nmy friend and colleague from Connecticut for allowing me to jump ahead.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend and colleague from Tennessee for \noffering this amendment, which I am happy to cosponsor and also \ncongratulate him for the speech he made. I hope my colleagues had a \nchance to hear what Senator Thompson was saying.\n  I also compliment Senator Allen for the comments he made. I \nappreciate the impact he has had since joining the Senate, including \nhis idea, based on a campaign system that has worked quite well in the \nState of Virginia, which he has shared with us. Perhaps we will have a \nchance to vote on that amendment as well.\n  The pending amendment is the Thompson amendment, which I am pleased \nto cosponsor, which increases the hard money limits. It is one of the \nmost important amendments we will deal with in this entire debate, in \nthis Senator's opinion.\n  The amendment increases the hard money limits, hard money \nrepresenting what individuals can contribute. Every dime of hard money \nis disclosed and reported. No one has alleged, that I am aware of, that \nthis is corrupt money, that this is illegal money. Every dime is out in \nthe open for everybody to see. The Thompson amendment increases the \nindividual level from $1,000 to $2,500. That increase, if you look back \nto 1974, doesn't even keep up with inflation.\n\n  Senator Thompson also would increase some of the other limits that \nare in the current law. PAC limits would grow from $5,000 to $7,500. \nThat is not keeping up with inflation: if we kept up with inflation \nover 25 years, we would have over a 300-percent increase. The amendment \nhas a moderate increase in PACs. And the aggregate individual limit \ngoes from $25,000 to $50,000. Somebody has said, isn't that too much? I \ndon't think so. If somebody wants to contribute $2,500 per year, they \ncan only contribute to 10 candidates currently. Under this amendment, \nyou could contribute to 20.\n  Is that corrupt? No, I don't think that is corrupt. What I see as \ncorrupt are the joint fundraising committees where you have millions of \ndollars of soft money funneled into some races. That money is not fully \ndisclosed. Who contributed that money? We had a lot of Senate races \nlast year and, the Democrats received around $21 million in these \nspecial joint committees last year. And we would like to say, is this \nthe right way to raise and spend money? Does it make sense to do it \nthat way? I don't think so. But with hard money, every single dime is \nout there for everybody to see in every single instance.\n  I think the Senator's amendment makes great sense. I hope my \ncolleagues agree.\n  Some say we need to look for a compromise on this amendment. Senator \nThompson has already compromised. His original amendment basically kept \neverything up with inflation, growing the aggregate limit from $25,000 \nto $75,000. His amendment now is at $50,000.\n  The limits on giving to parties goes from $20,000 to $40,000. Don't \nwe want to strengthen parties? My friend and colleague has made a good \npoint: parties are healthy to the system. Senator Thompson's amendment \nallows individuals to increase contributions to parties. We should keep \nparty contributions and allow parties to grow.\n  If we are going to ban soft money, we should allow some increases in \nhard money. I think that is what the amendment we have before the \nSenate would do.\n  I thank my friend and my colleague from Tennessee for offering this \namendment. I think it is an important amendment. I urge my colleagues: \nIsn't this a good improvement over the existing system?\n  I think it is. I urge the adoption of the amendment when we vote on \nit tomorrow morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask the Senator from Tennessee if I could have 7 or \n8 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. DODD. Could I be heard at some point?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will wrap it up really fast.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I want to commend the Senator from Tennessee for his \namendment. It certainly begins to deal with what I think is the single \nbiggest problem in the system today, and that was the failure to index \nthe hard money contribution limit set back in 1974 when a Mustang cost \n$2,700.\n  As may have been said by the Senator from Tennessee and others, the \naverage cost of a 50-question poll has increased from about $5,000 to \n$13,000 over the last 25 years. The average cost of producing a 30-\nsecond commercial has increased from $4,000 to approximately $28,000 \nover the last 26 years. The cost of a first-class stamp was 10 cents in \n1974 and today it is 34 cents. The cost of airing a television \nadvertisement per 1,000 homes has escalated from over $2 in 1974 to $11 \nin 1997. Meanwhile, the number of voters candidates must reach has \nincreased 42 percent since 1974.\n  The voter population in 1974 was 140 million; today it is 200 \nmillion. We have produced a scarcity of funds for candidates to reach \nan audience. In 1980, the average winning Senate candidate spent a \nlittle over $1 million; in 2000 the average winning candidate spent a \nlittle over $7 million, an almost sevenfold increase. An individual's \n$2,000 contribution to a $1,000,000 campaign in 1980 amounted to .17 \npercent of the total. If the contribution limits were tripled for this \nlast election to adjust for inflation, since 1974 an individual $6,000 \ncontribution to the average $7 million campaign would have been only \n0.08 percent of the total. A $60,000 contribution to an average winning \nSenate campaign in 2000 would be only .83 percent of the total.\n  What this all adds into, there is no potential for corruption, none \nbased on the 1974 standard, if the amendment of the Senator from \nTennessee is adopted. If no one in 1974 thought those limits at that \ntime, based upon the cost of campaign activity at that time, was \ncorrupting, why in the world would the Senator's amendment, which is \neven less than the cost of living increase--why in the world would \nanybody say that this has even the appearance of corruption? Certainly \nnot corruption or even the appearance of corruption in today's dollars?\n\n  It is also important to note that these low contribution limits are \nthe most tough on challengers. Challengers typically do not have as \nmany friends as we incumbents. They are trying to pool resources from a \nrather limited number of supporters in order to compete with people \nsuch as us. The single biggest winners in the increase in contribution \nlimits in hard dollars would be challengers.\n  Challengers already took a beating here on this floor when we took \naway\n\n[[Page S2965]]\n\nall of this money from the parties earlier today. We have taken away 40 \npercent of the budget of the Republican National Committee and the \nDemocratic National Committee. We have taken away 35 percent of the \nbudget of the Republican Senatorial Committee and the Democratic \nSenatorial Committee. Parties: The only entity out there that will \nsupport challengers.\n  Challengers have lots of problems. Typically they have a really \ndifficult time getting support from individuals and PACs. Now we have \nnailed the parties. At least under Senator Thompson's amendment we give \nthese challengers an opportunity to raise more money from their friends \nto compete with people such as us.\n  So this is a very worthwhile amendment. I hope we will have an \nopportunity to vote on the Thompson amendment up or down, which means a \nchance to adopt it. We will have that discussion, I gather, at greater \nlength in the morning. But it is a very worthwhile amendment.\n  I associate myself with the effort of the Senator from Tennessee, \ncongratulate him for making this effort, and indicate my full support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I believe I said earlier I was the only one \nhere. I have been told a couple of colleagues may be on their way to \nthe floor to be heard on this amendment before wrapping up debate \ntonight.\n  I am very fond of my friend from Tennessee. We have gotten to know \neach other a little better over the last number of months. He is a \nwonderful addition to the Senate. He was not unfamiliar with this \ninstitution prior to being elected to it, having worked back in the \n1970s as a very successful and influential member of the Watergate \nCommittee staff, and, having worked with Howard Baker and others, he is \nno stranger to this institution. His participation in any number of \nissues has enriched the Senate.\n  So it is with some sense of--again on a personal level, I would like \nto be supporting his amendment because I am very fond of him. People \nmight understand those inclinations. But, unfortunately, I disagree \nwith my colleague on this amendment. I will explain why.\n  I always love this story. When they asked Willy Sutton why he robbed \nbanks, I always loved his answer. He said, ``That's where the money \nis.'' That is why he robbed banks. We are not robbing banks, but my \nconcern about this amendment is we are going to end up gravitating to \nwhere the money is. That is what we do. Our staffs and consultants and \nadvisers and people who help raise money will tell you: Look, we have \nso much time in a day, so much time before the reelection or election \ncampaigns. So if you have an hour to spend, we are going to spend the \ntime going after those large contributors. It doesn't take a whole lot \nof knowledge to know that you do not go after the ones who cannot give \nas much. Instead, you go after the ones who can give more.\n\n  My concern is not so much that this number goes up and that people \nwho can afford it are going to have greater access and greater \ninfluence. What is not being said here is very troubling to me. We are \nmoving further and further in the direction of seeking the support and \nbacking of those who can afford to write a check for $2,500. But, make \nno mistake about it, we should be clear with the American public, these \nnumbers are somewhat misleading.\n  It doesn't make any difference whose numbers you are talking about. \nUnder current law, an individual may contribute a $1,000 per election \nor $2,000 with $1,000 going to the primary and another $1,000 going to \nthe general election. If we are talking about amendments being offered, \nSenator Hagel's proposal contained a $3,000 per election, Senator \nFeinstein is proposing $2,000 per election, while there are still \nothers talking about $1,500 per election. Those numbers are really not \na final number. A more accurate number is a doubling of the per \nelection number to reflect one limit for the primary and another for \nthe general, with the potential of yet another limit for a special or \nrunoff election. So every number you read, has the automatic potential \nto double with respect to the individual contribution to candidates per \nelection.\n  I know very few cases where Members have gone after the $1,000 \ncontribution and not ended up with the $2,000. That, after all, is how \nit works. Because, as a practical matter, you can give $1,000 before \nthe primary and $1,000 for the general election. So when we talk about \nlimits here of $1,000 or $1,500 or $2,000 or $2,500, do a quick \ncalculation and double the amount. That is the general formula that an \nindividual can contribute to a candidate per election.\n  My friend from Tennessee proposes a $2,500 per election limit that \nindividuals can give to candidates. This number may also double to \n$5,000, because that individual can write $2,500 for the primary and \n$2,500 for the general election.\n  You do not have to have a primary, just as long as there was some \npotential contest within your own party for the nomination. Such a \npotential contest allows you to get that additional $2,500 limit.\n  But it goes even beyond that. Frankly, people who can write a check \nfor $2,500 probably can write a check for $5,000. If you can afford to \ngive someone $2,500, there is a good likelihood your pockets are deep \nenough to write the check for $5,000. Under current law, each spouse \nhas his or her own individual contribution limit. So that $2,500 \nbecomes $5,000. If your spouse is so inclined--and they usually are--\nthe $2,500 under the Senator proposal then becomes $5,000 per election. \nAs a couple, the total they can give is now up to $10,000 per election.\n  Every single Member of this Chamber knows exactly what I am speaking \nabout with respect to fundraising practices because as a candidate for \nthis body many have done exactly what I have described. The general \npublic may not follow all of this. That is how it is done. When you get \nthat person who is going to give you $2,500 contribution for the \nprimary, you always say: Can't you give me $2,500 for the general as \nwell? In addition you say--Wouldn't Mrs. Jones or Mr. Jones also be \nwilling, as well, to write those checks reflecting the maximum \nindividual contribution limit per election?\n  Under this proposal, we are talking about potentially a total of \n$10,000 per couple as opposed to the current levels of $2,000 or $4,000 \nper election, if you will, if both husband and wife contribute. That is \na pretty significant total increase.\n  My colleague quickly answers that his stamps have gone up, the price \nof television spots have gone up. I know that these costs have \nincreased. But so has the population of the country and the number of \npeople who can write $1,000 checks.\n  In 1974 there were not a tremendous number of people who could write \na check for $1,000 to a candidate. Today the pool of contributors who \ncan give $1,000 has expanded considerably. Last year there were almost \na quarter of a million people who wrote checks for $1,000. That is not \na small amount of people: 235,000 people wrote checks for $1,000 to \nsupport Federal candidates for office.\n  But what we are doing here by raising these amounts? We are moving \nfurther and further and further away from the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans. I would like to see the average American participate in the \nelectoral process of the country. I would like to see them contribute \nthat $25 or $50 or $100, $200 to a candidate or party of their choice. \nHowever, given the average cost of a Senate race today or a House \nrace--the numbers of my colleague from Tennessee suggests of around $7 \nmillion, and a House race around $800,000 a congressional district, I \ndo not see many campaigns that are going to bother any longer with that \nsmaller donor.\n  It is the de facto exclusion of more than 99 percent of the American \nadult population who could support, financially, the political process \nin this country, that worries me the most. I am worried about us \ngetting overly concentrated on only those who can afford to write the \nlarge, maximum checks to campaigns. But I am more worried that we are \ngetting ourselves further and further and further removed from the \naverage citizen. The Americans who could not dream, in their wildest \ndreams, about writing a check for $2,500, let alone $10,000 to support \na candidate for the Senate or the House of Representatives. They\n\n[[Page S2966]]\n\ncouldn't dream about doing that. They may be making decent salaries and \nincomes so they are not impoverished. But the idea of writing out a \n$10,000 check or any such checks that we would allow if this amendment \nis adopted is beyond the average Americans' imagination.\n  To some extent, it ought to be beyond ours as well. However, where we \nappear to be going is where the money is. That is what Willy Sutton \nsaid, and that is what we are saying. We are going to spend our time on \nthat crowd because that is the most efficient use of our time with \nrespect to fundraising. A phone call to Mr. and Mrs. Jones who can \nafford to make this kind of a contribution are going to get our \nattention. We are not interested in that individual who may be making \n$30,000, $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, $70,000, or $100,000 a year, with \ntwo or three kids, paying a home mortgage, trying to send kids to \ncollege. We are not interested, really, because they cannot even begin \nto think about contributions like this.\n\n  That is the danger. That is the danger. I am really not overly \nconcerned--although it bothers me--over this concentration of wealth \nand the access that comes with it by adopting this amendment. That \nbothers me.\n  What deeply troubles me--what deeply troubles me--is that this \ninstitution gets further removed from the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans. Their voices become less and less heard. They become more \nfaint. They are harder to hear. They are harder to hear because we are \ngetting further and further away from them since their ability to \nparticipate is being diminished.\n  One of my colleagues----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I don't want to break up the rhythm of what the \nSenator is saying. It is very powerful. I do not think I can say it as \nwell as you. I would like to ask you one or two questions.\n  In this debate I don't believe I had really heard your formulation \nbefore. We talk about big money, corruption, not individual wrongdoing; \nsome people have too much access. You just used the word ``exclusion.''\n  There was a young African American man today with whom I spoke. He \nwas talking about Fannie Lou Hamer, a great civil rights leader. By \nbackground, Fannie Lou Hamer was the daughter of poor sharecroppers.\n  This is a question of inclusion. If you take the caps off, and you \nare relying on people who can afford to make these kinds of \ncontributions, he was basically saying, this almost becomes a civil \nrights issue because it is a question of whether or not people who do \nnot have the big bucks will be able to participate in the political \nprocess, will be able to be there at the table.\n  I ask the Senator, is this part of what is concerning you, that you \nare getting away from representative democracy and many people are \ngoing to feel more and more excluded as we now rely on bigger and \nbigger dollars?\n  I have three questions. And I will not take any more of your time. Is \nthat what you are talking about?\n  Mr. DODD. That is part of it. I said, we are concentrating on who can \ngive and how much they can give. Every time we raise the bar on the \nlimits, then we are also expanding the number of people who do not, and \nmaybe cannot, contribute their financial support. We are not even \nseeking their financial support, only their votes. I think there is \ninherently a danger in that.\n  I think it is a positive thing, by the way, that people write that \ncheck out for $5 and $10 and $20 contributions. In some ways, it can be \nmore significant because sometimes that $10 or $25 check from someone \nwho is trying to make ends meet. It is a greater sacrifice in some ways \nthan it is for some of the people I know who write checks for $1,000 or \n$2,000 or $10,000. That $10,000 in the context of their overall wealth \nis a smaller percentage than the person making that $50 or $100 \ncontribution who really cannot afford to do it but believes it is in \ntheir interest. It is part of their responsibility of citizenship to \nsupport the political process of this country and to support our \ndemocratic institutions.\n\n  What I am deeply troubled about--I am bothered by the raising of the \ncontribution limits because of where I think it takes us, where it is \nultimately going.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Right.\n  Mr. DODD. If you take the numbers of my friend from Tennessee, I \nthink it is $400,000 in 1976--Is that right?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. It is $600,000.\n  Mr. DODD. So $600,000 in 1976, and $7 million in the year 2000. I \ntried to do some quick math--and I could be corrected of course--but if \nyou extrapolate from that and go to the next 10 years, to the year \n2010, we are buying into the notion that there is nothing we can do \nabout this. It is just going to keep getting more expensive, guys.\n  So we are just going to make it a little easier for you to reach the \nlevels of $13 million. I think that is about where we go in 10 years if \nthe trend lines are accurate and continue.\n  I realize there can be changes here because it is not a perfect trend \nline. But if you take where it was 10 years ago, I think in about 1990 \nit was $1.16 million----\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That was 1993.\n  Mr. DODD. Sorry. So that was 1993. It has doubled. It is roughly \nabout the same. So we may be talking about roughly $12 or $13 million \nin 10 years.\n  So as we raise the bar to make it easier for us to get up there, we \nare shrinking the pie of people who can contribute. Getting smaller and \nsmaller and smaller and smaller are the number of people who can write \nthese kinds of contributions. Make no mistake about it, that is where \nthe money is. That is where we are going to go. You are not going to \nhold $100 fundraising events. You might do it because it is good \npolitics. Maybe it will pay for the hotdogs and chips, and so forth, \nbut you are not going to have a fundraiser doing that. It is a \npolitical event. Fundraisers have, as their minimum contribution, $500, \n$1,000, $1,500, or whatever it is as the bars go up.\n  In response to the question of my friend from Minnesota, that bothers \nme. What troubles me--what deeply troubles me--is that as that pool \nshrinks of those Americans who can make those large contributions, the \npool expands of those Americans who are excluded from the process. And \nthat is a great danger. That is a peril.\n  For us to enter the 21st century having inherited 200 years of \nuninterrupted democracy in this country, the only responsibility we \nhave as life tenants, charged with however long we serve in this body, \nis to see to it that future generations will inherit an institution as \nsound and as credible and as filled with integrity as it was when we \ninherited it. To go in the direction we are headed here puts that, in \nmy view, in peril and danger because of the very reason we are \nexcluding too many Americans from having a voice to participate in our \npolitical process.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator from Connecticut yield for another \nquestion?\n  You might call it a plutocracy, but let me ask you this. To my \nunderstanding, our colleague from Tennessee is talking about individual \nlimits that basically amount to $5,000 for the 2-year cycle. The amount \nan individual can give to a party goes from $20,000 to $40,000 to \n$80,000 per cycle. What concerns me maybe even more is that the \naggregate limit, am I correct, goes from $30,000 to $50,000, so it is \n$100,000 per cycle?\n\n  Mr. DODD. Yes. I did not get to that, but that is further down the \nline.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me ask my colleague this. I would argue that what \nwe are now doing with the proposal of the Senator from Tennessee is \nactually making hard money soft money when you get to the point where \npeople can now contribute up to $100,000 per cycle.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague, I will regain my time a little bit \nhere, and then I will yield to him.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Here is my question. Do you think that when people in \nConnecticut--and I see Congressman Shays is here--or people from \nMinnesota, or people from Rhode Island--people around the country--read \na headline, if this amendment passes--I certainly hope it is defeated--\n``The Senate Passes Reform, Brings More Big Money Into Politics,'' do \nyou think people are going to view this as reform? Do you think taking \nthese spending limits off and having us more dependent on the top 1 \npercent of the population--do you think most people in the country in \nthe coffee shops are going to view this as reform, or do you\n\n[[Page S2967]]\n\nthink they are going to feel even more disillusioned about what we have \ndone, if we support this amendment?\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest more of the latter. I didn't get to that part of \nthe amendment yet, but the Senator from Minnesota is correct.\n  I have a hard time saying this and keeping a straight face. Today, \nand for the last number of years, you could give up to the limit of \n$25,000 per calendar year to Federal candidates. There were 1,200 \npeople in America last year in part of the national campaign, including \nthe Presidency, the entire House of Representatives and one-third of \nthe Senate, who wrote checks contributing the $25,000 limit. I think it \nwas 1,238 Americans to be exact.\n  But now we are saying--This is too tough. This is a real burden. \nThese poor people out there, they are upset about this. We have to do \nsomething for these folks. This is outrageous that they have an \naggregate limit for each individual of $25,000. We are going to double \nthat cap.\n  We are going to say to them--The aggregate limit is now $50,000 per \nindividual per calendar year. As I have suggested, as a practical \nmatter, a husband and wife have their individual limits. If you can \nwrite a check for $50,000, I will guarantee that the couple can write \nchecks totaling $100,000 in aggregate limits.\n  My colleague from Minnesota is correct. This is the softening of hard \nmoney. I don't know of anybody who keeps personal accounts--I am not \ntalking about candidates no. I am talking about the average citizens. \nIf they have a bank account at the Old Union Savings and Trust, or \nwhatever it is, then they have their soft account and their hard \naccount. I don't know of anybody, particularly average citizens, who \nsegregates their own wealth that way. They write checks for \npoliticians. They are told they have to send this to the soft money \nnon-Federal account or instead, to the hard-money Federal account. But \nthe average citizens do not keep money nor accounts that way. When they \nare writing checks for $100,000 and we say, ``That could be all hard \nmoney,'' we make the contributor dizzy. They get nervous when you start \ntelling them about soft and hard money. Money is money.\n  The fact is, it is too much money in the political process. The \naverage citizen who hears about this throws up their hands. They shake \ntheir heads in utter disgust. They must think, what are these people \nthinking about. How disconnected can they be from the people of their \nStates and their constituencies. It is not understandable to the \naverage American if we sit here with a straight face and suggest that \nraising the maximum aggregate annual limits from $25,000 to $50,000 per \nyear, which could total $100,000 per year per couple.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Does the Senator realize that the $50,000 he is \nconcerned about now, which is doubling the $25,000, would be about \n$75,000 in 1974 terms? In other words, when our predecessors looked at \nthis problem in 1974, they decided that for an individual limit for \nthat year, it ought to be $75,000, roughly, in 2001 dollars. So \nactually by doubling it, we are not keeping up with inflation.\n  In terms of real purchasing power, they were higher than we are \ntoday. Did they miss the boat that badly back when they addressed this?\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest they may have.\n  I am not sure I heard my friend from Tennessee talk about statements \nmade in 1971 or 1972. Prior to the adoption of the legislation after \nWatergate in 1974, people such as former distinguished colleague George \nMcGovern and others who had suggested limits that were higher than even \nwhat we are talking about. I would be curious to know, had we said to \nthem at that time, by the way, as a result of what you are doing, what \nthe cost of an average Senate race would be 25 years from now, that \neven with $1,000 limits, we would be looking at a $7 million cost, when \nin 1976, the average cost was $400,000, and if you buy into this, it is \ngoing to rise to $7 million.\n\n  My concern is, by doubling the limits, we are inviting those numbers \nto go up. We are doing nothing about trying to at least slow this down \nfrom the direction it is clearly headed in: $13 million in 10 years, an \naverage cost of a Senate seat. We are going to make this the Chamber of \nthe rare few who can afford to be here or have access to these kinds of \nresources.\n  I accept the notion that costs have gone up. I also accept the notion \nthat there are many more people today who could make that $1,000 \ncontribution than could in 1976. It was a relatively small number of \npeople then. Of course, that law also had other limitations which the \nCourt threw out after the adoption of the campaign finance reform \nmeasures of 1974.\n  I realize the contribution limit is going to go up. I am even willing \nto accept some increase in the numbers. I am not suggesting we ought \nnot to have any increase, although I could make a case for that.\n  I hope my friend from Tennessee and others who care about this--I \nknow a lot of Members do--that we can find some numbers here that would \nbe more realistic. The stated purpose must demonstrate that we are \ntrying to slow down the money chase. It should not get any more out of \nhand than it has.\n  If you don't think it is out of hand--I know there are Members who \ndon't--if you don't think the direction we are heading in is dangerous, \nif you don't think we are excluding more and more people every year, \nwhen you should look at the tiny percentage of people who actually can \nwrite these checks. During the 1999-2000 election cycle, the were only \n1,200 people who could write checks totaling $25,000 per year. Out of a \nNation of 280 million people, there were 230,000 people who wrote \n$1,000 checks. Basically we disregard most of the other contributors. \nIf you think we are heading in the right direction, then you ought to \nsupport this amendment.\n  If you think this is getting us dangerously close to the point where \nfewer and fewer people are going to participate in the process, then \nyou should oppose this amendment. I remind my colleagues that in the \nnational Presidential race last year, one out of every two eligible \nadult voters did not show up at the polls. Despite the fact we spent \nover $1 billion in congressional races, not to mention what was spent \non the Presidential race, one out of every two eligible adult voters of \nthis country did not vote. There is a reason for this statistic.\n  I suggest in part it is because people are feeling further and \nfurther and further removed from the body politic. If you will, the \nbody politic of our own Nation is being pulled further and further by \nexcluding the average American. They do not believe they have the \nability to have some say in politics. Their voices are being drowned \nout. Average Americans are further and further removed from being \ninvolved in the decision making process of who will represent them. \nThat worries me deeply. That is what troubles me about this amendment.\n  For those reasons, I will oppose the amendment when the vote occurs. \nI urge that others see if we can't find some configuration. I am still \nhopeful, I say to the Senator from Tennessee, that maybe some \nconfiguration here that can be founded. There are a couple of numbers I \ndidn't address, such as PAC limits, the State and local parties limit, \nthe national parties limit. I don't really disagree with my colleague \nregarding where he has come out on those numbers. In fact, he could \neven move them around a little more. I accept that.\n\n  The number I have objected to is the aggregate annual limit of \n$50,000 per calendar year. There has been another number suggested by \nour colleague from California. There is a possibility of a compromise \nin there somewhere that we might be able to reach. I am not interested \nin seeing us go through an acrimonious debate and having a series of \namendments where I think people recognizing the realities, could come \nto some reasonable compromise.\n  Our colleague from Tennessee has already reduced his original \nproposal by $500--as I think his original proposal was $3,000. He is \nnow proposing $2,500 with this amendment. It is presently $1,000 per \nelection under current law. It seems to me that if we are serious about \nthis, we will attempt to come to a compromise. For those of us who \nsupport McCain-Feingold, who want to see us send a bill to the \nPresident that he could sign, then I would urge, between this evening \nand tomorrow, that we might try to find that ground.\n  I know that there are many people here interested in doing that. I \nadd my\n\n[[Page S2968]]\n\nvoice to that. I am more than prepared to sit down with others who may \nbe so inclined to see if we can't find some numbers that we can live \nwith and defend. Numbers, I hope, that will both restrain the \nexponential growth of the cost of campaigns and not get us even further \nremoved from the average citizens' ability to participate in the \nprocess financially and otherwise.\n  I put that on the table for whatever value it may have. I hope there \nis something we can do. I commend my colleague. I mentioned how fond I \nam of him personally and what a contribution he has made to the Senate. \nHe has made very good suggestions in this amendment. While I disagree \nwith some basic points, there are elements with which I do not \ndisagree. I commend him for that and want to be on record in support of \nthose efforts he has made.\n  My colleague from New York has arrived. I don't know what my \ncolleague from Tennessee wants to do.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I will make a couple comments first. I \nthank my friend from Connecticut, who is eloquent, as usual, in his \nadvocacy. Clearly, what we are trying to do is reach a balance where we \nhave limits that are high enough for people to run decent campaigns, \nand allow challengers in large States such as California, Texas, and \nothers to have a decent chance to get a campaign off the ground, so you \ndon't have to be a multimillionaire or a professional politician in \norder to have a chance. That is what we are doing--trying to get it up \nenough so they have a fighting chance, while not getting so high that \nwe have a danger of corruption, or appearance of corruption. I don't \nreally detect that we are in that ballpark yet.\n  There is some talk that increasing the aggregate individual limits \nfrom $25,000 to $50,000 is somehow outrageous. But I don't think that \nthe ability to give several contributions, let's say, of $2,500 around \nthe country s going to corrupt anybody. No one person is receiving all \nthis money. No one person is receiving more than $2,500. So you don't \nhave a corruption issue there. And why we are doing something on behalf \nof democracy by limiting the number of potential candidates out there \nwho can get $2,500 kind of escapes me; plus the fact that in 1974, \nafter the Watergate scandal, when everyone was rather sensitive, shall \nwe say, about these issues and we addressed these issues, they came up \nwith a $1,000 limitation, which would be $3,500 today. They came up \nwith this $25,000, which--I am going to round it off 3 times--would be \n$75,000 today.\n  My colleagues heard my reference to Senators of the past, Democratic \nSenators and Republican Senators, many of whom wanted to go higher than \nwhat we are talking about today. My colleague is correct that I have \nscaled mine down because I had the temerity and audacity to think there \nwas a chance that we could index this to inflation and have basically \nactually a little less than inflation. But let's round it off and say \nbasically we can have the same dollars they had in 1974, right after \nthe scandal of the century, when people were most receptive and \nresponsive to this. But I found that was not to be the case. I don't \nthink that would have flown. Certainly, Senator Hagel's amendment today \ndid not fly. So I came back and said: OK, let's move down from \ninflation, move down from 1974 dollars, go to $2,500. There is no \ncorruption issue here. And these other limits, too, let's double some \nof them. We don't double all of them. But let's do something that will \nenhance McCain-Feingold, my friends.\n  As you know, I have supported McCain-Feingold from the beginning \nthrough thick and thin. My colleagues talk as if McCain-Feingold has \nalready passed and that the scourge of soft money has totally left us. \nThat is not the case.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my friend. I have respect for him and I know his \ncommitment to reform is so real. I want to ask him a question because I \nhave a concern. I would not go as high as $2,500. I can support a \n$2,000 raise. But that doesn't bother me very much. It is the aggregate \nlimit that bothers me.\n  A minute ago, my friend from Tennessee who, I repeat, I have such \nrespect for on this issue and on so many others, said it is not going \nto one person.\n  Why the aggregate limit raise gives me trouble is this. And I ask my \nfriend from Tennessee a question. It is true that in 1974, when this \nlaw passed, the aggregate limits didn't go to one person. Now, however, \nthey do--much of it. The reason is a series of Supreme Court rulings, \nas well as all of us, Democrats and Republicans, have become much more \nclever, and I know that people will donate the maximum limit to the \nnational party, and the national party then gives that money to the \ncandidate in their State, or the candidate they wish to see the \nnational party give the money to; and given the first 1996--maybe \n1998--Colorado decision, the party and the candidate can coordinate \ncompletely.\n  So I don't think it is correct for my good friend from Tennessee to \nsay the aggregate limits don't go to one person. They didn't in 1974; \nthey do now. If my friend from Tennessee had just decided to raise the \nindividual limits and kept the party limits the same, I would not have \nmuch of an argument with him. It is silly to quibble over $500, if I \nbelieve $2,000 is the right amount and he has an amendment for $2,500. \nBut it seems to me that under the new cases and under my friend's bill, \nsomebody could donate $40,000 per year to the national party, could do \nthat for 6 years, and thereby get $240,000 back to their candidate.\n  One other point, and I will ask my friend to comment. If the Supreme \nCourt in the second Colorado case rules that the limits that the \nnational party can give to the candidate, which is now 2 cents per \nvoter age person per State, or per district in the House--but if they \nrule, as many think they will, to eliminate those limits, then it would \nnot just be three or four people giving $240,000. It could be unlimited \nnumbers of people giving $240,000 to the national party, which then \ngives it back to the candidate, with complete coordination allowed.\n  So, frankly, even though I know this was not the intent of my friend \nfrom Tennessee, I shudder to think that the party limits would go up. \nAnd unless there were provision in my friend's bill that would not \nallow that to happen--and I think with Supreme Court rulings it would \nbe difficult to prevent--I think this would be a giant step backward, \nnot because of simply raising the limits but because of all the new \nways--I will be introducing tomorrow an amendment that tries to deal \nwith the 441(a)(d) problem. But I say to my friend--and this is not his \nfault--that even if McCain-Feingold were to pass as is, if the Supreme \nCourt rules that the 441(a)(d) limits go, then maybe we will accomplish \na 10-percent improvement in corporate and in labor changes. True, you \ncould not give more than whatever--you could not give $500,000 or a \nmillion, but you would not accomplish much.\n\n  The reason I am so worried about the amendment of my friend from \nTennessee is it makes it even easier; instead of saying $180,000 that \nsomebody could give in a Senate cycle, or $50,000 in a House cycle, \nthey could give $400,000 in a cycle and, again, without those limits, \nout the window everything goes.\n  I just ask my colleague from Tennessee, am I wrong in thinking that \nnow with the new Supreme Court decisions the aggregate limits are such \nthat they do allow just what my friend from Tennessee said he didn't \nwant the aggregate limits to do, which is give lots of money--call it \nhard or soft, whatever--to one campaign? I thank him for yielding and \nwill give him a chance to answer.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I respond first by saying that, based on \nmy recollection, I disagree with his analysis of the Colorado case. I \ndo not believe the Colorado case would allow coordination. I believe \ncoordination would run afoul--in the amounts we are talking about, \nwould run afoul of the hard money limits. Coordination would deem it as \na hard money contribution, and therefore that is not allowed.\n  With regard to the issue of an individual contributing to a State \nparty and having that earmarked for some particular candidate, again, I \nthink you get into a coordination problem.\n  I am somewhat amazed with this alchemy going on here. This piddling \nincrease that does not even keep up with\n\n[[Page S2969]]\n\ninflation has doubled, tripled, quadrupled, and now we are up into the \nstratosphere. A couple is automatically doubled. Are we assuming the \nhusband is going to tell the wife what to do or is the wife going to \ntell the husband what to do? I am not prepared to assume that. I do not \nthink my friend from New York is either.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It depends on the family.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I think the Senator from New York might agree that we \nshould not automatically double whatever the head of the household \nmight want to do politically.\n  Let us get back within the realm of reason. Clearly, the real world \nbeing what it is, there is certainly a risk of some things going on in \nterms of parties helping individual candidates at the expense of other \ncandidates. I do not think you can stop that.\n  My point is that the areas about which we are talking are \ninfinitesimal compared to the problem we are supposed to be addressing. \nWe are concentrating on the tail of the elephant instead of the \nelephant or we are concentrating on the tail of the donkey instead of \nthe donkey. We are talking about hard money, incremental increases that \ndo not amount to very much in terms of the increase but are very \nsignificant in terms of their being hard dollars instead of soft \nbecause it is not union money, it is not corporate money, if they are \nhard dollars to start with. I think we can agree that would be \nprogress.\n  Again, yes, the world has changed. Perhaps people have gotten more \nclever. They have gotten attorneys general who will give them \ninterpretations they like, and things of that nature, but when the \npeople addressed this back in 1974, they were talking about much more \nbuying power than we are talking about today.\n  Again, my colleagues are assuming they have soft money. That is the \nsituation in the bank, and now we are talking about the details. I \nsuggest that what my amendment will do is strengthen McCain-Feingold \nand ultimately make it something that will be more likely to pass the \nSenate, more likely to pass the House, and more likely to be signed by \nthe President of the United States.\n  I am trying to help my friends, as I always have, with regard to this \nissue.\n  We overlook what is going to happen if we do not make some progress \nin this hard money area. I am encouraged to hear my friend from \nConnecticut say he is willing to talk about it, and obviously I am, \ntoo, but I have been doing all the coming down and I have not seen much \ncoming up.\n  If we do not make some progress with regard to this area, we are \ngoing to create a situation where we have eliminated soft money, and we \nhave impoverished the hard money side of the equation. Both parties \nhave neglected the hard money side of the equation, the side that used \nto be predominant, by far, in terms of running these campaigns.\n  We are going to eliminate soft money, have an impoverished hard money \nsituation and have these independent groups continue doing what they \nhave been doing more and more.\n  People are going to react to that. That will not work. That will not \nwork in my estimation. I want to get rid of soft money. I am tired of \nreading all these stories about the money pouring in and this vote on \nthis major issue is going to go one way because the Democrats got this \nmoney and another way because the Republicans got that money. I am \ntired of all that.\n\n  I am telling my friends, if we do that and nothing else, we are going \nto wind up with a disfigured system that is worse than what we have \ntoday, and we will be back on the floor and all regulations will be \ntaken off.\n  There is sentiment out there that I think will be energized under a \nfew years of the system I just described, and we will be back here and \npeople will be making credible arguments that we tried this, we tried \nthat, candidates can no longer compete, and instead of having 98-\npercent reelection in the House, we will have 100 percent. They cannot \nget any higher than that. Challengers will not have a prayer, \nespecially in the larger States. The independent groups will double, \ntriple, and quadruple their buys in all of our States. Everybody will \nbe running our campaigns except ourselves, and these are just the \nincumbents. The challengers will have no prayer at all.\n  That, I say to my colleagues, will result in a reaction that none of \nus want, a reaction to take off absolutely all the limits. I say some \nof us--none of us on the reform side of this issue want. I had to stop \nand remind myself that some of my colleagues think that would be a \njolly good idea, which makes my point, that we are not as far away from \nthat possibility as we might think.\n  In summary, I say to my friend from New York and to my other \ncolleagues on this issue with whom I have worked side by side, it boils \ndown to this: $5,000--let's say you double it to take care of the \nprimary and the general election. Somebody can contribute $5,000.\n  Mr. President, $5,000 is different than $100,000; $5,000 is different \nthan $500,000; $5,000 is different in every way quantitatively and \nqualitatively from $1 million. That is what we ought to be \nconcentrating on, but in order to get rid of those large dollars, we \nhave to give a candidate an even chance of running so he is not totally \ndependent on that soft money and he is not even totally dependent on \nhis party and having somebody in Washington dole out the checks and \ndecide which one of the potential challengers has a chance and which \none does not.\n  Hopefully, at the end of this, we will have an opportunity to adopt \nthis amendment and still be open for further discussion.\n  I reiterate, this amendment strengthens the cause. This amendment \nstrengthens the cause; it does not weaken the cause. The fact that \nsomeone cannot contribute to the limits we might raise, to that point I \nsay there are plenty of people who cannot contribute to the $1,000 \nlimit we have today. We have diminished their freedom when we raise it \nto $1,000, recognizing you have to have some money to run.\n  If somebody can give $200, do we diminish their freedom? Are we \ncausing their levels of cynicism to rise because we had a $1,000 limit? \nIf we have a $2,500 limit, there will be some people who can give \n$1,000 or $500 or $700. Maybe not the full amount. The fact that you \ncan give the full amount does nothing to my freedom or to my \ncitizenship because I cannot at the present time give as much as you \ncan.\n  As long as we live in a free country and I can aspire to that, there \nis no legal impediment to me doing that. I do not think we do anything \nto empower those who cannot necessarily give to the maximum of whatever \nlevel we raise because they cannot do it now. We are getting off the \nfocus.\n  The focus ought to be on the issue of corruption, which cannot be the \ncase. If so, our forbears in 1974 missed the mark, if we say corruption \nkicks in in these cases or the appearance of corruption. The other side \nof the equation, of course, is making it so people can run a decent \ncampaign and get their message out and especially challengers.\n  I cite, again, the independent study that was done by the Campaign \nFinance Institute affiliated with George Washington University. It says \nfrom a competition standpoint, upping the individual contribution limit \nhelps nonincumbent Senate candidates while having little impact on the \nHouse.\n\n  I can understand all the positions that my friends who oppose this \namendment take with regard to it, but one might listen to that and \nthink this is something outrageous we are proposing. I cite David \nBroder, I cite Stuart Taylor, I cite almost any commentator I have read \non the subject. I think I am paraphrasing correctly. It was certainly \nreasonable to raise the limits to $2,000 or $3,000, and of course we \nare coming in the middle of that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be given 7 \nminutes from the time of the opposition.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I reiterate a statement made in my dialog \nwith the Senator from Tennessee. I did not hear him actually rebut what \nI said.\n  We focus too much on the smaller individual limits which go up from \n$1,000 to $2,500. I have no problem keeping\n\n[[Page S2970]]\n\nthem at $1,000. I have no problem raising them to $2,000. Yes, $25,000 \nis pretty large but hardly worth falling on a sword in terms of the \nbill.\n  There is truly an egregious problem with the amendment of my friend \nfrom Tennessee, and that is the raising of the aggregate limits. Under \nthe new aggregate limits, there is complete coordination allowed by the \nSupreme Court when a national party contributes to the candidate. It is \nan expenditure. There is total coordination allowed. Under his \nproposal, a candidate could give to that national party $40,000 a \nyear--this is not $1,000 or $2,000 but $40,000 a year. In the Senate, \nwhich is 6 years, that is $240,000. Assume for the sake of argument the \nspouse is of a different political persuasion, $240,000 under the \nThompson amendment going directly to one candidate. That could be done \nover and over and over again if the 441(a)(d) limits go to candidate \nafter candidate after candidate.\n  There is a serious problem with the amendment of my friend from \nTennessee. It is not the raising of $1,000 to $2,500. It is the huge \nraise of the aggregate limits. We all know right now people raise money \nfor their campaigns in $20,000 bits, the maximum allowable to a party. \nIt is limited by the 441(a)(d) expenditure limits, 2 cents a voter. \nThose are likely to go in a month or two. Once they go, it won't \nmatter, for most contributors, the contributors of wealth, whether the \nlimit is $1,000 or $2,000 or $3,000; they can give to the candidate of \ntheir choice $40,000; $40,000 to the national party, again, \nconstitutionally protected by the United States Supreme Court. That \nnational party can coordinate with the candidate.\n  This is not a minor increase. That is not simply a rate of inflation \nincrease. That is undoing a large part of eliminating soft money.\n  My friend from Tennessee talks about it being hard money. The way I \nthought about it, a large amount of individual money that goes to a \ncandidate, whether it is funneled through a party or goes directly to a \ncandidate, is what we are trying to prevent. You can call it hard \nmoney, but $40,000 is awfully soft hard money.\n  The amendment is a serious mistake under present law. But the only \nsaving grace is that couldn't be done very often because there are \nlimits on how much the party can give each candidate. I repeat, if the \n441(a)(d) limits are eliminated, which many think they will be, then we \nhave gone amok. And we will go doubly amok with the amendment of my \nfriend from Tennessee.\n\n  This is not about raising the limits from $1,000 to $2,500. That is \nthe least of it. If the Senator from Tennessee were good enough to keep \nall the other limits in place and just raise the individual limit to \n$2,500 or even raise the PAC limit to $7,500, I would have an argument. \nBut it would be an argument against the current system. When he doubles \nthe amount of money that can be given to national party committees from \n$20,000 to $40,000, he makes it a heck of a lot easier--call it soft, \ncall it hard--for large amounts of money to be channeled directly to \nindividual candidates.\n  If I were a well-to-do person who wanted to aid a campaign, I \nwouldn't give $1,000 directly to the candidate. I wouldn't give $2,500 \ndirectly to the candidate. I would give $40,000 to the Senate \nRepublican committee, to the Senate Democratic committee and they, \nthen, could coordinate with the candidate I liked and give them all of \nthat money.\n  What are we talking about? The Senator from Tennessee keeps going \nback to 1974. We are not in 1974. We have had a number of Supreme Court \nrulings. We have had all sorts of consultants who have found ways \naround the law. The aggregate limit in 1974 seemed rather benign. It \nsaid, OK, you can only give to 25 candidates at $1,000 a head. The \naggregate limit in 2001 is pernicious because the combination of court \nrulings and figuring out ways around the law have allowed all of that \nmoney to be channeled to an individual candidate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I simply say the issue has been joined. \nMy position is my friend from New York is incorrect in terms of the \nlaw, his interpretation of the law in terms of a donor's legal right to \ncoordinate or direct the direction of his contribution to a particular \ncandidate. I do not think that is a correct interpretation of the law.\n  For anyone concerned about that, perhaps the Senator from New York \nand I can get together and hash this out tonight or in the morning, but \nI did want to state that issue. We have a disagreement on that.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Utah be given 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as I listened to the Senator from New \nYork give a hypothetical circumstance, I am reminded of the statement \nthat I was taught by a lawyer. As the Chair and my colleagues know, I \nam unencumbered by a legal education, so I have to defer to those who \nhave been to law school, but I am told that one of the factors in law \nschool they teach is hard cases make bad law.\n  The Senator from New York has described a theoretical, highly \nunlikely, hard case. If we were to legislate entirely on the basis of \nthat theoretical circumstance, we would make bad law. I am interested \nto hear the Senator from Minnesota go on at great length about how few \npeople give in these upper ranges. For the Senator from New York to be \ntalking about many people giving $40,000 to many candidates every year \nflies in the face of the actual circumstance and experience about which \nthe Senator from Minnesota talks.\n  As I say, I cannot comment on the legality of the cases that have \nbeen cited. But as an outside observer, listening to it, I simply say \nwe had a theoretical hard case which would, if we followed it, make bad \nlaw.\n  Let me comment on why I am in favor of the Thompson amendment. As the \nSenator from Tennessee indicated earlier, I am one who would be \ndelighted to see all limits disappear for a variety of reasons that I \nhave stated over the years about campaign finance and its challenges.\n  Let me run through a historic demonstration of why the green bars on \nthe Senator's chart keep going up. I got chastised in the press the \nother day for quoting Founding Fathers and talking about the Founding \nFathers--as if they were irrelevant.\n  Quite aside from the philosophy, there is much we can learn from the \nFounding Fathers because every one of them was a very practical, very \nreal politician. They had to run for election, too. They understood the \npolitical process. As I pointed out, George Washington won his \nelections by buying rum punch and ginger cakes for the assembled \nelectorate. That is how they did it in those days. James Madison \nrefused to do it and got defeated. So this issue is not new.\n  But when they were writing the Constitution, George Washington, as \nthe President of the Constitutional Convention, never spoke except when \nhe recognized one or the other delegates to the convention--except on \none issue and that issue was how big congressional districts should be. \nThe original proposal was that a congressional district should \nrepresent 50,000 people. The motion was made; no, let's cut that down \nto 30,000 people.\n  George Washington stepped from his chair as President of the \nConstitutional Convention to endorse the idea that it be cut down to \n30,000 because, he said, a Representative has too much to do if he has \nto represent as many as 50,000 people. That is just too big for a \ncongressional district.\n  So it was written into the original Constitution, 30,000, with, of \ncourse, the understanding that Congress could change that.\n  I now come from the State that just by 800 people missed getting a \ncongressional seat in the last redistricting. Our State has the largest \ncongressional districts, therefore, of any in the country--roughly \n700,000 people per congressional district.\n  So if you want to talk about inflation in campaigns, go for a House \ncampaign that, in George Washington's day, had to go for a population \nof 30,000 people to, today, where the seat represents 700,000 people--\nmore than 20 times increased.\n  So it is not just inflation of money; it is inflation of challenge to \nmeet that many people. How do you do it? You do not do it shaking \nhands. You do not do it speaking to Rotary Clubs and Kiwanis Clubs. You \ndo not do it by\n\n[[Page S2971]]\n\nholding town meetings. The only way you can reach 700,000 people for a \ncongressional seat, and 10 times that or more in many Senate seats, is \nto buy time. That is the only way you can do it. There is no other \nphysical way to let the people of your State know who you are, unless \nyou are an incumbent who has already had 6 years of free publicity, a \nsports hero--and we are getting more and more of those in Congress and \nsome of them are pretty good Members of Congress, but they would not be \nMembers if they had not had their names emblazoned on the front pages \nof the papers, a circumstance that is worth millions.\n  If somebody wants to start from scratch, run from obscurity, they \nhave to raise a lot of money because they have not been on the sports \npages and they have not been on the front pages. They have not had all \nthe free exposure. If they are not wealthy, they have to raise a lot of \nmoney. Raising money becomes harder and harder to do if you have a \nlimit on the amount you can raise that does not grow with inflation and \ndoes not grow with the number of people in your district.\n\n  The days when Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas could go around \nthe State of Illinois and hold debates where thousands of people would \ncome and stand in the Sun for 3 hours listening to them are over. We do \nnot have that kind of attention being paid to politics today.\n  When I run a campaign ad, I do not have to just compete with my \nopponent. We talk as if all the campaign advertising is between two \nopponents. When I run a campaign ad, it has to compete with the \nBudweiser frogs. It has to compete with all the other ads that are out \nthere that will crowd it out as far as public attention is concerned. I \ncan't just say here is where I am, and put my ad up and my opponent \nsays here is where I am and put his ad up because people are turning \noff the ads. They are going into the kitchen for a sandwich while the \ncommercials are on. I have to have so many that I cut through the \nclutter of all the competition that has nothing to do with politics. \nAnd that means I have to raise a lot of money.\n  It becomes harder and harder to do that if the limits do not grow, \neither with inflation in money or with inflation in the population I \nrepresent or with inflation in the amount of competing advertising that \nis there.\n  In my first race, we bought ads on all of the network stations, and I \nthought we were reaching the public. Then my ad adviser came to me and \nsaid we were getting killed in the ad war. I said: What do you mean? We \nare doing fine.\n  He said: You are not on cable and your opponent is on cable.\n  I hadn't thought about cable. I don't have cable in my house. So we \nhad to buy ads on cable.\n  The number of outlets keeps increasing and the number of challenges \nto meet those outlets keeps going up. Yet we stick with a limit of the \namount we can raise in the face of all of these increases.\n  So it only makes sense to index the amount we spend, not only to \ninflation of dollars but index to the inflation of the challenge that \nwe face in spending those dollars to reach the voter because you get \nless and less bang for your buck, even if the number of bucks goes up \naccording to monetary inflation.\n  I support this amendment. It is only common sense. It will not lead \nto the kind of theoretical disaster about which the Senator from New \nYork talks. It will only make it possible, slightly easier, for \nchallengers to get a little traction against incumbents. I still think \nit is not easy enough and I quote again the primary example of a \nchallenger who took on an incumbent and knocked him off, which was \nEugene McCarthy in 1968, who went to New Hampshire against an incumbent \nPresident and won enough votes in the New Hampshire primary to cause \nLyndon Johnson to resign the race and announce he would not run.\n  Understand how he did that; that is how McCarthy did that. He got \nfive people to give him $100,000 each. So he went to New Hampshire with \na war chest of $500,000 in 1968. In today's money, that is $2 million \nor more. Under today's rules, he could not begin to do that. Under \ntoday's rules, for him to raise $100,000, he would have to go to 100 \ndifferent people and do that five times over. His chances of getting \nthat done would be very slim.\n  So I endorse this amendment. I am happy on the occasion of campaign \nfinance reform to finally be in agreement with my friend from Tennessee \non something relating to this bill. I hope we reject all of the \ntheoretical arguments and live in the real world where this amendment \nmakes enormous good sense.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes in opposition.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me say I know how much Senators \nThompson and Collins believe in campaign finance reform. They have been \ntwo of the real stalwarts of trying to help us get rid of the soft \nmoney loophole. So this is a disagreement in which I take no particular \npleasure, to put it mildly. They have been some of the strongest \nsupporters for campaign finance reform.\n  I do not agree with their amendment. The limits that are created are \nway too high, and it is going to create some of the same problems that \nthe soft money loophole has created in terms of the size of the \ncontributions that will be permitted. It will not be through \nunregulated money, the soft money loophole, but it will be through \nregulated increases in the total aggregate amounts which are simply too \nhigh to create public confidence that we are doing the right thing, \nthat we are not selling access to ourselves for large amounts of money, \nthat we are not accepting contributions of large amounts of money from \npeople who have significant business before the Congress.\n  We are at an important moment in the Senate's consideration of this \nbill. It is a point where we are going to have to decide whether we are \ngoing to hold the line on real reform, which not only means eliminating \nthe soft money loophole, which I think we are on the verge of doing, \nbut also in terms of putting some reasonable, modest limits on \ncontributions so we do not have aggregate contributions that are so \nlarge that the public will lose confidence in the electoral process. \nThey could lose confidence, whether we call it soft money or hard \nmoney, if the amounts which flow into these campaigns, either directly \nor indirectly, are too large.\n  We become addicted to large sums of money. It is easier to raise a \nlarge sum of money from a few people than it is to raise a small sum of \nmoney from many people. That is how we got started on soft money. That \nis why it is called soft money. And that is why regulated money is \ncalled hard money.\n  It is hard to raise money with real limits. But now that we are close \nto banning soft money--hopefully--to going cold turkey on the enormous \ncontributions that the soft money loophole has let us raise from a \nsmall number of individuals, now I am afraid we are going to be looking \naround for other opportunities to raise large sums of money.\n  It is like a smoker who wants to quit who looks under the sofa \ncushions for a cigarette they may have dropped 3 months ago. We are \nlooking around for someplace to still get large contributions.\n  The categories for the amount of money that an individual can give to \na party and the aggregate that an individual can give in any 1 year to \ncandidates, parties, and PACs looks to be a very large pot of money. We \nhave to resist the temptation--that is what it is properly called, at \nleast for some of us--to raise the aggregate limits to sums which to \nthe average American seem horrendously large.\n  The Thompson-Collins amendment doubles the limits for parties and the \nyearly aggregate, so that one individual, under the Thompson-Collins \nproposal, can give as much as $100,000 in a cycle. That is $50,000 a \nyear to the parties and candidates and PACs that the individual \nsupports. So a couple could give $200,000 over 2 years, and it can be \nsolicited all at one time--from you, from me, from a Member of the \nHouse, from the President, the Vice President, and the political \nparties--because what is before us would raise the hard money limits.\n  It means that any of us can solicit the amounts of money which are \nunder\n\n[[Page S2972]]\n\nthat aggregate or within the aggregate. That would mean, if this \namendment passes, we could call up a couple and say: Can you contribute \n$200,000 in this cycle to our party and to the candidates we are \nsupporting?\n  It is too big an amount. It puts us in a position which I believe we \nshould not be in, which is to be competing in this arena for large \ncontributions, which have undermined public confidence in the electoral \nprocess.\n\n  Too often when these large contributions have been what is being \nsolicited--in the past with soft money, the unregulated money, but now \nif this amendment passes up to $200,000 a cycle per couple in hard \nmoney, usually we have gotten into the sale of access, the open, \nblatant sale of access. Nothing hidden about that.\n  Just a couple of examples--one from each party because this is a \nbipartisan problem.\n  First, for a Democratic National Committee trustee, which is shown on \nthe board before us--this is for a $50,000 contribution or raising \n$100,000--a contributor gets two events with the President, two annual \nevents with the Vice President, an annual trade mission where the \ntrustee is invited to ``join Party leadership as they travel abroad to \nexamine current and developing political and economic [trends].'' And, \nby the way, this same thing was used in a Republican administration--\nvisiting foreign dignitaries at the highest level. So this is not, \nagain, a partisan issue. It is the sale of access for huge amounts of \nmoney. And the larger the amount of money that we permit to be \nsolicited, the worse, it seems to me, the appearance is when access is \nso openly and blatantly sold for that contribution.\n  That is what the temptation is. There is nothing illegal about this. \nI think it is shocking, but it is not illegal. If we raise the hard \nmoney limits to this extent, this same kind of sale of access is going \nto continue for the large contribution, which I think is so totally \ndisenchanting our constituents.\n  On the Republican side, I have a chart in relation to a RNC annual \ngala. This is for a contributor who raises $250,000. He or she gets \nlunch with the Republican--Senate or House--committee chairman of their \nchoice.\n  I think that is wrong. I do not know how we can stop this kind of \nopen sale of access to ourselves for large amounts of money if we are \ngoing to increase hard limits, hard money contributions to the same \nextent as we see on these boards, when soft money was being used at \nthis level of contribution to tempt people to make contributions in \nexchange for that access.\n  Another invitation to a Senatorial Campaign Committee event: This one \npromised that large contributors would be offered ``plenty of \nopportunities to share [their] personal ideas and vision with'' some of \nthe top leaders and Senators. And then this invitation read the \nfollowing: Failure to attend means ``you could lose a unique chance to \nbe included in current legislative policy debates--debates that will \naffect your family and your business for many years to come.''\n  So for a large amount of money--in the view of most Americans, an \nexceedingly large amount of money--people are told they can have access \nto people who will affect their family and their business for many \nyears to come, and explicitly that if you do not purchase that access, \nfor a large amount of money, you could lose a unique chance to \nparticipate in a debate which ``will affect your family and your \nbusiness for many years to come.''\n  No American should think that because he or she cannot contribute a \nhuge sum of money they are then going to be unable to participate in a \ndebate which affects family and business for many years to come.\n  Another one: This one says: ``Trust members can expect a close \nworking relationship with all [of the party's] Senators, top \nAdministration officials and national leaders.''\n  The greater these contribution limits are, the worse, it seems to me, \nthe appearance is of impropriety, which is what we are trying to stop.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be yielded 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Supreme Court has held very explicitly, \nin Buckley v. Valeo, that large contribution limits can create the \nappearance of impropriety and that Congress has the right to stop that \nappearance of wrongdoing, that appearance of corruption, as the Court \nput it, which can be created by the solicitation of large amounts of \nmoney by people in power from constituents who have business before \nthem. The amounts of money which we are talking about in this amendment \nare simply too large.\n  We should not be tempted. It is easier to raise money in these large \namounts--we all know that--but we should not be tempted. If we are so \ntempted, we would be on the one hand closing the soft money loophole \nbut on the other hand creating the same problem by lifting hard money \nlimits to such a level that the same inappropriate appearance is \ncreated by the solicitation of contributions of this size.\n  I commend our friends and colleagues, Senators Thompson and Collins. \nThey have been staunch supporters of reform. It seems awkward being on \nthe other side from them on an amendment in this area, but I think it \nis a mistake to adopt this amendment. I hope we will reject it.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this morning I was unavoidably \ndetained for longer than expected at a doctor's appointment. Because of \nthat appointment I was not able to vote on the motion to table the \nfirst division of the Hagel amendment to the McCain-Feingold bill. My \nvote would not have changed the outcome on this amendment. I would have \nvoted to table.\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, my responsibilities to the people \nof the State of Montana require that I be in Montana during the \nPresident's visit to my State. However, because campaign finance reform \nis such an important issue, I would like to submit this statement on \nhow I would have voted on the following had I been present in the \nSenate today.\n  On the Hollings constitutional amendment. I voted for this amendment \nin the 105th Congress, and I would have voted for it again in the \n107th. This amendment would ensure that Congress had the ability to \ncombat the influence of money on the voting process.\n  On the Wellstone amendment, I would have voted for this amendment. I \nthink it is a step in the right direction because it does not single \nout one group and reduce its ability to communicate with the voters. \nThis amendment will create a more level playing field with regards to \nissue advertisements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/27/senate-section/article/S2972-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2972-S2973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now \nbe a period for the transaction of routine morning business with \nSenators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I applaud today's release of the Surgeon \nGeneral's report, ``Women and Smoking.'' It provides us with important \ninformation and recommendations to support our efforts to reduce \nsmoking among women and prevent girls from starting the deadly habit. \nThe results are disturbing and make it clear that we have a \nresponsibility to combat the epidemic of smoking and tobacco-related \ndiseases among women in the United States and around the world.\n  What the report makes clear is that we have been witness to an \nunprecedented tobacco industry marketing campaign targeted towards \nyoung women and girls. The consequences of this marketing campaign are \nstaggering. From 1991 to 1999, smoking among high school girls \nincreased from 27 to 34.9 percent. Since 1968, when Philip Morris \nintroduced Virginia Slims, the rate of lung cancer deaths in women has \nskyrocketed. In fact, lung cancer has surpassed breast cancer as the \nleading cause of cancer death in the United States, accounting for 25 \npercent of all cancer deaths among women.\n  I am pleased that Secretary Thompson was able to join Dr. Satcher \nthis morning to release the Surgeon General's report. I hope his \npresence signals the Bush administration's willingness to aggressively \npursue policies and legislation to combat tobacco use among our \nchildren.\n\n[[Page S2973]]\n\n  In particular, the report demonstrates the need for meaningful \nregulation of tobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration. \nToday, tobacco companies are exempt from the most basic health and \nsafety oversight of their products. Consumers know more about what is \nin their breakfast cereal that what is in their cigarettes. Tobacco \ncompanies are not required to test additives for safety or tell \nconsumers what is in their products. Nothing prevents them from making \nmisleading or inaccurate health claims about their products.\n  This lack of regulation impacts women as tobacco companies \naggressively target young girls through marketing campaigns linking \nsmoking to weight loss and women's rights and progress. For example, \none of the most famous ads directed at women was Lucky Strike's ``Reach \nfor a Lucky Instead of a Sweet.'' A recent Virginia Slims' ad campaign \ntold women that smoking could help them ``Find Your Voice.'' As the \nfather of two daughters, I find it unacceptable that young girls are \nrelentlessly barraged with slick marketing campaigns encouraging them \nto take up a deadly--and illegal--habit.\n  Also, recognizing that many women are concerned about the long term \nhealth risks of smoking, tobacco companies have been promoting ``low \ntar'' or ``light'' cigarettes to women as a ``safer'' option. Big \nTobacco is well aware that the health claims in their ads are either \nmisleading or entirely false. But it works. Currently 60 percent of \nwomen smokers use light and ultra light cigarettes.\n  These are just some of the reasons I, along with Senators Lincoln \nChafee and Bob Graham, introduced the first bipartisan tobacco \nlegislation in this Congress, the KIDS Deserve Freedom from Tobacco \nAct. Our bill would grant the FDA full authority to regulate the \nmanufacture, distribution, marketing, and sale of tobacco products to \nprotect our children from the dangers of tobacco use.\n  The results of the Surgeon General's report demonstrate the need for \nFDA authority over tobacco products. Today, I call upon Secretary \nThompson to make a commitment to the young girls and women of this \ncountry: that the Bush administration will make passing legislation \ngiving the FDA strong, meaningful regulatory authority over tobacco \nproducts a top priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/27/senate-section/article/S2973-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2973-S2974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as we celebrate National Women's History \nmonth, I pay tribute to the countless contributions made by women, past \nand present, those heralded and those unknown to most, who have \nadvanced the rights of women and enriched our Nation's history.\n  The month of March has been designated as National Women's History \nMonth to illuminate the tremendous accomplishments of women throughout \nhistory. I salute my colleagues, Senator Barbara Mikulski and Senator \nOrrin Hatch for cosponsoring legislation over two decades ago declaring \nNational Women's History Week. The celebration of women's history has \nsince been expanded into a month long tribute to commemorate the many \ncontributions of women.\n  This year's national theme, ``Celebrating Women of Courage and \nVision,'' seeks to spark interest in the many remarkable stories of \nwomen's achievements in our schools and communities. We must strive to \npresent history accurately, and in its entirety. History is not a \nwomanless story and it should not be presented as such to our youth. It \nis imperative that we share the rich stories of women's struggles and \nachievements with all our children, but especially with our girls. With \nthe benefit of strong female figures as role models, young women will \nhave a fuller vision of what is possible in their lives.\n  The advancement of women in the last century has been nothing short \nof remarkable. At the beginning of the last century, women generally \ndid not have the right to vote or own property. They could not hold \nmost occupations, participate in the armed forces, or aspire to \npolitical office. But as long ago as 1872, a little known milestone in \nthe fight for women's equality was achieved by the courageous actions \nof an Illinois woman.\n  Ellen Martin of Lombard, IL, understood her lack of legal \nentitlements in the late 1800s, but had the vision, the wits, and the \ndetermination to transcend the barriers around her. In the Presidential \nelection of 1872, almost 50 years prior to the passage of the 19th \nAmendment, Martin and fourteen other Lombard women marched to the polls \nand demanded their right to vote. At the time, Lombard, Il, was \ngoverned by its local charter of incorporation, which inadvertently \nstated that ``all citizens'' rather than ``all male citizens'' had the \nright to vote.\n  Armed with a law book and her spectacles, Martin asserted her \n``citizenship'' and demanded a ballot. Allegedly, the election judges \nwere so shocked by the demand that one gentleman actually ``fell \nbackward into a flour barrel.'' Ironically reminiscent of this year's \nunusual election, the votes of those 15 courageous women were \nextensively debated in the courts. But eventually, those 15 votes \nbecame the first women's votes ever to be counted in Illinois in an \nAmerican Presidential election.\n\n  Ellen Martin refused to be held down by the social and political \nmores of the day. She had the courage to challenge and conquer the \nbarriers that attempted to restrict her. And for her efforts, she won a \nsmall but important victory. Of course, it was not until 1920 that \nwomen's fundamental right to vote was expressly protected by the \nConstitution in the 19th Amendment. I am proud to say that Illinois was \nthe first State in the Union to ratify that long overdue amendment, \nguaranteeing women a voice in the political arena.\n  There are many little known milestones, similar to the story of Ellen \nMartin's courage, which reveal the heroism of women throughout our \nhistory. These stories are important and they are powerful, but they \ncan have little impact if they are not shared. Sadly, only 3 percent of \nour educational materials focus on women's contributions. Legislators \nin Illinois have recognized the need for the appreciation of the \nhistorical contributions of women and have mandated the teaching of \nwomen's history in K-12 classes. Only by recognizing the authentic \ncontributions of women will educators be truly faithful to our national \nheritage.\n  Today, women play a central role in the Nation's political and \neconomic arenas. I am privileged to work with 13 women Senators who \nprovide powerful examples to young women across the Nation. At the \nState level, women currently hold 27.6 percent of the statewide \nexecutive offices across the country and 22.4 percent of State \nlegislative positions. As Susan B. Anthony pointed out in 1897: ``There \nnever will be complete equality until women themselves help to make \nlaws.'' Women's representation in politics is not yet equal, but their \nincreasing prominence signals a step in the right direction.\n  Today, women participate in our economy in record numbers, both in \nthe workforce and as business leaders. Women own more than 9 million \nsmall businesses across the Nation, representing 38 percent of all \nsmall businesses nationwide. In Illinois, women own more than 250,000 \nfirms. With their comprehensive participation, it is beyond dispute \nthat women are vital to sustaining and improving our Nation's economy.\n  However, despite their strong presence in the workforce, women \ncontinue to earn less than men in this country. For every dollar a man \nearns, women on average earn only 73 cents. In Illinois, the wage gap \nis even larger: For every dollar earned by a man a woman earns only 69 \ncents. This wage gap persists despite the passage of the Equal Pay Act \nover three decades ago. Although the gap continues to shrink, the \nprogress is painfully slow, shrinking by a rate of less than a half a \npenny a year. In order to facilitate the closure of this gap, I urge my \ncolleagues to consider Senator Daschle's Paycheck Fairness Act, S. 77, \nof which I am a cosponsor. That bill would strengthen the enforcement \nmechanisms of the Equal Pay Act as well as recognize employer efforts \nto pay wages to women that reflect the real value of their \ncontributions. The wage disparities between men and women have endured \nfor far too long. We must approach the problem pro-actively and demand \nresults.\n  The dedication of March as Women's History Month provides an \nexcellent\n\n[[Page S2974]]\n\nopportunity to celebrate the many contributions of women that have \nshaped our history as well as the powerful influence that women \ncontinue to exert not only as business leaders and politicians, but \nalso as mothers, teachers, neighbors and vital members of the \ncommunity. But as we ``Celebrate Women of Courage and Vision,'' let us \nnot forget the battles that lie ahead for women as they continue to \nstruggle for full equality. As Alice Paul, a female attorney in the \nearly 1900s, eloquently noted: ``Most reforms, most problems are \ncomplicated. But to me there is nothing complicated about ordinary \nequality.'' Let us allow the simple principle of equality to guide us, \nas we strive to make history in further advancing the rights of women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/27/senate-section/article/S2974-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SMALL BUSINESS ENERGY EMERGENCY RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate approved S. 295, the \nSmall Business Energy Emergency Relief Act of 2001. This bill will \nprovide needed assistance to small businesses and farmers that have \nsuffered direct and substantial economic injury caused by significant \nincreases in the prices of heating oil, propane, kerosene, or natural \ngas.\n  Specifically, I would like to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member \nof the Small Business Committee, Senator Kit Bond and Senator John \nKerry, for their willingness to include an amendment sponsored by \nSenator Harkin and me. This amendment will help farmers offset the \nsurging costs of fuel. Farmers in my state and throughout the country \nhave been negatively impacted as a result of high energy prices on farm \nincome, due not only to the costs for fuel farmers need to run their \nequipment but also the increases in costs for fertilizer, which is made \nfrom natural gas.\n  Earlier this year, the spot price for natural gas had increased 400 \npercent from the year before. The Department of Energy is predicting \nthat natural gas rates this winter will be at least double last year's \nlevels. The most recognizable impact of this price spike has been on \nheating costs. However, many in the agriculture community are concerned \nwith the impact of these spiraling costs on agricultural producers, \nsince natural gas is the major component of nitrogen.\n  I am pleased that the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Small \nBusiness Committee agreed to include the Farm Energy Relief Act to \nallow the Secretary of Agriculture to declare a disaster area in \ncounties where a sharp and significant increase in the price of fuel \nand fertilizer has caused farmers economic injury and created the need \nfor financial assistance.

Mr. President, it is my great privilege to pay \ntribute to a Rhode Islander, Lieutenant Colonel Michael David, who will \nsoon complete 23 years of distinguished service to our Nation.\n  As friends and colleagues gather to honor Lieutenant Colonel David's \nretirement from the U.S. Air Force, I would also like to extend to him \nmy heartiest congratulations. Indeed, the State of Rhode Island is very \nproud and fortunate to have had a native of Warwick, RI represent us so \nwell. I join with all Rhode Islanders in expressing thanks to \nLieutenant Colonel David for the wonderful job he has done.\n  A graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy, Lieutenant Colonel David \nhas shared his expertise as he trained service men and women to fly the \nT-38 and C-141 aircraft at Air Force bases across our land; he has \nserved as a T-38 Instructor Pilot, a C-141 Instructor and Evaluator \nPilot. In addition, he has flown and led many world-wide airlift and \nformation airdrop missions. At present, he is charged with aiding the \nPentagon's top brass in leading the Armed Forces into the 21st century, \nequipping our military to meet the challenges of the 21st century.\n  Along the way, Lieutenant Colonel David has been awarded numerous \ndecorations including: Meritorious Service Medal, 2nd OLC, Aerial \nAchievement Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal, Air Force Achievement \nMedal, Combat Readiness Medal, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, \nNational Defense Service Medal, Southwest Asia Service Medal, Small \nArms Expert Pistol Ribbon, Air Force Legacy Service Award, Air Force \nTraining Ribbon, Joint Meritorious Unit Award and the Air Force \nOutstanding Unit Award. Lieutenant Colonel David currently has the \nDefense Superior Service Medal pending approval by the Chairman, Joint \nChiefs of Staff.\n  That is an impressive list! Out hats are off to Lieutenant Colonel \nDavid for these tremendous accomplishments.\n  Yet, we all know it is the military family that also deserves the \nrecognition and congratulations for the years of travel, leaving family \nand friends, and for their tireless energy and support of the United \nStates Armed Forces. For their outstanding dedication, I wish to \ncommend and congratulate Lieutenant Colonel David's wife, the former \nBernadette Louise Brennan, of Providence, and his two daughters, Ashley \nNicole David and Stephanie Michelle David.\n  In closing, I am pleased to offer my very best wishes to Lieutenant \nColonel David for happiness and fulfillment in his new endeavors. His \ncontributions certainly will be remembered for generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/27/senate-section/article/S2974-4", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2974-S2975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN HONOR OF COMMUNITY FOOD RESOURCE CENTER\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is my honor and pleasure to \ninform my fellow Senators that this year marks the 21st anniversary of \nCommunity Food Resource Center, a New York City organization that has \nbeen a leader in the fight for improved nutrition and economic well-\nbeing for all Americans.\n  CFRC's first project in 1980 was a school breakfast campaign. Since \nthen, CFRC has been instrumental in shaping and promoting child \nnutrition programs. Because of CFRC's efforts, for example, New York \nCity became the first major city to implement universal school meals on \na large scale.\n  I became familiar with CFRC because of my work on the Senate \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee. I have come to admire \nand respect the organization and its dedicated staff, and I feel \nhonored to have had the chance to work with them. Whatever the issue, I \ncan always count on CFRC to focus on the needs of those whose voices \nare rarely heard in the Capitol.\n  I would like to highlight just a few of CFRC's many innovative \nprograms. Its Community Kitchen of West Harlem provides meals to more \nthan 600 people nightly. Its CookShop program encourages schoolchildren \nto eat more fruits and vegetables. Its senior dinner programs use \nschool cafeterias after hours\n\n[[Page S2975]]\n\nto provide nutritious meals, social activities and an intergenerational \nprogram.\n  CFRC is also a leading advocate for government policies assisting \nlow-income individuals and families. At a time when Food Stamp \nparticipation is declining nationwide, CFRC's Food Force project sends \noutreach workers with laptop computers to community-based sites to pre-\nscreen thousands of needy New Yorkers. With TANF reauthorization \napproaching, CFRC's Welfare Made A Difference National Campaign is \nchallenging the stereotypes that led to passage of the 1996 welfare \nlaw.\n  CFRC is not only committed to making a difference, it is also \neffective. Each year, tens of thousands of New Yorkers benefit from \nCFRC's programs, and its advocacy has made a difference to millions of \nAmericans. I hope that 21 years from now, this country no longer needs \ngroups like CFRC. But if there are still those among us who are poor or \nhungry, I hope that CFRC is still here keeping their needs in the \nnational conscience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/27/senate-section/article/S2975-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the annual celebration of Greek \nIndependence Day that took place on Sunday, March 25 commemorated the \nindependence of Greece after 400 years of oppression under the Ottoman \nEmpire. The pages of our history books are filled with contributions \nthat the Greeks have made to society. Our system of government, our \nliterature, philosophy, religion, and mathematics all have their roots \nin Greek tradition. With the founding of the Olympic Games, the Greek \npeople taught us that there is more to be gained through peaceful \ncompetition than armed conflict.\n  Perhaps the greatest contribution that the Greek people have made is \na simple yet powerful idea that first conceived over 2,000 years ago. \nIt is the idea that citizens possessed the power to determine the \ncourse of a nation. The Athenian republic was the world's first \ndemocratic state, a fact respected by all free states today.\n  The bonds that join the United States and Greece extend back to the \nfounding of our country. When drafting our Constitution, our \nforefathers recognized the idealism and spirit of ancient Greece. \nInspired by our own struggle for independence, Greece followed forty-\nfive years later with its own struggle for independence. By celebrating \nthis day, we pay tribute to those Greek men and women who have made the \nultimate sacrifice in defense of the common cause of freedom. The \nUnited States has been able to proudly call Greece an ally in every \nmajor international conflict of the last century.\n  Those Americans that claim Greek heritage can be proud of the \ncontributions made by their ancestors. The many Greek sons and \ndaughters who have come to the United States have served honorably in \nall walks of American life. Greek culture continues to flourish in \nAmerican cities, thus contributing to the rich ethnic diversity of our \ncountry. It is with great honor that I commemorate the celebration of \nGreek independence. I look forward to the continuing cooperation and \nlasting friendship between the United States and Greece.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/27/senate-section/article/S2975-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DR. JOHN R. ARMSTRONG AND THE JOHN R. ARMSTRONG PERFORMING ARTS CENTER\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the L'Anse \nCreuse Public Schools and their Superintendent, Dr. John R. Armstrong, \nfor the opening and dedication of their beautiful new 999 seat \nauditorium. The L'Anse Creuse Public Schools have appropriately chosen \nto name this state of the art facility the John R. Armstrong Performing \nArts Center in recognition for all Dr. Armstrong has done to support \nthe arts, not only as the current Superintendent of the L'Anse Creuse \nPublic Schools in Harrison Township, Michigan, but also as a teacher \nand principal.\n  Dr. John R. Armstrong has served his community, state, and country in \ncountless ways. Since graduating from Bowling Green University thirty-\nfour years ago, he has been a dedicated teacher and administrator in \nthe L'Anse Creuse Public Schools. However, Doctor Armstrong's passion \nfor education and youth has led him to take an active role not just in \nthe school system, but in his community. He has held leadership \npositions in many civic organizations and institutions that seek to \nadvance educational causes such as Director of the Kellogg Math/Science \nGrant Program at Selfridge Air National Guard Base. In addition, Dr. \nArmstrong has been a board member of the Mt. Clemens YMCA, the Mt. \nClemens Art Center, the Macomb Literacy Project and the Traffic Safety \nAssociation of Macomb County.\n  Dr. Armstrong has worked extensively to increase funding for his \nschool district. He has presided over several capital campaigns and \nbond proposals that have allowed this growing school district to \nprovide an environment in which learning can flourish. While Dr. \nArmstrong has been superintendent, student achievement has soared, as \nevidenced by the fact that student's in his school district have \nimproved their test scores on the Michigan Education Assessment \nProgram, the PSAT, SAT and ACT at a rate that has exceeded the county, \nstate and national averages.\n  Just as importantly, Dr. Armstrong has worked to promote life-long \nlearning opportunities that realize that education should not be \nconfined within classroom walls. To that end, he has fostered cross-\ncultural exchanges, a co-operative art and design program with General \nMotors and a dialogue on issues between students and senior citizens. \nIn addition to supporting life-long learning for others, Dr. Armstrong \nhas led by example. Since coming to the L'Anse Creuse School District, \nhe has earned several teacher certificates, a master's degree and a \ndoctorate in education.\n  The L'Anse Creuse School District can take pride in the opening of \ntheir new auditorium, and Dr. Armstrong can take pride in his long and \nhonorable service to the students of not only the school district but \nof all Michigan. I hope my colleagues will join me in saluting both the \nL'anse Creuse School District and Dr. John R. Armstrong for their \ncontributions to their community and the State of Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/27/senate-section/article/S2975-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/27/senate-section/article/S2975-4", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/27/senate-section/article/S2975-5", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT OF THE CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING COVERING CALENDAR \n              YEAR 2000 MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 14\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to section 19(3) of the Public Telecommunications Act of \n1992 (Public Law 102-356), I transmit herewith the report of the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting covering calendar year 2000.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend titles V, XVIII, and XIX of the Social \nSecurity Act to promote tobacco cessation under the medicare program, \nthe medicaid program, and maternal and child health services block \ngrant program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nexpands treatment to millions of Americans suffering from a deadly \naddiction: tobacco. I am pleased to have Senators Brownback, Bingaman, \nand Graham of Florida join me in this effort. The Medicare, Medicaid \nand MCH Smoking Cessation Promotion Act of 2001 will help make smoking \ncessation therapy accessible to recipients of Medicare, Medicaid, and \nthe Maternal and Child Health, MCH, Program.\n  We have long known that cigarette smoking is the largest preventable \ncause of death, accounting for 20 percent of all deaths in this \ncountry. It is well documented that smoking causes virtually all cases \nof lung cancer and a substantial portion of coronary heart disease, \nperipheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, and \ncancers of other sites. And the harmful effects of smoking do not end \nwith the smoker. Women who use tobacco during pregnancy are more likely \nto have adverse birth outcomes, including babies with low birth weight, \nwhich is linked with an increased risk of infant death and a variety of \ninfant health disorders.\n  Still, despite enormous health risks, 48 million adults in the United \nStates smoke cigarettes, approximately 22.7 percent of American adults. \nThe rates are higher for our youth, 36.4 percent report daily smoking. \nIn Illinois, the adult smoking rate is about 24.2 percent. Perhaps most \ndistressing and surprising, data indicate that about 13 percent of \nmothers in the United States smoke during pregnancy.\n  Today, the Surgeon General released a new report that documents the \nhealth effects for women who smoke. Women now represent 39 percent of \nall smoking related deaths in the United States each year, more than \ndouble the percentage in 1965.\n  More than 21 percent of women in my state of Illinois smoke. Lung \ncancer is the leading cancer killer among women surpassing breast \ncancer in 1987, and smoking causes 87 percent of lung cancer cases. In \nfact, lung cancer death rates among women increased by more than 400 \npercent between 1960 and 1990. And smoking among girls is on the rise \nas well. From 1991 to 1999, smoking among high school girls increased \nfrom 27 to 34.9 percent.\n  There is no doubt that smoking rates among women and girls are linked \nto targeted tobacco advertising. The Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention's National Health Interview Survey showed an abrupt increase \nin smoking inititation among girls around 1967, about the same time \nthat Philip Morris and other tobacco companies launched advertisements \nfor brands specifically targeted at women and girls. Six years after \nthe introduction of Virginia Slims and other such brands, the rate of \nsmoking initiation of 12-year-old girls increased by 110 percent.\n  The report released today echoes this concern, highlighting the \ntargeting of women in tobacco marketing. Between 1995 and 1998, \nexpenditures in the United States for cigarette advertising and \npromotion increased from $4.90 billion to $6.73 billion. In 1999, these \npromotional expenditures leaped another 22 percent, to a new high of \n$8.24 billion.\n  As a result, we are not only paying a heavy health toll, but an \neconomic price as well. The total cost of smoking in 1993 in the U.S. \nwas about $102 billion, with over $50 billion in health care \nexpenditures directly linked to smoking. The Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, CDC, reports that approximately 43 percent of \nthese costs were paid by government funds, primarily Medicaid and \nMedicare. Smoking costs Medicaid alone more than $12.9 billion per \nyear. According to the Chicago chapter of the American Lung \nAssociation, my state of Illinois spends $2.9 billion each year in \npublic and private funds to combat smoking-related diseases.\n  Today, however, we also know how to help smokers quit. Advancements \nin treating tobacco use and nicotine addiction have helped millions \nkick the habit. While more than 40 million adults continue to smoke, \nnearly as many persons are former smokers living longer, healthier \nlives. In large part, this is because new tools are available. \nEffective pharmacotherapy and counseling regimens have been tested and \nproven effective. The Surgeon General's 2000 Report, Reducing Tobacco \nUse, concluded that ``pharmacologic treatment of nicotine addiction, \ncombined with behavioral support, will enable 10 to 25 percent of users \nto remain abstinent at one year of posttreatment.''\n  Studies have shown that reducing adult smoking through tobacco use \ntreatment pays immediate dividends, both in terms of health \nimprovements and cost savings. Creating a new nonsmoker reduces \nanticipated medical costs associated with acute myocardial infarction \nand stroke by $47 in the first year and by $853 during the next seven \nyears in 1995 dollars. And within four to five years after tobacco \ncessation, quitters use fewer health care services than continued \nsmokers. In fact, in one study the cost savings from reduced use paid \nfor a moderately priced effective smoking cessation intervention in \njust three to four years.\n  The health benefits tobacco quitters enjoy are undisputed. They live \nlonger. After 15 years, the risk of premature death for ex-smokers \nreturns to nearly the level of persons who have never smoked. Male \nsmokers who quit between just the ages of 35 and 39 add an average of \nfive years to their lives; women can add three years. Even older \nAmericans over age 65 can extend their life expectancy by giving up \ncigarettes.\n  Former smokers are also healthier. They are less likely to die of \nchronic lung diseases. After ten smoke-free years, their risk of lung \ncancer drops to as much as one-half that of those who continue to \nsmoke. After five to fifteen years the risk of stroke and heart disease \nfor ex-smokers returns to the level of those who have never smoked. \nThey have fewer days of illness, reduced rates of bronchitis and \npneumonia, and fewer health complaints.\n\n  New Public Health Service Guidelines released last summer conclude \nthat tobacco dependence treatments are both clinically effective and \ncost-effective relative to other medical and disease prevention \ninterventions. The guidelines urge health care insurers and purchasers \nto include counseling and FDA-approved pharmacotherapeutic treatments \nas a covered benefit.\n  Unfortunately, the federal government, a major purchaser of health \ncare\n\n[[Page S2982]]\n\nthrough Medicare and Medicaid, does not currently adhere to its own \npublished guidelines. It is high time that government-sponsored health \nprograms catch up with science. That is why we are introducing \nlegislation to improve smoking cessation benefits in government-\nsponsored health programs.\n  The Medicare, Medicaid and MCH Smoking Cessation Promotion Act of \n2000 improves access to and coverage of smoking cessation treatment \ntherapies in four primary ways.\n  First, our bill adds a smoking cessation counseling benefit to \nMedicare. By 2020, 17 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 years \nof age or older. It is estimated that Medicare will pay $800 billion to \ntreat tobacco-related diseases over the next twenty years. In a study \nof adults 65 years of age or older who received advice to quit, \nbehavioral counseling and pharmocotherapy, 24.8 percent reported having \nstopped smoking six months following the intervention. The total \neconomic benefits of quitting after age 65 are notable. Due to a \nreduction in the risk of lung cancer, coronary heart disease and \nemphysema, studies have found that heavy smokers over age 65 who quit \ncan avoid up to $4,592 in lifelong illness-related costs.\n  Second, our measure provides coverage for both prescription and non-\nprescription smoking cessation drugs in the Medicaid program. The bill \neliminates the provision in current federal law that allows states to \nexclude FDA-approved smoking cessation therapies from coverage under \nMedicaid. Ironically, State Medicaid programs are required to cover \nViagra, but not to treat tobacco addiction. Despite the fact that the \nStates are now receiving the full benefit of their federal lawsuit \nagainst the tobacco industry, less than half the States provide \ncoverage for smoking cessation in their Medicaid program. On average, \nstates spend approximately 14.4 percent of their Medicaid budgets on \nmedical care related to smoking.\n  Third, our legislation clarifies that the maternity benefit for \npregnant women in Medicaid covers smoking cessation counseling and \nservices. Smoking during pregnancy causes about 5-6 percent of \nperinatal deaths, 17-26 percent of low-birth-weight births, and 7-10 \npercent of preterm deliveries, and increases the risk of miscarriage \nand fetal growth retardation. It may also increase the risk of sudden \ninfant death syndrome, SIDS. And a recent study published in the \nAmerican Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine shows that \nchildren whose mothers smoke during pregnancy are almost twice as \nlikely to develop asthma as those whose mothers did not. The Surgeon \nGeneral recommends that pregnant women and parents with children living \nat home be counseled on the potentially harmful effects of smoking on \nfetal and child health. A new study shows that, over seven years, \nreducing smoking prevalence by just one percentage point would prevent \n57,200 low birth weight births and save $572 million in direct medical \ncosts.\n  Fourth, our bill ensures that the Maternal and Child Health Program \nrecognizes that medications used to promote smoking cessation and the \ninclusion of anti-tobacco messages in health promotion are considered \npart of quality maternal and child health services. In addition to the \nwell-documented benefits of smoking cessation for maternity care, the \nSurgeon General's report adds, ``Tobacco use is a pediatric concern. In \nthe United States, more than 6,000 children and adolescents try their \nfirst cigarette each day. More than 3,000 children and adolescents \nbecome daily smokers each day, resulting in approximately 1.23 million \nnew smokers under the age of 18 each year.'' The goal of the MCH \nprogram is to improve the health of all mothers and children. This goal \ncannot be reached without addressing the tobacco epidemic.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by ENACT, a coalition of more than \n60 national health organizations including the Campaign for Tobacco \nFree Kids, the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, \nthe American College of Chest Physicians, the Association of Maternal \nand Child Health Programs, and the American Public Health Association.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me not only in cosponsoring this \nlegislation but also in working with me to see that its provisions are \nadopted before the year is out. As the Surgeon General has said, \n``Although our knowledge about tobacco control remains imperfect, we \nknow more than enough to act now.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 622\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act and \nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to improve access \nto health insurance and Medicare benefits for individuals ages 55 to \n65, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a 50 percent \ncredit against income tax for payment of such premiums and of premiums \nfor certain COBRA continuation coverage, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the problem of the uninsured \ncontinues to plague our Nation, and it is particularly severe for older \nAmericans who are facing the loss of health coverage but who are not \nyet eligible for Medicare. Today, over 40 million Americans are without \nhealth insurance.\n  Adults between the ages of 55 to 65 are the fastest growing group of \nuninsured. Individuals 55 and older who have been laid off or retire \nearly are particularly vulnerable to loss of health insurance. They \nhave a difficult time buying health insurance on their own because they \ntend to have more chronic health problems that can result in either the \ndenial of coverage, limited coverage, or very expensive policies.\n  This is the age group where early detection and access to \npreventative care become crucial. For example, only 16 percent of \nuninsured women report having had a mammogram in the past year, \ncompared to 42 percent of insured women. Because regular preventative \ncare is not received, the uninsured are more likely to be diagnosed at \na more advanced stage of cancer, over 40 percent more likely to be \ndiagnosed with late stage breast and prostate cancer, and more than \ntwice as likely to be diagnosed with late stage melanoma than the \ninsured.\n  The uninsured are more likely than those with insurance to be \nhospitalized for conditions that could have been avoided, such as \npneumonia and uncontrolled diabetes. Delaying or not receiving \ntreatment can lead to more serious illness and avoidable health \nproblems, which has a direct impact on the health care needs of this \nsegment of the population as they become old enough for Medicare \ncoverage.\n  Lack of insurance and gaps in coverage affect more than just those \nwithout insurance. There is a cost to society, as well. When an \nuninsured person goes to a public hospital or clinic, and emergency \nroom, or a private physician for care and cannot pay the full cost, \nsome of the bill is passed on to those who do pay, through higher \ninsurance premiums and in the form of taxes supporting our public \ninsurance programs. One way or another, we all pay indirectly for \nhaving a large and growing uninsured population.\n  With the aging of the baby boom generation, this particularly \nvulnerable age group is expected to increase significantly. In 1999, \nthere were 23.1 million Americans in this age group. This is expected \nto increase to 35 million Americans by the year 2020. Unless we effect \npositive change to address the barriers facing the growing number of \nuninsured in this age group, this problem will only get worse.\n  I join Senators Kennedy, Daschle, and Sarbanes, and Representatives. \nStark, Brown, Gephardt, Rangel, Dingell, and a number of their \ncolleagues today to introduce an improved version of the Medicare Early \nAccess Act. Our legislation will create an opportunity for people \nbetween ages 55 and 64 to purchase Medicare coverage, which is really \nthe only affordable option for this group, because of their age and the \nlikelihood of chronic and/or preexisting conditions.\n  The Medicare Early Access and Tax Credit Act would reduce the number \nof uninsured Americans by more than 500,000. This bill provides new \ninsurance coverage options through a Medicare buy-in for people aged 55 \nthrough 64 or through a special COBRA continuation program for workers \naged 55 through 64 whose employers reneged on the promise of retiree \nhealth coverage.\n  This legislation improves upon the existing Medicare Early Access Act \nby adding a new 50 percent federal tax credit to the program to make it \nmore affordable for people age 55 and over to obtain health insurance \ncoverage. By including a tax credit, we are making this option \navailable to a broader range of people.\n  A survey released last session by the Commonwealth Fund finds that \none in five people from age 50-64 reported a period of time when they \nwere without health insurance coverage since turning age 50. Access to \nemployer insurance is reduced as people approach age sixty-five and \nretire. Consequently, older Americans rely most heavily on individual \ninsurance, which is expensive and limited for people with serious \nhealth problems. Because average health expenses increase sharply with \nage, people closest to age sixty-five face the greatest risk of being \nuninsured and being charged the highest premiums in the individual \nmarket. Clearly, we need to take real steps to address the needs of \nthis population.\n  The Commonwealth survey also found that, when asked what source they \nwould trust more to provide health insurance for adults ages 50 to 64, \nMedicare outranked employer-sponsored coverage and direct purchase of \nprivate individual health insurance. Half of uninsured adults ages 50-\n64 said they would trust Medicare the most as a source of coverage.\n  The Medicare Early Access and Tax Credit Act provides an insurance \noption for people who are unable to purchase health insurance in the \nprivate market either because of pre-existing conditions, age related \npremium increases, or both.\n  The Medicare Early Access and Tax Credit Act is not the solution to \nsolving America's health insurance coverage problems. But, it is a \nsimple and obvious step to take to open new doors to a vulnerable \nsegment of our population who are lacking affordable coverage \nelsewhere, and who need the opportunity to buy in to Medicare. I urge \nmy colleagues to join us in making health insurance a reality for \npeople in their later years of life, who are not yet eligible for the \nsafety net of Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 623\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprovide to private sector employees the same opportunities for time-\nand-a-half compensatory time off and biweekly work programs as Federal \nemployees currently enjoy to help balance the demands and needs of work \nand family, to clairfy the provisions relating to exemptions of certain \nprofessionals from minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Fair \nLabor Standards Act of 1938, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that, \nif enacted, could have a monumental impact on the lives of thousands of \nworking men, women and families in America. Today, with Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison, I am pleased to introduce the Workplace Flexibility \nAct. The Workplace Flexibility Act has as its primary purpose, giving \nfamilies and employers greater flexibility in meeting and balancing the \ndemands of work and family.\n  The demand for family time is significant. In fact, families today \nare spending close to 40 percent less time with their families and \nchildren than in the 1960s. This is an important and even critical \nissue to many Americans. In fact, survey upon survey has found that the \nissue of workplace flexibility and family time is the number one issue \nwomen want addressed.\n  The Workplace Flexibility Act is not a total solution, but it is an \nimportant part of the solution. It gives working families a choice.\n  The Workplace Flexibility Act in a nutshell consists of two main \nprovisions. The first allows employees the option of taking time off in \nlieu of overtime pay. The second gives employees the option of \n``flexing'' their schedules over a two week period. In other words, \nemployees would have 10 ``flexible'' hours that they could work in one \nweek in order to take 10 hours off in the next week. Flexible work \narrangements have been available to Federal government workers since \n1978. In the 1970's, 80's, and 90's federal government workers have had \nthis special privilege. The Federal program was so successful in fact, \nthat the President in 1993 issues an Executive Order extending it to \nparts of the Federal Government that had not yet had the benefits of \nthe program.\n  Yet members of the private sector do not have this option. The \nWorkplace Flexibility Act corrects this and extends this option to all \nbusinesses covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  So, who are these workers who are currently covered by the FLSA but \ndo not have the ability to exercise workplace flexibility? They are \nsome of the hardest working Americans. Sixty percent of these workers \nhave only a high school education. Eighty percent of them make less \nthan $28,000. A great\n\n[[Page S2990]]\n\npercentage of them are single mothers with children. They are working \nhard to meet their family's economic needs as well as their emotional \nneeds. And while government can't mandate love and nurture, it can get \nout of the way and eliminate barriers to opportunities for love and \nnurture. That is what the Workplace Flexibility Act does.\n  In the subsequent weeks and months we will undoubtedly hear from some \nthat what working families really need is more money. They need their \novertime pay. That may well be true for some families, and this bill \ndoes not affect them in any way. But for other families, for families \nwho want to choose to take time off with pay to attend a child's school \nplay or PTA meeting, the issue is time, not money. The point is this--\nthe family should have the right to choose. Washington should not \ndecide for them which priority is important for their family.\n  I am one who believes in the working men and women of America and in \ntheir ability to know what is best for their families. It is time for \nCongress to give families what they want, and not what Congress thinks \nthey need. It's time to give working families what every Federal \nemployee has already, workplace flexibility.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a bill summary \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 624\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

For hours worked in excess of 80 in a \n2 week period, a worker would have to be compensated either in cash or \nin paid comp time, if the employer has agreed to a comp time option, \neach at not less than a time-and-a-half basis.\n  Like comp time, this program is completely voluntary and may not \naffect collective bargaining agreements that are in force.\n  Congress would be covered by both provisions which sunset after 5 \nyears.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my \ncolleague, Senator Gregg from New Hampshire to introduce the Workplace \nFlexibility Act to give America's families the kinds of choices and \noptions they demand and deserve.\n  When I speak with hourly wage workers in my home state of Texas, and \nI ask them how they are coping with the growing and competing demands \nof work and family, I hear many different answers. I hear stories of \nparents working days and nights to pay the bills and maybe even get a \nlittle bit ahead.\n  Today we introduce legislation to deal with some of the workplace \nproblems of Americans who are paid by the hour. Every day, millions of \npeople in this country must punch a time clock, and they never seem to \nhave enough time they need to get things done, much less the time they \nwould like to have to spend on home and family. Despite the fact that \nhourly wage earners have the greatest time and money pressures on them, \nthe federal government gives them the least amount of flexibility in \nscheduling their work week.\n  While salaried, or so-called ``exempt'' workers can bargain with \ntheir employers to work additional hours in one week in order to take \ntime off later, hourly or ``non-exempt'' workers do not have that \nprivilege. The Federal Fair Labor Standards Act prohibits them from \nbenefitting from the additional scheduling options that salaried \nworkers enjoy and that Congress gave to all federal employees back in \n1978.\n  It is time to end this inequity in our nation's labor laws. It is \ntime to give all American workers the ability to choose work schedules \nto fit their own home and family needs.\n  The Workplace Flexibility Act will do just that. The bill restores \nfairness in workplace scheduling by giving hourly wage earners three \nnew scheduling and overtime options.\n  First, where an employer requires an employee to work overtime, any \nhours in excess of 40 in a week, the bill would give that employee the \noption of choosing paid time-and-a-half off in lieu of time and a half \npay. So, for example, an employee who works 10 hours of overtime would \nhave earned 15 hours of paid time off for later use. This is called \n``comp time.''\n  Second, for those employees who do not typically work overtime, \nwhich, by the way, encompasses over 90 percent of the women who are now \npaid by the hour, the bill would allow employees to choose to work more \nthan 40 hours in one week in exchange for the same amount of paid time \noff in another week. This is called ``flex time.''\n  Finally, the bill will give employees and employers the option of \nestablishing regular two week schedules to allow an employee to work \nadditional hours in week one in order to take paid time off in week \ntwo. For example, many federal employees enjoy working 9-hour days and \ntaking every alternate Friday off, with pay, for a total at the end of \ntwo weeks of 80 hours. I think it is only right to give private sector \nworkers the flexibility that these federal employees now enjoy.\n  Polls show that Americans overwhelmingly support being given these \nadded options. Three fourths of federal employees say comp time and \nflextime have given them more time to spend with their families and \nhave improved their morale and even their productivity. President \nClinton's own polling firm found recently that the same proportion of \nAmericans, 75 percent, favor expanding these options to all private \nsector employees. It is easy to understand why.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, both mother and father \nwork outside the home in almost two thirds of American households. \nMoreover, 75 percent of mothers with school age children are now in the \nworkforce,\n\n[[Page S2993]]\n\nup dramatically in recent years. While the causes for this are many, \nincluding expanded work opportunities for women and a heavy tax burden \non working families, the results are clear: fewer hours are spent by \nmothers and fathers with their children and with each other. This \nshrinking window of family time is weakening the essential family bond \nthat is the bedrock of our strength as a nation.\n  Not only will our bill make it easier for parents to spend more \nquality time at home or engaged in personal or community activities, it \nwill do so without a hit to the monthly bottom line. Since comp time \nand flex time are paid, workers will receive the same amount of money \nas they would if they did not have these options. The only difference \nis that this legislation will allow workers the flexibility of taking a \nday, a week, or even a month off once they have accumulated time in \ntheir bank.\n  Let me make one point very clear: the Workplace Flexibility Act \nexpands, but does not replace the existing law requiring overtime pay \nfor overtime work. For those employees required to work overtime, they \nwill always have the option of receiving overtime pay at the standard \ntime-and-a-half rate. This bill simply affords the employee additional \noptions, upon the mutual agreement of the employee and employer. An \nemployer who violates this or any other provision of our labor laws \nwould be subject to severe civil fines and possibly even prison. In \nfact, this bill heightens those protections by providing for quadruple \ndamages against an employer who violates the law.\n  But rather than foster antagonism between labor and management, these \nadded scheduling options have been proven both in this country and \nabroad to encourage greater cooperation between employees and their \nemployers. Flexible scheduling has created win-win situations for \nmillions of salaried and federal workers and their employers. For the \nfirst time in 50 years, America's blue collar working men and women \nwill be empowered to help determine the course of their work week. And \nthereby, workers will be given greater control over the most precious \nasset in their lives and in the lives of their families: time.\n  I urge my colleagues to respond to the growing need for workplace \nflexibility by supporting the Workplace Flexibility Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Smith \n        of Oregon, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Collins, Mr. Leiberman, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mr. Wyden, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Akaka, \n        Mr. Ensign, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Breaux, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. Carper, Mr. Cleland, \n        Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, \n        Mr. Durbin, Mr. Edwards, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n        Harkin, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n        Levin, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Miller, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Reed, Mr. Reid, \n        Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Torricelli, \n        and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 625. A bill to provide Federal assistance to States and local \njurisdictions to prosecute hate crimes, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY, Mr. President, today's introduction of the bipartisan \nLocal Law Enforcement Act, with 50 original sponsors in the Senate, is \nthe first step toward passing this important legislation this year. \nThis bill has the support of a wide range of law enforcement, \nreligious, and civil rights organizations.\n  Although America experienced a significant drop in violent crime \nduring the 1990s, the number of hate crimes has continued to grow. In \nfact, according to FBI statistics, in 1999 there were 7876 reported \nhate crimes committed in the United States. That's over 20 hate crimes \nper day, every day.\n  Hate crimes are a national disgrace, an attack on everything this \ncountry stands for. They send a poisonous message that some Americans \nare second class citizens who deserve to be victimized solely because \nof their race, their ethnic background, their religion, their sexual \norientation, their gender or their disability. These senseless crimes \nhave a destructive and devastating impact not only on individual \nvictims, but entire communities. If America is to live up to its \nfounding ideals of liberty and justice for all, combating hate crimes \nmust be a national priority.\n  Yet for too long, the Federal government has been forced to stand on \nthe sidelines in the fight against these senseless acts of hate and \nviolence. The bill we are introducing today will change that by giving \nthe Justice Department greater ability to investigate and prosecute \nthese crimes, and to help the states do so as well.\n  We look forward to bringing this legislation to the Senate floor for \na vote in the near future.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with \nSenator Kennedy the Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001, legislation that \nwould add new categories to current hate crimes law. I want to keep my \nremarks brief, so I speak to you from the heart about hate crimes.\n  Many of you know I am a Republican, a conservative man of faith from \na religious minority. I have known firsthand persecution and \ndiscrimination because of my faith. As a member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, I have taken great interest in religious freedom \nand fighting anti-Semitism abroad. I found that all of my colleagues \nhave joined me in that goal in many ways. We have all asked other \ncountries to stop hate, to stop ethnic violence and persecution of \nminorities. Today, I ask every Senator to take the same stand in our \nown country.\n  If it were easy to speak out against hate thousands of miles away, \nthen it must be easy to speak out against hate in your own backyard. \nBackyards in Wyoming--where Matthew Shepard was brutally beaten and \nleft to die tied to a cattle fence off a lonely road. Backyards in \nTexas, where James Byrd, Jr. was dragged to death behind a pick-up \ntruck. Backyards in Virginia, where Roanoke native Danny Lee Overstreet \nwas brutally shot down in a hate crime last fall. Backyards in Alabama, \nwhere Jack Gaither was bludgeoned to death and set on fire. And \nbackyards in Oregon, my state, where two women, Roxanne Ellis and \nMichelle Abdill of Medford, were killed in late 1995 because of their \nsexual orientation.\n  This hate crimes legislation sends a signal that violence of any kind \nis unacceptable. I look to my party and look for inclusion--a big tent \napproach to this issue. I hope that the President can join in this \neffort, I believe that given the opportunity, the White House can \nparticipate in this effort and play a significant role in the outcome. \nFurther, I am committed to making sure that partisan rhetoric stays out \nof this issue and together we can work on both sides of the aisle to \nmake this legislation public law. I fear any strain of hate or \nhomophobia, any isolationism or xenophobia in politics today, and I \nbelieve that all my colleagues share this fear. Taking a stand against \nhate crimes isn't a liberal or a conservative issue--it's something we \nshould all do.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate, to defend them \nregardless of their status, be they female, disabled or gay. The Local \nLaw Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. By changing this law we can change hearts and minds as well.\n  The law is a teacher and we should teach our fellow citizens that all \ncrime is hateful. But we can also teach that some crime is so odious \nthat an extra measure of prosecution is demanded by us, so that it will \nnever again be repeated among us.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in \nexpressing my strong support for the Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001, \nlegislation of which I am an original cosponsor.\n  Popularly known as the ``Hate Crimes Prevention Act,'' this \nlegislation would expand current federal protections against hate \ncrimes based on race, religion, and national origin; amend the criminal \ncode to cover hate crimes based on gender, sexual orientation, and \ndisability; authorize grants for State and local programs designed to \ncombat and prevent hate crimes;\n\n[[Page S2994]]\n\nand enable the federal government to assist State and local law \nenforcement in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes.\n  While past efforts to enact this legislation have received strong \nbipartisan support, we have not been able to get it to the President's \ndesk for his consideration. We must now work to ensure that this \nlegislation is not simply supported, but actually passed and signed \ninto law by the President.\n  This important legislation would enhance current hate crimes law and \nenable the federal government to offer assistance to states and \nlocalities in investigating and prosecuting bias-motivated crimes. Even \nwith the strides we have made in combating hate crimes thus far, these \ncrimes are still frequently under-reported and therefore go \nunprosecuted.\n  In California, I have seen, first-hand, the devastating impact these \ncrimes have on victims, their families and their communities. Hate \ncrimes divide neighborhoods and breed a sense of mistrust and fear \nwithin communities. This is why I have long supported legislation aimed \nat protecting citizens from crimes based on races, ethnicity, religion, \ngender, disability, or sexual orientation.\n  Prior to 1990, while we knew that hate crimes existed, we had no \ntools to measure the number of instances in which such crimes were \ncommitted. In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate Crimes Statistics Act. \nBecause of this law, we are now able to quantify the extent of the \nproblem. What we found was disturbing. For the first time, data was \ncollected and analyzed on the incidence of hate crimes. In 1991, the \nfirst year after the Act took effect, 4,588 hate crimes were reported \nnationwide. In 1998, the last year for which we have statistics, that \nnumber rose to 7,755. These statistics provide federal and state law \nenforcement officials the tools to recognize the problems particular to \ntheir communities and have encouraged many to come up with solutions.\n  In 1993, I sponsored the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act in \n1993, which was subsequently signed into law as part of the Violent \nCrime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. This act increased \npenalties for hate crimes targeting individuals because of their race, \ncolor, religion, national origin, gender, disability or sexual \norientation.\n  While current hate crime laws help us better understand the problem \nand penalize those who would resort to such violent acts, these laws do \nnot extend to the thousands of people who are victimized because of \ntheir gender, sexual orientation or disability. Nor are they broad \nenough to help those who were not engaging in such federally protected \nactivities as attending school, or voting, when they were victimized.\n  In New Jersey, for example, a mentally disabled man was tortured by \neight different people at a party. The man was burned with cigarettes, \nbeaten, choked, and then left alone in the wilderness. Investigators \nfound that this man was tortured only because of his disability. This \nwas the third time this man had been attacked at a party.\n  Just recently, my staff met with a constituent who is a teacher at a \nBeverly Hills high school. The teacher expressed concern about the \nsafety of gay students, many of whom had been targeted and attacked by \nother students on account of their sexual orientation. She felt that \nteachers like herself did all they could to protect the students while \nthey were on school property. She feared for their safety, however, \nonce the students were off school grounds. Even within the school, the \nteacher, explained, some officials did little to create an environment \nof tolerance and mutual respect for the students. As a result, the \nbias-motivated acts committed against them often went unreported, \nwhether they took place in the school or within their communities.\n  My constituent's appeal for help on behalf of her young students \namplifies the need to send a strong message of mutual tolerance and \nrespect to our youngsters. Nearly two-thirds of these crimes are \ncommitted by our nation's youth and young adults. In many ways, \nreinforcing the strength of our diverse nation must begin with our \nyouth.\n  As these stories illustrate, the perpetrators of hate crimes have no \nrespect for boundaries. They are neither confined to any one region of \nthe country, nor any one age group. The perpetrators of these crimes \ntarget individuals not because of what the victims have, or what they \nhave done, but for who they are. Hate crimes are not like other crimes \nof violence. Their impact is pervasive.\n  Opponents of hate crimes legislation argue that these crimes are no \ndifferent from any other crime; that they should be treated like other \ncrimes of violence. Research by the American Psychological Association, \nAPA, suggest otherwise. According to the APA, hate crime victims and \ntheir communities are often left with psychological wounds that run \ndeeper and take significantly longer to heal than the wounds of victims \nof non-bias related crimes.\n  Much like victims of non-bias related crimes, victims of hate crimes \nare likely to exhibit symptoms of depression, post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, anxiety, high levels of anger, and a decreased sense of \ncontrol. Unlike victims of non-bias related crimes, however, hate crime \nvictims experience psychological after-effects at a much higher level. \nAccording to the APA, hate crime victims need ``as much as five years \nto overcome the emotional distress of the incident,'' compared with \n``victims of non-bias crimes who experience a drop off in crime-\nrelated psychological problems within two years of the crime.'' The \nfinancial costs for mental health and medical treatment following an \nattack only add to the psychological stress of the victim.\n\n  Hate crimes pose a very real threat to the social health of the \ncommunity. Individuals who live in communities where hate crimes have \noccurred often experience an increased sense of fear and intimidation. \nThey also tend to feel a heightened sense of vulnerability and are much \nless likely to report such crimes should they occur again, for fear of \nretaliation. Hate crimes also breed mistrust within the community. \nMembers of the victimized groups are likely to believe that law \nenforcement agencies are biased against their group and, that when \nneeded, the law enforcement community will not respond.\n  In essence, hate crimes have been shown to produce deep psychological \nwounds in the victim. They engender a sense of disunity and division \nwithin the community, which undermines the basic tenets on which this \nnation was founded. As a country that prides itself on its diversity, \nour nation cannot continue to withstand these acts of hatred and \nintolerance. No individual or group should be targeted for violence and \nno such act of violence should go unpunished.\n  No American should have to live in fear because of his or her \nperceived race, sexual orientation, ethnicity or disability. No \nAmerican should be afraid to walk down the street for fear of a gender-\nmotivated attack. No American should be deterred by intimidation from \nliving in the home of his or her choice. And certainly, no American \nshould be deterred from reporting a hate-based crime because they are \nafraid that the police lack the will or the resources necessary to \nprotect them.\n  This legislation is not only overdue, it is necessary for the safety \nand well being of millions of Americans. It is necessary for our \nNational unity.\n  Certainly, none of us in this body would condone an act of brutality \nbased on an individual's race, religion, sexual orientation, \ndisability, ethnicity or gender. None of us would be willing to send \nthe message that today, basic civil rights protections do not extend to \nevery American, but only to a few and under certain circumstances.\n  By introducing this legislation today, we are sending a signal that \nwe are unwilling to turn a blind eye to this epidemic of hate that \nthreatens to envelop our Nation. I urge my colleagues to join in this \nmessage by supporting the enactment of ``The Local Law Enforcement \nEnhancement Act of 2001.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 626. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend the work opportunity credit and the welfare-to-work \ncredit, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Work \nOpportunity Improvement Act of 2001, which\n\n[[Page S2995]]\n\nwill permanently extend both the work opportunity tax credit and the \nwelfare-to-work tax credit. The bill will also modify eligibility \ncriteria for the work opportunity tax credit, to strengthen efforts to \nhelp fathers of children on welfare find work. Over the past five \nyears, these tax credits have played a crucial role in helping 1.5 \nmillion low-skilled, undereducated persons dependent on public \nassistance enter the work force.\n  The work opportunity tax credit was first enacted in 1996, to provide \nemployers with financial resources to recruit, hire, and retain \nindividuals who have significant problems finding and keeping a job. \nThe welfare-to-work tax credit, serving a similar purpose, was enacted \nthe next year. Traditionally, employers had been reluctant to hire \npeople coming off the welfare rolls, both because they tended to have \nless education and experience than other job candidates, and because \nthey tended to have less education and experience than other job \ncandidates, and because welfare dependence was seen as fostering a poor \nself-image and work habits. These tax credits, however, have \ndemonstrated that employers can be enticed to overcome their resistance \nto hiring less skilled, economically dependent individuals. No other \nincentive or training program has been nearly as successful as these \ntax credits in encouraging employers to change their hiring practices.\n  Over the past five years, government and employers have developed a \npartnership that has led to significant changes in hiring practices. \nMany employers have established outreach and recruitment programs to \nidentify and target individuals whom employers could hire under these \ntax credit programs. States have made the tax credit programs more \nemployer-friendly by continual improvements in the way the programs are \nadministered. Still, we repeatedly hear both from employers and State \njob service agencies administering the programs that continued \nuncertainty about the programs' future impedes expanded participation \nand improvements in program administration. Making the work opportunity \nand welfare-to-work tax credits permanent would induce employers to \nexpand their recruitment efforts and encourage States to commit more \ntime and effort to further improve the programs. This, in turn, would \nmean that more individuals would be helped to make the jump from \nwelfare dependency to work. Because these programs have proven so \nsuccessful over the past five years, I believe they should be made \npermanent and am today introducing a bill to achieve this end.\n  In addition to making these two tax provisions permanent, my bill \nwill address an oversight. Currently, the work opportunity tax credit \ngives employers an incentive to hire individuals on food stamps between \nages 18 and 24. No sound policy reason exists for not extending the tax \ncredit's eligibility criteria to people on food stamps over age 25. \nLifting the work opportunity tax credit food stamp age ceiling would \nmean that many more fathers of children on welfare could be hired under \nthe credit. These individuals often face significant barriers to \nfinding work. Increasing the age ceiling for food stamp recipients is \nconsistent with the tax credit's underlying objectives, as many food \nstamp households include adults who are not working. Moreover, over 90 \npercent of those on food stamps live below the poverty line. My bill \nwill include among those eligible for the work opportunity tax credit \npersons in households receiving food stamps, as long as they are 50 \nyears old or younger. I believe that this will have the effect of \nmaking the tax credit available with respect to fathers of children on \nwelfare who aren't otherwise eligible.\n  I urge my colleagues to support and co-sponsor this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 627. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nindividuals a deduction for qualified long-term care insurance \npremiums, use of such insurance under cafeteria plans and flexible \nspending arrangements, and a credit for individuals with long-term care \nneeds; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Long-Term \nCare and Retirement Security Act. This legislation, which I sponsored \nin the 106th Congress with my distinguished colleague from Florida, \nSenator Bob Graham, would ease the tremendous cost of long-term care.\n  The bill that Senator Graham and I are re-introducing today would \nallow individuals a tax deduction for the cost of long-term care \ninsurance premiums. Increasingly, Americans are interested in private \nlong-term care insurance to pay for nursing home stays, assisted \nliving, home health aides, and other services. However, most people \nfind the policies unaffordable. The younger the person, the lower the \ninsurance premium, yet most people aren't ready to buy a policy until \nretirement. A deduction would encourage more people to buy long-term \ncare insurance.\n  Our proposal also would give individuals or their care givers a \n$3,000 tax credit to help cover their long-term care expenses. This \nwould apply to those who have been certified by a doctor as needing \nhelp with at least three activities of daily living, such as needing \nhelp with at least three activities of daily living, such as eating, \nbathing or dressing. This credit would help care givers pay for medical \nsupplies, nursing care and any other expenses of caring for family \nmembers with disabilities.\n  The Van Zee family of Otley, Iowa, typifies many families who would \nbenefit from his legislation. Renee Van Zee at 55 years old has early \nonset Alzheimer's disease. Three years after her diagnosis, she can't \nfeed, bathe or dress herself. Her daughter, Leanna, and her husband, \nAlbert, are pulling out all the stops to keep Mrs. Van Zee out of a \nnursing home. They care for her full-time. They've found some services \nthrough Medicaid and Medicare and received a donated hospital bed. Even \nso, caring for Mrs. Van Zee is difficult. She can't be left alone at \nany time. The family's network of services is piecemeal, like that of \nmany families in similar straits. Those services could change with any \nchange in their circumstances. The family bears considerable out-of-\npocket expenses for Mrs. Van Zee's nutritional supplements. The \nsupplements cost $4.96 for a four-pack of cans. Mrs. Van Zee consumes \ntwo or three cans a day. It's obvious how this situation affects a \nfamily's finances. Working adults quit their jobs to care for a loved \none, and take on a host of new expenses at the same time.\n  The Long-Term Care and Retirement Security Act would help the 22 \nmillion family caregivers like the Van Zees. A $3,000 tax credit would \nhelp to pay for Mrs. Van Zee's nutritional supplements or hire an extra \nnurse. The legislation also would help families like the Van Zees buy \nlong-term care insurance. Someone like Mrs. Van Zee could have bought \nherself insurance years ago, had it been an affordable option for her.\n  As it did last year, the bill that Senator Graham and I are \nintroducing today has been endorsed by both the AARP and the Health \nInsurance Association of America. A companion bill sponsored by \nRepresentatives Nancy Johnson, Karen Thurman, and Earl Pomeroy is \npending in the House of Representatives.\n  An aging nation has no time to waste in preparing for long-term care, \nand the need to help people afford long-term care is more pressing than \never. I look forward to working with Senator Graham and our colleagues \nin the Senate to get our bill passed into law as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. Murkowski):\n  S. 630.

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) There is a right of free speech on the Internet.\n       (2) The Internet has increasingly become a critical mode of \n     global communication and now presents unprecedented \n     opportunities for the development and growth of global \n     commerce and an integrated worldwide economy. In order for \n     global commerce on the Internet to reach its full potential, \n     individuals and entities, using the Internet and other online \n     services should be prevented from engaging in activities that \n     prevent other users and Internet service providers from \n     having a reasonably predictable, efficient, and economical \n     online experience.\n       (3) Unsolicited commercial electronic mail can be a \n     mechanism through which businesses advertise and attract \n     customers in the online environment.\n       (4) The receipt of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     may result in costs to recipients who cannot refuse to accept \n     such mail and who incur costs for the storage of such mail, \n     or for the time spent accessing, reviewing, and discarding \n     such mail, or for both.\n       (5) Unsolicited commercial electronic mail may impose \n     significant monetary costs on providers of Internet access \n     services, businesses, and educational and nonprofit \n     institutions that carry and receive such mail, as there is a \n     finite volume of mail that such providers, businesses, and \n     institutions can handle without further investment. The \n     sending of such mail is increasingly and negatively affecting \n     the quality of service provided to customers of Internet \n     access service, and shifting costs from the sender of the \n     advertisement to the provider of Internet access service and \n     the recipient.\n       (6) While some senders of unsolicited commercial electronic \n     mail messages provide simple and reliable way for recipients \n     to reject (or ``opt-out'' of) receipt of unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail from such senders in the future, \n     other senders provide no such ``opt-out'' mechanism, or \n     refuse to honor the requests of recipients not to receive \n     electronic mail from such senders in the future, or both.\n       (7) An increasing number of senders of unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail purposefully disguise the source \n     of such mail so as to prevent recipients from responding to \n     such mail quickly and easily.\n       (8) An increasing number of senders of unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail purposefully include misleading \n     information in the message's subject lines in order to induce \n     the recipients to view the messages.\n       (9) Because recipients of unsolicited commercial electronic \n     mail are unable to avoid the receipt of such mail through \n     reasonable means, such mail may invade the privacy of \n     recipients.\n       (10) The practice of sending unsolicited commercial \n     electronic mail is sufficiently profitable that senders of \n     such mail will not be unduly burdened by the costs associated \n     with providing an ``opt-out'' mechanism to recipients and \n     ensuring that recipients who exercise such opt-out do not \n     receive further messages from that sender.\n       (11) In legislating against certain abuses on the Internet, \n     Congress should be very careful to avoid infringing in any \n     way upon constitutionally protected rights, including the \n     rights of assemble, free speech, and privacy.\n       (b) Congressional Determination of Public Policy.--On the \n     basis of the findings in subsection (a), the Congress \n     determines that--\n       (1) there is substantial government interest in regulation \n     of unsolicited commercial electronic mail;\n       (2) senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     should not mislead recipients as to the source or content of \n     such mail; and\n       (3) recipients of unsolicited commercial electronic mail \n     have a right to decline to receive additional unsolicited \n     commercial electronic mail from the same source.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Affirmative consent.--The term ``affirmative consent'', \n     when used with respect to a commercial electronic mail \n     message, means--\n       (A) the message falls within the scope of an express and \n     unambiguous invitation or permission granted by the recipient \n     and not subsequently revoked;\n       (B) the recipient had clear and conspicuous notice, at the \n     time such invitation or permission was granted, of--\n       (i) the fact that the recipient was granting the invitation \n     or permission;\n       (ii) the scope of the invitation or permission, including \n     what types of commercial electronic mail messages would be \n     covered by the invitation or permission and what senders or \n     types of senders, if any, other than the party to whom the \n     invitation or permission was communicated would be covered by \n     the invitation or permission; and\n       (iii) a reasonable and effective mechanism for revoking the \n     invitation or permission; and\n       (C) the recipient has not, after granting the invitation or \n     permission, submitted a request under section 5(a)(3) not to \n     receive unsolicited commercial electronic mail messages from \n     the sender of the message.\n       (2) Commercial electronic mail message.--The term \n     ``commercial electronic mail message'' means any electronic \n     mail message the primary purpose of which is to advertise or \n     promote, for a commercial purpose, a commercial product or \n     service (including content on an Internet website).

Mr. President, Internet communications are increasingly \nimportant to Americans' daily lives and business. However, as the \npublic's reliance on online and Internet services continues to grow, so \ndo the burdens and frustrations stemming from unwanted junk e-mail.\n  This type of e-mail is commonly known as ``spam,'' and it isn't hard \nto see why. Getting spam e-mail in your in-box is a lot like getting \nits namesake lunchmeat in your lunchbox: You didn't order it, and you \nreally can't tell where the stuff comes from.\n  Until now, you also have been virtually powerless to stop it. The \nrecipient has no opportunity to refuse to accept the message, and thus \nis forced to take the time and bear the costs of storing, accessing, \nreviewing, and deleting such unwanted e-mail. In short, spammers have \nall the power. A spammer can send a recipient whatever messages it \nwants, and the recipient has no choice but to deal with them.\n  Technology is on the side of the spammer. E-mail technology enables \nspammers to send huge quantities of messages quickly and cheaply. With \nthe stroke of a key, a spammer can let fly a torrent of tens or \nhundreds of thousands of identical e-mails at minimal cost. Such bulk \nspam can clog up the network, impairing Internet service for everyone. \nFor example, back in December, an influx of millions of junk e-mails \nslowed Verizon's network to a crawl, causing delays of several hours \nfor customers trying to send and receive messages.\n  Spam affects Internet companies as well as end users. Internet \nservice providers are the ones who have to deal directly with the \ntraffic jams caused when bulk spam floods their networks. And when \nconsumers become frustrated by the receipt of spam, the first place \nthey turn to complain will be the Internet companies from whom they \npurchase service. Left unchecked, spam could have a significant impact \non how consumers perceive and use Internet services and e-commerce.\n  Because of this, Internet service providers have often played a major \nrole in trying to shield their customers from spam. But the bottom line \nis that existing laws do not provide the tools to deal with the \nmounting problem of junk e-mail.\n  That is why I am teaming up again today with my good friend Senator \nBurns to introduce the ``Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited \nPornography And Marketing Act,'' the CAN\n\n[[Page S2999]]\n\nSPAM Act, for short. This bipartisan legislation says that if you want \nto send unsolicited marketing e-mail, you've got to play by a set of \nrules, rules that allow consumers to see where the messages are coming \nfrom, and to tell the sender stop. The basic goal is simple: give the \nconsumer more control.\n  Specifically, our bill would require a sender of any marketing e-mail \nto include a working return address, so that the recipient can send a \nreply e-mail demanding not to receive any further messages. A spammer \nwould be prohibited from sending further messages to a consumer that \nhas told it to stop.\n  The bill also would prohibit spammers from using falsified or \ndeceptive headers or subject lines, so that consumers will be able to \ntell where their marketing e-mails are coming from.\n  The bill includes strong enforcement provisions to ensure compliance. \nSpammers that intentionally disguise their identities would be subject \nto misdemeanor criminal penalties. The Federal Trade Commission would \nhave authority to impose civil fines. State attorneys general would be \nable to bring suit on behalf of the citizens of their states. And \nInternet service providers would be able to bring suit to keep unlawful \nspam off of their networks. In all cases, particularly high penalties \nwould be available for true ``bad actors''--the shady, high-volume \nspammers who have no intention of behaving in a lawful and responsible \nmanner.\n  Our goal here is not to discourage legitimate online communications \nwith consumers. Senator Burns and I have no intention of interfering \nwith a company's ability to use e-mail to inform customers of warranty \ninformation, provide account holders with monthly account statements, \nand so forth. Rather, we want to go after those unscrupulous \nindividuals who use e-mail to annoy and mislead. I believe this bill \nstrikes that important balance.\n  Senator Burns and I have worked with a number of different groups in \nshaping this legislation, and we believe we have made real progress in \naddressing some concerns that were raised about the spam bill we \nproposed last year. We feel that the version of the bill we introduce \ntoday is a workable, common-sense approach. I am pleased that Senators \nLieberman, Landrieu, Torricelli, Breaux, and Murkowski are cosponsoring \nthis bill today, and I look forward to working with them and the rest \nof my Senate colleagues to see that the bill moves forward as quickly \nas possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH:\n  S. 631. A bill to provide for pension reform, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat I believe will provide for the financial future of millions of \nAmericans, help boost this nation's savings rate, and bolster long-term \neconomic growth. My bill, the Comprehensive Retirement Security and \nPension Reform Act, mirrors H.R. 10, legislation introduced earlier \nthis year by my friend and fellow Ohioan, Representative Rob Portman.\n  It is estimated that right now, an astounding 75 million American \nworkers have no pension plan. In other words, roughly half of America's \nworkers lack a key mechanism they will need in order to achieve a \ncomfortable retirement. This situation is intolerable and must change.\n  In my view, we must do more to encourage more citizens to ensure \ntheir financial independence in their golden years. That's why I \nstrongly believe we need to enact the Comprehensive Retirement Security \nand Pension Reform Act. The increased personal savings and investment \nthat would result from expanding pensions would reinvigorate our \nsavings ethic, which has been eroding over recent years. Something \nneeds to be done quickly to encourage more Americans to save and plan \nfor their retirement and I believe the legislation I am introducing \ntoday is an important step in the right direction.\n  Among the important things the bill I am introducing today does is \nraise the maximum annual contribution to an Individual Retirement \nAccounts, IRAs, from $2,000 per individual to $5,000. The contribution \nlimits for, IRAs, has remained unchanged since 1981. Since sixty-nine \npercent of all IRA participants contribute the maximum, the $2,000 \nlimit has been a barrier to encouraging Americans to save for their own \nretirement. If the original IRA contribution limit in 1975, of $1,500, \nbeen indexed for inflation, it would have reached $5,353 in the year \n2000. Clearly, today's working men and women want to, and are ready to, \ninvest more for their retirement if Congress would only let them. The \ntime has come to raise the contribution limit.\n  In addition, the Comprehensive Retirement Security and Pension Reform \nAct includes provisions to encourage employers to offer pensions, \nincrease participation by eligible employees, raise limits on benefits \nand contributions, improve asset portability, strengthen legal \nprotections for plan participants, and reduce regulatory burdens on \nplan sponsors.\n  When the baby boomers start to retire in a few short years, this \ncountry will begin to experience a retirement tsunami unlike anything \nit has ever experienced. This 20-year event will put great strain on \nthe economy and the federal budget, especially on government programs \nthat provide services to senior citizens. One of the best ways to help \nprepare for this is to encourage private saving. The Comprehensive \nRetirement Security and Pension Reform Act is an important step in this \ndirection and I urge my colleagues to join in co-sponsoring this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 632. A bill to reinstate a final rule promulgated by the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \ngrave concern about the Bush administration's latest decision to roll \nback measures designed to safeguard public health. Last Tuesday, the \nadministration announced it would revoke the new, safer arsenic \nstandard for drinking water and revert to the standard we have had in \neffect since 1942. The administration stated that the lower standard \nfor drinking water should not go into effect because there was ``no \nconsensus on a particular safe level'' of arsenic in drinking water. \nThe administration also claims it would cost industry too much money to \ncomply with the lower standard.\n  The old standard of 50 parts per billion was established almost 60 \nyears ago--before research linked arsenic to some forms of cancer. A \n1999 study by the National Academy of Sciences, a study mandated by \nCongress for drinking water, concluded that the current arsenic \nstandard for drinking water could result in one additional case of \ncancer for every 100 people consuming such drinking water. Moreover, \nthe study determined that long-term exposure to low concentrations of \narsenic in drinking water can lead to skin, bladder, lung, and prostate \ncancer. Non-cancer effects of ingesting arsenic at these levels can \ninclude cardiovascular disease, diabetes and anemia as well as \nreproductive, developmental, immunological, and neurological effects. \nIn response, the Environmental Protection Agency adopted a rule that \nset a new standard of 10 parts per billion which the EPA deemed safe \nfor drinking water.\n  This standard also has been adopted by the European Union and the \nWorld Health Organization.\n  Is cost a sufficient reason for reversal? No. That's because Congress \nconsistently has made clear that it will help states and municipalities \nwith the funds necessary to provide their citizens with safe drinking \nwater.\n  Even the Governor of Florida recognizes the health risks of arsenic. \nArsenic was discovered recently in the soil in playgrounds in Tarpan \nSprings, Miami and Crystal River. It leached into the soil from \npressure-treated wood used for park boardwalks and other outdoor \nstructures. Last week, Gov. Jeb Bush ordered the state's wood-treatment \nplant to stop using arsenic to treat wood. I commend him for that \ndecision.\n  If arsenic in the soil is dangerous for children, it only stands to \nreason that the danger is even greater when it is found in drinking \nwater. The Administration should join the State of Florida in \nrecognizing the danger of arsenic and restore the 10 parts per billion\n\n[[Page S3000]]\n\nstandard. In the meantime, I am introducing legislation to restore the \nfederal rule containing the new, safer drinking-water standard. The \nAmerican people deserve clean, safe drinking water. If the \nAdministration won't act, Congress must.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 632\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the review and management of airport \ncongestion, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleague \nSenator Rockefeller, to introduce legislation that will bring real \nrelief to the hundreds of millions of passengers that have been \nsuffering through the dramatic increase in the number of flight delays \nand cancellations in our passenger aviation system.\n  I know that most of my colleagues are, by necessity, frequent fliers. \nSo you know how bad it is out there and you have heard the statistics. \nMore than twenty-five percent of the scheduled flights last year were \ndelayed or canceled. The length of the average delay has also \nincreased, despite the extra ``fudge time'' built into eighty-three \npercent of flights by the airlines to compensate for delays they know \nare going to occur.\n  Not coincidentally, the number of annual air travelers is also \nrising. Between 1995 and 1999, the number of air travelers increased \nnearly sixteen percent, from about 582 million to 674 million. The \nFederal Aviation Administration estimates that this number will \nincrease to more than 1 billion by the end of this decade. To meet this \nincreased demand, the number of scheduled flights has also increased.\n  However, there has not been a commensurate increase in the number of \nnew aviation facilities. Only one major airport has opened in the last \ndecade, in Denver, and only a handful of new runways and terminals have \nbeen completed to deal with the new demand. Unfortunately, the process \nfor making capital improvements to existing airports is often painfully \nslow and easily derailed by well-organized groups who use every \npossible impediment to delay a new runway until it becomes impossibly \nexpensive and difficult to build.\n  Unless we significantly expand the capacity of our aviation system, \nwe will not be able to meet the growing demand for air travel. Air \nfares will skyrocket and delays will continue to spread across the \nsystem. The loss of American productivity, from millions of hours lost \nwhile sitting on an airport tarmac, will be incalculable.\n  Fixing the problem will call for more infrastructure and better air \ntraffic control facilities. But we must meet the challenge now so these \nnew runways and terminals can be ready before we have a real crisis on \nour hands.\n  Until now, most of the focus here in Congress has been on passenger \nservice. The Commerce Committee recently reported a bill, which I \ncosponsored, to force airlines to live up to their promises to provide \nimproved customer service, especially during delays and cancellations. \nPassenger service is critical, but the real cause of consumers' \nfrustration is the explosive growth in the number and length of flight \ndelays. This bill gets to the heart of that issue.\n  The bill instructs the Secretary to develop a procedure to ensure \nthat the approval process for runways, terminals and airports is \nstreamlined. Federal, state, regional and local reviews would take \nplace simultaneously, not one after the other.\n  In no way would this mean that environmental laws would be ignored or \nbroken. The bill does not limit the grounds on which a lawsuit may be \nfiled. It simply provides the community with a reasonable time line to \nget an answer. If that answer is ``no,'' then the community is free to \nexplore other transportation options.\n  The bill also addresses the unfortunate practice of the airlines to \noverschedule at peak hours. At many airports, these schedules are so \ndensely packed that, even in perfect weather conditions throughout the \ncountry, there is no way the airlines could possibly meet them. The \nresult is chronically late flights.\n  The legislation directs the Secretary to study the options to ease \ncongestion at crowded airports. The legislation also grants the \nairlines a limited antitrust exemption, so that they may consult with \none another, subject to the Secretary's approval, to re-schedule \nflights from the most congested hours to off-peak times.\n  We have all experienced flights that push away from the gate only to \nlanguish for hours on the tarmac waiting to take off. The current \nsystem logs these flights as on-time departures. This legislation would \nchange the definition of ``on-time departure'' to mean that the flight \nis airborne within 20 minutes of its scheduled departure time.\n  Our national economic health depends upon the reliability of our \naviation system. If we fail to act now, that reliability will be placed \nin serious jeopardy.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I join today with the chairwoman of \nthe Aviation Subcommittee in introducing the Aviation Delay Prevention \nAct. The bill is intended to start a dialogue about some of the \nsolutions for reducing congestion, specifically ways to expedite \nairport construction, and provide a mechanism for air carriers to talk \nabout changing flight schedules to reduce delays. This is a tough issue \nwith no easy, simple solutions. Senator Hutchison and I know this. I \nalso know that this specific piece of legislation is intended to \nprovide a framework for a debate on how to provide a better air \ntransportation system for travelers. We must, though, continue our \nefforts to work through every issue in our efforts to enable the FAA, \nairports and air carriers to provide a more efficient air \ntransportation system.\n  Senator Hutchison and I want to provide our colleagues with \nconstructive and feasible legislative provisions that are well thought \nout and considered. We will hold a hearing on this bill on Thursday, \neliciting testimony from the Department of Transportation, DOT, the \nFederal Aviation Administration, FAA, airports and airlines, as well as \ngeneral aviation.\n  We do know we are facing an aviation system that today is overcrowded \nand cannot keep up with demand. Tomorrow's demand forecasts are also \ndaunting, with an increase in passenger traffic from about 670 million \npassengers to more than a billion. As we review the problems of our \naviation system, I am constantly thinking and envisioning a system with \ntwice the number of planes, and twice the number of people traveling \nwithin the next 10 years. Today, right now, we have airports that \ncannot accommodate all of\n\n[[Page S3001]]\n\nthe planes. We have terminals that need to be expanded, and runways \nthat must be built. One thing all of us know is that without adequate \nrunways and terminals, no one is well served.\n  We see it first hand as we fly around the country, as our planes are \ndelayed, as we talk with constituents at home and here in Washington, \nthat our aviation system is running on empty. Last year, we had to \nfight and claw our way to getting bills that finally provides \nsufficient money for the FAA to be able to build new runways and buy \nnew equipment. We must be vigorous in ensuring that the Administration \ndoes not make cuts to these key programs, as was initially proposed by \nthe Bush Administration. Knowing that it takes years to build a runway \nand years to develop new air traffic control systems, we cannot \nshortchange the system.\n  Last year, as part of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and \nReform Act, FAIR-21, P.L. 106-181, we set out a road map for a more \nbusinesslike Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, creating a \ncorporate-type Board with people from non-aviation related businesses \nto oversee air traffic control. We created a Chief Operating Officer, \nCOO, to run air traffic, with specific authority to focus on \noperations, the budget and establishing a goal-oriented ATC. In \naddition, we made sure that the money was provided to buy new ATC \nequipment to expand ATC capacity.\n  With respect to airports, we authorized significant increases in \nAirport Improvement Program monies, increases of $1.25, $1.35 and $1.45 \nbillion over 1999 funds, $1.95 billion. We also gave airports the \nability to increase their passenger facility fees from $3 to $4.50 per \nperson. The money is there to build and expand capacity. But, nothing \nhappens overnight and we all know it.\n\n  With the reforms of the FAA and the funding, we are on a path to \nchange. Yet, even with that path, we are not able to keep up with \ndemand, particularly in the short term. Secretary Mineta has already \nstated he wants to use the reforms of FAIR-21, and not get bogged down \nin an age-old debate over FAA privatization/corporatization. The Air \nTransport Association, ATA, has echoed this sentiment. Nonetheless, we \nmust look at ways particularly in the near term, to provide relief to \ntravelers, and in the longer term figure out better ways to build \nrunways, while being cognizant of the need to be environmentally \nconscious.\n  Right now we have runway construction underway at Denver, Detroit-\nMetro, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Houston, and Orlando. Miami is set to \nbegin construction within the next month or two as is St. Louis. \nCharlotte is awaiting the United-US Airways merger decision before it \nbegins construction since the carriers will help finance the project. \nAt other airports, runway planning is ongoing. Chip Barclay, the \nPresident of the American Association of Airport Executives, in \ntestimony before a House Committee recently noted that if we could \nbuild 50 more miles of additional runways we could solve our airport \ncapacity problem. Fifty miles. Each of us wants them built more \nquickly, but changes in the laws may not expedite the current \nconstruction. Yet, we can ensure, as this bill does, that the FAA and \nother Federal, State and local agencies do a better job of coordinating \nthe various environmental and planning reviews necessary before a \nrunway is built. It is a starting point for the discussion, but by no \nmeans an end point. We want to expedite construction, without intruding \nupon the necessary environmental reviews.\n  AAAE has put out a proposal to expedite runway construction, and we \nwill carefully evaluate it too. I have been developing my own \nlegislation which will build upon the bill we introduced today and want \nto work with Senator Hutchison and other members on that bill. I have \nlearned that this is a complicated problem, with no easy, or quick, \nsolutions. As the legislation we introduce today is considered by the \nCommittee, changes will be made to reflect many concerns and issues. \nSenator Hutchison and I want to work with the entire aviation community \nin addressing and solving this issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 634. A bill to amend section 2007 of the Social Security Act to \nprovide grant funding for additional Enterprise Communities, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in 1993, Congress created the Community \nEmpowerment Program to provide communities with real opportunities for \ngrowth and revitalization. The program challenged local jurisdictions \nto develop strategic plans for the future and rewarded the communities \nthat have developed the best plans with a ten-year designation as an \nEmpowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. Once a designation is \nawarded, communities receive Federal support to assist local efforts to \npromote economic opportunity and implement strategies designed to help \ncommunities obtain their development goals. When it authorized the \nprogram, Congress also provided, in one appropriation, the funding \nnecessary to support the communities for the full life of the ten-year \ndesignations.\n  In response to the initial success of the Community Empowerment \nProgram, Congress authorized a second round of the Enterprise Community \ndesignations in 1998, creating an additional 20 Enterprise Communities. \nThese designations were awarded to deserving communities shortly \nthereafter by the Department of Agriculture.\n  When Congress authorized a second round of Enterprise Communities, it \nonly appropriated funding for the program in Fiscal Year 1999. \nConsequently, communities have had to rely on funding added in \nconference to the VA-HUD appropriations bill in each of the subsequent \nfiscal years.\n  This last minute approach to funding these communities is not at all \nconducive to the strategic planning that the Community Empowerment \nProgram is supposed to encourage. We cannot expect local leaders to \neffectively implement their plans if the Federal support they have been \npromised is still in question. I believe it is time for Congress to \ndemonstrate its support for the Round II Enterprise Communities by \nsetting aside, as it did in Round I, the funding necessary to sustain \nthis important program.\n\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that would ensure that Congress \nkeeps its commitment to the Round II Enterprise Communities by \nauthorizing a one time appropriation to the States through the Social \nService Block Grant program to support the remaining years of the \ndesignations. My bill, the Enterprise Communities Enhancement Act of \n2001, also authorizes the States to make annual grants for each of the \nseven remaining years of the program of $500,000 for each of the 20 \nRound II Enterprise Communities. By guaranteeing funding, Congress \nwould demonstrate its support for the work being done by these \ncommunities and provide local leaders with the assurance that Federal \ndollars will be available as they make their plans for the future.\n  The Enterprise Communities Enhancement Act will also allow for more \nlocal control over how the annual funding is used. My bill allows \ncommunities to use funds to capitalize local revolving loan accounts \nshould community leaders deem such accounts as an important part of \ntheir economic development efforts.\n  I have long been a strong supporter of Empower Lewiston--the local \neffort that secured and is implementing the Enterprise Community \ndesignation for the city of Lewiston, Maine. Thousands of local people \nand dozens of organizations worked together for a year to develop a \nstrategic plan for the city as a whole and those neighborhoods most \naffected by poverty. The plan includes proposals to enhance lifelong \nlearning and employment opportunities, improve the community's housing, \nand revitalize the city's downtown.\n  Empower Lewiston has been able to leverage its funding by more than \n50 to 1, generating more than $11 million in public and private \ninvestment in the community. Included among the projects that have been \nfunded are investments in a local employment firm that created 60 new \njobs and in the Seeds of Change program that enhances outreach among \ncommunity residents. Looking ahead, Empower Lewiston will be developing \na community resource center, working to develop safe and affordable \nhousing, and expanding education programs that target the needs of \nlocal residents.\n  Empower Lewiston provides a wonderful example of what the new \nEnterprise Communities are able to accomplish. By passing the \nEnterprise Communities Enhancement Act, Congress\n\n[[Page S3002]]\n\ncan ensure that communities such as Lewiston will have the resources \nthey need to complete their missions and create a brighter future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/27/senate-section/article/S3002-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 29--CONGRATULATING THE CITY OF DETROIT AND \n   ITS RESIDENTS ON THE OCCASION OF THE TERCENTENNIAL OF ITS FOUNDING\n\n  Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Ms. Stabenow) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                            S.
