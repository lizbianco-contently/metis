Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. Good morning.\n\n[[Page S5186]]\n\n  I rise this morning to support the Gregg amendment. I am proud to be \na cosponsor of the Gregg amendment. The Gregg amendment, very simply, \ncuts the capital gains tax rate from 20 to 15 percent over a 2\\1/2\\-\nyear period. The cut will sunset on December 31, 2003.\n  The Gregg amendment is about one thing; it is about sustaining \neconomic growth in this country. I think most Americans understand it \nis investment capital that fuels the engine of economic growth. That \nengine of economic growth is productivity. There is no growth without \ninvestment and productivity.\n  We have been debating over the last few months--and we will continue \nto debate--a fiscal year 2002 budget. That budget calls for \nexpenditures by the Federal Government of around $1.9 trillion. That is \na lot of money. From where does that money come? It comes from tax \nrevenues.\n  At the same time we are debating the priorities of that $1.9 trillion \nbudget, we are looking at expanding Government programs. As we \nprioritize the programs that are important for our people for future \ngenerations, that is part of our charge. That is part of the \nresponsibility we have as policymakers.\n  One of the things we have done recently is we have voted to set aside \n$300 billion over the next 10 years for a new prescription drug plan \nfor Medicare. It is important. It is relevant. It is needed. We must \nmove on it. What that will do is, of course, build onto an already very \nsignificant amount of uncontrollable budget expenditure, the Medicare \nprogram, another new very expensive program.\n  We prioritize that issue in this country. We have essentially said, \nas did President Bush in the campaign last year, Democrats and \nRepublicans in Congress, we want that prescription drug plan. So $300 \nbillion has been set aside during the next 10 years to add on a new \nprescription drug plan. I suspect most Americans understand it is going \nto be far more than $300 billion over the next 10 years by the time we \nput it all in place. And the hidden cost of that which we do not factor \nin is the outyears after the 10 years when we will saddle all future \nAmericans with that additional add-on expense of Medicare.\n  When you look at that $1.9 trillion Federal budget today, you will \nfind that about two-thirds of that is already locked in. That is \nnondiscretionary. There is nothing we can do about that. We can debate, \nwe can pass laws, but unless we want to change Medicare, unless we \nessentially want to do away with parts of Medicare and other \nentitlement programs that we want, that we have prioritized, the fact \nis that two-thirds of our budget is already committed and we are adding \nto that.\n  That is a decision we have all come to, as a society. We want that. \nThe question comes back to what the Gregg amendment is all about. How \ndo we continue to pay for that? How do we pay for that additional \nprescription drug plan that will cost billions, and hundreds of \nbillions in the outyears, and all the other programs to which we have \ncommitted?\n  We do that by sustaining our economic growth. Government does not \nproduce growth. Government can only do certain things. It is the \nprivate sector that produces growth because it is the private sector \nthat develops the productivity which enhances growth and develops and \ndrives growth.\n  Some of us believe the way to sustain growth is to free up more of \nthat capital so more people in the private sector have that capital in \ntheir hands so they can save, they can invest, they can put it in new \nventure start-up firms that are the firms that will find the \ntechnologies and the solutions to the challenges that we have, not just \ntoday but what we will face tomorrow. When that investment capital \ndries up, you will see the consequences as our technology bogs down in \nevery industry, in every discipline--science, health, medicine, \nnational security, new energy sources, new technologies. It is capital, \nprivate capital that drives that.\n  So this amendment is about freeing up some of that capital that is \nlocked in because of ridiculous tax rates. In fact, the United States \nis one of the very few countries in the world that taxes capital, and \nwe have about the highest capital tax rates of any country in the \nworld. It make no sense to do this.\n  The other thing it does, as we have seen very clearly from the last \ntwo cuts in the capital gains rates, in 1981 and 1997, it increases \nrevenues into our Treasury. We find we are receiving more tax revenues \nas a result of freeing up those locked down assets.\n  What does that mean? It means we win all the way around. \nUnfortunately, we take that fact of life, that reality, that more \nrevenue comes in when we cut capital gains rates, and we score that as \na negative. We don't score that as we should, that, in fact, we will \nfind a new source of revenue, a bigger source of revenue. That is \nanother issue.\n  Capital gains taxes no longer affect just the wealthy. A recent U.S. \nTreasury Department study found that roughly three-quarters of all \nfamilies in the United States own capital assets. The study further \nfound that about 30 percent of those families whose incomes are less \nthan $20,000 held capital assets, as did 50 percent of families with \nincomes between $20,000 and $50,000. So who pays the tax? It is not \njust the so-called wealthy, unless you are in that $20,000 to $50,000 \nbracket and you consider yourself wealthy. I don't think you do.\n  According to IRS data from 1998, 25 million returns filed that year \nreported capital gains; they reported capital gains on their tax \nreturn. That represents about one in five returns. Of those, 40 percent \nreporting capital gains had incomes of less than $50,000 and 59 percent \nof those filing those returns with capital gains had incomes of less \nthan $75,000.\n\n  It is rather clear, I think, to most of us, that, in fact, capital \nassets are held by a very significant majority of Americans: pension \nplans, IRAs--wherever you invest. Whatever the pension plan is, most \nlikely that plan is invested in stocks, in the productivity of this \ncountry, in the base of this country.\n  So as a result of reducing capital gains taxes, the economy will \ncontinue to grow. We will have sustained growth creating more jobs, \nbetter jobs, generating more capital, and increasing productivity, the \nengine of growth. All sectors of the economy benefit, increasing more \ntax revenues into the U.S. Treasury.\n  Sustaining economic growth is the purpose of the Gregg amendment. I \nencourage all my colleagues to take a serious look at this amendment. \nIf they do, I believe they will come to the conclusion that this \ncountry needs a reduction in its capital gains tax.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time is remaining and how has it been allocated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 20 minutes on the time of the \nSenator from New Hampshire; 30 minutes on the other side.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is there someone to speak in opposition?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Not yet, not at this point.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I want to make clear I am in opposition, too, but right \nnow I don't have anyone to speak.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Just for the sake of completing the record, I will speak \nin opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate the arguments of my good friend from New \nHampshire. Clearly, as capital gains taxes affect the transfer of \ncapital, that is of property, they can affect the degree to which this \neconomy prospers. There is no doubt that capital gains tax rates are a \nfactor in the acceleration of growth rates.\n  I must point out, though, when the President proposed his tax cut \nbill of $1.6 trillion, he did not include any capital gains \nprovisions--none whatsoever. I wouldn't want to second guess the \nPresident, but the point is he himself thought it made more sense to \nlower individual rates and not to lower capital gains rates at this \ntime.\n  I think, if you look at the bill the Finance Committee has brought to \nthe Floor, you will see it is a bill designed to reduce individuals' \nincome taxes. Whether it is the marriage penalty provisions, child \ncredit rates, the new 10-percent bracket--they are all on the \nindividual side. There are no corporate\n\n[[Page S5187]]\n\nprovisions, nor are there any affecting capital gains.\n  Another problem I must point out about the proposal by my good friend \nfrom New Hampshire is that it is temporary. We have heard many people \nlegitimately voice their concerns about the complexity of the Tax Code, \nand the capital gains provisions are responsible for their fair share \nof that complexity. If we have an on-again, off-again capital gains \nprovision, it is not only going to add to the complexity, but it will \nadd some uncertainty as well. People will not know what congressional \npolicy is with respect to capital gains.\n  That is less true with respect to other provisions. Let's take the \nR tax credit as an example. It is true that Congress over the years \nhas been a bit inconsistent in the number of years for which it extends \nthe R tax credit. Sometimes it is extended for 1 year, others a few \nyears. There was a time a few years ago when it lapsed completely for a \nshort period of time. Yet people know Congress will stand by the R \ntax credit so they have some ability to count on it when they do their \nplanning.\n\n  It is much less clear with respect to capital gains. The capital \ngains provisions have changed dramatically over the years, both in \nstructure and in rates. People don't know what to expect with respect \nto how they will be taxed in the future.\n  Finally, I must point out that this amendment is not germane to the \nunderlying bill, and at the appropriate point I will make a point of \norder to that effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  First, I think we have to understand what the capital gains tax cut \nwill do. It will generate prosperity. It will generate capital that is \ntoday locked down in investments that are not productive, take that \ncapital, cause people to convert that capital to cash, and reinvest it \nin other economic activity which will create jobs, create prosperity.\n\n  Every time we have reduced the capital gains rate in this country, we \nhave seen a flow of revenues into the Federal Treasury also. So not \nonly does it create economic activity in the community at large, and \ncreate more investment activity, and thus create more entrepreneurship, \nand thus create more jobs, it also creates more cash coming into the \nFederal Treasury.\n  Why is that, you may ask. How can a tax cut actually generate more \nincome? Because, very simply, the income is never realized if the money \nstays locked down. It never occurs unless you create the tax cut. When \nyou create the tax cut, people have an incentive to go out and convert \nthose capital assets--which today are just sitting there--into cash, \nand as a result they generate revenue, and that revenue is taxed. As a \nresult, the Treasury gains more money.\n  In fact, we do not have to think of this in theoretical terms \nanymore. We have a series of events which have shown this to have \nactually occurred. The last time it was suggested that we cut capital \ngains rates, it was also suggested those capital gains rates would, \nagain, over a period of time, create a loss to the Treasury. In fact, \njust the opposite occurred. The estimates were off by $100 billion the \nlast time the capital gains rates were cut. We received $100 billion \nmore of income to the Government than we expected as a result of the \ncapital gains activity during the period from 1997 through 2000.\n  So this year we come forward with a proposal which is a limited \ncapital gains cut, the purpose of which is to energize the economy, \ncreate activity, and, as a side bar, it will generate revenues to the \nFederal Government.\n  It has been scored as a positive generator of revenues to the Federal \nGovernment for the first 3 years by the Joint Tax Committee. \nUnfortunately, when they looked over 10 years, they did not look, I \nguess, at the historical data because, if they had, they would have \nseen that historically there is a factual event which shows it \ncontinues to generate positive revenues. Instead, they went to some \nsort of model they used at Joint Tax and came up with the estimate that \nin 10 years there might be a loss to the Treasury of $10 billion. \nRemember, this is $10 billion on a $3.5 trillion tax cut. So it is less \nthan 1 percent of the entire event. And even that number is suspect.\n  So the simple fact is, the argument that this is going to lose money \nfor the Treasury cannot be supported, either in the short term, where \nit will generate cashflow, or in the long term, where we have seen \npositive cashflow to the Treasury as a result of the capital gains cut \nthat was done in the early 1990s. So that makes no sense.\n  This argument on germaneness also makes no sense. In two places in \nthis bill capital gains are affected. They are affected on the AMT, and \nthey are affected on the estate tax. So clearly capital gains activity \nis a germane event.\n  But most importantly, we get back to the original point, which is \nthat by cutting capital gains we actually will generate more economic \nactivity in the marketplace, we will give people more cash, more \ninvestment assets. They will go out, take risks, create jobs, and thus \ncreate prosperity. That should be our goal in the tax cut.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hagel be added as \na cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. As was mentioned so appropriately by the Senator from \nNebraska, this is no longer a tax issue for the wealthy; this is a tax \nissue for middle America. Middle America is aggressively investing in \nthe stock market today through their pension plans and also through \ntheir individual activity. Reducing the capital gains rate will \nsignificantly and positively impact middle America, something this tax \nbill does not do in the most effective way, in my opinion.\n  More importantly, it will affect them today because it will give them \nthe opportunity--starting next month, if this tax bill passes--to take \nadvantage of a lower tax rate, which will have an immediate impact on \ntheir ability to generate profits and gains and take those profits and \ngains and put them into new investments which will generate new jobs, \nwhich will generate more prosperity.\n  It is a win-win situation for us because we generate more prosperity \nas a result of more economic activity and more investment and we \nactually generate more revenues for the Federal Government.\n  So I certainly hope, when we get to the point of voting, if there is \na motion to repeal this amendment on the issue of germaneness, that \nwill not be brought forward because I might win, and I would not want \nto undermine the germaneness rules of the Senate by winning that vote. \nI think it might make more sense, if that motion is going to be made, \nthat it be made on the issue of the cost estimates of this bill. We \ncould waive that motion and, hopefully, be successful.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for \nbringing this amendment forward. If I am not listed as a cosponsor, I \nask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I note that I offered a similar amendment myself. In fact, I \nknow several of us offered similar amendments because this is such a \ngood idea.\n  I begin by complimenting the Presiding Officer for the extraordinary \njob he has done in putting together a compromise tax bill. It is with \ngreat hesitancy that I suggest an amendment to this bill, but I know if \nit were not so critical to get a lot of support from disparate groups \nof folks, the Presiding Officer undoubtedly would be supporting an \namendment of this type as well.\n  So I simply agree with the Senator from New Hampshire that the \nprimary point here is to both raise revenue and stimulate the economy, \nwhich is what a capital gains rate reduction will do. That is what our \nprior experience in this country has been. Clearly, that is what would \nhappen in this particular case.\n\n[[Page S5188]]\n\n  So again, what this amendment does is reduce the long-term top rate \nfrom 20 to 15 percent for a 2\\1/2\\-year period, from June 2001 to \nDecember 31, 2003--a period of 2\\1/2\\ years. That is the period at \nwhich the rate will be reduced.\n\n  What would be the impact of that? All investors, it has been pointed \nout--small, medium, and even large investors--would understand there is \na window of time for 2\\1/2\\ years, during which they could dispose of \nassets, sometimes assets they have held for a long period of time \nbecause they have not wanted to have to pay the large capital gains \nrate on them. So they have held on to the asset, thus, in effect, \nmaking less money available for investment into the newer technologies \nand the more exciting things in the market today. It would provide a \n2\\1/2\\-year window for all of these people to go ahead and sell those \nolder portfolio stocks, those older assets of land or equipment--or \nwhatever it might be that they have been hesitant to sell in the past \nbecause of the huge tax they would have to pay--a 2\\1/2\\-year window to \ndispose of those assets, take the cash, and reinvest it in something \nthat would help the new economy even more.\n  That kind of churning effect in the past has been demonstrated to \nprovide not only stimulus to the economy, as the Senator from New \nHampshire said, but also more revenues to the Treasury. Indeed, Joint \nTax, which does not have a reputation of favorably scoring these kinds \nof things, noted that during the first 4 years there would be a net \ngain in revenue to the Treasury from the reduction in the capital gains \nrate. It is only after that that they have estimated a very slight loss \nthat would occur thereafter. I disagree with that estimate. But, in any \nevent, clearly this is the way to both stimulate the economy and \nincrease revenues.\n  I think it is unassailable by any standard that the capital gains \nrates in this country are too high. According to a study by the \nAmerican Council for Capital Formation, American taxpayers face capital \ngains tax rates that are 35 percent higher than those paid by the \naverage investor in other countries. This is an area where virtually \nevery other country on the globe outcompetes the United States because \nthey recognize the anchor effect, the drag effect, of a capital gains \nrate on their economy. We need to get in the game, and we can do that \nby reducing our capital gains rates.\n\n  Lowering the rates will be a boost to the economy. The recent \nindividual capital gains rate reductions have boosted U.S. economic \ngrowth. These are facts. Reducing the cost of capital promoted the kind \nof productive business investment that fostered growth in output and in \nhigh paying jobs. Lowering the capital gains rates aided entrepreneurs \nin their efforts to promote technological advances in products and \nservices most people wanted and needed. It has this unlocking effect I \nmentioned earlier.\n  Further reductions in the capital gains rates will enhance savings, \ninvestment, GDP growth, and boost equity values.\n  A recent analysis done by Dr. Allen Sinai, President and CEO of \nDecision Economics, concluded that the capital gains reductions that \nwere included in the 1999 tax bill, which was vetoed by President \nClinton, which would have reduced long-term rates from 20 down to 18 \npercent, would have had a significant, positive impact on the economy. \nThe analysis indicates that if the rate reductions had been enacted, \nreal GDP would be $64.6 billion higher, and employment, investment, new \nbusiness formation, and national savings would be greater over the \nperiod of 2000-2004.\n  It is quite likely--I think evident--that our economy would be in \nmuch better shape today had the previous administration appreciated the \nimportance of capital formation growth and the President not vetoed the \ncapital gains reduction we passed.\n  The recent Federal Reserve Board report indicated that Americans lost \nnearly $2 trillion in wealth in just the last quarter of 2000 as a \nresult of the stock market decline. That is approximately a loss of \n$20,000 in wealth and capital for each household in America--think of \nthat--the equivalent of $20,000 in loss for each household in America. \nOf course, less household capital means less capital available for \ninvestment and capital formation.\n  Reducing the capital gains tax rate will encourage investors to \nunlock cumulative gains of the past. Capital would be more free to go \ninto the entrepreneurial and future-oriented, technology-generating \nenterprises. In particular, venture capital investment, which is vital \nto this new technological innovation and productivity, will benefit as \na result of the unlocking of this capital.\n  Let's not forget about national savings. Reducing capital gains taxes \nmeans less taxes on Americans who choose to save for their future.\n  To conclude, this estimate by Joint Tax indicates a revenue increase \nto the Treasury for the first 4 years. There is not another provision \nin the tax bill the Presiding Officer has so carefully crafted that \nwill produce actual increases in revenue during this period of time. \nThis is exactly the time when our economy needs the boost. I can't \nthink of anything that would be better for inclusion in this tax bill \nthan this temporary reduction in the rate of capital gains paid by \nAmericans.\n  The fact that they declare a slight net loss in the time thereafter \nis simply an indication of the kind of poor estimating they have done \nin the past.\n  Again, it is a very small amount of money, and the time we really \nneed the boost is right now. That is where Joint Tax indicates there \nwould be a revenue increase.\n  The amendment to this bill complements many aspects of the \nPresident's plan. It adds another important addition, immediate relief \nfor capital formation and growth. That is what this tax plan is all \nabout. That is what the American people are expecting as the result of \nthe plan. That is why this idea put forth by several of us, \nencapsulated in the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire, is \nsuch a great idea.\n  I urge my colleagues, when the time comes, to support this amendment \nas something that will both generate new revenue and foster capital \nformation for the American economy. I thank the Senator from New \nHampshire for offering the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-six and a half minutes in opposition.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I note with some amusement the last Senator \ncriticizing the previous President for not being more sympathetic to \ncapital gains reductions. I remind my good friend, the current \nPresident also does not seem to have much interest in further capital \ngains reductions because he, in his big tax bill, did not include any \ncapital gains reduction provisions. Some time down the road he may \nsuggest it. But in this big tax bill, which certainly is one of the \nmajor pieces of legislation the President would like to see enacted, \nthis administration does not include any capital gains provisions.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a quick comment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Certainly.\n  Mr. KYL. Does the Senator from Montana believe that President Bush, \nhowever, would veto a capital gains reduction as President Clinton did?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I cannot answer that kind of hypothetical \nbecause there is no way of knowing what else might be in that bill the \nPresident may not like, just as there's no way of knowing whether \nPresident Clinton would have vetoed a capital gains reduction standing \nalone. Presidents don't have the ability to line-item veto, so it is \nvery hard to answer that question.\n  But my basic point is clear: This bill contains no capital gains \nprovisions, and for that reason, the amendment is nongermane.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the amendment offered by my good friend from \nNew Hampshire adds much greater complexity to the tax bill than already \nexists by making capital gains reductions apply only for a short period \nof time. We have had a difficult enough time as it is in this bill to \ntry to fit a more progressive bill into the confines of $1.35 trillion \nover 11 years. We wanted to provide for marriage penalty relief, \nrefundability of the child tax credit and expansion of the Earned \nIncome Tax Credit, lower marginal rates, increased pension benefits, \neducation deductions for college tuition. It has been very hard to fit \nin all those provisions.\n\n[[Page S5189]]\n\n  Now the Senator from New Hampshire would add more complexity by \nmaking this capital gains provision active only for a short period of \ntime. I believe a major amendment such as this one needs to be \nthoroughly vetted before we impose a new capital gains structure \nthrough this bill.\n  Many different ideas on how to treat capital gains have been \nproposed. For example, some Senators have suggested capital gains \nexclusions, either in the form of a dollar amount exclusion or as a \npercentage exclusion. This type of capital gains reform actually makes \nthe code much more simple. It is easier to administer, and it might \nmake more sense for more taxpayers; that is, the first x amount of \ndollars of capital gains could be excluded when computing one's income \ntaxes, or one could say the first 50 percent of capital gains could be \nexcluded.\n  Years ago, we did have a percentage exclusion, and it made sense. And \nit represented another way of providing lower capital gains taxes, in \nthe form of an exclusion as opposed to a straight lowering of the \nrates.\n  A lot of Americans who holders of mutual funds are concerned about \ncapital gains today because, while the value of their mutual funds \ndeclined last year, in many cases they nevertheless paid capital gains \ntaxes on stocks the portfolio manager traded in order to maximize the \nvalue of the fund. So even though the shareholder's value declined, he \nis still paying capital gains taxes in many cases. This doesn't seem to \nmake a lot of sense, but the taxpayer gets to deduct those losses at a \nlater date when he sells the shares.\n  It has been suggested that we should try to help these taxpayers too, \nperhaps by allowing them to defer the gains that the portfolio manager \nprovided to the shareholder by trading securities in the portfolio. \nThat would be a way to deal with the capital gains taxes millions of \nAmericans in that situation are facing, even though the shares of their \nmutual funds are declining. Providing this type of deferral would tend \nto help middle-income taxpayers a lot more than the amendment offered \nby the Senator from New Hampshire, which will tend to help wealthier \ntaxpayers.\n  There are other ways to deal with capital gains taxes too, which have \nbeen proposed but not considered this year by the Finance Committee. \nThis is a major modification to the Tax Code designed to stimulate the \ntransfer of assets, yet it hasn't been considered by the Committee of \njurisdiction to determine whether this particular approach is the best \none to take. I don't think it is good public policy to write such a \nmajor provision on the Senate Floor without the Finance Committee's \nparticipation.\n  I think it would be much wiser for us to defer this until later this \nyear, or maybe next year, when there is an opportunity to debate it \nmore fully. The Joint Tax Committee has produced a study on the \nsimplification of the Tax Code, and I will point out again that some of \nthe greatest complexities in the code are the result of our capital \ngains provisions. In part, this complexity results because of the \ndifferential between capital gains rates and ordinary income rates.\n  The greater that differential, the more taxpayers try very creative \nways to move their assets so they are not taxed at ordinary income \nrates, but rather capital gains rates. And this effort to re-\ncharacterize income can stretch the meaning of normal tax concepts. \nThis amendment would exacerbate these efforts because the gap between \nrates would be greater and people would have more incentive to try to \nmanipulate the characterization of their income in order to improperly \nminimize their taxes.\n  My main point is that this is an attractive idea on its face. \nClearly, lowering capital gains rates would stimulate the transfer of \nassets and may accelerate growth, at least in the short term. But this \nis not the time and place for this amendment.\n  As for the revenue issues, the Senator has touched on the issue of \ndynamic scoring versus static scoring methodologies. This brings up an \nage-old problem we deal with in Congress--that is, how to determine \nwhat the revenue impact will be when we change the Tax Code. Those who \nsupport dynamic scoring claim that tax cuts, whether in capital gains \nrates or otherwise, actually raise revenue rather than losing it \nbecause of the interactive effect of economic growth. The Joint Tax \nCommittee, in what is almost an art more than a science, generally does \na good job of taking into consideration those taxpayer behaviors that \nare the most reliable when they attempt to estimate the impact of a \nprovision.\n  I think we have to trust the Joint Tax Committee, which is the agency \nwe all depend upon to determine scoring, which says that the provision \nactually loses revenue in the context of this bill.\n  I appreciate the effort of my friend from New Hampshire, but I truly \nbelieve this time this is not the time and place for this amendment. I \nwill raise a point of order at the appropriate time.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to explain my vote in favor of \namendment No. 656 to the tax bill that we are debating today. The \nrecord clearly shows my strong support for fiscal discipline and \nresponsible tax reduction. It also shows my strong opposition to the \nunderlying tax cut because it is too large and too careless. However, I \nam voting in favor of this amendment even though it contains no offsets \nand could potentially raise the overall cost of the tax cut. I vote for \nthis amendment because I believe it is imperative that this tax bill \nshould contain some provisions directed to business and industry and \nsupportive of economic growth. By voting in favor of this amendment, \none of the few that will directly influence investment and economic \ngrowth, it is my intent to get it before the Conference Committee where \nit will be a part of the discussion of what will be the final version \nof this tax bill. It is my hope that in Conference, our colleagues will \nrecognize that capital formation is a key to economic growth and \nprosperity. In addition, history has proven that a cut in the capital \ngains tax not only stimulates the economy, but also raises revenue for \nthe federal government. In fact, one of the reasons I am voting in \nfavor of this temporary reduction in the capital gains tax rate, is \nthat the Joint Tax Committee score does show it raising revenue this \nyear and through 2004 before losing revenue in out years. I am voting \nfor this amendment because I am confident that its cost is justified \nwhen compared to its economic benefits and because it is my hope that \nthe Conference Committee will add it to the tax bill without raising \nthe bill's overall cost.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). Who yields time? The Senator \nfrom New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 5 minutes. \nThe Senator from Montana has 18 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask that any time used during a quorum call be charged \nagainst the time of the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. What is the request?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Montana has 18 minutes. If we are going \nto go into a quorum call, I ask that the time be charged to the time of \nthe Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object. That is not the way we do business around here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. If no one yields time, \ntime will be charged equally against both sides.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am going to speak, then the Senator from \nMontana will speak, and then we will yield on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I want to make a couple points in response. The \nscoring on this that I am referring to is not dynamic; it is \nhistorical. The fact is that the last time we cut the capital gains \ntax, it was said by Joint Tax that we would lose revenue over an \nextended period of time. In fact, it turned out that we gained revenue \nover the extended period of time. In fact, we exceeded the revenues by \nover $100 billion over the time period of 5 years.\n  Today the amendment I have offered generates positive revenue over \nthe first 3 years, which is the period--2\\1/2\\ years--when the capital \ngains cut is in place. And then it has been projected that in the \nbalance of the 10 years, it\n\n[[Page S5190]]\n\nwill lose $10 billion total. Mr. President, $10 billion on a $1.3 \ntrillion bill is a manageable number.\n  The economic benefit that will be generated by cutting the capital \ngains tax starting June 1 will be huge. It will far exceed any $10 \nbillion that is lost--assuming it were ever lost--because it will mean \nthat there will be a massive infusion of cash into the economy that is \ntoday locked down--a massive infusion of investment into the economy \nthat is today locked down.\n  That investment will generate jobs, create entrepreneurship, and \ngenerate prosperity. It will benefit, disproportionately, middle-income \nAmericans, who are today heavily invested through their pension funds \nand through personal activity in the stock market. It will, therefore, \nbe a significant win for the American people and for the Federal \nGovernment because we will generate more revenues for the prosperity of \nour Nation.\n  That is why I think it is a good idea to do it and do it now, and it \nis certainly not an expensive exercise.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from New \nHampshire for agreeing to shorten debate on this amendment. I will \nagain outline why I must respectfully oppose the amendment. One, this \nis not part of the President's package, and we have resisted including \nprovisions in this bill that are not part of the President's agenda \nexcept in very limited circumstances. Frankly, because there are no \ncapital gains provisions in the underlying bill, this amendment is \nsubject to a point of order. It is not germane.\n  Second, the provision is temporary, and that adds complexity to a \ncode that is complex enough.\n  Third, there are many ways to deal with capital gains reductions. \nThis amendment only represents one: to lower the rates for a certain \nperiod of time. Another would be to provide for an exclusion of some \nportion of capital gains income from taxes completely, either as a \ndollar exclusion or as a percentage exclusion. This particular form, \nthat is, the exclusion from income, will tend to help middle-income \ntaxpayers even more than the provision offered by my friend from New \nHampshire, which will tend to benefit the wealthiest taxpayers who deal \nin stocks.\n  Those Americans who pay capital gains on assets held in their mutual \nfunds, even though the value is declining, are not going to be helped \nthat much by this amendment. There are other ways to help them.\n  In conclusion, I don't believe this provision represents sound tax \npolicy.\n  I urge Senators to not support this amendment so we can keep this \nbill intact, go to conference, and come back with a bill that is \nvirtually identical, if not identical, to the Senate-passed bill. I \nyield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back the remainder of his \ntime.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, \nis recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 692--Motion to Commit with Instructions\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 692.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the motion be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Mr. Wellstone moves to commit the bill H.R. 1836, as \n     amended, to the Committee on Finance with instructions to \n     report the same back to the Senate not later than that date \n     that is 3 days after the date on which this motion is adopted \n     with the following amendments:\n       (1) Establish a reserve account for purposes of providing \n     funds for Federal education programs.\n       (2) Strike the reductions to the highest rate of tax under \n     section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 contained in \n     section 101.\n       (3) Provide for the deposit in the reserve account \n     described in paragraph (1) in each of fiscal years 2002 \n     through 2011 of an amount equal to the amount that would \n     result from striking the reductions described in paragraph \n     (2) (as determined by the Joint Committee on Taxation).\n       (4) Make available amounts in the reserve account described \n     in paragraph (1) in each of fiscal years 2002 through 2011 \n     for purposes of funding Federal education programs, which \n     amounts shall be in addition to any other amounts available \n     for funding such programs during each such fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will take a little time because I \nwant to hear from my colleagues on the other side.\n  In the budget resolution on the Senate side there was an amendment \nthat Senator Harkin offered. I was an original cosponsor with Senator \nHarkin. This was an amendment on which Senators Murray and Kennedy \njoined. I think this amendment was adopted with 52 votes.\n  We called for $250 billion over the next 10 years to go into \neducation. There were altogether 52 Senators who voted in support.\n  But, when the conference committee got its hands on the Harkin \namendment, this commitment to education disappeared. This motion \ncommits the reconciliation bill to the Senate Finance Committee and \ndirects the committee to send the bill back to the Senate with a \nreserve fund of $120 billion; in other words, just half of what the \nHarkin amendment included.\n  Where does the $120 billion for education come from over the next 10 \nyears? The motion eliminates the cuts in the 39.6-percent tax bracket.\n  My colleagues might ask: What happens to the 0.7 percent of Americans \nwho pay taxes at this rate? That is all we are talking about, 0.7 \npercent of taxpayers. Do they not get a tax cut under this amendment? \nAbsolutely they do, and they get a big one. In fact, the 0.7 percent of \nfamilies who pay at least some tax at this rate--a married couple, for \nexample, would have to earn over $297,000 a year to do so--will still \nget about a $8,400 cut in their taxes under this motion. That is a big \ncut. More importantly, 99.3 percent of American taxpayers will not have \ntheir tax cut affected by this motion at all.\n  By slightly reducing the tax cut for 0.7 percent of the richest \nAmericans, we can invest in what is 100 percent of our future, which is \nour children. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  What does this mean? It means we can do better with afterschool \nprograms.\n  What does this mean? It means we can do better with more reading \nassistance for these children.\n  What does this mean? It means we will not have as great a disparity \nin who can afford higher education.\n  What does this mean? It means people who are laid off on the Iron \nRange will have job training and job education opportunities to find \nother work and do well.\n  While too many of us are taking photos with children and talking \nabout education, we have a system in the low-income communities where \nthere are 50,000 unprepared teachers hired every year. How interesting \nit is. We are going to be doing all of this testing, which I will get \nback to when we get back to the education bill, but at the same time we \nare going to have a Federal mandate to test every child, we will not \nhave a Federal mandate that will call for the same opportunity for \nevery one of these children to learn and do well.\n  How in the world do we think these children are going to do that if \nthey do not have good teachers?\n  How do we think they are going to do it in classes that are 50 in \nsize?\n  How do we think they are going to do it when the schools are so \ndecrepit?\n  How do we think they are going to do it when they do not have the \nadditional help they need?\n  While we are talking, about 25 percent of prekindergarten child care \nis considered to be good or excellent. Most of it is average to \ndangerous.\n  While we are talking, over half of Minnesota's 10- to 12-year-olds \nhave no care after school. That means children whose parents are \nworking hard have no place to go but home alone.\n  While we are talking, the Pell grant has declined in value to only 86 \npercent of what it was worth in 1980.\n  This is a clear question of values. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis motion. It leaves unaffected the tax cuts in this bill for 99.3 \npercent of American taxpayers. It takes some, but not all, of the \nsurplus funds that would go to\n\n[[Page S5191]]\n\ntax cuts for the wealthiest 0.7 percent of taxpayers, and it sets that \nmoney aside--$120 billion over 10 years--for education.\n  The wealthiest 0.7 percent will still see their taxes cut by $8,400. \nThe bill proposes to lock in $1.35 trillion in tax cuts over the next \n10 years. If this motion is adopted, we will still have $1.23 trillion \nof tax cuts, but we will also be locking in $120 billion for education.\n  Here is the simple proposition: Should the Senate set aside $120 \nbillion of the surplus over the next 10 years for education, an amount \nequal to one-tenth of the tax cuts that are proposed? I propose $10 in \ntax cuts but $1 for every $10 in new money for education.\n  That should be an easy tradeoff for colleagues. I hope it is easy, \nand I hope they vote yes.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of \nthe Senator from Minnesota. I know he is one of the most sincere \nindividuals in the Senate when it comes to the issue of education. We \nhave had a chance to hear him speak on these issues many times in the \nlast few weeks as we have been considering the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act amendments.\n  As sincere as the Senator from Minnesota is in pursuing his goals for \neducation, doing it on this bill is beyond the scope of the Finance \nCommittee's jurisdiction in the way that he would set up a reserve fund \nto do that.\n  A commitment of this bill back to committee to set up a reserve fund \nwould not be within the jurisdiction of our committee. It would direct \nus to set up a reserve account that would lead us to what he refers to \nas full funding of education programs.\n  It would also strike any reduction in the tax burden for those at the \n39.6-percent tax rate. There is no revenue estimate for this amendment. \nThat is another issue with which we have to deal within the realities \nof the budget resolution.\n  Our bill contains many excellent educational provisions that are \nwithin the scope and the jurisdiction of our Senate Finance Committee. \nThese are tax provisions. They are tax provisions that consequently \nwould improve the day-to-day lives of ordinary Americans.\n  The Senate has passed these education amendments--twice last year \nand, I think, the year before. Also, these are provisions which, even \nthough they are in this bill, they are on the calendar as a separate \nbill that was voted out of our committee by a vote of 20-0. So we know \nthese have almost unanimous support in the Senate, as the Senate \nFinance Committee is a microcosm of the entire Senate.\n  This motion to commit ought to be seen by our colleagues as a motion \nto delay the passage of this tax bill and the tax relief for working \nmen and women that will result from this legislation.\n  In addition, while the motion to commit may be in order, what it \ndirects the committee to do is to fund education spending programs. \nTherefore, it is my belief--and we may raise this point later on--it \nwould not be germane to the bill. I appreciate Senator Wellstone's \nsincerity. However, I urge my colleagues to reject it.\n  On a larger note, I am going to take this opportunity to ask the \nSenator from Minnesota to consider a point of view that I expressed \nlast week in regard to the wealthy of America. I do not deny what he \nsays about the people who pay the 39.6-percent tax rates, that they are \nvery high income people and, maybe more so than other people, can \nafford to pay that rate. I think too often the Senator from Minnesota \nas well as a lot of other Senators--maybe even some on our side of the \naisle--take the view that when we apply the 39.6-percent tax rate, we \nare applying it to a group of people who have always been rich and will \nforever be rich. But that is not the true picture of America.\n  I want to address that thought and ask the Senator to consider that \npoint of view as I ask him to focus upon what he is doing on the tax \nportions of his amendment.\n  We hear so much in this debate about taxing those getting a good \npaycheck--obviously, a very good paycheck in terms of the amendment of \nthe Senator and those people who are going to be taxed at 39.6 percent. \nBut speeches such as this would make you think the people being taxed \nmust have been getting a good paycheck their entire life--born rich, \nstay rich, and die rich. But that is not true of most of the people who \nare in the highest tax brackets. I think people who make these claims \nprovide a distorted picture of America. They present a picture of \nAmerica where a family who is struggling will always struggle and \nconsequently be at the low income tax rate level or maybe not pay any \nincome tax at all. That is on the one hand. On the other hand, we have \nan America where people can buy sirloin instead of chuck round, that \nthey have always been able to do this and will always be able to do it. \nIn other words, the poor are always poor and the rich are always rich.\n  But as we all know, real life provides a more complicated picture. \nThe reality is that the vast majority of our poorest Americans, with a \nbad spell here and there, spend their lives moving up the economic \nladder until retirement.\n  Yes, there is an extremely small group of people, estimated at \napproximately 1 percent, for whom the enormous hardship of poverty is a \nlifelong constant; that is, they are poor and will remain poor \nthroughout most of their life. For these unfortunates, obviously, our \nsociety hopefully is a loving society and provides a safety net, a \nsafety net that is expanded by the provisions of this bill, in addition \nto a lot of appropriated accounts in which we try to help this group of \npeople.\n  But beyond that 1 percent, or fewer, who are going to be poor \nthroughout their entire life, for most Americans who study, work hard, \nand play by the rules, their tomorrow is a brighter tomorrow.\n  I do not come to this conclusion by myself. Every one of us can have \nthe benefit of a detailed study by the University of Michigan that \nabout a third of those at the bottom fifth income bracket--the bottom \n20 percent economically of our society--will move up to a higher income \nbracket even next year; in other words, into the second or third \nquintile.\n  Over the past 16 years of study by the University of Michigan, \napproximately 80 percent of those who were the poorest of Americans had \nmoved into the middle class. And incredibly--but it tells you something \nabout the greatness of America and our economic system and our social \ndynamics--about 30 percent of those at the bottom were among the \nrichest top fifth during the 16-year study period.\n  This notion that the people's wages are not constant, that a man \nprobably will not be paid the same amount when he is 25 as compared to \nwhen he is 55, is not news to me nor millions of other Americans who \nunderstand that there is opportunity to move ahead and up in our \nsociety.\n  But from the way others talk, this must be incredible news to those \nin the Washington elite who have never had a callus on their hands--\nthat somehow the poor are always poor and the rich did not work to get \nthere, but they have.\n  What a shock to them it must be to learn that over 60 percent--again, \n60 percent--of all families found themselves in the top 20 percent for \n1 or more years over a 16-year period in an analysis provided by the \nFederal Reserve.\n  This is who is now labeled the wealthy by those fighting tooth and \nnail against this tax cut--over 60 percent of all American families. \nAnd I would like to tell you the real story for many of these families \nwho have finally received the reward of a good paying job after a \nlifetime of hard work. It is at that time that these families are often \nthe most financially pressed. In other words, people who have married, \ngotten a job, had families, over a period of 30 years have moved up and \nmaybe became high-income people, but these are also people who might be \nhit by a 39.6-percent tax bracket who are also financially pressed \nbecause in modern-day America these are the families struggling to pay \nfor their kids' college, helping their kids with the cost of daycare, \ntrying to put away something for savings for their retirement.\n\n[[Page S5192]]\n\n  Also, this generation, the first generation in American history that, \nbesides taking care of their own kids, worrying about their own \nretirement, may be taking care of their mom and dad who are in a \nnursing home or need some financial assistance, these people are \nlabeled the rich, the wealthy, and in some instances facing marginal \ntax rates of up to 50 percent of Federal and State income taxes.\n  My colleagues should know, too, that for most Americans a good \npaycheck is fleeting because, as I said, the rich in America are not \nalways rich. Most of them were not born rich. They worked hard to get \nthere. And they do not stay there either because fully one-half of the \ntop 1 percent at the beginning of the decade dropped out of the top 1 \npercent at the end of the decade, and not only were they not in the top \n1 percent, they were not even in the top quintile, the top fifth income \nbracket, by the end of the decade.\n  That said, we still all know that the American dream is alive. Sixty \npercent of all American families will reach the top fifth income \nbracket during their lifetime. Eighty percent of those on the bottom \nrungs will reach the middle class or higher.\n  These high tax rates are really hitting the hard-working middle class \nwho finally get into the top brackets for a few years as a reward for \n30 years of hard work and may be even leading a miserly life to some \nextent thinking about the future. I want you to know those are some of \nthe people who are hurt so much by the high tax brackets--middle-class \npeople who finally make it to the promised land for a few years. I \nwould be sympathetic to people in this body who want to preserve that \nhigh tax rate if they wanted to apply it to the people who, for a \nlifetime, you might refer to as filthy rich. But for people who are \nfrom time to time in that high tax bracket, we ought to recognize the \nfact that it is punitive for people who have worked hard throughout \ntheir lifetime.\n  If you want to tax the other group of people who were born rich, stay \nrich, and die rich, then figure out some way of taxing them at a high \nbracket over a 5-year average or something so you do not hook these \npeople who reach the high bracket for a few years of their life and \nsteal the American dream from them.\n  I am proud this bipartisan tax bill helps reduce the tax bites of \nthese hard-working, middle-income Americans. I encourage my colleagues \nto remember that when they offer amendment after amendment, it limits \nmarginal tax cuts. It is these millions of hard-working American \nfamilies who have borne the brunt of hard work, been productive, \nraising their family, and providing for their own future. Let's not \ntake it away from them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 minutes--24 minutes 25 \nseconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wish to respond directly to my \ncolleague from Iowa. I am going to start out the same way he did \nbecause it has been a friendship. It is not like I dislike Senators, \nbut I always say very positive things about him because I think he is \none of the best people in the Senate. I think probably the other 98 \nSenators feel the same way.\n  I am going to get back to education, but on this whole question of \nthe elitist Washington viewpoint and people being able to work hard \nand, if you will, attain the American success or American dream--I know \nall about it. I don't want to get corny, but I think my father was 56 \nwhen my parents finally had enough money to buy a home. We thought we \nhad died and gone to heaven. It was a little box, it was a teeny place, \nbut for them, Jewish immigrants, it was a big deal. I understand full \nwell what that is about.\n  But I will tell you something and this is an honest to God \ndisagreement we have. You mentioned the whole issue of nursing homes. \nFirst of all, both had Parkinson's disease. My parents are no longer \nalive, but other people's parents and grandparents, they are not going \nto get a break when it comes to being able to afford prescription \ndrugs. That is why I support the Rockefeller amendment.\n  I say to my colleague from Iowa, as a matter of fact, the Finance \nCommittee is spending a lot of money on these tax cuts so that is not \nrevenue that is there. If, in fact, you want to make sure senior \ncitizens--then we will get to education--can afford prescription drugs, \nwhich means you cannot have too high a deductible or copay, which means \nyou can't means-test it at $20,000 and then say because individuals \nhave an income of $21,000 they don't get any break, which means you \nhave to cover the catastrophic expenses--you cannot do it on the cheap. \nWe are not going to have the money for it.\n  You talk about nursing homes. My colleague from Iowa has done some of \nthe best work, being there for consumers, going after some of the \nnursing home industry that do not live up to good standards. I agree \nwith him. But the truth is, whether it is enabling people in Iowa and \nMinnesota to stay home as long as possible and to live with dignity--\nthat is what my mom or dad wanted--or go to a nursing home, from where \ndo you think the money is going to come? Do you think that is going to \nbe done on a $3,000 tax credit? It costs a lot more than that. Where is \nthe commitment of resources going to be? We are not going to have it. \nIt is all going to be crowded out by this legislation.\n  I am saying to colleagues that for a couple with an income of \n$300,000 a year, their tax cut--they are going to get a tax cut. But \ntheir tax cut will be $8,400 a year. I think the majority of \nMinnesotans and couples in the United States of America who make \n$300,000 a year will say, if the tradeoff is we will be limited to a \n$8,400 tax cut but there will be more for children and for education, \nincluding our children, we are for it.\n  Let's get real about this. This is all a debate about values and \npriorities.\n  Mr. President, 52 Senators voted for the Harkin amendment. I was the \nfirst original cosponsor of that amendment. That was $250 billion, and \nin the budget resolution you said you were going to take it out of tax \ncuts. Mr. President, 52 Senators voted for that.\n\n  I am now taking half of that $250 billion, $120 billion, and I am \nsaying we take it out of the top 0.7 percent of the population, who \nstill get a tax cut but not as much.\n  You have voted in this ESEA authorization bill, as far as I can \ncalculate, for $212 billion for the period of 2002 to 2008. Are we \nengaged in symbolic politics or is this for real? I heard some of my \ncolleagues come to the floor and say we have to do more than talk the \ntalk; we have to walk the walk. If you have voted to authorize $212 \nbillion, from where do you think it is going to come? From where do you \nthink it is going to come? My colleague from Iowa, and for all I know \nDemocrats as well, are going to come out here and they are going to say \nthat this motion violates the Budget Act and, because of the Senate's \narcane rules, would require 60 votes.\n  That is true. But, unfortunately, I have to bring this motion to the \nfloor right now because you members of the Senate Finance Committee, \nyou are the ones who are spending all this money. You are spending the \nmoney through the tax cuts. It is going to be $2 trillion over the next \n10 years when all is said and done, and then in the following 10 years \nwhen the chickens come home to roost and we have more and more people \nwho are 65 and 70 and 75 and 80, you are going to erode the revenue \nbase by $4 trillion.\n  Where is the money going to be for Medicare? Where is the money going \nto be for Social Security? It is fiscally irresponsible. Honest to God, \nthis Senate Finance Committee--and I love you all individually--you are \nmaking me a fiscal conservative. I never thought I would ever say that \non the floor of the Senate. I cannot believe what you are doing, in \nterms of the future projections. I want to announce for the people of \nMinnesota today: Not only am I a Senator for education and children, \nthat is what I am trying to do here right now, but the Senate Finance \nCommittee, the Republicans and too many Democrats, all of whom I love \nindividually, have now made me a fiscal conservative. I cannot believe \nwhat we are doing. I cannot believe it.\n  So now I would say to my colleagues: This is your choice. Can I \nrepeat it one more time? We set aside only $120 billion of real money--\nnot authorizations.\n\n[[Page S5193]]\n\n I don't want you to vote for authorization and go back home and say I \nvoted for all this money for title I and I voted for all this money for \neverything else, when it is not real money, it is fiction. It is \nfiction and the Presiding Officer knows it. You set aside $120 billion, \nthat is one-tenth of the tax cuts. So it is an easy choice, $1 for \nchildren and education for every $10 in tax cuts, and you set it aside \nby saying to people, couples with incomes of almost $300,000 a year: \nYou get a tax cut of at least $8,400. What could be more reasonable?\n  I want to make two other points, one about this overall tax cut that \nis before us and the other about education. My colleague from Iowa \ntalks about the poor and helping the poor. I give credit where credit \nis due for a partial refundable tax credit, child credit. But can I ask \nthis question, and I may have an amendment on this later on today: If \nthe choice is between not covering any low-income children versus \ncovering some low-income children, versus covering all low-income \nchildren, why aren't we covering all low-income children? Why is it \nthat the poorest of poor children--the 10 million children who come \nfrom families with incomes under $10,000 a year--their families do not \nget a break at all? What in the world is going on here?\n\n  My colleague comes out on the floor and says--and so will others--\n``You are violating the Budget Act.''\n  Why don't you tell that to my daughter Marcia who is a Spanish \nteacher who will have 50 students in her class next year?\n  Why don't you tell that to my son Mark who has been teaching at an \ninner city school, Arlington High, in St. Paul, where so many of those \nstudents never had a break and need the additional help but they are \nnot going to have the resources?\n  Why don't you tell that to these children who are 7 and 8 years old \nand in a given year, especially in your inner city schools, they will \nhave two or three or four teachers, and, in addition, quite often they \ndo not have qualified teachers, and, in addition, the schools are \novercrowded, and, in addition, quite often the bathrooms don't work, \nthe plumbing doesn't work, the heating isn't adequate, the schools are \ntoo hot, and, in addition, they don't have the technology and the \nresources?\n  Why don't you tell it to these children that this--because of the \nSenate's arcane rules--violates the Budget Act? Tell it to the \nchildren. Do you want to know something? We can do a lot of things in \nthis Chamber of the Senate and they are reversible later on. When you \nrob a child of his or her childhood, it is irreversible. We are going \nto fully fund the title I program for children who come from low-income \nfamilies 10 years from now, maybe? These 7-year-olds will be 17. It \nwill be too late for them. You don't want to take $120 billion of real \nmoney for education? Instead, you want these Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax \ncuts?\n  I am embarrassed that the Democratic Party has not fought back \nharder. This will be the first of many amendments I will have on this \ntax cut, win or lose.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, might I inquire, how much time is \nremaining on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Wellstone has 13 minutes 33 seconds, \nand the opponents of the amendment have 15 minutes 4 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not see anyone in the Chamber who \nwishes to speak against this amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. May I ask my colleague, that must mean I have 98 votes \nfor it?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I don't know what it means, I say to my good friend from \nMinnesota. All I know is that at this point no one wishes to speak \nagainst the amendment. I urge my friend, if he wants to continue \nspeaking on the amendment, to do so. I wish I could help the Senator by \ndredging up opposition to this amendment, but I cannot find any.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Montana, I certainly \nappreciate it. I certainly would like to debate Senators on this \npriority. I certainly would like to. I think this gets right to the \npoint of values. I think this is a spiritual debate we are having.\n  I want to know when we are going to match our rhetoric about children \nand education with real resources. But I do not see Senators in this \nChamber, so I am assuming that this will be a win for children and \neducation.\n\n  But, for the moment, I say to my colleague, I guess what happens is \nwe go into a quorum call and time is charged equally against both \nsides?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator would yield, or the Senator could yield back \nhis time, someone else could offer an amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think I will speak a little longer \nabout my amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me summarize, in a very quiet way, for a moment, what this is \nabout. Then let me just challenge Senators. All I am saying is, it is \nkind of like walking our talk. There should be 52 votes for this \nmotion. Fifty-two Senators voted for a Harkin amendment to take $250 \nbillion out of tax cuts. I take half of that for education. I take it \nby eliminating the cuts in the 39.6-percent tax bracket. That is .07 \nper percent of Americans; that is a couple with an income of $300,000 a \nyear, and they still get an $8,400 tax cut.\n  But I am saying, by not making that additional cut, you then would \nhave $120 billion you would put aside for education. That is $1 for \neducation and children for every $10 in tax cuts. I am saying to \nSenators, if you voted for the Harkin amendment, this is half that \namount. I hope you will support this motion.\n  I am saying to you, Senators, that unfortunately it is 10:55 and I \ncannot get anybody to debate me. But the truth of the matter is, this \nis historic. What we are doing in the Senate is breathtaking.\n  The Presiding Officer, he can disagree with me. He is another one of \nthese Senators--I feel as if I am passing out compliments--who is civil \nand decent and good. And people can have different viewpoints.\n  For my own part, I think that we are doing two things.\n  We are, A, passing a tax cut that is still ``Robin Hood in reverse,'' \nwith still over 30 percent of the benefits going to the top 1 percent \nof the population. I remind my colleagues one more time, I give you \ncredit for improving this bill in the Finance Committee over what the \nPresident had, but when over 30 percent of the benefits are going to \nthe top 1 percent, and still 10 million of the poorest children in \nAmerica and their families are not benefiting from a child credit, I \nwonder about our priorities.\n  And B, and even more importantly--and I am sorry; in fact, I am \nembarrassed--the Democrats do not seem to grasp this. This will so \nerode our revenue base. We are talking really more about $2 trillion \nover the next 10 years and that there will not be the resources to \ninvest in education and children, or the resources to invest in \naffordable prescription drugs, or the resources to expand health care \ncoverage. And the list goes on and on.\n  If you believe that when it comes to these pressing issues of \npeople's lives there is nothing the Government can or should do, then \nthis is one big, good, ideological victory for you. But if you believe: \nI came to Washington believing we could do things that would lead to \nthe positive improvement of people's lives, and you believe there is a \npositive role for Government, then what we are about to do is shut it \ndown.\n  I cannot even begin to express my indignation about what we are doing \nwith education. We are all for the children, and we are all for \neducation, and we all love them, but we are not digging into our \npockets and making the investment.\n  We are going to get back to a bill really soon where the Federal \nGovernment--I am amazed conservatives are considering this--is going to \ntell every school district, every school, every State: You are going to \ntest children every year, age 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13, and at the same \ntime we are not interested in also having a Federal mandate backed by \nresources to guarantee that every one of those children will have the \nsame opportunity to succeed. We fund the title I program at the 30-\npercent level. We have children--most\n\n[[Page S5194]]\n\nchildren, many children--coming to kindergarten way behind, and yet we \nare not making the investment in the resources.\n  There never was a deal before we went to this education bill that \nthere would be the money. There still isn't any understanding. And now, \nDemocrats, wake up and smell the coffee. We are not going to have the \nresources.\n  This is a massive reversal in social policy. I am heartbroken by what \nwe are doing, but I certainly think that at the very minimum Senators \nwould be willing to vote for this motion. It is simple.\n  We should not separate our lives as legislators from the words we \nspeak. We have spoken great words about education and children. I have \nheard so many speeches, I have heard enough speeches to deafen all the \ngods. I want to know whether we are willing to invest the real money.\n  My colleagues are going to say this is a violation of the Budget Act. \nTell that to the good teachers who are trying to teach the children; \ntell that to the children. Tell that to kids whose childhood is \nprecious and wonderful, and, in all too many ways, we are robbing them \nof that childhood.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Six minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Is it too much to ask Senators, is it too much to ask \nfor the sake of better teachers, more teachers--by the way, there are a \nlot of great teachers--for the sake of having more qualified teachers, \nfor the sake of making sure these kids get more help with reading, \nmaking sure there is more title I money for kids who come from low-\nincome backgrounds, making sure we have the additional help for the \nchildren, especially the little children, is it too much to ask the \nwealthiest 0.7 percent to still get tax breaks, at least the $8,400 a \nyear, but we would not eliminate cuts in the 39.6-percent tax bracket \nand instead make the investment in children and education?\n  I grant you, the children I am talking about probably do not have the \nsame lobbying coalitions as those who want to cut the highest tax rate. \nI grant you the children I am talking about and their families probably \ndo not have the same access, probably they are not the big givers, \nprobably they are not the investors. But one would think out of some \nsense of values we could at least provide the support.\n  This whole issue of class warfare is a bogus argument. I maintain \nthat the vast majority of people in Minnesota who have incomes around \n$300,000 a year would be pleased to have some tax cut, at lease $8,000 \nor thereabouts, but then would say, fine, we don't need any more, and \nif you are going to put that money into children and education, God \nbless you, do it. We are proud of you, Senate.\n  I hope you will vote for the amendment.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is there in opposition to \nthe amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will take 4 minutes.\n  It is with deep regret that I must tell my good friend from \nMinnesota, in good faith and conscience, I cannot support his \namendment, certainly not at this time.\n  I agree with him that this tax bill is too big. In fact, I argued to \nthe President that he ought to propose a much smaller bill for the \nfirst 5 years and then, if the budget surpluses materialize, we can \nlook at another tax cut. That way, if the surpluses don't materialize, \nthis country is protected. We certainly don't know with a great degree \nof certainty what the budget surplus is going to be 10 years out.\n  The President did not agree with my suggestion, but it is a position \nthat makes a lot more sense and is better public policy, if we were to \npursue that direction. Unfortunately, we are not in that position \ntoday, as the Senator well knows.\n  The main argument the Senator makes--one that has a lot of merit to \nit--is an argument that he and others made on the budget resolution. \nBut that argument was not successful, and the budget resolution has \npassed with $1.35 trillion in tax cuts locked in. That is where we are \ntoday.\n  I agree with him that this is still too large a tax cut, though at \nleast it is smaller than the President's earlier proposal of $1.6 \ntrillion, so that is some progress.\n  There are other provisions in the budget resolution that do protect \nsocial needs. One is the $300 billion over 10 years for prescription \ndrugs, an amount that was locked in during the budget debate. \nAgriculture is provided $74 billion over 10 years, though that is not \nlikely to be enough. There is always the likelihood of disasters and \nother emergencies that will require us to re-evaluate that amount. As \nfor the contingency fund of $500 billion that is in this bill, we all \nknow that there are more claims to that $500 billion than there are \ndollars. That is a problem. Nevertheless, the contingency fund is also \nlocked in by the budget resolution.\n  It is important to remind ourselves that this tax bill will sunset \nafter 10 years; that is, under the rules we provided for ourselves, \nunless this tax bill passes by 60 votes or more, then these revenue \nbills are terminated after 10 years. This means that, while it is \nlegitimate to be concerned about the second 10 years, we necessarily \nreview all of these provisions before that time because of the \ntermination.\n  It may not be the best tax policy to have tax laws that terminate in \n10 years, but nevertheless those are the rules we have provided for \nourselves to ensure that there is strong bi-partisan support for these \nmeasures.\n  It is also important to recall that future Congresses are also going \nto make changes. Congress will meet again tomorrow. Congress will also \nmeet next week, next month, and next year, and according to the \nconditions of the time, I am quite confident that Members of future \nCongresses will make changes to what we consider here today. There will \nbe different Presidents during the 10 years of this bill, and they will \nhave different priorities and a different agenda.\n  Although it is not a lot of fun to raise taxes, Congress has raised \ntaxes when Congress felt it was necessary, even under Republican \nPresidents--many times in the 1980s.\n  This is a very dynamic country. The United States of America is \nprobably the most dynamic country in the history of civilization. We \nare a big country, and we have a history of adjusting to difficulties. \nWe are going to find ways to help education more than we have in the \npast, just as the Senator from Minnesota very correctly points out.\n  It is important to remember that in our country, 93 percent of the \ndollars for elementary and secondary education are raised at the State \nand local level. Only 7 percent of elementary and secondary education \ndollars are Federal dollars. That is starting to change because the \nStates are so strapped. We in Congress should accelerate that change, \nand this bill does so. There are deductions for college tuition, for \nexample, and other education provisions in the bill that total some $30 \nbillion. That is a start, and it includes a big, new initiative in the \ncollege tuition deduction, which is sure to be expanded in future \nyears.\n  To conclude, I must tell my good friend from Minnesota with a great \ndeal of regret, it is not even in the jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee to set up this fund. He is fighting the right battle for the \nright cause, but not in the right place. We will be more successful in \nfuture days and weeks and months to get more money for education, I am \nquite confident, and I will help him do so. Regrettably, we can't do it \nright here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to make a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote relative to the \nmotion to waive with respect to the Gregg amendment occur at 6:08 \ntoday, with 5 minutes under the control of Senator Gregg and 3 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Baucus for final debate prior to the vote, \nand that there be no second-degree amendment in order prior to the \nvote, and further, following that vote, the Senate proceed to a vote in \nrelationship to the Carnahan amendment as under the order.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I say to my \nfriend,\n\n[[Page S5195]]\n\nthe manager of the bill, the reason we are going to agree to this is \nthe fact that Senator Gregg has been over here for several days. I \nthink he deserves this extra time.\n  With the many, many votes we have later today, there will be no other \nagreements such as this. The reason there has been a rearrangement of \nthe order of voting is that this will allow Members to hear this debate \nprior to the first vote, and then after that the votes will sequence. \nSenator Gregg's vote was supposed to be second. We would have one vote \nand have this in between.\n  I hope the majority leader enforces the 10-minute rule this evening. \nWe have so many votes. I hope he will do that. If people have to step \nout of the Chamber for other business, I hope it will be at the peril \nof their missing these votes. In the past several months, we have held \nup votes for so long that it has made it inconvenient for everyone.\n  Having said that, I withdraw my objection.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator from \nNevada has said. I hope, too, that we will be able to expedite each of \nthese many rollcalls that we will have this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I was listening to the Senator from \nMontana. I have to say to him, with all due respect, he was talking \nabout how we locked this in for agriculture, and this for prescription \ndrugs--although I will tell you something, it is fiction, what has been \nlocked in for prescription drugs to make it affordable.\n  If we can lock it in for other areas, why can't we lock it in for \nchildren and education? The only thing I have gotten from the Senator \nfrom Montana is this vague commitment--oh, well, you know, sometime, \nsomeplace, later on we will get this done.\n  We have an opportunity right now to lock this in for children and \neducation. We can lock it in right now--$120 billion over 10 years, \nhalf of what we voted for in the budget resolution, coming out of the \ntax cut, coming out of the very highest 39.6 percent--although the very \nhighest income people, couples with $297,000, still will get a break of \n$8,400. In exchange for not cutting it any further, we will have $120 \nbillion for children and education.\n  I mean, vague commitments about the future--why don't we lock it in \nnow? This is real money. That is what this is all about. There is a \nzero-sum game between how much you do by way of tax cuts and how much \nyou erode the revenue base and what we will be able to do for children \nand education.\n\n  I say especially to my Democratic colleagues, if we can't step up to \nthe plate and vote for children and education, we don't have a \npolitics. We don't have a politics. No wonder people wonder what in the \nworld is going on. You have these Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax cuts still \nmainly going to the top 1 percent. You erode the revenue base and you \nare unwilling to lock in a commitment right now to children and \neducation, albeit a very modest commitment.\n  Senators, in the words of Rabbi Hillel: If you can't make the \ncommitment to children and education now, whenever will you? If you \ndon't speak for children in education now, whenever will you? If we are \nnot for children and education, who in the world are we for? Who do we \nthink we represent? It is time to step up to the plate now. This is \nreal money. Let's not play symbolic politics any longer.\n  How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to respond.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, very briefly, I voted to lock in more \nmoney for education when we were on the budget resolution, by voting \nfor the Harkin amendment. I wish that amendment would have passed, but \nunfortunately it didn't. As the Senator well knows, the place to lock \nin big amounts for programs such as education is during the budget \ndebate. The budget resolution was the place we were successful in \nlocking in $300 billion for prescription drugs.\n  But this is not the budget we are debating here. This is the tax \nbill. And unfortunately, the amount of the tax cut was locked in during \nthe budget debate, and that is what we must be comply with now.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Montana, 60 \nSenators can make this the proper time and place. That is what this \ndebate is all about. Sixty Senators can make this the proper time and \nplace to make a modest commitment to children and education. We can do \nit right now, or tonight when we vote on this motion.\n  With all due respect, I will tell you, people in the trenches working \nwith children in schools around the country look at these arcane rules \nand say, hey, if 60 of you can step to the plate and be there for \nchildren and education, please do so. We are waiting for you to act on \nwhat you say you believe in.\n  So I hope we get 60 votes, and then it will be the time and place. I \nyield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nUtah, Mr. Hatch, is recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 697\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senators Allen, Craig, \nGordon Smith, and Harry Reid, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. HATCH], for himself, Mr. Allen, \n     Mr. Craig, Mr. Smith of Oregon, and Mr. Reid, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 697.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permanently \nextend the research credit and to increase the rates of the alternative \n                          incremental credit)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title VIII insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __. RESEARCH CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Permanent Extension of Research Credit.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 41 (relating to credit for \n     increasing research activities) is amended by striking \n     subsection (h).\n       (2) Conforming Amendment.--Paragraph (1) of section 45C(b) \n     is amended by striking subparagraph (D).\n       (3) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this subsection \n     shall apply to amounts paid or incurred after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Increases in Rates of Alternative Incremental Credit.--\n       (1) In General.--Subparagraph (A) of section 41(c)(4) \n     (relating to election of alternative incremental credit) is \n     amended--\n       (A) by striking ``2.65 percent'' and inserting ``3 \n     percent'',\n       (B) by striking ``3.2 percent'' and inserting ``4 \n     percent'', and\n       (C) by striking ``3.75 percent'' and inserting ``5 \n     percent''.\n       (2) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this subsection \n     shall apply to taxable years ending after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the amendment I offer is simple and \nstraightforward. It would extend permanently the credit for increasing \nresearch activities, commonly known as the research credit, or the R \ncredit. This provision has been an important contributor to our robust \neconomic growth in the past decade. I have to admit I am working with \nthe managers of the bill on trying to find an acceptable offset for \nthis particular amendment. Even if we don't find an offset, this \namendment is very important, and should be adopted.\n  Let me explain why this amendment is necessary. In July 1999, the \nSenate voted to make the research credit permanent. Unfortunately, the \nHouse version of the 1999 tax bill included only a 5-year extension of \nthe credit. The 5-year extension prevailed in conference. As we all \nknow, that bill was vetoed by President Clinton.\n  However, in November of 1999, Congress passed and President Clinton \nsigned the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act, which \nincluded the 5-year extension of the research credit. Therefore, the \ncredit was extended to June 30, 2004.\n\n[[Page S5196]]\n\n  Last summer, the Senate again had the opportunity to vote on a \npermanent extension of the research credit. While we were debating last \nyear's version of the death tax repeal bill, Senator Baucus and I \noffered an amendment to again make the research credit permanent. The \nSenate passed the amendment with a vote of 98-1. Once again, President \nClinton vetoed the underlying tax bill.\n  Thus, as it stands under present law, the research credit is \nscheduled to expire on June 30, 2004. This is most unfortunate, Mr. \nPresident, because in 2004, the Congress and, more importantly, \nAmerica's business community, will once again have to go through the \nrigmarole of on-again, off-again uncertainty of an important tax \nprovision that means so much to our country.\n\n  The ultimate loser in this game is not the Congress, nor even the \ncompanies that engage in research, but each American. This is because \nevery one of us is the direct beneficiary of the research investments \nmade by the businesses of America. Each one of us benefits from the \nhigher economic growth, the increased productivity, and from the higher \ndegree of global competitiveness that increased research brings.\n  The research credit has been in the Internal Revenue Code for 20 \nyears, in one form or another. It has expired and been extended ten \ntimes. Ten times, Mr. President. Those extensions have been as short as \n6 months and as long as 5 years. There have even been periods when the \ncredit was allowed to expire, and then retroactively reestablished. On \none occasion, the credit expired and was re-enacted prospectively, \nleaving a gap period when the credit was not available. The one thing \nthe credit has never been is permanent.\n  This is significant because, as effective as the credit has been in \nproviding a strong incentive to companies to increase their research \nactivities, it has been inherently limited in its effectiveness because \nbusiness leaders have never been able to count on the credit being \nthere on a long-term basis.\n  Anyone who has been in business for more than 10 minutes knows that \nplanning and budgeting--unlike what we do in Congress--is a multiyear \nprocess. And, anyone who has been involved in research knows that the \nscientific enterprise does not fit neatly into calendar or fiscal \nyears.\n  Our history of dealing with the research credit--that is, allowing it \nto run to the brink of expiration and reviving it at the 11th hour, the \n12th hour, or even bringing it back from the dead with retroactive \nextensions--results in not only very poor tax policy, but is also \ndetrimental to our research-intensive business entities and indeed the \nwhole country.\n  It is time to get serious about our commitment to a tax credit that \nis widely viewed by economists and business leaders as a very effective \nprovision in creating economic growth and keeping this country on the \nleading edge of high technology in the world. A 1998 study by Coopers \nand Lybrand dramatically illustrated the significant economic benefits \nthat have been provided by the research credit. According to the study, \nmaking the credit permanent would stimulate substantial amounts of \nadditional research and development in the U.S., increase national \nproductivity and economic growth almost immediately, and provide U.S. \nworkers with higher wages. That is hard to beat. In fact, it cannot be \nbeat.\n  The vast majority of the members of this body are on record in \nsupport of a permanent research credit. As I mentioned, last summer, 98 \nSenators voted in favor of permanence. Moreover, making the research \ncredit permanent was practically the only business provision that \nPresident Bush included in his tax proposal. And, just in case some \nhave forgotten, former Vice President Al Gore also included a permanent \nresearch credit in the tax plan on which he campaigned last year. The \npoint here is that making the credit permanent is probably the most \nbipartisan tax cut provision that has been before the Congress in \nrecent years.\n  While practically everyone says they support a permanent research \ncredit, it has become too easy for Congress to fall into its two-\ndecade-long practice of merely extending the credit for a year or two, \nor even 5 years, and then not worrying about it until it is time to \nextend it again.\n  These short-term extensions have occurred ten times since 1981. Ten \nshort-term extensions for a tax credit that most Members of this body \nstrongly support. I am not sure we realize how the lack of permanence \nof the credit damages its effectiveness. I am telling you it does, and \nso do the experts.\n  Research and development projects cannot be turned on and off like a \nlight switch. They typically take a number of years and may even last \nlonger than a decade. As our business leaders plan these projects, they \nneed to look years ahead in making the projections and estimating the \npotential return on their investment. Because the research credit is \nnot permanent, and its extension is not assured, the availability of \nthe credit over the life of these projects is uncertain and is thus \noften not included in the numbers. As a result, the projected return on \nthe investment is lower and some promising research projects are simply \nnot funded.\n  With a permanent credit, these business planners would take the \nbenefits of the credit into account, knowing they would be there for \nall years in which the research is to be performed. The result would be \na lower projected cost, leading to more research projects being funded, \nwhich in turn would lead to more benefits to the economy, to our \nproductivity, and to each consumer. In fact, making the credit \npermanent would start these benefits now and actually give an immediate \nboost to the amount of research performed, even before the current \ncredit expires in 2004.\n\n  There is little doubt that a significant amount of the incentive \neffect of the research credit has been lost over the past 20 years \nbecause of the constant uncertainty about its continuing availability. \nThis uncertainty has undermined the very purpose of the credit. For the \nGovernment and the American people to maximize the return on their \ninvestment in U.S.-based research and development, this credit must be \nmade permanent. And now is the time to do so.\n  Each time that Congress has extended the research credit for only a \nshort period, rather than permanently, the ostensible reason has been a \nlack of revenue. We tell our constituents that we simply did not have \nthe money to extend the credit permanently.\n  Is this the excuse we are going to give the next time we meet with \nthe high-tech workers and entrepreneurs in our States? Are we going to \ntell them that out of a tax cut bill totaling $1.35 trillion, we could \nnot find the revenue to pay for the permanent extension of this credit?\n  I admit that the revenue cost of extending the research credit \npermanently is not inconsequential. The estimate I have from the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation says that its extension would cost around $47 \nbillion over 10 years. But this is only 3.5 percent of the total cost \nof the bill. It seems to me that 3.5 percent is a small price to pay \nfor a provision that will help ensure continued productivity increases, \neconomic growth, and job creation.\n  Ironically, it costs at least as much in terms of lost revenue to \nenact short-term extensions as it does to extend it permanently. So \nsaying we cannot afford to make the research credit permanent is a \nnotion of false economy forced on us by the budget rules. I believe \nthere is simply no valid reason that the credit should not be extended \non a permanent basis. The provision was in the President's proposal, \nand it should be in the bill before us today, and was in Al Gore's plan \nas well.\n  I believe a permanent research credit is one of the most important \nelements of President Bush's tax plan because it is so tied in with the \nissues of economic growth and our future prosperity.\n  According to Chairman Greenspan, the Nation's high productivity \ngrowth, which has played an instrumental role in our economic growth of \nthe past few years and also in creating our projected budget surplus, \nwould likely not have been possible without the innovations of recent \ndecades, especially those in information technologies. The research \ncredit is a key factor in keeping these innovations coming into our \nlives. But a temporary credit is inherently limited in its ability to \ndo this.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I am afraid too many of us are stuck in a \nmindset that says that since the research credit can just be taken care \nof later this\n\n[[Page S5197]]\n\nyear in a tax extenders package, or when it gets closer to its 2004 \nexpiration date, why bother about it now?\n  I want to emphasize that another temporary extension is not the issue \nhere. We can and probably will always extend the credit when the time \nfor its expiration comes. It will likely be on the less effective basis \nwe have always done it, perhaps only for a few months, or it may be on \na retroactive basis, and there may be a gap created, but we will \nprobably keep extending it. The issue is whether or not we should \nmagnify the power of this credit by making it permanent. It is just \ncommon sense to do so.\n  The conditions for a permanent extension now are better than they \nhave ever been, and are likely to be again, and we should not let this \nbill go by without doing this.\n  This amendment is about long-term growth, it is about fostering \ninnovation and keeping the innovation pipeline filled, and this is \nabout sustaining the productivity gains that have brought us where we \nare today and that can help us stay prosperous in the future as we deal \nwith the entitlement challenges ahead.\n  In conclusion, if we decide not to make the research credit \npermanent, are we not limiting the potential growth of our economy? How \ncan we expect the American economy to hold the lead in the global \neconomic race if we allow other countries, some of which provide huge \ngovernment direct subsidies, to offer stronger incentives than we do?\n  Making the credit permanent will keep American business ahead of the \npack. It will speed economic growth. Innovations resulting from \nAmerican research and development will continue to improve the standard \nof living for every person in the U.S. and also worldwide.\n  This provision should be in this bill. It deserves to be on the table \nin conference with the House. We should not overlook the importance of \nmaking the credit permanent now.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 701 to Amendment No. 697\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I will just take a few minutes to speak to \nSenator Kerry's amendment.\n  This amendment provides a 30 percent tax credit on qualified research \nexpenses to develop microbicides for HIV and vaccines for malaria, TB, \nHIV, and other diseases that kill 1 million people or more annually. \nThis is an expansion of the existing 20 percent research and \ndevelopment tax credit.\n  It mandates that a company file a research plan with the Secretary of \nthe Treasury on these priority vaccines or microbicides before claiming \nthe tax credit.\n  It allows the tax credit to be applied to the costs of clinical \ntrials outside of the United States, because of the prevalence of \nmalaria, TB, and HIV in developing countries. However, pre-clinical \nresearch must be conducted in the United States in order to claim the \ntax credit.\n  This amendment also provides a refundable tax credit to small biotech \ncompanies based on the amount of qualified research that a company does \nin a given year. This credit is designed to stimulate increased \nresearch among firms that often do the most innovative research.\n  It mandates that any firm receiving this credit put an equivalent \namount of funds into research and development within 2 years of having \nreceived the credit. Such expenditures cannot be claimed under the tax \ncredit for qualified vaccine research and development. It requires the \nSecretary of the Treasury to promulgate regulations to recapture the \ncredit if a company fails to make these expenditures.\n  The amendment allows 100 percent of the expenditures on contracts and \nother arrangements for research and development on these priority \nvaccines and microbicides to be counted toward the baseline for the R \ntax credit. Currently only 65 percent can be counted. This increase is \ndesigned as an incentive for larger firms to contract with smaller \nvaccine research companies.\n  So, Mr. President, I have filed this on behalf of Senator Kerry and \nmyself. I hope the Senate will give great consideration to this.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. I appreciate \nthe commitment of the Senator from Utah to extending the research and \nexperimentation credit. There is no question the issue of research and \nexperimentation has no greater supporter than the Senator from Utah and \nall the people involved with it ought to appreciate his interest in it.\n  I know the R credit has strong bipartisan support and that it was \nincluded in the President's request.\n  I ask the Senator give us the time to work with him on the amendment \ntoday and see what we can do to make sure it becomes something we can \nwork with and deal with in conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I join the chairman of the committee in \ntelling the Senator from Utah he has a good amendment. The R tax \ncredit should be a permanent part of our law for a couple of basic \nreasons. One, we know jobs in the future depend upon research today. \nThe more research today, the more technology will be enhanced, \nproductivity enhanced, and more jobs in the market. That is pretty \nclear.\n  Second, we want research in the United States more than other \ncountries. It is fine to conduct research overseas if American \ncompanies conduct research overseas but we also want them to conduct \nresearch here. Other countries give far more lucrative benefits in \ncredits and other incentives to companies in their countries for \nresearch and development than do we in America. We all know it is a \nfiercely competitive world; our economy is so globalized. If we are \ngoing to, A, stay ahead and, B, make sure those jobs are here in the \nUnited States, it makes good sense to have a credit for Research and \nDevelopment as a permanent part of our law.\n  I am a cosponsor with the Senator from Utah of his bill to make R \ntax credit permanent. I will work with the Senator to try to find a way \nto work this out so we can make it permanent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleagues for their graciousness and \nwillingness to work with me to see how we can make this part of the \noverall tax bill, and I sure hope our colleagues on both sides will \nsupport whatever offset they come up with, and that they can support \nthis amendment.\n  We are making a diligent effort to try to resolve the offset \nproblems. I am willing to yield my time, but I notice the Senator from \nNevada has risen. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of this amendment. It is \nvery good legislation. We have had continual battles in the Senate over \nwhat we should do with renewables. We can do nothing with renewables \nuntil we get a permanent tax credit.\n  An example is, we have a wind farm we are putting in at the Nevada \nTest Site. We are trying to develop new uses for that test site which \nhas been in effect for some 50 years, after setting off nuclear devices \nthere.\n  The people there know it will produce huge amounts of electricity, \nbut they cannot borrow the money because no one will loan them the \nmoney because the tax credit is for a limited period of time.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Utah, of which I am a proud \ncosponsor, is the way we have to go. If we are going to change our \nheavy dependence on fossil fuels, we have to have a tax credit that is \npermanent on renewables. This does that, among other things. I totally \nsupport the amendment of the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague and I am prepared to yield the \nremainder of my time if the floor managers are prepared to yield the \nremainder of their time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Under the order, the pending amendments are laid aside and the \nSenator from West Virginia is recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 703\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am going to offer an amendment. But, before I do, I \nfeel compelled to express my appreciation to the two managers of this \nbill for the work they have given to the task, for the time they have \ngiven to the task. I know it is not easy. I know they have had \npressures from colleagues on both sides. I know each has had his own \npressures from his own colleagues on his own side. I do not envy you.\n\n[[Page S5199]]\n\n  I am going to offer an amendment which the managers may not accept. \nBut that will not lessen my appreciation and respect for them. We can't \nall agree on everything.\n  When I was majority leader I, from time to time, had colleagues on my \nown side who did not support me. But those who did not support me today \nmight be those who would support me tomorrow.\n  So like the waves of the sea, the tide comes in, the tide goes out; \nit comes back again. I just want to express my appreciation, first of \nall, to the two managers of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I am going to send an amendment to the desk, as I \nsaid. But, before I send it to the desk, let me say to Senators what \nthe amendment would do. The purpose of the amendment is as follows: I \nshall read it, then I will send the amendment to the desk.\n\n       Purpose: To strike all marginal rate tax cuts except for \n     the establishment of the 10 percent rate and strike all \n     estate and gift tax provisions taking effect after 2006 in \n     order to provide funds to strengthen social security--\n\n  Here is your chance, my friends, to strengthen Social Security--\n\n     extend the solvency of the Social Security Trust Funds, \n     maintain progressivity in the social security benefit \n     system--\n\n  A great Roman said: Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.\n  My colleagues, listen. This amendment would:\n\n     maintain progressivity in the social security benefit system, \n     continue to lift more seniors out of poverty, extend the \n     solvency of the Medicare Trust Funds, and provide \n     prescription drug benefits.\n\n  ``provide prescription drug benefits.''\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 703.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To strike all marginal rate tax cuts except for the \nestablishment of the 10 percent rate and strike all estate and gift tax \n   provisions taking effect after 2006 in order to provide funds to \nstrengthen social security, extend the solvency of the Social Security \n  Trust Funds, maintain progressivity in the social security benefit \n   system, continue to lift more seniors out of poverty, extend the \n  solvency of the Medicare Trust Funds, and provide prescription drug \n                               benefits)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. ENSURING FUNDING FOR SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE \n                   SOLVENCY, PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, AND LONG-TERM \n                   DEBT REDUCTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act--\n       (1) except for section 1(i)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986, as added by section 101 of this Act, and any \n     necessary conforming amendments, title I of this Act shall \n     not take effect; and\n       (2) any provision of title V of this Act that takes effect \n     after 2006 shall not take effect.\n       (b) Strategic Reserve Fund for Long-Term Debt and Needs.--\n     Subtitle B of title II of H. Con. Res. 83 (107th Congress) is \n     amended by inserting at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 219. STRATEGIC RESERVE FUND FOR SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   REFORM, MEDICARE REFORM, AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG \n                   BENEFITS.\n\n       If legislation is reported by the Committee on Finance of \n     the Senate or the Committee on Energy and Commerce or the \n     Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, \n     or an amendment thereto is offered or a conference report \n     thereon is submitted, that would strengthen social security, \n     extend the solvency of the Social Security Trust Funds, \n     maintain progressivity in the social security benefit system, \n     continue to lift more seniors out of poverty, extend the \n     solvency of the Medicare Trust Funds or provide prescription \n     drug benefits, the chairman of the appropriate Committee on \n     the Budget shall, upon the approval of the appropriate \n     Committee on the Budget, revise the aggregates, functional \n     totals, allocations, and other appropriate levels and limits \n     in this resolution for that measure by not to exceed \n     $450,000,000,000 for the total of fiscal years 2002 through \n     2011, as long as that measure will not, when taken together \n     with all other previously enacted legislation, reduce the on-\n     budget surplus below the level of the Medicare Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund surplus in any fiscal year provided in \n     this resolution.''.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last week as the Senate began debate on the \nfiscal year 2002 budget reconciliation tax cut bill, the President was \nin Minnesota unveiling his energy strategy.\n  Over the weekend the American people read about the content of the \nPresident's plan. Essentially, the administration is promoting a \nnational energy strategy heavy on increased production to respond to a \nnumber of current and near-term energy shortages that have manifested \nthemselves through rolling blackouts in California and rising gasoline \nprices across the country.\n  No one is pretending that the planned construction of new power \nplants or distribution lines will provide immediate relief to \nconsumers. Instead, the President argues that the only short-term \nrelief for energy-starved, price-gouged consumers is a tax break.\n  Somehow I think that is not quite sufficient comfort to victims of \nrolling blackouts--those men and women who have been stuck in \nelevators, or involved in automobile accidents when the power suddenly \ncut off. It won't shed light for those families who have had to walk \naround in the dark, feeling their way along the walls, and tripping \nover things that they can't see right in front of them.\n  What amuses me, Mr. President, is that this administration, in using \nblackouts to promote both its energy and tax cut plans, has seemingly \nforgotten about the fiscal blackouts of the 1980s. I remember them, \nwhen the Congress found itself wandering around in the dark and the \neconomy had tripped over the 1981 Reagan tax cut plan.\n  In 1981, the Reagan administration promised that massive tax cuts \nwould reinvigorate the economy. Instead, the American economy nearly \ncollapsed. In 1982 and 1983, the annual unemployment rate increased to \n9.7 percent and 9.6 percent, respectively--the highest rates recorded \nsince 1950. In 1985, while America's wealthy were reaping the largest \nshare of the national income since World War II, businesses and banks \nwere failing at a record breaking pace. Our savings rate was the lowest \nin 4 decades, and our national trade deficit had reached a record high.\n  The Congress had no choice but to pass, and Presidents Reagan, Bush, \nand Clinton had no choice but to sign, eight in all--numerous \nbills three of them were not as significant as the five that I will \nmention. The five that I shall mention are TEFRA, DeFRA--sounds like \ntwins but, wait, they are quintuplets--TEFRA, DeFRA, OBRA of 1987, OBRA \nof 1990, and OBRA of 1993--to correct our mistake. Why were these all \npassed? Why were these tax bills passed? To correct our mistakes and \nthe mistakes of the then administration, and increase taxes in hopes of \nstemming the unprecedented tide of red ink.\n\n  The protracted deficits during the 12 years of Presidents Reagan and \nBush resulted in higher interest rates for the American taxpayer. This \nforced the average American to pay more for his mortgage, to pay more \nfor his car, to pay more for his child's education, because of our \nrush--our mad rush--to enact a huge tax cut--the benefits of which \nwent--in that instance, as will be the case in this instance--the \nbenefits of which went mainly to the wealthiest taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, this administration, the Bush administration, the Bush \nNo. 2 administration, has tried to juxtapose tax cuts and the threat of \na recession in the minds of the American people, even though the most \nrecent economic data suggests that a recession only exists in the \nrhetoric--in the rhetoric--of the administration.\n  There is where the recession exists, in the rhetoric of the current \nadministration. And now, of course, the administration has offered tax \ncuts as a solution to this Nation's energy crisis; the idea being, I \nsuppose, that Californians would be able to purchase more candles and \nflashlights to deal with the rolling blackouts.\n  E.J. Dionne pointed out in a recent Washington Post editorial that--\nand I quote--``there's absolutely nothing the president won't say in \nsupport of his tax cut. When times were good he told us we needed a tax \ncut to keep the good times going. When times threatened to go bad, he \nsaid we needed a tax cut to get the economy [rolling]. Now that times \nlook a bit better, he says we need a tax cut to pay the gas bills. \nSomeday soon, he'll tell us tax cuts will solve the problems of crime, \ndrug abuse, teen pregnancy, traffic jams and static cling.'' And that \nif you do not have\n\n[[Page S5200]]\n\nhair, it will make your hair grow, and make your fingernails longer. \nAnd if your hair is black, it will make it turn white over night or \nvice versa.\n  I would only add, Mr. President, that we may soon hear from the \nadministration that tax cuts can provide whiter teeth, fresher breath, \nand may even cure the common cold.\n  But, how much are the American taxpayers willing to shell out for \nthis miracle tonic, this tax cut?\n  Are the American people ready to spend the money that they invested \ninto the Social Security and Medicare programs? In 2025, the number of \npeople age 65 and older is projected to grow by 73 percent--in 2025. In \ncontrast, the number of workers supporting the Social Security system \nwould grow by 13 percent. The Social Security and Medicare Board of \nTrustees project that the Social Security's taxes will be inadequate to \npay full Social Security benefits by 2016. This $1.35 trillion tax cut \npackage spends vital resources that could otherwise be used to ensure \nthat Social Security benefits will be paid to future retirees.\n\n  The Medicare program faces a similar fate. Medicare's projected costs \nfor hospital expenses will grow 60 percent faster than its income over \nthe next 75 years. By 2075, Medicare's costs will be more than two \ntimes larger than its income. Again, this $1.35 trillion tax cut spends \nresources that could otherwise be used to ensure that hospital \ninsurance benefits will be paid to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Now, what about our domestic investments in highways, bridges, \nagriculture, health care, education, and a host of other areas? Are the \nAmerican people willing to trade these away for a tax cut?\n  This tax cut package starves the domestic discretionary side of the \nbudget, resulting in a spending level that is $5.5 billion below what \nis necessary to maintain domestic investments in FY 2002, and an \nincredible $62 billion cut below what the Congressional Budget Office \nsays is necessary to maintain current services over the next 10 years. \nThat means cuts--cuts, cuts--veterans programs, crime prevention, \nhighway construction and maintenance, and a host of other areas, other \ncategories, in order to provide for these tax benefits.\n  Now what about the national debt? Well, we are just going to dump \nthat on these youngsters here, the pages, and on people such as my \ngrandchildren, my great grandchildren, and yours, yours out there. Are \nthe American people ready to trade away this historic opportunity to \nretire the national debt for a tax cut?\n  Our current gross debt is $5.7 trillion. How much is a trillion \ndollars? At $1 per second, how long would it take to count $1 trillion? \nAt the rate of $1 per second, how long? It would take 32,000 years. \nThat is big money. We are not used to having that kind of money in my \nState of West Virginia.\n  When we talk about $1 trillion, our current gross debt is $5.7 \ntrillion. That amounts to $929 for every man, woman, boy, and girl in \nthe world--that is some debt, isn't it?--$929 for every man, woman, \nboy, and girl in the world. That is not just pocket change. It \nrepresents $20,062 per man, woman, and child in the United States.\n  Are we to disregard these financial obligations? Are we? Or should we \nlook at our grandchildren and just wash our hands? We can wash our \nhands, I say to Senators, we can wash our hands of this debt and just \nleave to it our grandchildren. This the sacrifice that average \nAmericans are being asked to make.\n  I am almost 84; 83\\1/2\\ yesterday. I could just walk away from the \ndebt and let you folks pick up this obligation. We can enjoy a tax cut \nfor ourselves--just vote for this bill and enjoy the tax cut, but leave \nthis heavy debt burden to the folks who are going to come after us. We \nwon't be around, so what does it matter to us? Let's vote for the Bush \ntax cut. I am a little selfish, perhaps a little self-centered, so I \nwould like to have this tax cut. Let's vote for the Bush tax cut and \nlet future generations worry about paying off the national debt.\n\n  Even if you happen to be lucky enough to be one of the privileged few \nwho would receive any real tax relief under this proposal, you most \nlikely wouldn't receive those tax benefits for another 5 to 10 years. \nUnder this proposal, most of the tax cuts--estate tax repeal, increased \nIRA contribution limits, expanded child credit, marginal rate \nreductions--wouldn't be fully in place until sometime between 2007 and \n2011. Marriage penalty relief wouldn't even begin to phase in until \n2006. How about that, 2006? Let me say that again. Marriage penalty \nrelief wouldn't even begin to phase in until 2006.\n  I am going to be a little late in reaping the benefits therefrom. A \nweek from tomorrow we will have been married 64 years, my wife and I. \nYet, the marriage penalty relief won't even begin to phase in until \n2006. That is 5 years away. This bill would put these tax cuts into \neffect when the surplus projections are most unreliable and least \nlikely to accurately project our ability to pay for them.\n  There are so many accounting gimmicks in this proposal to hide the \ntrue cost of the bill that the only reasonable, accurate measure of its \ncost would be in the second 10 years, which the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities projects would be $4.1 trillion.\n  What kind of a balanced tax cut proposal pushes the real costs into \nthe future at the exact moment that money is needed to finance the \nretirement of Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries? Where is the \nbalance? Where is the balance in a proposal that delays marriage \npenalty relief for lower and middle income taxpayers so that the top \nmarginal rates can be reduced more quickly? Where is the balance?\n  Where is the balance in a proposal that provides one-third of its \nbenefits to those taxpayers with annual income over $373,000 by cutting \nthose programs that benefit lower and middle income families?\n  Well, Mr. President, I submit that the day that this tax cut is \nenacted and signed into law will be remembered as a black day in our \nnational history. So I propose that we limit the size of this tax cut \nuntil we are more certain of whether we can afford it, and that any \nsavings be put aside in a reserve fund for Social Security, Medicare \nreform, and a prescription drug benefit.\n  My amendment would eliminate the marginal rate reductions that would \nbenefit the wealthiest taxpayers in the Nation and leave in place the \n10-percent bracket reduction that would benefit all taxpayers--lower, \nmiddle, and higher income. Under my amendment, those funds that would \nbe allocated to repealing the estate tax for the wealthiest 1 percent \nof taxpayers would be redirected to ensuring the solvency of those \nretirement programs from which lower and middle-income taxpayers would \nbenefit much more.\n  Not only would this amendment put back those funds that should have \nbeen set aside for Social Security and Medicare reform in the first \nplace, but it would also provide for a substantial tax cut that would \nbe more evenly distributed amongst the American taxpayers. This \namendment would avoid the fiscal disasters that would certainly occur \nif these tax cuts were allowed to take effect under this bill, if the \nwild projections of 5 and 10 years out don't materialize. This \namendment would ensure that Social Security and Medicare benefits are \navailable for future retirees and that the national debt is being \nretired.\n  Mr. President, last week, at the Senate Finance Committee markup, the \nDemocratic leader stated that he found it ``difficult to accept, \nimpossible to explain'' that Congress was about to repeat the same \nmistake it made in 1981 by passing another massive tax cut that the \nNation was not equipped to afford.\n  As I view these comments, and as I view this Bush tax cut, which had \nits genesis in the snows and cold winds of New Hampshire last year \nduring the campaign, it reminds me of a story about Benjamin Franklin, \na great American statesman, philosopher, and revolutionary of the 18th \ncentury.\n  As Franklin recalled later in his life:\n\n       When I was a child of seven years old, my friends on a \n     holiday filled my pocket with half-pence. I went directly to \n     a shop where they sold toys for children, and being charmed \n     with the sound of a whistle that I met by the way, in the \n     hands of another boy, I voluntarily offered and gave all my \n     money for it. When I came home, whistling all over the house, \n     much pleased with my whistle, but disturbing all the family, \n     my brothers, sisters, and cousins, understanding the bargain \n     I had made, told me I had given four times as much for it as \n     it was worth, put me in mind of what good things I might have \n     bought with the rest of the money, and laughed at me so much \n     for my folly that I cried with vexation; and the reflection \n     gave\n\n[[Page S5201]]\n\n     me more chagrin than the whistle gave me pleasure.\n\n  With the wisdom of age, Franklin added:\n\n       As I came into the world, and observed the action of men, I \n     thought I met many who gave too much for the whistle.\n\n  Mr. President, the Congress paid too much for its whistle in 1981, \nand it almost wrecked the economy. Insight will come after the fact \nwhen we realize again that we sacrificed too much for this tax cut.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the unsound fiscal policy in this \nbill. I urge my colleagues not to pay too much for the whistle. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote for my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The distinguished Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such as I might consume.\n  I appreciate the concern of the Senator from West Virginia about \nSocial Security. The budget resolution provides for protection for \nSocial Security and Medicare. The relief act, in my opinion, does not \njeopardize these programs. Rather, I suggest the relief act strengthens \nthese critical programs because we have a strong, growing economy that \nis going to result from making sure that we keep resources with the \ntaxpayers for them to invest and spend; thus, doing much more good than \nif the Government keeps those resources. A growing economy is the best \nguarantee for Social Security and Medicare's long-term solvency.\n  I will talk briefly about the fact that we have had concern expressed \nin the media about some of these very same things that the Senator from \nWest Virginia has visited about--the long-term needs of all programs, \nincluding Social Security and Medicare. I think the editorial writers, \nas I have read them, just over the weekend, and as late as this \nmorning, are in a frenzy about this tax cut that they need not be in. \nBut they can't seem to make up their minds. One day we are criticized \nbecause the $1,000 child credit is not indexed for inflation. Then the \nnext day we are attacked because the tax cut is too expensive in the \noutyears.\n  Maybe what is really happening is the media is just against reduction \nof taxes. This is kind of like Goldilocks, I would say, when they first \nsay it is too hot and then it is too cold. But I fear that, unlike \nGoldilocks, there is no tax cut that is just right for the elite of our \nmedia because they want no tax cuts whatsoever. They honestly believe \nthe Federal Government creates wealth, that it is better for a \npolitical determination of more money of how the resources are divided \nrather than letting the marketplace do it.\n  Somehow, I think they feel ignored as we debate this tax bill. It is \nlike the media crying about Social Security and Medicare. When all else \nfails, I think it is their goal to raise so many questions that senior \ncitizens so ponder the situation of the budget, whether or not there is \nsecurity there, long-term security for Social Security and Medicare, it \nends up scaring them needlessly.\n  In the process of our debate, obviously, when you look ahead 10 \nyears--and I said this last week during the debate, so I am not saying \nit just because the Senator from West Virginia brought it up--\nin 1regard to the long-term projections of the fiscal condition of the \nFederal Government, meaning how much money is going to come in and how \nmuch we are going to spend on existing programs over the next 10 years, \nit is legitimate to be cautious.\n\n  On the other hand, we are making judgments based on 10-year \nforecasts. We recently heard about the Reagan tax cuts in 1981, 20 \nyears ago. At that particular time, we were only looking ahead 5 years. \nI do not think it has entered into this debate, but I know as a fact in \n1963, when President Kennedy had tax cuts, they only looked ahead 1 \nyear. Looking ahead 1 year in 1963, looking ahead 5 years in 1981, or \nlooking ahead 10 years in the year 2001, as imprecise as it is to look \nahead, although I have to say the people who work on this are getting \nbetter at it than they were during the 1980s--but looking ahead 10 \nyears has to be considered more fiscally responsible in our spending \nand taxing policies than looking ahead just 5 years 20 years ago or \nlooking ahead just 1 year in 1963.\n  People might wonder why I am talking about 1963, 1981, and 2001. \nThese are the three biggest tax relief measures passed by Congress in \nthe last 50 years.\n  All I am saying is, nobody knows what the future holds, but we are \nmaking a tax relief decision for working men and women based upon these \n10-year projections. We ought to give some credit to the people who \nwork so hard to make those projections so that we in Congress can be \nmore--I do not know whether the word ``certain'' is correct--so we can \nat least attempt to be more precise as we make policy for the long \nterm. That is all we are doing.\n  I ask people to consider that in the historical approach as we try to \ndo a better job of making public policy decisions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not know any Member of the Senate who \nhas more respect and regard for the Senator from West Virginia than \nmyself. He is a Senator's Senator. He knows more about and defends this \ninstitution far more than any other Senator. He really lives for his \npeople in West Virginia, for this institution, and for the country. I \nwish more people knew how hard the Senator from West Virginia fights \nfor all those causes and all those beliefs in such a dignified way. I \nhave the highest respect for the Senator.\n  I understand his concerns about this bill. I share some of those \nconcerns. I think most Members of the Senate privately share some of \nthe concerns that perhaps this tax cut is a little too large because it \nis hard to predict what the budget surplus is going to be in the \nfuture. But we have provided for this amount in the budget resolution. \nIt did pass the Senate. I know the Senator from West Virginia believes \nthat budget was inappropriate and did not vote for it. As the Senator \nknows, more than any other Senator here, we still have that budget \nresolution that passed through the conference and we are in this \nChamber with a tax bill that passed the Senate Finance Committee.\n  There are a lot of provisions in this bill that are major \nimprovements over the President's proposal and/or measures passed by \nthe House. Most significantly, it provides a much better distribution \nof tax cuts so middle-income Americans receive a greater share of the \nbenefit as opposed to wealthier people compared with the House-passed \nbills and that suggested by the President.\n  We also make specific improvements to the Tax Code. One is the \ncreation of a new 10-percent bracket. This is large. It is the single \nbiggest piece of the bill. It provides for $438 billion of tax relief \nover 10 years to those persons who would be in the 10-percent bracket. \nOf course, those lower and middle-income Americans and, obviously, even \nthe most wealthy receive some benefit because a new lower bracket rate \naffects everybody all the way up regardless of the amount of income.\n  Seventy-five percent of the benefits in this bill go to people who \nearn less than $75,000. Seventy-five percent of the tax reductions in \nthis bill go to Americans who earn $75,000 or less. There is an upfront \nstimulus by making a 10-percent provision retroactive to the first of \nthis year.\n  In addition, there is a significant increase in the child tax credit \nfrom $500 to $1,000. Friday, when I was heading home to Montana, \nsomebody stopped me as I was getting off the airplane. I had to change \nplanes at Salt Lake City to get to Montana. He said: Senator, I hope \nyou get a tax credit in there. My wife is about to have a child.\n  I said: We are going to increase that child tax credit over time to \n$1,000.\n  He said: Boy, Senator, I really like that. I really appreciate that. \nThanks for doing that.\n  There are people who do benefit from this legislation. In fact, 16 \nmillion children receive benefits under this legislation, children who \notherwise would not receive benefits under the other legislation.\n  We also create incentives for education. One can deduct $5,000 from \nhis or her income to pay for college tuition, which, clearly, is a help \nbecause higher education is getting so much more expensive.\n  The pension provisions, IRA provisions, new stimulus for more \nsavings,\n\n[[Page S5202]]\n\nthe marriage penalty, it is true, do not take effect, as my very good \nfriend from West Virginia notes, until 2006. I have no doubt the \nSenator from West Virginia is going to fully utilize that provision in \nthe code for many years, even after it takes effect in the year 2006. \nOf that I have no doubt.\n  In addition, there are other provisions in the bill that are very \nhelpful to Americans who really need a break. They revolve around the \nprovisions that make the child tax credit refundable. There is $109 \nbillion in this bill--most of it is new money--for parents, for single \nparents, single moms, single fathers who do not have a lot of income \nbut are struggling to make ends meet. That is going to go a long way in \nkeeping them off welfare rolls because it is tied in with the EITC, the \nearned-income tax credit. It is going to help a lot of Americans. That \nis all in this bill.\n  To sum up, this is a good bill. It is not perfect, but it certainly \nwill put a lot of dollars into people's pockets in tax reductions. It \nis more fair to Americans all across the board compared with the \nPresident's proposal and those measures passed by the House. It is good \nlegislation.\n  We are a very dynamic Nation. I have concerns about the size of the \ncut, for the reasons mentioned by my friend from West Virginia, and \nhave some sympathy for the amendment he is offering for those reasons. \nI would like to give more stimulus to education, to make sure the \nSocial Security trust fund is even better protected, the Medicare trust \nfund is even better protected.\n  We are a very dynamic Nation. We are a very resourceful Nation. We \nwill find ways to do what we know we should do, and that includes \nprotecting Social Security, protecting the Medicare trust fund, and \nmaking sure, too, we do all we possibly can to help our children get \nthe very best education possible. Of that I have no doubt.\n  I remind Senators, if we do not pass this bill, which has been worked \non thoroughly by the Senate Finance Committee, my guess is we will be \nfaced with another tax bill which will be much less to the liking of \nabout half the Members of this body, particularly on the Democratic \nside.\n  It would be much closer to the measure proposed by the President. It \nwould have a distribution that is much more weighted toward upper \nincome Americans. It would be a bill much to the dislike particularly \nof the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Life has choices. We are presented with choices, presented with \nalternatives. We have to make choices and choose the alternatives which \nmake the most sense. I personally believe that given the choice between \nthis legislation or some other legislation which would be closer to the \ndesire of the President, if Democrats did not try to work to make this \nlegislation better, this is a better choice; that is, this bill as \nopposed to essentially the President's bill. It is roughly $1.35 \ntrillion--less than the President suggested but still a very \nsignificant tax cut.\n  Although I think this is a better choice compared to the \nalternative--I deeply respect the Senator's views and I have the \nhighest regard for him--I disagree with this amendment for the reasons \nI have stated. With the utmost respect, I must tell my good friend I do \nnot support this amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Do I have time remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank both of the managers again. I \nrespect their reasons for opposing my amendment. I hope the Senate will \nadopt my amendment later.\n  Reference has been made to President Reagan's 5-year deficit/surplus \nestimates. Those projected surpluses in that instance were as follows: \nIn 1982, the projected deficit was $45 billion; the actual deficit was \n$128 billion. The projected surplus for 1985 was $5.9 billion--that was \nthe projected surplus under the Reagan administration tax cut--whereas \ninstead of a $5.9 billion surplus, the actual deficit was $212 billion. \nIn other words, for the 5 years projected under the Reagan tax cut, the \ndifference between the projected deficit and the actual deficit was \n$921 billion. That experience should teach us to be cautious.\n  I close by referring to Joseph in the Bible. We will recall that \nPharoah had a dream in which he saw seven fat cattle come up out of the \nriver to feed in a meadow. They are referred to as ``kine'' in the \nScriptures. They were followed by seven lean cattle who ate up the \nseven fat cattle. Pharoah turned to his soothsayers, his wise men, for \ninterpretation of this dream, but they could not interpret the dream. \nSomeone spoke of Joseph as one who could interpret dreams, so Pharoah \nasked that Joseph, be brought forth from the dungeon where he was being \nheld. Joseph interpreted the dream to mean that there would first be 7 \nyears of plenty, represented by the fat cattle in Pharoah's dream--7 \nyears of plenty. The 7 years of plenty would be followed by 7 years of \nfamine. Joseph recommended that in the time of plenty they should save, \nput the grain into the warehouses and prepare for the 7 lean years that \nwere sure to come in Egypt.\n  We have had in this country some very good years. We have had \nprojected surpluses. I think we ought to return to history, realizing \nthat in some form or another it does repeat itself. We have this golden \nopportunity to use these years of plenty and the fruits therefrom to \napply to the problems that confront the Nation, the problems that will \ncome with Social Security, and Medicare, for example. Now is the time \nto deal with Social Security and Medicare.\n  The President has said he doesn't want to leave any child behind. The \nPresident's budget, which was referred to by my friend from Montana, \nleaves the old folks behind. I can call them old folks because I am one \nof them. The old folks, the senior citizens are being left behind. But \nno millionaire is being left behind.\n  I urge again that the Senators vote for my amendment later in this \nday. I thank all Senators for listening. I particularly thank the Chair \nfor his courtesy and kindness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Iowa yield back his \ntime?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded back.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 707\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], for himself, Mr. \n     Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Levin, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 707.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand the \n                         dependent care credit)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title II insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DEPENDENT CARE CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Increase in Dollar Limit.--Subsection (c) of section 21 \n     (relating to expenses for household and dependent care \n     services necessary for gainful employment) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``$2,400'' in paragraph (1) and inserting \n     ``$3,000'',\n       (2) by striking ``$4,800'' in paragraph (2) and inserting \n     ``$6,000'', and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(3) Inflation adjustment.--In the case of any taxable \n     year beginning after 2002, any dollar amount contained in \n     paragraph (1) or (2) shall be increased by an amount equal \n     to--\n       ``(A) such dollar amount, multiplied by\n       ``(B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under \n     section (1)(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable \n     year begins, by substituting ``calendar year 2001'' for \n     ``calendar year 1992.''.\n       (b) Increase in Applicable Percentage.--Section 21(a)(2) \n     (defining applicable percentage) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``30 percent'' and inserting ``50 \n     percent'', and\n       (2) by striking ``$10,000'' and inserting ``$30,000''.\n       (c) Revenue Offset.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     adjust the highest rate of tax under section 1 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended by section 101 of \n     this Act) to the extent necessary to offset in each fiscal \n     year beginning before October 1, 2011, the decrease in \n     revenues to the Treasury for that fiscal year resulting from \n     the amendments made by this section.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2001.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the United States has entered into a \ntime\n\n[[Page S5203]]\n\nof unprecedented budget surplus. Over $1 trillion is the amount we are \ndiscussing. What to do with it, and trillions that are expected into \nthe future.\n  For years we have struggled to balance the budget, forgoing spending \nfor programs necessary to maintain our human infrastructure. We have \nnot devoted enough to supporting our families and educating our \nchildren, but times have changed. There is enough money in the surplus \nto cut taxes, eliminate the death tax, and reduce the marriage penalty. \nI believe we must increase our investments in our children and \nfamilies. To my colleagues I must ask, if not now, when?\n  I commend Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus for their leadership. \nThey have carefully crafted this legislation so it brings the benefits \nof tax relief of all Americans. They have included balanced rate \nreductions, a careful phaseout of the estate tax, and a refundable \nchild tax credit. Especially important to me, they have fixed the \nmarriage penalty for all taxpayers, including those who receive the \nearned-income tax credit.\n  There is, however, one crucial area not sufficiently enhanced to meet \nour national education goals. The issue not addressed in this \nlegislation is the great need for our Nation to improve childcare, \nparticularly the early learning and developmental aspect of that care. \nAmerica lags far behind all other industrialized nations in caring for \nand educating our preschool-age children. We have the opportunity to \nmake improvements. We need to act now.\n  If we want to get to the core of our most serious problems in \neducation, we have to improve the care and education of our preschool \nchildren. This is something every other industrialized nation in this \nworld does except the United States. And every industrialized nation in \nthe world pays for that through Government funds.\n  I rise to offer an amendment to increase the dependent care tax \ncredit. The current law allows taxpayers to claim a small credit for \nchildcare expenses.\n  Right now, the maximum credit allowed is $720 for one child, and \ntwice that amount for two children. Unfortunately, no families qualify \nto receive the maximum. My amendment would raise the maximum credit to \n$1,500, for one child, and $3,000, for two or more children. It would \nallow families with adjusted gross incomes of $30,000 or less to \nqualify for the maximum credit. And the credit amounts would be indexed \nfor inflation still far from what we need but a major step forward.\n  This increase in the dependent care tax credit is to be paid for by \nslowing the reduction of the top income tax rate.\n  We know that from the time of birth, the human brain is making the \nconnections that are vital to future learning. We know that what we do \nas parents, care providers, educators, and as a society can either \npromote or inhibit a child's healthy development---the acquisition of \nthe cognitive, social, behavioral, and physical skills necessary for \nsuccess in school and life.\n  Far too many of America's children enter school without the requisite \nskills and maturity, and continue to lag behind for their entire \nacademic career.\n  Billions of dollars are spent on remediation efforts to get these \nchildren ``up to speed.'' But I believe that ``an ounce of prevention \nis worth a pound of cure,'' and if we are ever to achieve the first \nnational education goal, we must improve the quality of child care and \nmake it more affordable and available for working parents.\n  We have known for years that high-quality preschool programs produce \ncognitive gains, improved school performance, decreased grade \nretention, and higher achievement in math and reading. The research has \nbeen around since the mid-1980s.\n  The Perry Pre-school Project, the Carolina Abecedarian Project, and \nthe recent Chicago Child-Parent Center study are just a few of the \nresearch studies that clearly show the benefits of high-quality early \ncare and education to future academic success. Unlike the rest of the \nworld, America has done little to ensure that our children have access \nto these kinds of programs.\n  Quality early education is the bedrock upon which a child's future \nacademic success is built. By giving every child a strong foundation \nfor success in school we set the stage for that child to become a \nproductive worker and a contributing member of society. A strong \neducational foundation for each child is the key to our national \neconomic, military, and political future.\n  Let me show the most dramatic evidence of what I am telling you. My \nfirst chart is the results of the so-called TIMS examination. These \nTIMS studies indicate how we compare to the rest of the world with \nrespect to our 13-year-olds in mathematics. As you can see from this \nchart, where are we? We are 16th; at the bottom of the heap. That means \nthat 55 percent fewer American students give correct answers on the \nexam. Who is at the top? That is China.\n  There are a couple of reasons why I have this presentation. One is \nbecause it includes China. After we included China that time, someone \ndecided not to do that again. It gives you evidence relative to the \nlargest country with which we compete. If you take a look at the \ncountries doing pretty well on this side of the chart--Switzerland, \nFrance, Italy--all industrialized nations that have early education and \nchild care, these are for their 3- and 4-year-olds.\n  More recent TIMS studies have shown no significant change for the \nUnited States, and the most recent report was even worse.\n  Yet in international contests of the best math students, students \nfrom the United States are often the best in the world. So it is not \nthe students, its the educational system that bears most of the \nresponsibility for this failure.\n  What does this mean for our children? It means that in the global \neconomy in which we live, our children will not be prepared to compete \nfor the high-tech jobs that rely on math skills. In a world of global \nfinance and integrated information systems, it will be very easy for \nchildren from other countries to line up for the best, high paying \njobs.\n  Will this have a large impact on the U.S. economy?\n  I am afraid so. The Information Technology Association of America has \nrecently issued a report that states that at present there are 425,000 \nIT jobs nationwide that are unfilled because the American workforce \nlacks the skills to do the job. And these are high paying jobs, with an \naverage income of $50,000 a year. To date, the United States has \nallowed almost 1 million H-1-B foreign students to take these jobs.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that a child care tax credit that sets the \nstage for improved math performance by American students is a direct \ninvestment in the strength and health of our economy. John Glenn's \nCommission issued a report entitled ``Before It's Too Late,'' which \nemphasizes this need.\n  The overall health of our society depends on our children coming to \nschool ready to learn and ready to read. Our democracy itself; our \nleadership in the world, is dependent upon literate citizens.\n  I want to now to refer to another National Center for Education study \nentitled ``The Nation's Report Card, 4th Grade Reading 2000.''\n  Forty percent of American fourth graders are reading below grade \nlevel, and 68 percent are not reading at a level that demonstrates \nsolid academic performance. What this says to me is that more than half \nof our young students have not learned to read very well.\n  And if you haven't learned to read you cannot read to learn. And I \nhave to wonder if it is a coincidence that 40 percent of our Nation's \n3- and 4-year-olds are not enrolled in preschool programs--40 percent, \nagain.\n  From first through third grades our children are supposed to learn to \nread so that they can go on to academic success. Without excellent \nreading skills and a love of reading and learning we are doomed to a \nspiral of ignorance in our society. We will lose the cultural and \nhistorical richness that informs us as a democracy. How can we \nrightfully retain our place as leader in the democratic world, if many \nof our students emerge from our public education system functionally \nilliterate?\n  We must invest in our children from the moment they are born so that \nthey are fully prepared to be excellent and early readers. This is an \ninvestment we must make.\n  Today, two-thirds of our 3- to 5-year-olds are in some type of care \noutside\n\n[[Page S5204]]\n\nthe home. For some, that care is part-day or part-year. But many spend \n35 hours or more in the care of someone other than their parents.\n\n  A recent nationwide study found that 40 percent of the child care \nprovided to infants in child care centers was potentially injurious--\nnot that it was beneficial but that it was injurious.\n  Fifteen percent of center-based child care for all preschoolers is so \nbad that a child's health and safety are threatened.\n  Seventy percent of center-based child care is rated mediocre--they \nare not hurting, but neither are they helping children.\n  Only fifteen percent, I repeat, 15 percent actively promote a child's \nhealthy development.\n  We know that high quality, preschool education and care improves \nschool readiness and school performance, leads to better socialization, \nand results in cognitive gains for our children.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 17 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. While there are benefits for all children, low-income \nchildren benefit even more than children from more economically \nadvantaged families. And we see those benefits regardless of the \nsetting in which the early education and care takes place--as long as \nit is a quality program.\n  So I ask my colleagues, how can we, as a nation, continue to \nshortchange these programs?\n  Why do we not view early care and education as an integral part of \nour educational system?\n  How can we as a nation continue to view it as a private matter among \nfamilies, rather than a social imperative?\n  Every one of our industrial competitor countries do. Every one--and \nthe government pays for it. We are leaving children behind.\n  Our children are not entering school ready-to-learn. Our children are \nlagging behind most other industrialized nations in math and science.\n  We know that the best predictor of quality early education and care \nand positive outcomes for children is a trained, competent teacher. So \nwhy do we have a child care workforce that has little education and \ntraining beyond a high school diploma?\n  The majority of the providers in center-based child care receive less \ntraining and job specific education than child care workers in urban \nareas of Nigeria.\n  We know that this surplus should be used to address the greatest \nneeds in our nation today. So why don't we begin to take care of the \nmost critical problem, the early education and care of our children?\n  Spending for child care over the past few years by governments--\nlocal, State and federal--has increased.\n  Yet, less than 15 percent of the families eligible under Federal law \nto receive child care subsidies are receiving any assistance.\n  The Head Start Program is only serving about 40 percent of the \nchildren eligible for the program. The educational component of that \nprogram is in the process of being expanded and strengthened.\n  The Dependent Care Tax Credit helps offset a small portion of the \ncosts of a family's child care expenses.\n  American parents are the main source of funding for early care and \neducation. They pay it right from their pocket.\n  All of our competitors in the international marketplace, have \ngovernment paying most of the costs of care.\n  Of the total funds spent on early care and education, government pays \nfor 39 percent, private sources--1 percent, and parents--60 percent. \nThis is the reverse of the cost-sharing between parents and government \nin other industrialized nations.\n  In all of the other industrialized nations, the costs of early care \nand education for 3- and 4-year-olds rests with government, employers, \nor a combination of both. Parents are responsible for a small \npercentage of the costs, generally in the ten to twenty percent range. \nIn comparison, some low-income working families in the U.S. have to pay \n10, 20, sometimes 30 percent of their household income just for the co-\npayments required to receive a Federal child care subsidy.\n  In addition, much of the early care and education in America is of \npoor to adequate quality. High-quality care is expensive, and few \nfamilies can afford to pay any more.\n  In every State, except one--Vermont, the cost of 1 year of child care \nfor a 3- or 4-year-old is more than the yearly cost of tuition at a \npublic four-year university in that state. And Vermont's distinction is \ndue to the high cost public higher education, rather than a lower cost \nof child care.\n  We know how to improve the quality of early care and education.\n  We need better trained and educated teachers. We need to pay those \nteachers more.\n  We need to quit viewing child care and early education differently--\nand recognize the critical importance of early education.\n  We need to integrate quality early learning and healthy development \ninto all care giving.\n  We need to make quality early learning programs more affordable and \navailable to all children--particularly 3- and 4- year-olds.\n  We need to give providers funds to recruit and retain quality \nteachers, to upgrade facilities and equipment, and to provide staff \ntraining on a regular basis.\n  We need to help states increase not only the number of low-income \nworking parents receiving child care subsidies, but make sure those \nsubsidies are high enough to allow families to afford quality care for \ntheir children.\n  Middle and lower-middle income working families receive the least \namount of help in covering the costs of child care, and spend a \ndisproportionately high amount of their household budget on child care. \nWe have to focus more government assistance in their direction.\n  We need to increase the number of quality programs by improving \nexisting care and starting new programs.\n  We need to encourage businesses to provide more on- and near-site \nchild care for employees and more resources to support the child care \narrangements of their employees. Federal tax credits and incentives \nneed to be increased to help these businesses.\n  And we must make those improvements without increasing the costs to \nparents.\n  In other industrialized nations, early education and care for 3- and \n4-year-olds is universal, voluntary and free to parents, regardless of \ntheir income. Early education and care is viewed as good for children \nand an important part of the public education system.\n  American families struggle to pay $4,000, $6,000, and sometimes over \n$10,000 a year for child care for their young children.\n  Our own Senate employees, many using federally subsidized child care \ncenters, pay $6,000 to $7,000 a year for one child--out of their own \npockets with little financial help.\n  A few local and State governments have already accepted this view of \npre-school and have devised a variety of ways to finance their efforts.\n  Some counties in Florida increased property taxes to pay for pre-\nschool and child care services.\n  Voters in Aspen, CO, approved a dedicated sales tax for child care.\n  Maine has created tax increment finance districts and identified \nchild care as an approved development program cost.\n  Missouri dedicates a portion of the funds received from the state \nlottery to the Early Childhood Development, Education, and Care Fund.\n  North Carolina has done a remarkable job in subsidizing child care \nwages and benefits in exchange for completing professional development \nactivities.\n  Rhode Island has extended health care benefits for child care \nproviders through the State's publicly funded health insurance program.\n  Connecticut makes long-term, low-interest loans for the construction \nand renovation of child care centers available as tax-exempt bond \nfunding. It has started a school-readiness program to make sure low-\nincome children have access to high quality early learning experiences.\n  New York has a generous, refundable child care tax credit against \nstate personal income taxes that are owed.\n  And last, but never least, Vermont gives increased subsidy rates for \naccredited care, and provides cash bonuses to child care providers that \nget\n\n[[Page S5205]]\n\naccredited or complete academic degrees.\n  Other States have created voluntary income tax check-offs, car \nlicense plates, motor vehicle registration accounts, and other \ninnovative means of financing high-quality pre-school programs. Even \nwith these creative approaches, quality pre-school programs are still \nout of the reach of many parents.\n  Several States have started programs and tax incentives to get the \nbusiness community to assume more of the costs of child care for their \nemployees. Some companies, such as IBM, AT, and Bank of America, have \nclearly stepped up to the plate. But too many others have not.\n  It is particularly hard for small business owners. Unfortunately, \nmany of these programs and incentives have met little success. \nParticipation levels are very low, even among businesses that provide \nchild care assistance for employees. We must work with the business \ncommunity to create incentives that work for employers and employees \nalike.\n  Government, businesses, or parents cannot do this alone. Providing \nquality early care and education must be a partnership. There must be \njoint responsibility and cost-sharing.\n  Government needs to view early education and care as an integral part \nof the education system. It needs to provide additional funding to \nimprove quality and decrease the costs for parents.\n  The business community needs to view early education and care as \nnecessary for recruiting and maintaining today's employees. It needs to \nsee it as an investment in tomorrow's workforce.\n  Parents are already paying most of the costs of care, and find few \nchoices that provide high quality care at a price they can afford. They \nmust have more choices so their children can grow up healthy and ready \nto succeed.\n  We must improve the quality and financing mechanisms for early care \nand education, particularly for our Nation's 3- and 4-year-olds. This \nis an investment in the real ``infrastructure'' of our country--our \nchildren and families. It is one that we cannot afford to ignore any \nlonger.\n  Isabelle Sawhill of the Brookings Institute has estimated that a \nhigh-quality, 2-year program in the United States would cost about \n$8,000 annually per child. This translates to about $30 billion a year \nto serve all families with incomes under $30,000 a year. This amendment \nrepresents a down payment on that investment.\n  In March, the HELP Committee held a hearing to compare the United \nStates early care and education, with the rest of the world. At that \nhearing, a child care provider from Vermont testified. At the \nconclusion of her testimony, she said: ``Why do so many children get \nleft behind?''\n  One, there simply is not enough capacity to meet the needs--it's that \nsimple. Two, few parents can afford high quality care. We are talking \nabout young families at the lowest point in their income earning years \npaying up to fifty-eight percent of their income on child care.\n  These young parents absorb 87 percent of the cost of care, as opposed \nto their later years and incomes are higher and they bear only 47 \npercent of the cost of a year in college. We ask families to pay more \nat a time they can least afford it.\n  I always tell my staff, don't come to me with a problem unless you \nhave at least three potential solutions. Here are my suggestions for \neasing the child care crisis:\n  Bring business on board as partners.\n  Forgiveness of student loans, access to higher wages, and health care \nfor providers will help attract and retain our child care workforce.\n  Quality incentives work, whether we are talking about guaranteed \nbonuses for extended education or training, or accreditation.\n  Tax cuts are great, but only after the true needs of a nation have \nbeen meet. You have a difficult choice: save a little now by not \nfunding a comprehensive early care and education initiative or pay a \nlot later. Studies show that for every dollar we spend on early care \nand education, we save seven dollars in other government programs down \nthe road.\n  We can no longer afford to be a nation where only the poor or rich \nhave access to high quality early care and education. You need to \ncommit precious resources to our most precious resource, young \nchildren.\n  Let me show you just some other documentation. I want to bring to \nyour attention a study that all of my colleagues ought to read. This is \ndone by the French-American Foundation. The study compares the French \nsystem with American childcare. They point out how well the French do \nin comparison. I urge Members to look at this study. We have copies of \nthis study available. It demonstrates how beneficial the French system \nis. We should use it as a model. There are other systems also that we \nshould look at for possible solutions to our early care and education \ncrisis.\n  Mr. President, at this time I yield to my friend from Connecticut 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. First of all, I commend my colleague from Vermont for \noffering this amendment. I am delighted to be his principal cosponsor. \nThis is an issue we have worked on together for as many years as we \nhave been in the Senate. My colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, and \nmany others have helped us develop the Child Care and Development Block \nGrant program.\n  I note that the Presiding Officer has more than a passing awareness \nand knowledge of the subject matter of this amendment and has been \ninvolved in the question himself when he was in the other body as well \nas support here.\n  What we are changing with this amendment are three things that \npertain to the Dependent Care Tax Credit or, DCTC under current law. We \nhave not changed, in 20 years, the amount of annual eligible expenses \nfor child care against which the dependent care tax credit is based. \nThat is what we are talking about in this amendment.\n  Under current law, eligible expenses for child care are capped at \n$2,400 for families with one child and $4,800 for families with two \nchildren each year. We want to raise the cap on these expenses from the \npresent level of $2,400 for a single child up to $3,000. For families \nwith more than one child, the cap on annual child care expenses would \nbe increased from $4,800 to $6,000. That would be for two children. So \nwe are increasing the amount of child care expenses that would be used \nas the base against which the dependent care tax credit is calculated \nfrom $2,400 to $3,000 for families with one child; and $4,800 to $6,000 \nfor families with two children.\n  But then we do something else. Under current law, a family can only \ntake a percentage of eligible expenses capped by law as their dependent \ncare tax credit. We have talked already about the amount of eligible \nexpenses that we would be increasing under this amendment. But, also in \nthis amendment, we would increase the percentage that is applied to the \ncapped amount of eligible expenses to calculate the credit.\n\n  Under current law, the lowest income families can only take 30 \npercent of $2,400 in eligible expenses for one child or 30 percent of \n$4,800 for two children. That's the maximum credit allowed under the \nDCTC. The amount of expenses as well as the percentage of eligible \nexpenses have not been changed in 20 years. What our amendment does is \nincrease the percentage of eligible costs for the lowest income \nfamilies from 30 percent to 50 percent. If you make from $10,000 to \n$30,000, you get a maximum of a 50-percent credit. If you make in \nexcess of $30,000, that percentage declines as income rises until it \nreaches 20 percent. Even the most affluent family in the country can \nclaim 20 percent of allowable eligible expenses for child care under \nthe dependent care tax credit.\n  Then, lastly, we index to inflation the child care expense \nthresholds, the annual child care expenses against which the credit is \nbased, because over the last 20 years there have been no increases at \nall. Obviously, the cost goes up for child care and related expenses, \nso we will be back at this again. So why not index it, as we have in so \nmany other areas of the Tax Code? That is all this amendment does.\n  There is no refundability in this amendment. I regret that, but we \ndid not include refundability.\n  So very briefly, again, what we do is we increase the amount of \neligible expenses under the dependent care credit\n\n[[Page S5206]]\n\nthat a family can take into consideration in calculating their \ndependent care tax credit. In the case of a single child, the child \ncare expense threshold would increase from $2,400 to $3,000; in the \ncase of two children, the child care expense threshold would increase \nfrom $4,800 to $6,000.\n  You can talk to any family in the country, and they will tell you \nabout the cost of child care. Today it is not uncommon to have child \ncare costs reach $10,000 a year per child. On average, child care \nexpenses both in urban and rural areas are between $6,000 and $10,000 a \nyear. That has gone up considerably in 20 years. Twenty years ago, the \ncost of child care hovered around $1,500 to $2,000, in some cases \n$3,000 or more. In 20 years, those costs have just gone up through the \nceiling.\n  Today, in some of the poorer areas, good child care can cost as much \nas $10,000 or more a year. Needless to say, if you are a family, say, \nmaking $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, with two kids, obviously, when you \nare spending as much as $6,000 to $20,000 for child care for those two \nchildren--before you pay rent, before you pay a mortgage, before you \nput food on the table, clothes and the rest--obviously, that is an \nextraordinary amount of expense.\n  So by raising the child care annual expense threshold from $2,400 to \n$3,000 in the case of one child, and $4,800 to $6,000 in the case of \ntwo children, and then increasing the percentage applied to the child \ncare expense base from 30 percent to 50 percent--in the case of the \npoorest people--with a sliding scale that drops to 20 percent for the \nmost affluent Americans, we think we are going to provide some needed \nassistance to people who are burdened by high child care costs. For \neveryone, just like under current law, the amount of allowable expenses \nwould be the same. But, for those families who are low income and \nmoderate income earners, they would be able to take a larger credit \nthan current law--because, both the amount of allowable eligible \nexpenses and the percentage applied to that base would be increased.\n\n  How do we pay for it? We drop the top income tax rate by whatever \nnumber it needs, maybe 1 point, maybe even less than 1 point to pick \nthis cost up. So we are still providing a tax break for the most \naffluent Americans. But one of the most significant costs that \nAmericans face is for dependent care, and they need this help.\n  The Senator from Vermont has laid out--I am, again, preaching to the \nchoir when I speak to the Presiding Officer and the chairman of the \ncommittee. They know in the case of Iowa, and in the case of Kansas, \nthere are a lot of hard working folks out there, single parents raising \nkids. This is not a choice. This is not a case where someone is sitting \nthere and saying they think they will go to work or won't go to work. \nThis is a case where people actually have no other choice. So we are \nproviding some real relief.\n  I say, with all due respect to the managing members of this bill, the \nchairman of the committee, we have done something clearly in this bill \non the per child tax credit, and I appreciate that. But the dependent \ncare tax credit has not changed. There has been no change in 20 years. \nIt may be 20 years again. It has been nearly 20 years since the last \ntime we dealt comprehensively with the Tax Code. It could be another 20 \nyears before we have a chance to fix it.\n  So what we are suggesting in this proposal--as the chairman of the \nHELP Committee pointed out, is that millions of families struggle with \nchild care costs every week. The need for child care assistance is \ngreat. Some 65 percent of mothers with children under the age of 6, and \n78 percent of mothers with children between the ages of 6 and 13, are \nworking today. Nearly 60 percent of mothers with infants are working. \nThis is not a question of whether or not a need exists. The need is \nclearly there.\n  If you do the math on this, a single parent earning $30,000, who has \na 1-year-old child and a 3-year-old child, would be spending as much as \nhalf of her gross income on dependent child care expenses. The present \ndependent care tax credit helps, but it is no real match for the \nreality of the child care market.\n  Under current law, the maximum credit a family can claim is $720 for \none child for 1 year--30 percent of $2,400, and $1,400 for two--30 \npercent of $4,800. That is not insignificant, but it is not enough to \nmake a family's $8,000 child care bill more affordable.\n  Our amendment would also index the thresholds for child care expenses \nfor inflation. That is just common sense. Over the years, most of the \nbasic tax provisions affecting tax liability have been indexed for \ninflation. The personal exemption, the standard deduction, tax brackets \nfor low-income families, the earned-income tax credit, all have been \nindexed. By indexing the child care expense thresholds under the \ndependent care tax credit, we would ensure that the credit keeps up \nwith market realities. Within the context of the overall provisions of \nthis tax cut proposal, we can afford it.\n  We have not increased the child care expense thresholds themselves a \ndime, let alone indexed them for inflation, over the past 20 years. So \nagain, by raising the child care expense thresholds, and then raising \nthe percentage of eligible expenses a family can take in calculating \nits dependent care tax credit, we will provide some real relief for \nfamilies with high day care costs. For example, the maximum credit for \na family with one child would increase from 30 percent of $2,400 or \n$720 to 50 percent of $3,000 or $1,500. The maximum credit for a family \nwith two children would increase from 30 percent of $4,800 or $1,440 to \n50 percent of $6,000 or $3,000. These changes will really help low and \nmoderate income families where every dollar counts.\n  In view of the costs of child care expenses, we think this is an \naffordable amendment, one that makes sense and provides real relief for \nworking people.\n  There are no income eligibility caps on the dependent care tax \ncredit, so even the most affluent families can claim as much as 20 \npercent of allowable dependent care costs.\n  For these reasons, we urge our colleagues to support this very modest \namendment--it is not that expensive--and to reduce the top rate just a \nfraction to pick up this cost. We think this is something that would \nmake this tax bill a far better proposal.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back whatever time I may not have \nconsumed to the distinguished Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his very \nhelpful statement. I praise him for the work he has done in this area.\n  To close up, I would like to follow up on my colleague's statement \nwith a chart. This is the source of funds for child care in early \nlearning in the U.S.: 60 percent by the parents, 1 percent by the \nprivate sector, and 39 percent by the Government. In the other \ncountries, it is just the opposite. It is 60 percent by the Federal \nGovernment, about 30 percent by the parents, and about 1 percent by the \nprivate sector. That is just to emphasize what the Senator has pointed \nout.\n  That was excellent testimony that dramatically pointed out to me the \nserious problems we have.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Ms. Apgar's statement be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of Kathi J. Apgar, Executive Director, Bristol Family Center, \n Bristol, Vermont, President, Vermont Association for the Education of \n   Young Children, Before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, \n                  Labor, and Pensions, March 27, 2001\n\n       I would like to thank Senator Jeffords and the H.E.L.P. \n     Committee for inviting me to share some of the experiences of \n     operating a non-profit, early care and education facility. \n     Most of today's panelists have related statistical \n     information pointing to the crisis in early care and \n     education in our country and the solutions developed by other \n     nations.\n       I am here to add a personal face to the harsh realities of \n     maintaining a quality program under some dire economic \n     circumstances and add a passionate plea to add new federal \n     dollars to early care and education. We are not talking about \n     ``redirecting'' federal dollars here, let me be explicitly \n     clear: I am a master of robbing from Peter to pay Paul so I \n     can tell you ``redirecting'' is simply another word for non-\n     commitment. We in the early care and education field are \n     talking, real, new federal dollars infused into an inadequate \n     system where children and the future of a nation are at \n     stake.\n       I have been at the Bristol Family Center for almost eight \n     years. Most of my 11-person staff has been with me that \n     long--a virtually unheard of retention rate in an industry \n     which boasts a 30% turnover in employees\n\n[[Page S5207]]\n\n     each year. That would be the equivalent of your sixth grader \n     suffering through three new teachers each year . . . this \n     would not be acceptable in the public school setting and it \n     simply is not in the earliest, most critical years of a \n     child's life. My staff started with me at or just above \n     minimum wage with no benefits except federal holidays and \n     three paid sick days per year. It has taken me eight years to \n     raise their salaries to between $8.65 and $13.00 per hour. . \n     . . Still no benefits. This means no health, no dental, no \n     retirement, no long or short term disability . . . We simply \n     cannot afford it.\n       As we expand our program this year to include infants and \n     toddlers (there is a waiting list of 50 children for every \n     available slot in this age range) I do not know where my \n     staff will come from. Few teachers are readily prepared for \n     an early education setting like mine where English is a \n     second language: abuse is their first communication. Can you \n     blame most available teachers for seeking public school \n     positions with guaranteed salaries and benefits when we \n     cannot afford to compete with that security?\n       Why can't you afford it you ask?\n       53% of my enrollment is subsidized by the State of Vermont \n     Child Care Services Division (to you, that's Child Care Block \n     Grant dollars, that's TANF dollars).\n       The State reimburses us $94.60 per week (55 hours of care \n     at roughly $1.72/hr.).\n       It costs me $209.79 per week to provide high quality care \n     for these eligible children.\n       It doesn't take the Congressional Budget Office to tell me \n     that is a $115.00 per child, per week deficit or $5,980 per \n     year, per child for which I must beg the American Legion, VFW \n     and private philanthropic trusts for program support dollars.\n       People look at my budget and say ``Just cut staff and your \n     bottom line will be fine.'' But think about this for one \n     moment:\n       In higher education, the quality and quantity of faculty \n     and staff determine the success of a Student's experience.\n       The same thing is true in early care and education--if I \n     cut staff, the success of a child's first experience \n     plummets.\n       If you want children to enter kindergarten ready to learn--\n     then ``early literacy'' doesn't mean exposure to books \n     distributed at healthy child visits or flash cards at the \n     high chair, it means:\n       Honest to goodness human contact with highly trained \n     providers who are readily available through a low child-to-\n     teacher ratio.\n       It means always having a lap to snuggle on when a book \n     piques the child's interest and discussing what may happen \n     next in the story or creating a song from surrounding the \n     characters.\n       Early literacy means having someone across the lunch table \n     from a 3- or 4-year-old sharing silly, gigging rhymes and \n     tongue twisters.\n       Early learning happens when there is someone around to \n     record the child's words to accompany a treasured drawing so \n     they begin to see how letters are the symbols through which \n     feelings and thoughts are communicated.\n       Kids must feel safe and respected if they are to thrive and \n     be ready for the challenges of a formal school setting not \n     always ready for them.\n       I cannot provide these quality opportunities for children \n     on the recommended 10:1 ration--I maintain a ratio of roughly \n     five children to one teacher. This may not help my budget--\n     but my true bottom line is the success of a child's \n     experience.\n       We must never try to supplant the important role parents \n     play as the child's first, and in most cases, best teacher. \n     As modeled by other countries, this is not an us vs. them \n     rationale--we want parents to have the ability to stay home \n     with their young children but the economic viability of this \n     option is not a reality in most American homes.\n       In Vermont, 87 percent of children under the age of six \n     live with working parents. This creates a tremendous burden \n     on a system whose capacity has not significantly expanded in \n     10 years or more. We have 35,000 children in regulated care \n     not necessarily quality care. I am a NAEYC (National \n     Association for the Education of Young Children) validator \n     meaning I review programs as they strive to meet the high \n     standards of national accreditation--so I know what quality \n     should look like and we simply do not have enough quality or \n     quantity in the U.S.\n       Another 25,000 of Vermont's children birth through age \n     eight are in unregulated care--believe me, in many instances \n     you don't want to know what that means. Right now, we are \n     only providing subsidized care for low income and/or at-risk \n     children. Increases in Head Start dollars target the same \n     population--frequently only offering part-time care, not the \n     full day, full week, full year programming working families \n     need--especially those moving back into the workforce \n     thanks to the ``Welfare-to-Work'' initiative.\n       Why do so many children get left behind?\n       (1) There simply is not enough capacity to meet the needs--\n     it's that simple.\n       (2) Few parents can afford high quality care. We are \n     talking about young families at the lowest point in their \n     income earning years paying up to 58% of their income (with \n     an infant and 4-year-old) in child care. These young parents \n     absorb 87% of the cost of child care as opposed to their \n     later years when incomes are higher and they bear only 47% of \n     the cost of a year in college. We ask families to pay most at \n     a time when they can least afford it and pay less when they \n     are better equipped for these expenditures.\n       I always tell my staff, don't come to me with a problem \n     unless you have at least three potential solutions. Likewise, \n     I have some suggestions for easing the child care crisis:\n       Bring business on board as partners--the ultimate economic \n     gain is having a stronger workforce whose potential is not \n     wasted because they are worrying about the safety and well-\n     being of their young children. I'll be happy to elaborate on \n     our model collaboration with Middlebury College to create a \n     new infant/toddler center thanks to business participation.\n       Forgiveness of student loans, access to higher wages and \n     healthcare for providers help us attract and retain \n     employees. Each of these options is already being done in \n     other professions such as border patrol and rural medicine. \n     Let's work together to bring these options to early care and \n     education.\n       Quality incentives work whether we are talking about \n     guaranteed bonuses for extended personal credentialing or \n     program based bonuses tied to national accreditation \n     standards--it works and children benefit directly from these \n     upward movements.\n       Tax cuts are great but only after the true needs of a \n     nation have been met. It's nice to hear the slogan ``No child \n     will be left behind'' but as an early educator, parent, \n     taxpayer and lifelong Republican--I'm here to tell you under \n     the current budget--children will be left behind in droves. \n     You have a difficult choice: save a little now by not funding \n     a comprehensive early care and education initiative or pay a \n     lot later. We know that every dollar spent in early care and \n     education we save over $7.00 in corrections costs. Quality \n     early intervention works in every country, every time.\n       We can no longer afford to be a nation where only the poor \n     or rich have access to high quality early care and education. \n     You need to commit precious resources to our most precious \n     resource, young children. You can do it, you have proven it \n     on our military bases around the world. We know you can do it \n     and now we expect that you will do it. Thank you.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote to waive \nthe Budget Act, pass this amendment, and help our families who are \nstruggling with the higher cost of child care.\n  The research demonstrates so vividly that we have to do more now. Let \nme again reflect on the chart I displayed earlier. Nearly 40 percent of \nAmerica's fourth graders are reading below grade level; 68 percent of \nfourth graders cannot read at a level that demonstrates solid academic \nperformance. That, compared to the rest of the world, is abominable. \nAgain, in mathematics, this is so critical for the Nation's workforce. \nWe have hundreds of thousands of jobs and we find that American \nstudents are not qualified to take those jobs. We are at the very \nbottom of the heap. That is why we have nearly 1 million H-1-B foreign-\nborn students, people from other countries coming in and taking those \njobs which our young people could have--if they were qualified,\n  I yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Senator from Vermont has laid this out \nvery clearly. I hope our colleagues will find the wisdom to support \nthis. I know the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Montana \nwrestled very hard. They have been good supporters on many of these \nissues over the years. Here is something where just a modest change in \nthe rates can make a huge difference to people. I am not talking about \nthe poorest people, although some of them are, but people who are \nearning about $40,000, $50,000, or $60,000 a year. You have two \nchildren, and it is costing them $17,000 or $18,000 a year for child \ncare. That is a huge whack out of gross income.\n  To provide some increase to defray these costs is a great advantage \nand a great help to these people. We urge our colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to be supportive of this very fair, thoughtful, modest \namendment. I thank my colleague for offering it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  I am not alone in examining these issues. Here is, for instance, a \nreport from California, ``Challenges for Higher Education,'' indicating \nhow important it is for our young people to have the expertise, ready \nto enter the workforce; from Business Week, ``How to Fix America's \nSchools,'' because we are not providing the right type of trained \nworkforce; and another one, ``Helping Students to be First in the \nWorld,'' recommending action in early care and education by the Council \nof Chiefs of State school officers. There are a many reports and \nstudies. This is one I mentioned earlier, demonstrating how wonderful \nthe French system is and how\n\n[[Page S5208]]\n\nterrible our child care is. And there are more.\n  I will conclude by asking the question I did at the beginning: If not \nnow, when? If we have trillions of dollars of surpluses, and we have \nbillions of dollars of need, why can't we solve it? I see no reason. \nNow, we have an opportunity to take an important but small step \nforward.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. I won't speak long because I know the Senator from Connecticut \nis waiting to offer his amendment.\n  I rise mainly not to comment on the amendment of the Senator from \nVermont but to take some time to speak about his contributions to the \nlegislation that is before us. We heard earlier this morning a \nstatistic that Senator Baucus gave about 75 percent of the benefits of \nthis legislation go to families making under $75,000 a year. The \nSenator from Vermont, through several provisions on which he has worked \nwith me on this bill, deserves a great deal of credit for this \nlegislation being well balanced.\n  I listened to what the Senator from Vermont said about the amendment \nhe now lays before the Senate. I appreciate his speaking on that \nsubject. He should be very proud of his work on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, as he has every right to be proud of the work that has come \nfrom his own Senate committee that deals with the issue of education \nand many other items. It is fair to say that no Senator has had a \ngreater influence on the relief act that is before us than Senator \nJeffords. His fingerprints are on the expansion of the earned-income \ncredit for married families, the child credit being extended for \nworking families who do not pay income tax, and the inclusion of the \npension bill, and many of the education provisions in the bill.\n  A married family with two children making $15,000 will receive an \nadditional benefit of over $1,000 next year under the bill before us. \nThat is thanks in no small part to the efforts of Senator Jeffords. I \nrealize the bill before us, as is obvious from the introduction of the \namendment, does not do all the Senator from Vermont hopes for in the \nway of dependent care. I think it is a strong step toward his goals. \nThe changes I have mentioned already to the relief act are estimated to \ncost tens of billions of dollars. The Senator's amendment falls in the \narea of an additional $25 to $30 billion, a figure over 10 years. That \nwould be in addition.\n  It is unfortunate that we can't, for a lot of good amendments that \nare being offered, including the amendment by the Senator from Vermont, \ndo all the things given the tight constraints with which we are faced. \nBut the Senator is always blazing a trail for the work of the Congress, \nand most of his attention rightfully is given to the needs of families \nwith children and preparing people to do well in school.\n  I don't know what we can do on this particular amendment. But I have \nheard what the Senator from Vermont said. I pledge myself to work with \nhim.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back his time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 695\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 695.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me quickly get to the heart of what this \namendment does, and I will give some explanation of the specifics of \nit.\n  This amendment is designed to reduce the amount of the tax cut at the \ntop rate by a relatively small amount--about 1.6 percent--using those \nresources to do two things and, in addition to that, also modifying the \nrepeal of the estate tax. By doing those two things, reducing the top \nrate by less of an amount, by 1.6 percent rather than the 3 points, and \nby having a modification of the estate tax, we take those resources and \napply them to paying down more of the national debt. Fifty percent goes \nto that, and 50 percent goes to nontransportation infrastructure--the \nwater systems, sewage systems, the electrical, and all the things that \ngo on every day that are necessary for our cities, communities, and \nStates to work.\n  We have done very little about investing in the physical \ninfrastructure\n\n[[Page S5209]]\n\nof America. You cannot go back to your respective States and talk to a \nmayor or a Governor and they won't tell you that one of their major \nproblems is dealing with the nontransportation infrastructure needs. \nAlmost on a daily basis, when you pick up any paper in America, you \nwill read where another gas main, water main, sewage main has burst or \nbroken, hasn't been replaced in years, schools are literally falling \napart--kids go off to school every day to schools built decades ago. \nObviously, there are transportation needs. Those are dealt with in \nother places. This is nontransportation infrastructure and debt \nreduction. That is what I want to do with this modest change in the tax \nbill that is in front of us. There are two things that I think are \nabsolutely critical if we are going to succeed in the coming years \neconomically.\n  Presently, we pay between $220 billion and $225 billion a year in \ninterest payments. Let me repeat that--between $220 billion and $225 \nbillion a year in interest payments. An interest payment doesn't build \nanything, doesn't make anyone healthier, doesn't provide a Pell grant \nto go on to higher education, doesn't build a school, a road--it does \nnothing. All it is is interest payments on the national debt that we \nhave accumulated, the bulk of which was accumulated in the 1980s and \nearly 1990s--in excess of $3 trillion or $4 trillion. Mr. President, \n$200 billion a year--even with the surplus--is going in that direction.\n  Certainly, we all ought to agree as Americans that one of our major \ngoals ought to be to bring that debt down. I understand there is a good \nargument for not eliminating it altogether, and I will accept that. But \nnobody can convince me that paying $220 billion a year out of taxpayer \nmoney to go to interest payments at the expense of other things we need \nmakes much sense.\n  I think we ought to modify the tax cut for the most affluent \nAmericans by 1.6 percentage points--that is all, 1.6. You still get a \ngood tax cut here. But by a 1.6 point cut, and using those resources to \nhelp pay down that debt, and then by modifying the repeal of the estate \ntax, which only affects 49,000 Americans --modifying that to help \nrebuild or try to contribute to the infrastructure needs of our \ncountry.\n  How bad are the infrastructure needs? Interest costs on the debt, by \nthe way, are $220 billion a year. Over the next 10 years, that is $1.5 \ntrillion, if we do nothing, if we just accept the present level of \ndebt. Let's assume the economy runs pretty smoothly out here, with no \nnew increases but no real debt. That is $1.5 trillion in debt, \naccording to the Congressional Research Service, if we do nothing to \nincrease our indebtedness.\n\n  In 2001, interest payments on the debt were 11.2 percent of the \nbudget and 2.1 percent of the GDP. According to the Society of Civil \nEngineers, the condition of America's infrastructure receives a failing \ngrade of D plus. They go down the list in terms of roads, bridges, \ntransit, aviation, schools, drinking water, wastewater, dams, solid \nwaste, hazardous waste, navigable waterways, energy--all the way down \nare Ds, flunking. They estimate that over the next 5 years, just to put \nit in working condition--not replace--would be $1.3 trillion to bring \nthe Nation's infrastructure into a C or C+ condition. We are doing \nalmost nothing about it.\n  As we are talking about a tax cut--and I think there is room for it--\ncan we not modify this tax cut by a modest amount to help reduce the \ndebt and invest in the infrastructure needs of America? That is not a \ncomplicated question--just modify it, not eliminate it. I am not \ntalking about taking the tax cut off the table, but instead of reducing \nthe top rate from 39 percent to 36 percent, how about just bringing it \ndown 1.6 points?\n  By the way, I come from the most affluent State in the country on a \nper capita income basis--Connecticut. If you repeal the Federal estate \ntax, it affects about 980 people in my State of 3.5 million people. \nThat is 980 people in my State, and 49,000 nationally. So just \nmodifying the estate tax and reducing the size of the tax cut for the \nmost affluent Americans, I can make a huge dent in the national debt of \nthis country and I can invest in the infrastructure needs that we are \ntold, by every objective analysis, are in desperate need of repair. \nThat is what this amendment is designed to do, very simply--bring down \nthat debt, reduce those interest payments, and invest in the \ninfrastructure.\n  Are we asking so much? In fact, I suggest that if we asked the most \naffluent Americans whether or not they would be willing to take a more \nmodest tax cut--not to eliminate the tax cut, but a more modest tax \ncut--in order to bring down the national debt and to invest in the \ninfrastructure, water systems, and sewage systems that are falling \napart in our country, they would say you ought to do that.\n  I don't know why it is we think that the most affluent people would \nbe opposed to doing some of these things. Yet to hear some of the \nspeeches on the floor of this Chamber, that even a modest reduction in \nthe size of the tax cut for the top 1 percent of income earners, people \nmaking $300,000 or $400,000 a year, a slight reduction in their tax cut \nis absolutely unacceptable, even when it means cutting into that $220 \nbillion a year that goes for interest payments. When I think of what I \ncan do with $220 billion for schools, roads, and other things that our \ncountry needs.\n\n  I have a great fear, of course, that we are going to see this \nproposal in front of us cause an increase in the national debt. If that \nhappens, of course, then interest rates on cars, homes, and other \nconsumer goods will go up, and that is an awful tax increase. When \ninterest payments on those consumer goods rise, that is a tax increase.\n  We have seen that happen in the past. We are not unfamiliar with \nrising interest rate costs and what they can do to people's ability to \nprovide for their families, for businesses to grow and expand and hire \nmore people to compete in the global marketplace.\n  I have great concern that because of what we are doing with this tax \ncut proposal--crowding out our ability to do these other things, such \nas paying down the debt and investing in the infrastructure needs of \nour country--that we are going to look back and rue the day.\n  I am 1 of 10 people who was in this Chamber 20 years ago when a \nsimilar tax cut proposal was being made, a more modest one. Ten of us \nsaid: We are fearful that if we adopt this tax cut proposal, this \ncountry is going to witness an increase in its indebtedness, it is \ngoing to see interest rates climb, and hard-working people are going to \nsee the cost of everything they need go up.\n  There are only 3 of us left today in this Chamber who were part of \nthat group of 10 who voted against that tax cut in 1981-1982. I do not \nknow of many people who would not like to have that vote back, if they \ncould.\n  I do not need to spell out what happened during the mid-1980s and \nearly 1990s. Our national debt went from under $1 trillion to in excess \nof $3 trillion, almost $4 trillion. Interest rates went up to the \nceiling, the economy went dead, flat in the water, and it was not until \n1990 and 1993 that we began to come out of it, we began to see our \neconomy grow and expand again as a result of some very courageous votes \ntaken in this Chamber and the other Chamber.\n  I do not want to see us go back to recreate the mistake we did 20 \nyears ago. I have a great fear that is about what we are going to do in \nthe next 12 hours or less. I do not fault the managing Members for the \njob they have had to do in the Finance Committee, but this is being \ndone awfully quickly.\n  It is only the middle of May, and we are jamming through this tax cut \nproposal even before we are being told what the defense numbers are \ngoing to be. We have an energy crisis looming on the horizon. Thomas \nFriedman of the New York Times called it the ``perfect storm.''\n  We have this tax cut proposal, as much as a $150 billion to $200 \nbillion increase in defense spending, and an energy crisis looming and \nwe are charging ahead unmindful of the implications of these proposals \nand what they could do to the economy of this country and the \npocketbooks of average Americans.\n  This amendment does not correct all of that, but it does moderate it \nto some degree. It says that paying down the national debt ought to be \na priority; if not paying all of it down, pay some of it down. This \nshould not be a Democratic idea or a Republican idea to reduce $220 \nbillion in interest payments each year.\n\n[[Page S5210]]\n\n  Can anyone tell me when an economy has grown in this country when its \ninfrastructure was collapsing? We cannot point to a single period in \nour history when our basic infrastructure was falling apart and our \neconomy grew.\n\n  There is a relationship between interest payments on the debt and \ninfrastructure. The reason I am combining these two in this amendment \nis because both are absolutely critical to economic growth. If debt is \ntoo big, either personally or nationally, then we will not be able to \nafford the things we need for our families or as a nation. If our \ninfrastructure is collapsing and falling apart, our economy does not \ngrow.\n  By reducing the tax cut for the most affluent Americans by a small \namount, I do not eliminate the national debt, and I do not provide for \nall the infrastructure needs, but we do some of the things.\n  If my colleagues do not think this amendment has value, they can call \ntheir Governor, Democrat or Republican, and ask them whether or not \nthey think infrastructure costs are serious in their respective States.\n  I am looking at some numbers from my State of Connecticut. \nInfrastructure facts: 58 percent of Connecticut schools have at least \none inadequate building feature, 68 percent of the schools have at \nleast one unsatisfactory environmental feature. Connecticut's drinking \nwater infrastructure needs $1.35 billion over the next 20 years.\n  Connecticut is a small State. There are 11 State-determined deficient \ndams in the State of Connecticut. Again, my colleagues can call their \nhome States, and I am sure they will get similar numbers across the \ncountry about what is happening to the basic infrastructure of our \nNation and our inability, as a result of what we are about to do with \nthis tax cut, to pay for these costs.\n  By the way, when fully implemented, this tax cut is not $1.35 \ntrillion. It will cost $4 trillion. I draw the attention of my \ncolleagues to the lead editorial in the New York Times over the weekend \nabout the cost of this tax bill we are about to adopt, and those \nexploding costs will kick in just as the baby boomers retire, and just \nas Social Security and Medicare will be placed under extraordinary new \nstrains.\n  This amendment makes a commitment to debt reduction, and while I \nbelieve it is modest, it also seeks a commitment to that other \nimportant priority: our national infrastructure.\n  It is a well-known fact that our country's schools, our water, and \nwastewater systems, our telecommunications connections are in dire need \nof attention. Let me give some examples.\n  Nearly three-quarters of our schools are over 30 years old. The \naverage age of our schools is 42 years. That means schools go back \nalmost to the mid part of the last century. Fourteen million children \nattend school every day in buildings that are unsafe. Fourteen million \nkids go to unsafe schools every day.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers issued a report card on our \nNation's school infrastructure and gave it a failing grade. Our water \nand wastewater systems need nearly $23 billion more each year. Water \nand wastewater alone need $23 billion a year for the next 20 years--\nthere is nothing here for that; nothing--in order to replace aging and \nfailing pipes and to meet the environmental and public health standards \nin the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Acts.\n  Federal contributions have dropped 75 percent in real terms since \n1980. We used to be a better partner with our States and communities in \npicking up these costs. We have now left the scene, pretty much \ndeparted entirely. So while providing a tax cut on one level, who do we \nthink is going to pick up the cost of these items at the local level \nsince we do not contribute much anymore? Local property tax, local \nsales tax, and local income tax will go up. We will provide Americans \nwith a few bucks here, but we will take the money out of another pocket \nat the State and local level because the Governors and mayors are going \nto have to pick up these costs because we are not doing it.\n  The Federal Government represents only about 10 percent of the total \ncapital outlays for water and wastewater infrastructure. That is how \nmuch in 20 years we have declined in our participation. The architects \nof this bill would prefer we not pay anything. That is what they want. \nClean water, obviously, affects the environment, public health, and the \neconomy. Clean water supports a $50 billion recreational industry, $300 \nbillion in coastal tourism, $45 billion in annual commercial fishing, \nand a shellfishing industry.\n\n  And we all know the Internet has dramatically altered how we live, \nwork, gathering information, and we are all aware of the increasing \nimportance of being digitally connected. While access has increased for \nall groups, there still exists a gap, or digital divide, between those \nAmericans with access to technology and those without. Race, income, \neducation, age, and location are all factors related to the level of \nInternet connectivity.\n  As to the means to deploy this technology, once again, however, the \ninfrastructure needed to extend access is lagging, desperately lagging \nin certain areas and among certain groups in this country.\n  By reducing this tax cut, decreasing modestly for the most affluent, \nwe can make a difference on closing the digital divide to see to it \nthat every child in America will have the opportunity to access this \nmodern technology that they will need to be productive citizens.\n  Wastewater and telecommunications, are these not priorities issues as \nwell? Don't they deserve the attention of this body? As we are about to \ngive a tax cut of this magnitude, can we not modify it even slightly to \nmake a difference for the people who would benefit as a result of \nimproved water, wastewater, telecommunications, and schools? Does that \nnot make America richer and wealthier, more solid as a nation in the \nyears to come?\n  Why crowd out everything here so that instead of the 75 percent we \nused to contribute to our local communities, we are down to 10, 9, 8, \n5, and down to 1 percent?\n  Rural communities fall behind cities' and urban areas' broadband \npenetration, at only 7.3 percent for rural parts of America. This is \nnot just cities we are talking about; rural communities suffer \nterribly.\n  Large gaps in Internet access still remain among ethnic groups. The \nInternet has become a necessity. It will become even more so in the \nyears ahead. If we don't make investments in the basic infrastructure, \nwe will rue the day, in my view.\n  The importance of our commitment to our Nation's infrastructure is \nhighlighted by a recent visit I had with mayors from 60 of my cities. \nOne mayor said it best when he said a cut in Federal taxes equals an \nincrease in local taxes. Municipal governments are straining to find \nthe resources for water treatment and school repairs. He asked, are we \ngoing to ignore what is happening in our communities for a huge tax cut \nfor those who can afford it the most?\n  In the tax bill before the Senate, everyone gets tax relief. I am not \nchanging that. I especially appreciate what the most affluent have done \nsince 1993 in contributing to reducing our Nation's debt. They should \nget tax relief. I don't join those who say there ought to be no tax \nrelief for affluent Americans. They contribute. I suspect were they \nhere in this Chamber and asked the question of whether or not to reduce \nthe national debt and invest in the infrastructure of America by taking \na modest tax cut, most affluent Americans would say: Do it, do it.\n  The reason the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans pay more in taxes \nrelative to other income groups is not that tax rates have increased, \nbut rather that their before-tax incomes have increased by nearly 50 \npercent between 1992 and 1998 as a result of wise decisions we made to \nreduce debt and to increase opportunity in this country. At the same \ntime their incomes have risen dramatically, the overall Federal tax \nburden has dropped substantially.\n\n  The bipartisan 1997 tax bill cut taxes on capital gains from \ninvestments, a major source of income for wealthy Americans. So the top \n1 percent have seen a drop in their average overall tax rates. The top \n400 wealthiest taxpayers, for instance, have seen a decrease in the \naverage tax rates from 29 percent in 1993 to 22 percent in 1998--again, \nprimarily as a result of the cut in the capital gains tax rates.\n\n[[Page S5211]]\n\n  I reject the argument, further, that the affluent are ready to riot \nover their taxes. I think the affluent are responsible citizens. I \nthink they will be the first to say they live in the most wonderful \nnation on the face of this planet. Many came from poor families and \ncreated their wealth through hard work and sweat, ingenuity, and \nsmarts. They tell you what they hope more for this country than \nanything else is to see to it that others have a similar opportunity. I \ndon't think they are about to riot. They want to see the country well \nmanaged, well run. They want to see its economic policies reflect the \nkind of society that gives people that opportunity. When schools are \nfalling apart, with 42 percent of schools being built more than 30 or \n40 years ago, when our water and wastewater systems are falling apart, \nwhen we have to write a check each year for $220 billion in interest \npayments, affluent, responsible Americans would say, bring down that \nnational debt and invest in the infrastructure of America. Yes, they \nwill give you a tax cut, as well, in addition to what is being received \nin the cuts of the capital gains taxes.\n  I hope to adopt this amendment.\n  I mentioned earlier the estate tax. I don't disagree we need estate \ntax relief. But to eliminate it entirely? What that costs over 10 years \nof this bill is $660 billion a year, for 49,000 Americans. That is who \ngets saved by this--the 49,000 most affluent Americans. The difference \nover 10 years is $660 billion. Can we not just modify the estate tax, \nreduce the size of the tax cut by a very small amount, and make a huge \ndifference in the national debt of the country and the infrastructure \nneeds?\n  Mr. President, 49,000 Americans, 980 in my State alone--that is it--\nout of 3.5 million people who will benefit with the complete repeal of \nthe estate tax. And we can't find the resources, we can't modify that \nto make the difference? In Connecticut, 980 people resulted in estate \ntax liability out of 3.5 million. I hope my colleagues will consider \nthis amendment as a modest change in the proposal.\n  I add my friend and colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, as a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  This is modest change in the amount of tax rates for the most \naffluent, through modifying the estate tax repeal and investing those \nresources in bringing down that national debt and investing in the \nnontransportation infrastructure needs of America, is what this is \nabout. We will not have the economy grow if the national debt goes \nclimbing up again and if the infrastructure is falling apart. That is \nwhy I put these two issues together. In the absence of both of these, \ngood infrastructure and reducing debt, both personally as well as \nnationally, it is hard to imagine how this economy will see a brighter \nday if we adopt this bill without these provisions added to it.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is added as a \ncosponsor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself such time as I consume.\n  Looking at the amendment being introduced, the purpose of it is to \nmake changes in the bill to reflect changes in the rate of taxation, \nand particularly heavy emphasis upon change in the estate tax \nprovisions, so that savings can be realized to be used for Federal debt \nreduction and improvement to the Nation's transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  I know what the Senator's intent is: to save money so it can be used \nfor the Nation's nontransportation infrastructure. But there is nothing \nin his amendment that directs the money in that direction. So when it \nis finally said and done as far as public policy is concerned, this \namendment is just to change very dramatically the higher rate reduction \nthat we have in the bill and to more or less decimate the estate tax \nprovisions of our bill.\n\n  I have to confess I do not know what it is to be born rich and live \nrich. There seems to be a compulsion on the part of people in this \nbody, for those who are born rich, live rich, and die rich, to want \nthem to contribute more to the Federal Treasury than other people who \ndo not fit into that category. There is an effort to nick those rich \npeople for more money when they die.\n  I confess not to understand what it is to be born rich and live rich. \nSo I do not come from the perspective that there is all this money out \nthere that people are just willing to contribute to the Federal \nTreasury when they die. I do not understand the people who get a big \njoy out of taxing those people. But if they get a big joy out of it, \nOK. If they want to establish a category of people who are forever \nfilthy rich and go after them, that might be all right.\n  But most of the people I think about when I talk about doing away \nwith the death tax are people who have lived very moderately throughout \ntheir lives and come to a point, probably because they are involved in \nfarms and small businesses and you are just forced to reinvest so much, \nput all of your earnings back into the business so you can grow and \njust be competitive. That is particularly true in farming.\n  If you started farming years ago with 80 acres and you are only \nfarming 80 acres today, you aren't going to be successful unless you \nhave a job in town. So you have to keep investing in machinery, be more \nproductive, buy more land, et cetera. That is the sort of person I \nthink of, one who has lived moderately and maybe dies fairly well off. \nThe point is, when they live that way, they want to leave that \nbusiness, those resources, to their kids. They do not want to be hit \nwith a death tax after they have paid taxes all their lives.\n  I gave the example once before. And I am raising the issue of \nfairness of a death tax versus those who do not pay it. You have two \npeople who can make exactly the same amount of money throughout their \nlifetimes. Both of them obviously are going to pay income tax when they \nmake it. But this person over here is going to live very moderately and \nmiserly and maybe leave an estate of $5 million. Then when he dies, his \nestate, because he lived in so miserly a manner, is going to pay a big \nreward to the Federal Treasury.\n  You have the other person over here living it up throughout his life, \nwomanizing, drinking it up--you know, all the things that are dealt \nwith in the material world--who does not leave a penny. This person \ngets taxed once when he makes it and spends it tomorrow. This person \ngets taxed when he makes it, saves it, and invests it in a business and \nwants to leave it to his kids, and then he is taxed again when he dies. \nWhat is fair about that?\n  Those are the people I am worried about. I am not worried about the \nfilthy rich who are born rich, live rich, and die rich. So I have been \na long-time advocate that no American family should be forced to pay up \nto 60 percent of their savings, their business, or their family farm in \ntaxes when they die. No taxpayer should be visited by the undertaker \nand the tax collector at the same time.\n  We have now before us an opportunity to do something about that, to \nhelp those families that are being crushed under the expensive \nresponsibilities of estate tax planning and estate taxes.\n\n  Let me suggest probably the money that is wasted in this country on \nestate tax planning is the biggest waste of the productive resources in \nthis country that you can have. They are even worse than the estate \ntax, I believe. People who have worked hard, who are faced with the \nestate tax, who want to leave some money to their kids, just spend \nwasteful amounts of money on estate planning in order to legally avoid \npaying estate tax. Wouldn't it be better if those estate planners, \nthose insurance salesmen, those lawyers, were doing something \nproductive, contributing something to the economy as opposed to this \nnonproductive effort of estate planning?\n  When we do away with the estate tax, these folks will be able to do \nsomething productive.\n  There are those in the Senate who want you to believe we are spending \n$145 billion for the benefit of just 45,000 people; that it is just \n45,000 people paying estate tax. I want to tell the Senator from \nConnecticut I do not believe that is true. There may have been 45,000 \nestate tax returns that had checks attached. But that is no way to \nmeasure the impact on the American taxpayer.\n  In preparation for the RELIEF Act I had the opportunity to review \n1999 Internal Revenue statistics regarding estate tax returns. Those \nstatistics, frankly, were outrageous. In the Federal Government's \nattempt to enforce its version of social responsibility by\n\n[[Page S5212]]\n\nthis huge tax rate of 55 to 60 percent on the estate tax, taken from \nthe family's net wealth on the death of a loved one, it has cast a net. \nThere is a net cast by that one involuntary action of death into \nthousands of homes in its attempt to capture a few so-called rich \nfamilies.\n  In 1999, there were only 577 people who died in the United States \nwith gross estates greater than $20 million in value. But 104,000 \nfamilies were affected by the estate tax requirements.\n  Let's get this straight: 577 people died with estates over $20 \nmillion, but 104,000 families were affected by these estate tax \nrequirements. In search of this supposed social justice, to take 55 \npercent of a family's lifetime efforts to contribute to the Treasury's \ngeneral fund, we have upset lives in over 100,000 families. Is that \ntruly a ratio with which we are willing to live? Is that fair? I cannot \nimagine supporting this amendment. Thousands of American taxpayers who \ndeserve immediate estate tax reform are being cast aside by this \namendment.\n  On the backs of the American taxpayers, the Senator from Connecticut \nhas proposed funding nontransportation infrastructure. That is an \ninteresting thought--nontransportation infrastructure. In order to \nachieve that goal, he is willing to wait until the year 2010 to \nincrease the unified credit to just $2 million.\n  That is 30 years from the last time it was increased, 1981. That $2 \nmillion, 30 years later, would not even be worth what the unified \ncredit was in 1981. That means for the first time, American taxpayers \nwho are good Americans, who saved and invested in savings accounts and \nstocks and bonds, will be treated equally with all other taxpayers.\n  It means that for the first time American farm families and the \nowners of small businesses will not have to jump through hoops, hold \ntheir breath, and pray that they planned their estate just right, \nsubject to audit, in order to get the full use of their unified credit.\n  In addition, Senator Dodd gives no estate tax rate relief. The \nbipartisan RELIEF Act before us does. We immediately drop the top rate \nto 50 percent. In the year 2007, we reduce the top rate to 45 percent.\n  After all is said and done, people are going to be hit with the death \ntax at a higher rate of taxation than when they were living, which the \ntop rate today is 39.8 percent.\n  So for the first time in history, an American family can exempt $8 \nmillion from the death tax--that is in the bill before us--by the year \n2007.\n  In this bipartisan RELIEF Act, we have chosen to treat all American \ntaxpayers equally, and give a unified credit that everyone can use, \nunlike the proposed amendment by the Senator from Connecticut. In \naddition to stealing the American taxpayers' increase in the unified \ncredit, offered in this amendment is a paltry increase in the complex \nqualified family-owned business deduction. That would be increased by a \nmere $75,000. And that would not happen until the year 2006.\n  I think all this flies in the face of the American taxpayer. This is \nan overwhelmingly complex additional deduction of $75 which, quite \nfrankly, turns out to be meaningless--in fact, so meaningless that I am \nashamed I had a hand in writing this about 2 or 3 years ago when it was \nwritten. I would have to suggest to the Senator from Connecticut that \nif he would read again, as I have been forced to read, the Internal \nRevenue Code on these provisions, he would find that when you get \nthrough these complex provisions, if typed in its entirety, it is over \n20 pages long, and it is full of requirements, restrictions, cross-\nreferences that boggle the minds of accountants and the legal \nprofession and the American taxpayers.\n  I think we need to be honest with the American public and give them a \ntrue death tax break that everyone can use. This amendment will detract \nfrom that tremendously. I think our bill does a pretty good job of it, \nnot as good of a job as I would like but within the context of a \nbipartisan compromise and within the context of the budget restrictions \nwe are operating under, this is the best we can do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield myself about 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to address two arguments that \nhave been made against the distributional benefits of this bill.\n  First, opponents of the bill have made the argument that it does \nlittle to alleviate the payroll tax burden, which is the largest tax \nburden for many middle- and low-income Americans. It is true that about \n80 percent of Americans pay more in payroll taxes than they do in \nincome taxes. It is also true that for about 20 percent of Americans \ntheir sole Federal tax liability burden is the payroll tax; it is not \nincome tax.\n  The argument that is made is that this bill does nothing for those \npeople whose principal Federal tax is the payroll tax. That argument is \nsimply incorrect. In fact, the bill before us makes three important \nchanges that directly offset the impact of payroll taxes so there are \nthree measures in this bill which reduce payroll taxes for a \nsignificant number of Americans.\n  First, we amend the child credit to make it significantly more \nrefundable; that is, after you have used up your child credit against \nyour income taxes, if there is still more child credit available, we \nsay: Americans, if you are in that situation, you get a check from \nUncle Sam.\n  We also reduce the marriage penalty under the earned-income credit. \nIt is a very important provision which makes the so-called marriage \npenalty much less of a burden for low-income families. The Earned \nIncome Tax Credit allows people with insufficient income tax liability \nto still get the benefit of a tax cut by allowing a credit against \ntheir payroll taxes.\n  Third, we simplify the earned-income tax credit. That is no small \nmatter. Some people might argue that simplification does not have much \neffect. But I strongly disagree. This bill contains major \nsimplifications to definitions and other provisions which will be a \nvery significant aid to lower income people, allowing them to better \nutilize the earned-income tax credit. This means they will have more \nability, again, to offset against payroll taxes.\n  Put all these together and the bill before us includes about $109 \nbillion in outlays over the 10-year period of this bill. In other \nwords, about $109 billion is directed exclusively for offsetting \npayroll taxes.\n  The second argument against this bill's distributional effects is \nalso incorrect. This argument is that the tax cuts in the bill are \nregressive because they give a relatively larger cut to those at the \nvery highest income levels. Specifically, it is argued that the bill \ngives the top 1 percent highest income taxpayers a whopping 33.5 \npercent of the tax cuts.\n  Let's look more closely at that argument and deal with all the cards \non the table. The above conclusion can only be reached if you include \nthe distributional effects of the estate tax provisions.\n  But there are two problems with that analysis. First, there is an \nongoing dispute on how to distribute the impact of the estate taxes \nacross income classes. This is because the estate tax is based on the \nsize of the estate of the decedent there is no way to calculate the \nwealth of those who inherit the assets. In fact, the Joint Tax \nCommittee does not do estate tax distributional tables for that exact \nreason.\n  There are organizations in this city and in this country that do make \nthose calculations. I have no objection to their trying, but we must \nremember that these calculations are based on assumptions that are hard \nto pin down. They are doing as good a job as they can, but they are \ntrying to calculate something that our official scorekeepers refuse to \nestimate. But even assuming that the downtown organizations that make \nthat analysis are correct, let's think a little more about it.\n  Virtually all Senators in this body support either ``reform'' or \nrepeal of the Federal estate tax. I believe it is almost impossible to \nsupport reform or repeal of the estate tax and then attack the \ndistribution of tax benefits in the bill as regressive.\n  Why do I say that? Because if you set aside the estate tax \nprovisions--just take them off the table and deal with everything else \nin this bill--if you look\n\n[[Page S5213]]\n\nonly at the income and payroll tax effects, this bill is quite \nprogressive compared with current law--not regressive, but progressive.\n  Let's take a look at the numbers. If we set aside the estate tax \nprovisions what do we find? Let's look at the top 1 percent of \ntaxpayers; that is, those with an annual income of $373,000 or more.\n  This covers the top 1 percent of taxpayers in America. Under current \nlaw, those Americans pay 26 percent of all Federal taxes. That doesn't \njust cover income taxes, it includes all Federal taxes, including \npayroll taxes, excise taxes, and even estate taxes. But if you set \naside the estate tax provisions in this bill, these taxpayers do not \nget 33.5 percent of the tax cuts, as alleged. Instead, they get 19 \npercent, only 19 percent of the benefits, even though they pay 26 \npercent of all Federal taxes. People with lower incomes get much more \nunder this bill than they do compared to current law.\n  Let's take another look. According to the Joint Tax Committee, \ntaxpayers with an income of $200,000 or more, that is the top 4 or 5 \npercent of all taxpayers today, pay about 32 percent of all Federal \ntaxes. Under our bill, these taxpayers get about 22.5 percent of the \ntax cuts, again, a smaller share of tax cuts than the share of taxes \nthey pay under current law.\n  What is the point of all this? Basically I am saying that if you look \nat the whole bill, then this bill is very progressive with the \nexception of the estate tax provisions. That is, higher income people \nget a smaller proportion of the tax benefits when compared with current \nlaw and everybody below roughly $100,000 will get a greater proportion \nof tax benefits when compared with current law.\n  As for the estate tax provisions, unfortunately, a number of my \ncolleagues have been trying to have it both ways. They claim the bill \nis regressive, when its most regressive features are the estate tax \nprovisions, but at the same time they push to have the unified credit \ngo up to higher and higher numbers.\n  I have heard Senators on the floor who roundly criticized this bill \nprivately say: Gee, Max, can we raise the unified credit up to $6, $7, \neven $10 million?\n  I don't think you can have it both ways.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Montana yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Certainly.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Does the Senator from Montana support complete repeal of \nthe estate tax?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No, he does not.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The only point I make is, talking about this bill as \nprogressive, by saying if you don't consider the estate tax, it is a \nprogressive bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I may respond, by far most of the cost of the estate \ntax provisions in the bill, in the current 10 years which the bill \ncovers, results from raising the unified credit. Only a very small \nportion results from repeal of the estate tax. It is also important to \nrecall this whole bill is sunsetted after 10 years. And so the claims \nof $600, $900 billion in the second 10 years are interesting, if you \nproject current law out that far, but not particularly relevant since \nthe bill terminates at the end of 2011 and all of its provisions will \nneed to be reinstated.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might further inquire, I admit certain changes have \noccurred that have made this bill better for lower and middle-income \ngroups more recently. But my guess is the Senator from Montana is not \nsaying repeal of the estate tax is not in this bill, even though he \nsays it is sunsetted. This bill repeals the estate tax in the last \nyear; is that correct?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is absolutely correct. Personally, I do not \nsupport full repeal of the estate tax. I support reforming the tax so \nit protects our family farms, ranches and other businesses. I \nunderstand the Senator is going to offer an amendment later today that \nwill eliminate full repeal, while addressing the concerns of family \nbusinesses. I intend to support that amendment.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Further inquiring, I do intend to offer an amendment \nfollowing the amendment offered by Senator Kyl today. I might say that, \nwhile I support reform and have long supported reform of the estate \ntax, I do not support total repeal of the estate tax for reasons which \nI will describe later.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, because my time is limited I would like to \nget back to the point I was making originally about the distribution of \nthis bill.\n  As this chart behind me shows, for taxpayers with incomes of $25,000 \nor less, $50,000 or less, $75,000 or less, or $100,000 or less, this \nbill, which is the red, shows that a greater proportion of tax \nreductions apply to those taxpayers. For those taxpayers with incomes \nof $100,000 to $200,000 or taxpayers with incomes above $200,000, \nagain, the red shows they receive less in tax benefits compared with \nthe administration's plan--again showing that this bill is progressive. \nThat is, compared with current law and compared with the Bush plan, \nthis bill does give more tax reductions percentage-wise to people with \nincomes under $100,000, and those at $100,000 or more will get less in \ntax reductions than the Bush plan or current law. It does show that \nthis is a progressive bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 3 minutes 25 \nseconds remaining; the managers, 1 minute 41 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. In the 3 minutes, I want to make a couple of corrections to \nsome of the statements made about the estate tax.\n  First, I will tell the Senate exactly how many people paid the estate \ntax liability: 49,870 people had, in 1999, Federal estate tax \nliability. That is 2 percent of the adult deaths in the country. When \nit comes to family farms, the New York Times recently reported that an \nIowa State University economist had not been able to find a single \ndocumented example, not a single documented example of a family farm \nlost to the estate tax. Nor could the American Farm Bureau Federation \nfind one example, not one. So when I hear these nostalgic, mythical \narguments about the family farm losing out to the estate tax, that is \nwhat it is. It is mythology, unless you are the King Ranch in Texas \nmaybe.\n  The idea that small family farms lose is just not borne out by the \nstatistics or facts. The fact is, there is a significant revenue loss. \nMy colleagues may not want to talk about it, but this bill also \nbackloads the estate tax. It doesn't become fully effective until 2011. \nThis hides the true cost of estate tax repeal.\n  If you want to vote for $662 billion in tax breaks for 49,000 people, \nthen vote against the amendment. But then you explain that the next \ntime we try to fix the water system or a sewer system or repair a \nschool or reduce the national debt. The family farmer suffered? Name \none. The Farm Bureau couldn't name one. The New York Times couldn't \nfind one. Iowa State University couldn't find one.\n  This is a joke that is going on here. It is ridiculous. Listen to \nsome of the most affluent Americans. Listen to George Soros, who talked \nabout the estate tax and how ridiculous this is. Listen to Warren \nBuffett, Bill Gates, John Kluge, they will tell you this is a myth, \nthat it is ridiculous talking about death taxes, $662 billion over 10 \nyears. That is real money. That is money that could make a difference \nin paying down the debt, in investing in the infrastructure of America.\n  By taking the top rate down, instead of to 36 percent but to 38 \npercent, is that really an outrageous request to make for a modest \ninvestment in a downpayment on reducing the national debt and investing \nin the nontransportation infrastructure of America? I don't think so, \nBill Gates doesn't think so, George Soros doesn't think so, Warren \nBuffett doesn't think so, John Kluge doesn't think so.\n\n  I hope the amendment will be adopted. Maybe we will have a little \nmore balance in this bill. But repealing the estate tax to affect a \nfraction of the population in this country, some of the most affluent \npeople in the land--to their credit, some of the most affluent people \nthink this is wrong.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n[[Page S5214]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Might I, on behalf of the Republican majority, pose a \nquestion to the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, how much time does the chairman of the \ncommittee, the Senator from Iowa, have remaining on the Republican \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A minute and a half.\n  Mr. KYL. Might I be recognized to take that time in response to the \nSenator from Connecticut?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Then I will be happy to have a rollcall at that point.\n  This is a very deceptive amendment. There is absolutely nothing in \nthis amendment that calls for any money to be spent on paying down the \nnational debt or applying any money to the infrastructure of the United \nStates. Only in the title does the amendment say that the purpose is to \nallow money to be spent for this. It says ``may be used'' for Federal \ndebt reduction and improvements to the Nation's infrastructure. What it \ndoes is repeal almost all of the benefits in this bill relating to the \nrepeal and reform of the estate tax and takes away all but 1 percent of \nthe top marginal rate reduction called for in the bill.\n  When the Senator from Connecticut claims that the repeal of the \nestate tax in this bill is going to cost $662 billion, he is \nabsolutely, totally wrong. According to Joint Tax, the cost of the \nestate tax repeal and reform measures in this bill is $145 billion, \nperiod, not $662 billion. Moreover, it is a fallacy to say that few \nwill benefit. While it is true that relatively few estates pay the tax, \nhundreds of thousands of people will benefit by the reforms in the \nestate tax that are included in this legislation: The rate reductions; \nthe increase in the amount of unified credit; and, in the 10th year, \nthe repeal of the tax.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will be happy to take 30 seconds when he is \ndone, and I will not object.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated \nthat the House version, H.R. 8, would cost $186 billion between 2002 \nand 2011, less than one-third of the 10-year cost they estimated for \nimmediate repeal, $662 billion--the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  Mr. KYL. That is right. The immediate repeal--that was my original \nbill--would cost $662 billion. But we are not immediately repealing. \nThe Senator should consult the bill. The estate tax is not eliminated \nuntil the 10th and final year. That elimination is $30 billion of the \n$145 billion of the total cost of reforming and finally repealing the \nestate tax. It is not repealed in the first year, not until the 10th \nyear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 691\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I send amendment No. 691 to the desk. It is \nthe tuition scholarship tax credit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 691.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a credit \nagainst income tax for contributions to charitable organizations which \n provide scholarships for children to attend elementary and secondary \n                                schools)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I am offering this amendment because I \nbelieve our Tax Code must and can be reformed to address the urgent \nneed to improve elementary and secondary education in our country.\n  This tax bill takes a very important first step by allowing the \nCoverdell education IRAs to be used not only to facilitate savings for \ncollege education but for grades K through 12 as well.\n  Many of us since 1997 have worked very hard to secure this reform. I \nam gratified that it will finally be accomplished. For that, by the \nway, special credit is due to my late colleague, Senator Paul \nCoverdell, as well as Senators Torricelli and Hutchinson of Arkansas, \nwhom I am pleased to have as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  While the administration of our schools is and should remain a local \nresponsibility, we have a compelling national interest in improving the \nquality of K through 12 education. There are ways to do it without \nadding to the bureaucracy in Washington and without adding new \nmandates. It is a fact that America is currently not educating the \nworkforce it needs for the economy of the 21st century. Raising overall \nachievement will enhance America's competitiveness.\n  Congress has been compelled to authorize the issuance of hundreds of \nthousands of new visas for highly skilled temporary workers because it \nis a fact that not enough qualified American workers were available to \nfill new economy jobs. Unless we take action, this situation is \nunlikely to change. It is a fact that international tests reveal that \nAmerican high school seniors rank 19th out of 21 industrialized nations \nin mathematics achievement and 16th out of 21 nations in science \nachievement.\n\n[[Page S5215]]\n\n  Ironically, this threat to our competitiveness is the result of our \nfailure to apply the very principles undergirding our economy's success \nin the area of education. Our Nation has thrived because our leading \nindustries and institutions have been challenged by constant pressure \nto improve and to innovate. The source of that pressure is vigorous \ncompetition among producers of a service or a good for the allegiance \nof their potential customers or consumers. So why not promote \ninnovation by producers and choice for consumers in the field of \neducation?\n  The quasi-monopoly of public education today discourages this \ninnovation, and the fact that funding is through tax dollars diminishes \nthe choice option for all but the most wealthy. They have to go to \nschools where they are told. They can't direct their tax dollars to the \nschool where they want to send their children.\n  We must find a way to promote innovation and opportunity through \ngreater choice for parents. Those are the concepts that have built this \ncountry through our great free market economic system, and it is the \nsame concept that can improve our educational system for the \ncompetition that I spoke of earlier.\n  Another problem with our education system is that too many of our \nchildren are literally being left behind. Thirty-seven percent of \nAmerican fourth graders' tests show that they are essentially unable to \nread. For Hispanic fourth graders, the proportion is 58 percent, and \nfor African-American fourth graders, it is 63 percent. That is \nintolerable.\n  Since 1983, over 10 million Americans have reached the 12th grade \nwithout having to learn how to read at a basic level. Over 20 million \nhave reached their senior year unable to do basic mathematics.\n  As President Bush has repeatedly noted, far too many of America's \nmost disadvantaged youngsters pass through public schools without \nreceiving an adequate education. It is intolerable that millions of \nchildren are trapped in unsafe and failing schools.\n  Parents should have a right in the United States of America to get \nthe best education possible for their children as they see it, and the \namendment I offer today will help secure that right.\n  My amendment would provide a $250 tax credit, $500 for joint filers, \nto partially offset the cost of donations to tuition scholarship \norganizations. What are those? They are organizations that in the past \nhave been primarily founded by business leaders that provide partial \ntuition scholarships to enable needy youngsters to attend a school of \ntheir family's choosing.\n  The idea first came to light about a decade ago when the first one \nwas founded in Indianapolis. Now there are more than 80 such programs \nserving more than 50,000 students nationwide.\n  For families who benefit, these programs are a godsend. A study that \nwas just released by the Kennedy School of Government found that 68 \npercent of parents awarded scholarships are very satisfied with \nacademics at their child's school compared with only 23 percent of \nparents not awarded scholarships.\n  The problem is that demand for scholarships far outstrips supply, \neven though families must agree to contribute a significant portion of \nthe total cost of tuition. The interesting thing is, that is especially \nthe case at the lower end of the economic ladder.\n  For example, in 1997, 1,000 partial tuition scholarships were offered \nto families in the District of Columbia. Nearly 8,000 applications were \nreceived, many of them from very low income families.\n  Another example: In 1999, 1.5 million people applied for 40,000 \nscholarships in a national lottery. Clearly, there is a huge unmet \ndemand for this kind of assistance.\n  In 1997, Arizona implemented an innovative plan to meet that demand \nin our State: A $500 tax credit to offset donations to organizations \nthat provide tuition scholarships to elementary and secondary students. \nThe results: Upwards of $40 million in donations to tuition scholarship \norganizations.\n  The number of school tuition organizations operating in my State of \nArizona is up from 2 to 33, and the organizations have a very wide \nrange of emphasis and orientations. For example, they range from the \nJewish Community Day School Scholarship Fund to the Fund for Native \nScholarship Enrichment and Resources to the Foundation for Montessori \nScholarships.\n  Nearly 15,000 Arizona students, nearly all of them from disadvantaged \nbackgrounds, have received this scholarship assistance.\n  The interesting thing is while some have charged that the law was \nunconstitutional, particularly given the explicit prohibition on direct \naid to parochial schools in Arizona's constitution, our State supreme \ncourt recognized that allowing taxpayers to use their own money to \nsupport education is a different matter and upheld the program. And \nconsistent with previous holdings on the subject, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt declined to review the decision.\n  We have the answer to those who fear that Federal dollars going to \nvouchers which students would then take to the school of their choice \ncould possibly be unconstitutional, though I do not think that is the \ncase. But we have an answer to that concern.\n  Here you do not have Federal dollars being given to students in the \nform of vouchers which are then taken to the school of their choice. \nInstead, what we provide is that if people want to contribute money to \na duly qualifying scholarship fund, that scholarship fund can then give \nthat scholarship to needy students and those students can take that \nscholarship to whatever school in which they want to be educated.\n\n  The people who originally donate to the scholarship fund will be \ngranted a tax credit by the U.S. Government. That is constitutional. It \ndoes not violate any notion of separation of church and state, and yet \nit permits people to help those who need the help the most to have the \nflexibility that only the most wealthy in our society have today: the \nability to take their kids to the school of their choice.\n  It is a much better way to resolve this problem of choice and \ninnovation than, frankly, anybody has come up with to date because it \nmeets the constitutional challenges; it involves the private sector; it \ninvolves personal donations; it does not have the Federal Government \nhaving to fund a large voucher program. Yet it gets the benefits to the \nstudents who need it the most, who are willing to contribute part of \ntheir own income to match that scholarship and pay the tuition at the \nschool of their choice, be it a public school, a public charter school, \na private school, a parochial school--it does not matter.\n  In many cases, this money could even be used to pay the public school \nwhen one is able to transfer from one public school to another. It is \nneutral in this regard, as to whether it is used at public or nonpublic \nschools, and, as I said, it could even be used to offset tuition costs \nboth at private schools and to help enroll a child in a school across a \ndistrict boundary. This, in effect, creates a Federal credit comparable \nto those upheld in Arizona and to recently enacted provisions in other \nStates, such as Pennsylvania and Florida, of which I am aware.\n  It is interesting; the Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated this \ncredit could cost the Federal Treasury $43.4 billion over a 10-year \nperiod. Think what a magnitude of difference that money would make in \nthe lives of our children: $43 billion would finance 12.4 million \n$3,500 scholarships. Think of the opportunity provided to those 12.4 \nmillion students with a $3,500 scholarship to take them out of the \ncondition of education they are in now, out of the failing school, out \nof the unsafe school, and to a school where they can achieve, where \nthey can learn, where they can be competitive, where they can learn \ntheir full potential.\n  I close with this point. I have said many times that if we can get \neducation right, almost everything else in this country will follow. \nProbably all of my 99 colleagues would agree with that general \nproposition. If we can get education in this country right, everything \nelse follows. By ``we,'' I do not just mean the Federal Government. In \nfact, I mean primarily the parents and local school folks.\n  First, it will help people realize their full potential.\n  Second, it will make them more qualified to compete for the kinds of \njobs that are going to exist in the future.\n\n[[Page S5216]]\n\n  Third, it will help our Nation compete. We are going to need to \ncompete in a world environment.\n  Fourth, it is going to make us more secure because we are going to \nhave the kind of young students who can invent the things that are \ngoing to help us keep our technological edge when it comes to national \nsecurity.\n  Fifth, it is going to make us better citizens.\n  I have been somewhat appalled at what some of our schools do not \nteach about the history of this great country of ours, about the \nfoundation for the self-governance we have, about the need for people, \nespecially young people, to participate in our democratic Republic. I \nfear that generations of Americans are growing up not being taught the \nfundamentals of our society, our Government, and our free-market system \nthat we were taught, and I think fairly well. People such as the \nPresiding Officer have helped to create wealth to create jobs, to help \nturn this country into the great economic engine it is. People in \npublic life have also helped Americans realize the stake they have in \nself-governing.\n\n  If we go a couple generations without teaching our children \naccurately and adequately in subjects from math and reading to history \nto government to economics and all the other subjects that students in \nthis complex world have to master, then we are not going to progress as \na nation and be the leading superpower and the leader of the world we \nare today, not just in economic terms but in terms of human rights, \ndemocratic principles, and other societal values, as well as the \ntechnological values I spoke of earlier.\n  If we get education right, we can flourish in all of these areas, and \nif we stay 19 out of 21 on these tests, then Americans are not going to \nbe as well educated and we will be overtaken by other nations.\n  Is it all bad we would be ``overtaken''? Not necessarily, if other \nnations are putting their productive capabilities into the same things \nthe United States has, but we have never won a war without turning over \nto the vanquished the territory we took.\n  We have led the world in foreign aid and assistance. We have led the \nworld in our insistence on human rights. In other words, America stands \nfor what is good on this Earth, and for us to continue to be the leader \nof the world to promote these values requires an educated citizenry, a \ncitizenry that will be educated and committed to these ideals, to these \npropositions.\n  We cannot sustain that kind of education with the system we have \ntoday. The scholarship tuition credits I am proposing with this \namendment will enable parents to allow their children to be educated in \nthe very best schools for those students and to enable them to escape \nthe kind of system we have today to one where each child can grow to \ntheir full potential. We must demand nothing less of our system.\n\n  The final point is, if children are able to take scholarship tuition \nmoney to the school of their choice, the school from which they left \nwill have a much greater incentive to improve than is the case today. \nWe are talking about improvement of all schools, not just a few.\n  This is an idea whose time has come, an idea we can support through a \ntax credit, through this bill before the Senate today. I hope even \nthough there may not be adequate support for this when we vote on it \ntonight because of the opening of the debate on the subject, we will be \nable to promote this idea in ways that will enable it to bear fruit in \nthe days and weeks to come. This is an amendment Congress needs to \npass. It is a tax credit the Federal Government needs to provide for an \neducational benefit that the children of the country need to have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  I appreciate the Senator's amendment. He seeks to help encourage \ncharitable giving for scholarships, a very worthy cause. Obviously, it \nis an idea that deserves to be debated and to be looked at carefully. \nUnfortunately, it falls outside the scope of the RELIEF act. I hope the \nSenator and I can work to have the Finance Committee consider a \ncharitable bill down the road.\n  Before I close, I thank the Senator for his good work on the Senate \nFinance Committee. He is a new member of the committee. The committee \nhas greatly benefited from his energy and ideas. The people of Arizona \nare fortunate to have his service on the Finance Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to my good friend from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I speak in opposition to the amendment very briefly. \nThe amendment of the Senator from Arizona is essentially a somewhat \nindirect way to provide Federal funding for private schools and \nparochial schools. That is exactly what is involved. It is a tax credit \nof $250 or up to $500 per couple which is available to any taxpayer who \nwants to contribute to one of these organizations that provide \nscholarships to people who go to schools and charge tuition. The \nschools that charge tuition are the private schools in this country, \nthe parochial schools. Many of them do an excellent job. Clearly, they \ncontribute a tremendous amount to our country.\n  We do not have the votes in the Senate, and I do not support direct \nappropriations to private and parochial schools. That has not been the \ntradition in our country. It is generally considered contrary to our \nConstitution. The Government has stayed out of the business of funding \nthe private elementary and secondary schools. What we are saying is we \nwill not appropriate money directly to those schools, but we will give \neach taxpayer a $250 credit if they will give that $250 to the private \nschool. That, to me, seems to be a pretty direct way of providing \nFederal support for private and parochial schools.\n  Private and parochial schools do a tremendous job in educating young \npeople. I support the continuation and the success of our private and \nparochial schools in the country. We have many in my home State that do \nan excellent job. But we have a limited amount of Federal tax dollars \nthat we can commit to education. We have had many votes in the Senate \nand we will have more tonight that try to ensure that adequate money is \navailable for public education in the country. I think while all \nMembers generally agree we are not providing enough funds for public \neducation, it would be foolhardy, at the same time we cannot afford to \nprovide what we want for public education, to turn around and say, OK, \nwe will not appropriate it directly to private education, but we will \ngive this tax credit to anyone who wants to contribute.\n  It is a dollar-for-dollar tax credit, not something where the Federal \nGovernment pays part of what someone contributes to the private school. \nThis is a tax credit where the Federal Government pays every single \ndollar that a person or couple contributes to the private school, up to \n$500 in the case of a couple. It is a very expensive proposal; $43 \nbillion is the estimate from the Joint Tax Committee. That is an \nexpensive commitment of funds. Frankly, it is one I would be willing to \nmake if the money was going to the public school system to strengthen \nour public schools. I think that would be a good investment of our \ndollars. I do not think it is smart when we are unable to make that \ncommitment of an additional $43 billion to the public schools to be \nturning around and saying we will go ahead and commit that amount of \nFederal expenditure for the private schools in this indirect way.\n  I hope my colleagues will see this is not good policy. This is not \nthe way in which to proceed. This is something which has some \nmeritorious motives behind it, but clearly we should be doing all we \ncan to strengthen our public school system. This is a way of \nessentially taking resources that might otherwise be available for the \npublic schools and diverting them into the private schools which I \nthink would be a mistake at this time in our history.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. For Senator Kyl, Mr. President, we will yield back his \nremaining time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The same is true for our side. We yield back the \nremainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). All time is now yielded back.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 713\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, let me describe briefly what this \namendment does. This is amendment deals with the estate tax. I have \nlistened intensely to the debate on the floor of the Senate. Much of \nthe debate on the estate tax has been about Senators' concerns with \nfamily farms and small businesses and with parents not being able to \npass on those enterprises to their children to operate.\n  I, too, am concerned about this issue and believe that the estate tax \nshould not interrupt the transfer of a family business to qualified \ndescendants who want to continue to operate the business. We should not \ndo that. A Main Street business in Ames, IA; or Butte, MT; or Regent, \nND; ought not suffer the death of an owner and then a crippling estate \ntax obligation that prevents the owner's children from being able to \ncontinue to run that business. We don't want the surviving children of \nthat family business to inherit both the business and a crippling \nestate tax debt.\n\n  I understand that problem. And I believe we should do something about \nit. That's why my legislation would exempt from the estate tax family-\nowned businesses that are passed on to qualified heirs who continue to \noperate those businesses. My amendment would do that by the year 2003. \nIf the family enterprise is passed on to the qualified heir or lineal \ndescendent, and it continues to be operated as outlined in my \nlegislation, it will be totally exempt from the estate tax. So the next \ntime I hear senators stand up and say that this is their goal, I will \nsay, if this is your goal, then vote for my amendment because the \nestate tax proposal now on the floor of the Senate doesn't do this \nuntil a long time down the road.\n  My proposal exempts all family-owned and operated businesses and \nfarms that are passed on to the next generation by 2003. End of \ndiscussion. It is done and done far more quickly than by the bill now \nbeing considered by the Senate.\n  My legislation also includes a $4 million unified estate tax credit \nthat will be available to everyone in 10 years, or $8 million for a \nhusband and wife. With respect to the estate tax, what I am saying is: \nYes, let's agree that we will exempt family businesses and family \nfarms. Yes, let's agree that we will increase the unified credit in the \nestate tax.\n  The only question that remains then is: Should we completely repeal \nthe estate tax? My answer is no. Should we repeal the estate tax for \nthose whose estates are worth more than $8 million? My answer is no. \nHere's why.\n  I have heard lots of discussion today about the so-called death tax. \nAnd all of us know--we have read the news stories--that the term \n``death tax'' was concocted by a pollster. They used focus groups and \nfound that their purposes were better served by calling this the death \ntax, not the estate tax. But, of course, dead people do not pay taxes. \nWe know that. Wealthy heirs pay taxes. Trust fund babies pay taxes.\n  The ancient Egyptians thought you could take it with you when you \ndied. There are some demonstrations of that when they discover and open \ntheir tombs these days. Has anyone here ever seen a hearse pulling a U-\nHaul trailer? I don't think so. You can't take it with you, and we \ndon't tax death. If we do, I would like my friend from Iowa and others \nto describe to me how a dead person shows up at the tax office to pay \nthat obligation.\n  Dead people are not paying taxes. Estates pay taxes, which means the \nwealthy heirs get less and the trust fund babies get less.\n  It seems to me, that if the point is you can either have a tax \nincident in death or life, and you decide not to tax death--if I accept \nthat moniker for a moment--then what is left? Then you tax life. What \nyou're saying is: Don't tax unearned income that flows to a benefactor \nthrough someone else's death. Rather, to pay for defense and all the \nother priorities in the country, tax the income earned by people that \ngo to work every day. Is that a choice that makes much sense? Not to me \nit isn't.\n  There are those who want to repeal the estate tax in its entirety, \nbut they have sold this repeal as a means of alleviating the problems \nof family farms and family businesses. They should disabuse themselves \nof that notion. I say let's repeal the estate tax for the transfer of \nfamily farms and family businesses. So that that problem is solved. And \nmy amendment does that almost immediately, and much more quickly than \nin the underlying bill.\n  Once that is out of the way, the question is: What is left over? \nThose who say we must completely repeal the estate tax, even above $8 \nmillion for a husband and wife, say it is a horrible thing to tax \nunearned wealth or large inheritances.\n  If it is such a terrible thing to tax unearned wealth, than what \nshould we tax? Should we have a tax system that promotes opportunities \nfor all? Or should we have a tax system that protects the privileges of \na very few? A substantial portion of the estate taxes actually paid are \non estates that have never been taxed. Close to 70 percent of their \nvalue has never been taxed.\n  I understand that there are some who feel very strongly there should \nnever\n\n[[Page S5218]]\n\nhave been or even be an estate tax. Let me just make a couple of \ncomments about that position.\n  Without the estate tax, it seems to me, you would have a world with \nan aristocracy of the wealthy, which means the ability to command \nresources would be based on heredity rather than merit. Some think that \nis all right. But let me quote Mr. Martin Rothenberg, President of \nGlottal Enterprises. He said it quite well, I think, as a business \nowner. He said:\n       My wealth is not only a product of my own hard work. It \n     also resulted from a strong economy and lots of public \n     investment in me and others. My success has allowed me to \n     provide well for my family, and upon my death. I hope taxes \n     on my estate will help fund the kind of programs that \n     benefitted me and others from humble backgrounds--a good \n     education, money for research and targeted investment in poor \n     communities--to help bring opportunity to all Americans.\n\n  Some would say they do not agree with that. That this is not what \nthis is all about. But it seems to me that we ought to make some \nchoices here. When we talk about repealing the estate tax and we \ndescribe it as a death tax, it is critically important to understand \nthat what we are about to do is antithetical to good tax policy. We \nought to, in my judgment, protect the transfer of family businesses \nfrom one generation to another by exempting them from the estate tax. I \nagree with that.\n  My amendment is the only legislation you will vote on that will do \nthat almost immediately, in 2003. And if you do not vote for this \namendment, 6 months or 1 year from now, or 2 years from now, do not \ncome to the floor of the Senate with Kleenex, dabbing tears, talking \nabout how difficult it is to transfer family businesses and family \nfarms to heirs because you voted against the amendment that would have \nmade it possible for them to not have to pay any estate tax at all.\n  This country has about one-half of the world's billionaires, or about \n309 billionaires in 1999. The wealthiest 400 Americans had $1.2 \ntrillion in estates. And I say good for them. This country is a country \nin which you can do well, where opportunity exists. This country has \ncreated opportunities in which those who work hard and are fortunate \ncan do very well. I would not want to live in a different kind of \ncountry. I want those opportunities to be available for all Americans.\n  But I also believe, when we look at who is going to pay the bills in \nthis country--and, incidentally, everyone in the Senate has spending \npriorities. This isn't a case of anyone not having them because \neveryone here has spending priorities. The most conservative Member of \nthe Senate who rails against Federal spending is likely going to be out \nhere saying we need much more money for defense spending. Do you buy \nbombers or milk? Do you buy military equipment or food for the hungry? \nEverybody here has their spending priorities--everybody.\n  The question is: How do you tax to pay for those spending priorities?\n  My colleague says that the estate tax ought to be completely \nrepealed. Again, using the moniker ``death tax,'' which is a pollster's \ncreation to describe this tax in some pejorative way, what I say is \nthis: My amendment says that the only estate tax that will be left in \nthis country is one for those whose estates are $8 million and above.\n  I also in my amendment propose reducing the estate tax rate, \nincreasing the unified credit as I indicated, and totally repealing the \nestate tax for the transfer of family businesses to qualified heirs who \ncontinue to operate those businesses. The only estate taxes that are \nleft then are for those whose assets are $8 million and above.\n\n  One can say: My priority is to come to the floor of the Senate and \nprotect those folks from the hand of taxation, even though almost two-\nthirds of that money has never been taxed. That's right, two-thirds of \nthe asset base from those estates will never, ever have been taxed. One \nmight come to the floor and say: My mission in life is to support those \nestates, those above $8 million--not those who have a family business--\nbut those worth more than $8 million.\n  Everybody has a right to stand on whose side they want to stand on. \nBut it seems to me that the reasonable thing to do is: If someone dies \nwith $6 or $8 billion in assets, to have a substantial exemption at the \nbottom, which my amendment will do, and then say to them, that the \nunearned income that is going to your heirs will be diminished some, by \nan estate tax, that will go into the hands of those who will redirect \nit to strengthen our school systems in this country, to invest in \nresearch and development, to invest in technology, and to make this a \nbetter country.\n  There are others who say that is not a priority at all. So be it. I \nhappen to think it is a priority. I think if you were to rank \npriorities with respect to the Tax Code, you should start right at the \nbottom, with those people who show up for work and make the minimum \nwage, with those who struggle at the bottom of the economic ladder to \ntry to make ends meet. They are struggling mightily to figure out how \nto pay their bills, making just the minimum wage.\n  There are not a lot of folks in the hallways here worrying about \nthose folks today. You bet your life there are not. There are not a lot \nof lobbyists worrying about the economic interests of those folks at \nthe bottom of the economic ladder. But you can bet your life there a \nlot of folks around this building that have invested a great deal of \ntime looking after the interests of those who have $10 million, $50 \nmillion, $1 billion, or $10 billion, and who want to avoid having to \npay an estate tax.\n  Before I conclude, I again say that I hope I will not hear somebody \nstand up and say that the case for repealing the estate tax is to stop \nthe interruption of the transfer of small businesses or family farms, \nbecause my legislation repeals the estate tax for all of those \ntransactions. When you are going to transfer a farm or a business from \none generation to another, and the heirs are going to continue to \noperate it, my amendment is the only proposal that repeals that tax in \nthis circumstance by 2003. It is the only.\n  So you can no longer sell the proposition of repealing the estate tax \nfor the largest estates in the country by putting it on the backs of \nfamily farms and family businesses. This is the only proposal that will \nrepeal it and will stop the interruption of the transfer of a family \nfarm or business to qualified heirs.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I probably should spend most of my time speaking \nagainst the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota, but I have \nalready spoken today on why I think the estate tax provisions in this \nbill ought to be maintained.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 674\n\n  I want to use my time to speak at this point on the first or, I guess \nnow, the second amendment that is going to be up for a vote at 6 \no'clock, the Carnahan-Daschle amendment.\n  I want my colleagues to understand exactly what this amendment does \nbecause I think it is one of the toughest amendments and one that may \nhave one of the closest votes today.\n  This amendment by Senator Carnahan guts the tax relief for individual \ntaxpayers by $87 billion. In effect, it increases taxes on families and \nworking people by $87 billion by denying them the tax cuts contained in \nour bipartisan tax bill.\n  Here is how the amendment works.\n  First, this amendment not only delays the reduction of the marginal \ntax rates; it provides for only a 1-point reduction in the marginal tax \nrates over a period of years compared to the 3-point reduction in the \nbipartisan plan Senator Baucus and I have put together.\n  This 1-point reduction equals the rate relief that our bipartisan tax \nplan provides in the first year alone. Our plan's additional tax cuts \nwould be eliminated entirely under the Carnahan-Daschle amendment.\n  I have a chart here that demonstrates this better. Their amendment \nallows only a 1-percent rate cut, which our bill implements next year. \nBut Senator Carnahan's amendment delays the rate cuts over 5 years. As \nyou can see from the bottom part of this chart, 1 point each year, but \nwith a different rate each year so that it takes 5 years.\n  The Carnahan-Daschle amendment would entirely eliminate the \nbipartisan bill's tax cuts for the years 2005 and 2007.\n\n[[Page S5219]]\n\n  Our plan reduces the 28-percent rate to 25 percent over 6 years. Our \namendment reduces the rate by 1 percentage point to 27 percent next \nyear.\n  Two years from now, the Carnahan-Daschle amendment would reduce the \n28-percent rate to 27 percent but would entirely stop there--no more \ntax cuts after that point for the 28-percent taxpayers.\n  Who is a 28-percent taxpayer? It would include any family with \ntaxable income over $45,200. Those families get the shaft under the \nCarnahan-Daschle amendment.\n  Our plan also would reduce the 31-percent rate to a 28-percent rate \nover 6 years, and would do it immediately 1 point next year.\n  Three years from now, the Carnahan-Daschle amendment would reduce the \n31 percent to 30 percent, but stop right there--no more tax cuts then \nfor the 31-percent taxpayer.\n  You can see from this chart, it is the same story over and over \nagain.\n  The Carnahan-Daschle amendment takes just the first year of tax cuts \nfrom our bipartisan bill and spreads them out over 5 years. And, of \ncourse, that is their idea of tax relief for American working men and \nwomen.\n  How do they justify this? How do they justify taking away $87 billion \nof tax relief from individual taxpayers? They rationalize it by \nreducing the 15-percent rate to 14 percent; that is all. They claim a \n1-percent reduction of one bracket justifies denying a 2-point further \nreduction in all other brackets.\n\n  Senators Carnahan and Daschle claim this 14-percent rate puts more \nbenefit to middle-income taxpayers. I doubt that. I will show you with \na little bit of math how there is reason to doubt that.\n  I would like to go back to the 28-percent taxpayer family; that is, \nany family with taxable income over $45,200. Senator Baucus has noted \nthat 75 percent of the benefits under the new 10-percent rate bracket \nin our bill go to taxpayers making less than $75,000. So I will use \nthat as a starting point.\n  Let's say we have a family with taxable income of $75,000. Under the \nCarnahan-Daschle amendment, the reduction of the 15-percent rate would \nsave them $452. Two years from now, the 28-percent rate would go to 27 \npercent, which would give another $298 back. Our bill would give them \nthe $298 not 2 years from now but right now.\n  So when their plan is fully implemented, this family will have a \ntotal tax cut of $750 under the Carnahan-Daschle amendment. When our \nbipartisan plan is fully implemented, this family will have tax savings \nof $894, which is $144 more than under the Carnahan-Daschle plan. That \nis because we reduce the 28-percent rate to 25 percent. Our plan \nprovides over 19 percent more in tax cuts for this family than does the \nCarnahan-Daschle amendment.\n  Senators Carnahan and Daschle justify their proposal because they \nclaim taxpayers in this 15-percent income bracket are shorted since our \nplan does not reduce the 15-percent rate. They claim that families \nearning between $12,000 and $45,000 will get no rate cut and no tax \nrelief. That is completely untrue.\n  The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation says that our bipartisan \nbill provides between 9 percent and 33 percent of relief for families \nmaking between $12,000 and $45,000. Taxpayers on the lower end of this \nrange receive the biggest percentage reduction, 33 percent; those on \nthe upper end receive the least, 9 percent.\n  Senators Carnahan and Daschle do not consider that our bipartisan \nplan targets other benefits to taxpayers in this income range.\n  They only look at the rate itself. So these benefits, including the \nchild care credit, the education incentives, the pensions, and the IRA \nprovisions, and various other tax relief measures in this bill, are yet \nfurther reductions for people at the 15-percent bracket, between \n$12,000 and $45,000.\n  The child credit is one example. The entire 15-percent bracket \nqualifies for it while it is phased out in higher brackets. For many \ncurrent 15-percent bracket families, the child credit will erase more \nthan 100 percent of their tax liability. The $3,000 expansion of the \nearned-income credit income thresholds will make more 15-percent \nbracket families qualify. Higher tax brackets will not qualify.\n  When fully phased in, a four-person, two-earner family earning \n$30,000 will see their tax bill change from a $346 liability to a \n$1,911 net refund under this bill, and that is a 652-percent swing.\n  You may wonder why we targeted these benefits instead of reducing the \n15-percent rate. Well, Senator Daschle made this point better than I \ncould when he spoke on the Senate floor last Thursday. This is the \nreason he identified in correctly pointing out that when you reduce the \ntax rate, the benefits of the rate reduction go to taxpayers in that \nrate bracket and to all other taxpayers in the higher rate brackets. \nThis is because taxpayers pass through the lower rate bracket on their \nway to the higher rate brackets. If you did a rate cut, it would cause \nour plan to favor upper income levels, for which I am sure Senator \nDaschle would severely criticize us. Our plan does not do that.\n  As this chart demonstrates, our bill makes the current tax system \neven more progressive than it is currently. In every one of these \nbrackets, under present law, people are paying a higher share than they \nwould under the new tax law, except for the highest income level of \n$200,000 and above. At that level, people at $200,000 and above are \ngoing to be paying a higher proportion of taxes than they do today. But \nfor every other income level, as a result of our legislation, people in \nthose income levels are going to be paying a lower share of taxes.\n  The Daschle-Carnahan proposal would actually make our tax system less \nprogressive by giving greater savings to upper income taxpayers as they \npass through the 14-percent bracket. When you are really serious about \nreducing the tax burden for people in the 15-percent income tax \nbracket, you target available resources to people at that income level. \nThat is exactly what our bipartisan bill does. It targets benefits to \nfamilies making between $12,000 and $45,000 and provides relief \nranging, then, from 9 percent at the $45,000 income to 33 percent at \nthe lower income.\n  That is better relief than Senator Carnahan's 1-percent rate \nreduction because taking a 15-percent rate to 14 percent is less than a \n7-percent reduction of the rate itself.\n  I don't want you to take my word for it. I don't take Senator \nDaschle's or Senator Carnahan's word for it, either. These are \nconclusions drawn by the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  Let's look at the choice before us. Our bipartisan bill provides 9 to \n33 percent of relief for 15-percent taxpayers. Our bill provides 19 \npercent more tax relief to middle-income taxpayers. Their amendment \nincreases individual income taxes by $87 billion based upon the false \nassumption that we have not cut the tax burden of the 15-percent \ntaxpayers.\n  This all seems to be a simple decision. If you want to provide \nmeaningful relief for all taxpayers, then you should vote to defeat the \nCarnahan-Daschle amendment. If you want to increase individual income \ntaxes by $87 billion based upon flawed analysis, then by all means vote \nfor the amendment of the opposition. Their amendment only reduces taxes \n1 percentage point. It provides a mere thimbleful of tax relief.\n\n  This amendment creates a smokescreen to try to fool middle-income \nAmericans into believing they are getting substantial tax relief when, \nin fact, it will increase their tax burden by billions.\n  I will also point out to my colleagues from the other side that the \nCarnahan-Daschle amendment is not the same amendment offered by Senator \nDaschle during the Finance Committee markup. That amendment would have \ncut all of the rates by 1 percent in 2002. The Carnahan-Daschle \namendment spreads the 1-percent cuts over 5 years, a very significant \ndifference.\n  I hope the Carnahan-Daschle amendment to withdraw $87 billion in tax \ncuts is not the crown jewel of the Democrats' tax proposal. I believe \nthe bipartisan bill put forth by our committee should be the high \nwatermark for both political parties.\n  I say to all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who \nsupported the budget resolution, a vote for the Carnahan-Daschle \namendment destroys our efforts to provide a $1.35 trillion tax cut. As \nyou know, the RELIEF Act\n\n[[Page S5220]]\n\nbefore us contains only individual income tax cuts. It is not larded in \nfavor of a lot of special interest legislation that sometimes is in tax \nbills. You cannot draft bipartisan legislation if you do that.\n  A vote to decrease the tax cuts in the RELIEF Act is a vote to \nincrease income taxes of individuals across America by $87 billion. \nObviously, I urge Members to vote to reject the Carnahan-Daschle \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, may I ask how much time remains on the \nDorgan amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor has 16\\1/2\\ minutes; the \nopposition has 15.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the chairman of the committee, Senator Grassley, and I \nworked very hard to come up with a bill that both of us could support. \nGiven all the dynamics that exist in this body and given the two-party \nsystem that we are operating under, it has not been easy.\n  During the process of coming to this agreement, the chairman has \ngiven a lot--I am sure he would like the top rate to be lowered a lot \nmore quickly, and I have given a lot as well. Despite how progressive \nit is, I would like this bill to be tilted more toward education, more \ntoward pension reform, more toward middle-income taxpayers.\n  Having said all that, I do believe the Senator from North Dakota has \na good amendment, and I support it. It is true that the people who need \nrelief most in this country under the estate tax are family farmers, \nranchers, and family businesses. That is where the estate tax really \nhurts. They are the people who need the support. His amendment directly \ngoes to the main issue before us; namely, helping families.\n  It is also an improvement compared with the current bill because the \ncurrent bill repeals the estate tax only in the last year. A lot of \nAmerican families can't wait ten years to pass on their businesses to \ntheir children.\n  Senator Dorgan's amendment does it. By offering his amendment, he \ndoes away with a very complicated carryover basis provision contained \nin this bill. We tried that in 1970. We enacted a carryover basis to \nthe heirs of property after estates had been distributed. It didn't \nwork. In fact, we repealed it. It was so complicated, it was a mess. By \nkeeping the current stepped-up basis--again, Mr. President, I \npersonally think he has a good amendment. It is not what we agreed to \nin committee. It is difficult to strike this balance between supporting \nmy good friend in the committee and the bill we came up with on the one \nhand, and the one issue on which I do believe the Senator from North \nDakota makes good sense.\n  This was the last issue Senator Grassley and I negotiated--the estate \ntax provisions. It is extremely complicated, difficult, with very high \npassions on both sides. I think a good resolution for all of us in the \nSenate, frankly, is to support the amendment by my friend from North \nDakota. In the final analysis, it improves the bill which more of us \ncould support.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask the Senator from Kentucky, does he reserve time on \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. BUNNING. On the bill itself, not the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are still in the period of offering \namendments. Under the unanimous consent agreement we don't get to \ngeneral discussion until 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I was told I should come over because this amendment was \ngoing to be offered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Let me ask my friend on the other side of the aisle, \nwould it be all right if he could have what time I had not used on the \nDorgan amendment?\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that the Senator from Iowa has about \n15 minutes; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Just under 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Kentucky is not going to offer an \namendment, just speak on the bill?\n  Mr. BUNNING. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will yield the rest of my time to the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I voice my support for H.R. 1836, the tax \nrelief bill.\n  The American people deserve a tax cut. We have not given them a \nmajor, across-the-board tax cut since 1981. Twenty years is too long to \nwait.\n  Americans are overtaxed. Personal tax payments have risen on average \nby 10.5 percent per year over the last five years, but, personal income \nhas risen by only 5.9 percent per year.\n  The tax burden as a percentage of GDP is the highest it has been \nsince World War Two.\n  This is absolutely ridiculous, especially when you consider our \nbudget surpluses.\n  This money belongs to the people and should be returned to them.\n  If we don't, it's just going to get frittered away here in \nWashington.\n  President Bush is correct. No American should pay more than a third \nof their income in Federal taxes.\n  This bill does not take us all the way there, but it is a step in the \nright direction.\n  This bill will also help eliminate the unfair marriage penalty. We \nhave penalized families for far too long.\n  I have never understood why the Federal government, through the tax \ncode, would penalize people for getting married.\n  We should be encouraging marriage, not creating disincentives for \nmarriage.\n  This bill will provide a deduction up to $3,000 for two-earned \nfamilies who file jointly.\n  In Kentucky, that is real money.\n  The bill will also help families by doubling the child tax credit.\n  This will be a welcome addition to families and ease their burden \njust a little bit.\n  As the grandfather of 35, I know this will help my nine children.\n  I also strongly support the estate tax relief this bill is providing.\n  For far too long, the children of American farmers and small business \nowners have labored under the burden of knowing that death could force \nthem to sell their assets to satisfy the IRS.\n  It is way past time to correct this.\n  There is no good reason to tax individuals at death or to make this \nsad time a taxable event.\n  But we need a tax cut not just for of fairness reasons, but also for \neconomic reasons.\n  We need tax relief to stimulate our economy. As my colleagues know, \nunemployment has been increasing, and economic growth has been \nslipping.\n  The Federal reserve, through way too late in my opinion, has been \nusing monetary policy to help stimulate the economy. But monetary \npolicy itself is not the answer.\n  We need a strong fiscal policy solution as well.\n  We need an immediate decrease in withholding taxes to put more money \nin the pockets of consumers.\n  We can do much better and the stimulus effect will be much more \npronounced by putting more money in the hands of Americans immediately.\n  We need to get people to start buying again.\n  We need to give tax relief to our nation's small businesses so they \ncan start reinvesting again.\n  This bill will bring much needed relief to small businesses, which \nare the backbone of our economy.\n  Small businesses create jobs. We need to help them innovate by \nrelieving their tax burdens.\n  In a perfect world this is not the bill I would have written. I \nbelieve that we can give more relief to our small businesses. I think \nthe rates need to be cut more. And I'd like to see faster death tax and \nmarriage penalty relief.\n  There are some provisions in this bill which, while they have great \nmerit, are not the priorities I would have chosen.\n  But, obviously, this is not a perfect world.\n  I believe that chairman Grassley and the Finance Committee have done \nan outstanding job under very difficult circumstances.\n  I think it says a lot about chairman Grassley and the committee as a \nwhole that they were able to move such a major piece of legislation, so \nquickly, in such a bipartisan fashion.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to support this tax relief \nbill.\n\n[[Page S5221]]\n\n  It is not perfect, but it will bring much needed relief to all \nAmericans who pay income taxes, and even some who don't.\n  It will also help stimulate our economy, and help bring us out of \nthis economic funk we are in.\n  Time time for tax relief has long passed. Please support our \nPresident and vote for H.R. 1836.\n  Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time is remaining on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 11 minutes 44 seconds on the \nSenator's side; 8\\1/2\\ minutes remain on the other side.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa yielded his \nremaining time. Was the time not used by the Senator from Kentucky?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was not all used.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Was it reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was reserved.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me try to describe where we agree and \nwhere we disagree on this issue of the estate tax. We agree that the \nestate tax ought to be repealed for family businesses that are \ntransferred to qualified heirs who want to continue to operate the \nfamily business.\n  We do not believe that family business ought to be interrupted by an \nestate tax. So we agree on that.\n  The difference is when to do it. My amendment will totally repeal the \nestate tax obligation for the transfer of family businesses in 2003. \nThe bill that is before the Senate will do it in 2011. The most \nimportant part of their bill is effective, as they describe it, in \n2011. Mine is effective in 2003. That is a big difference.\n  We agree that the rates should go down to 45 percent. My amendment \ntakes the rate to 45 percent. The underlying bill does, too. We agree \nthat the unified credit should go up to $4 million. My amendment does \nthat, and the underlying bill does as well.\n  The difference is, those who oppose my amendment are saying they want \nto fight for additional estate tax exemptions and/or repeal for all \nestates above $8 million. That is the difference. Those who do not \nsupport this amendment are saying: We insist on an estate tax repeal \nfor those estates over $8 million in value. They say the largest \nestates in this country need to have their tax burdens eased.\n  I ask this question: Why would someone in the Senate support taxing \nthe income of middle-income Americans who work for their money but then \noppose taxing the income, in fact the largely unearned income, of those \nwho inherit more than $8 million a year? It seems to me to be a rather \nstrange set of priorities.\n  We are having this debate about the estate tax that we will vote on \nthis evening. Those who have spoken at great length in this Chamber, I \nmight say, of wanting to protect a family farm or a small business, in \nmy judgment, cannot with a straight face vote against this amendment \nand then go back home and say: I was supporting you, Main Street \nbusiness, or I was supporting you, farmer or rancher, because this is \nthe only amendment that, in the year 2003, will repeal the estate tax \non the transfer of family businesses to qualified heirs. It is the only \nopportunity to do that.\n  The underlying bill will only do it in the year 2011, 10 years from \nnow, the sweet by-and-by as Reverend Ike used to describe it.\n  I ask for some support for this amendment. I hope those who have \ntalked at such great length about this subject will now have the \nopportunity and feel the obligation to vote for an amendment that does \nwhat they claim they want to be done.\n  I will speak for a moment more generally on this bill. There is not \nany question that there is room for a tax cut in this country. We have \na budget surplus. It is also the case that we do not know what is going \nto happen in 6, 8, and 10 years, and we ought to be conservative and \ncautious about what we commit to in terms of fiscal policy 6, 8, and 10 \nyears from now.\n  About 20 years ago, a very large tax cut was enacted by this Congress \nand, as a result of a very substantial tax cut and a doubling of the \ndefense budget, this country sailed into some pretty tough economic \nwaters.\n  Those rough waters caused very significant and deep Federal budget \ndeficits that nearly choked this country's budget. It meant a \ndifference in everything we did. It meant a difference in how much we \nhad available to invest in our children, invest in education, invest in \nchild care, yes, invest in a range of things that are important to make \nthis a better life, invest especially in infrastructure--roads, school \nbuildings, and so many other things that are important. It made a big \ndifference in our ability to deal with those issues.\n  We struggled and struggled and, in 1993, we turned this fiscal policy \naround. We did it by one vote, one single vote in the Senate and one \nvote in the House of Representatives.\n  I remember those who stood and opposed it and said: You are going to \nwreck this country's economy. That is when we had a $290 billion annual \ndeficit. They said: You are going to wreck this economy. This economy \nwas headed in the wrong direction in a hurry. By one vote we supported \na change in fiscal policy and turned this economy around. We went from \nthe largest deficits in history to now a budget that is in surplus and \ngives us the opportunity to return some of that surplus to the American \npeople. And, yes, we should do that.\n  No one should call themselves, in my judgment, a conservative who \ncomes to this Chamber and says they know what is going to happen to \nthis economy 6, 8, 10 years out and, therefore, put in place a fiscal \npolicy that could, if our economy turns sour, run this country right \nback into big deficits once again.\n  That is not a conservative approach. A far better approach, in my \njudgment, would be to be somewhat cautious. Yes, provide a tax cut, but \ndo it in a manner that is fair, do it in a way that helps American \nworking families, stimulates the economy, and gives some money back to \nfamilies who could sure use it.\n  This is not the time, in my judgment, to put in place a tax cut of \nwell over $1.3 trillion but when the costs are really added up may well \nbe over $2 trillion in the coming 10 years. It leaves no margin for \nerror if this economy should turn soft.\n  It is almost zero gravity politically to be talking about tax cuts. \nThose who say their main mission in life is to cut the revenue stream \nof the Federal Government--that is not a controversial proposal I \nexpect back home. It is almost a certain way for one to be popular with \none's constituents to say they support the largest possible tax cut for \nas long as is possible.\n  But there is another element to this. We should support a tax cut \nthat is fair to all Americans, No. 1, and No. 2, we ought to have \nenough revenue left to reduce the Federal debt, which stands at $5.6 \ntrillion and which after this fiscal policy plays itself out will stand \nat $6.7 trillion.\n  This fiscal policy and the budget passed by this Congress, coupled \nwith this tax cut, will increase Federal indebtedness by $1.1 trillion. \nThink of that.\n  Second, there ought to be enough left to make sure we have the \ninvestment necessary to improve our country's schools, to provide the \nresearch in health and welfare and other issues we have to deal with in \nthis country, and to make this country a place in which all of us can \nlead better lives.\n  I know the Senator from New Mexico is waiting to speak. May I ask how \nmuch time remains on my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes 7 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I was asked by \nthe Senator from Iowa to protect the floor on his behalf in his \nabsence. I will certainly do that. It was my understanding that he no \nlonger wished to speak on this amendment. If he returns and desires to \nspeak, we will restore that time. In the meantime we can get to another \namendment.\n  I was told that if I allowed Senator Bunning to go forward, Senator \nSpecter was not going to offer his amendment and Senator Bingaman, who \nis next in order, could offer his. Does that make sense?\n  On behalf of the Senator from Iowa----\n\n[[Page S5222]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Iowa comes back and wants \nto claim his time, he will be so allowed.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf the Senator of Iowa, I yield back his time with \nthe understanding that if there is a misunderstanding, he can have back \nhis time.\n  Does the Senator from North Dakota yield back his 4 minutes?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I do so with the understanding that if the other side \nreclaims its time, I be restored the 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the 6 hours will run \nout at approximately 20 to 4. At that time, I alert the majority that I \nwill propound a unanimous consent request to use the 20 minutes, with \nboth sides having that in 5-minute increments, until 4 o'clock. I do \nnot propound that at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 717\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to offer an amendment, amendment \nNo. 717. It is an amendment related to our energy policy. Its purpose, \nas provided in the amendment, is to provide energy conservation and \nproduction tax incentives.\n  Let me briefly describe the amendment and the reasons I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment when we do get the opportunity to \nvote on it later this evening.\n  Last Thursday, President Bush unveiled his national energy policy. I \nhave a copy. There is a lot in this national energy policy upon which I \nthink all Members can agree. There are proposals that will increase \nproduction; there are proposals that encourage conservation; there are \nproposals that will try to stimulate more innovation in technology to \nbetter capture energy and use energy in the future.\n  I commend the President for the initiative he has shown. Obviously, \nthere are provisions in this national energy policy that are going to \nbe very controversial and that I will not support. We will have ample \nopportunity over the next weeks and months to discuss those and debate \nthem and deliberate on them and vote on them.\n  Members may wonder why I am talking about energy on a tax bill. This \nis supposed to be a bill to cut taxes. Why bring up the subject of \nenergy? The reason I bring energy up is that the President himself, \nlast Thursday, proposed a whole series of incentives to meet our energy \nchallenges. These are tax incentives, reductions in people's taxes, if \nthey will agree to take certain actions that will then help our country \nto meet the challenges we face in the energy area.\n  I introduced a bill earlier this year that also contains many tax \nincentives that we believe will move the country toward a more \nenlightened energy policy. Senator Murkowski, the chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, on which I am the ranking \nmember, introduced a bill early this year containing many tax incentive \nprovisions. There is a great deal of commonality between the bill \nSenator Murkowski introduced, the ones I introduced, and the ones the \nPresident's national energy policy embraces.\n  We have an issue where there is substantial consensus. The question \nis, Why talk about it on this tax bill? Let me explain the context in \nwhich we come to the debate on the tax bill. We are talking about this \ntax bill because we passed a budget resolution in the Senate which set \naside $1.35 trillion over the next 10 years and directed the Finance \nCommittee in the Senate to put together a tax bill that would use up \nthat $1.35 trillion.\n  The tax bill we are talking about today, that we are debating and \nthat we will vote on later tonight, does exactly what the budget \nresolution told the Finance Committee to do. That is, it uses up all of \nthat $1.35 trillion. There is no more after that. After that, according \nto the budget resolution, we should not be passing additional tax bills \nunder this budget resolution.\n  I very much believe if we are going to take the recommendations of \nthe President, if we are going to move in the area of energy policy to \nprovide tax incentives for the actions we believe people ought to take, \nthen we need to adopt the amendment I am offering, this energy \namendment, and in that way use some of the tax revenue we are proposing \nto eliminate in the tax cut legislation to provide these incentives.\n  Let me go through a description of what is in the amendment. The \namendment tries to speed up the investment in our Nation's energy \ninfrastructure, speed up the investment in high-efficiency equipment in \nall parts of our economy. As I indicated before, the provisions we have \nin this amendment I believe all have good bipartisan support. They are \nnothing that I claim authorship of because many are included in what \nthe President has recommended and many are included in what Senator \nMurkowski recommended.\n\n  One large category of these incentives is the investment in \ninfrastructure and highly efficient end use and in generating \nequipment. For example, one provision shortens the depreciation \nschedule for transmission lines and natural gas pipelines. We have \nheard a lot of testimony already in the Energy Committee that we need \nto move ahead more quickly with building of transmission lines, \nbuilding of additional pipelines. This will help.\n  There is a provision for incentives to push ultra-high-efficient \nappliances and equipment in the marketplace and provide incentives for \npeople to purchase these appliances and equipment.\n  It provides incentives for constructing and upgrading homes and \nupgrading and constructing commercial buildings that are energy \nefficient, something we all agree ought to be done.\n  It provides incentives for upgrading and building the cleanest, \nlowest emission coal-fired generation.\n  It provides incentives for purchase of high-efficiency hybrid \nvehicles. This is an initiative I have heard a lot of people talk about \nin this Chamber. We recognize we would be better off as a country; we \nwould import less oil, if we would drive more fuel efficient vehicles. \nOne way to persuade Americans to drive more fuel efficient vehicles is \nto give them a tax incentive so when they buy a hybrid vehicle with an \nengine that gets 60 or 70 miles per gallon, it will be cheaper for them \nbecause of the tax incentive we provide.\n  The amendment I will propose today extends the renewable production \ncredit to include a whole range of items: Steel, cogeneration, \ngeothermal, landfill methane, incremental hydropower. It provides a 7-\nyear depreciation schedule for distributed generation facilities. There \nare a whole range of provisions that are generally agreed by experts to \nmake sense. We also provide incentives for investment in sophisticated \nreal-time metering, electronic load management, so consumers can better \ncontrol energy use and costs. All of these are provisions that I think \nwill have broad bipartisan support and do have broad bipartisan \nsupport.\n  What I am urging is that we use up the revenue that has been made \navailable through the budget resolution for tax cuts; we do some of \nthese things in the energy area that the President himself last \nThursday said he believes we ought to do. It would be irresponsible to \npass a large tax cut, cutting rates, eliminating the estate tax, doing \na variety of things, without any consideration of the needs we have as \na country to move toward a more enlightened energy policy. This \namendment tries to ensure we do the right thing.\n  What I proposed as an offset is slowing down the phasing in of the \ncuts in the marginal tax rates, the top marginal tax rates. That seems \na reasonable way to pay for the cost of this amendment. It is something \nwhich I strongly believe would be a good procedure.\n  Let me make one more general point. I think a reason it is important \nto raise this issue now is that a lot of people are being misled into \nbelieving there is no limit to the number of tax bills we can pass--\nthat we can pass this for $1.35 trillion and then we can come\n\n[[Page S5223]]\n\nback later and pass another one that deals with extending the \nalternative minimum tax exemption; we can pass another that does the \ntraditional extenders; we can pass a whole variety of bills.\n  I was reading on the Associated Press wire published through the \nAlbuquerque Journal on the Web site before I came over today. The title \nof the article I thought was very interesting: ``O'Neill: Further tax \nrelief coming.'' It had a picture of Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill in \na speech he gave today where he said the administration viewed this as \nonly the first tax bill, not the last. He also goes on to say in the \nfuture they want to accelerate the tax relief under the estate tax. \nThat is another tax bill they anticipate.\n  It also referred to the fact that in the newspaper interview he \nindicated they would push for repeal of the Federal corporate income \ntax. That is not a cut in the Federal corporate income tax; that is \nelimination of the corporate income tax.\n  The third he mentioned was a Federal tax on capital gains that should \nbe eliminated.\n  Mr. President, I am told before I yield the floor I need to call up \nmy amendment. Let me do that at this time. I ask the amendment be \nconsidered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 717.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted and Proposed''.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield time to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico is the ranking \nDemocrat on the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. I am the \nranking Democrat on the Committee on Environment and Public Works. We \nworked very closely together this year and, rather than my offering a \nseparate amendment, we have joined in this amendment.\n  This is a very good amendment. I hope this body will support this \namendment. That which I am most concerned about in his amendment deals \nwith renewable energy.\n  We are all aware that the current energy crisis in California has \ndemonstrated that America must increase its supply of electricity and \ndecrease its demand.\n  Ensuring that the lights and heat or air conditioning stay on is \nabsolutely critical to sustaining America's economic growth and \nAmericans' quality of life. Already in Nevada electricity and natural \ngas prices have skyrocketed in recent months.\n  These increases are especially hard on working families who are \nalready struggling to make ends meet. The impacts of high energy bills \nhits minority groups hardest.\n  The citizens of Nevada, and of the nation, demand a national energy \nstrategy to ensure their economic well being and security, and to \nprovide for the quality of life they deserve.\n  Nevadans understand that an energy strategy must encompass \nconservation, efficiency, and expanded generating capacity.\n  Renewable energy is poised to make major contributions to our \nNation's energy needs over the next decade.\n  I have offered with Senator Bingaman as a lead, a good amendment. I \nhave offered an amendment which expands the existing production tax \ncredit for renewable energy technologies to cover all renewable energy \ntechnologies, increases the credit from 1.5 to 1.8 cents, and makes the \ncredit permanent.\n  This amendment expands the credit to include wind, animal and poultry \nwaste, closed- and open loop biomass, incremental hydropower, municipal \nsolid waste, geothermal energy, landfill gas, and steel cogeneration.\n  Recognizing that coal provides 50 percent of the nation's electricity \nsupply, this amendment also provides for a 1.0 cent production tax \ncredit for co-firing coal power plants with biomass, since co-firing \ncan significantly reduce emissions.\n  Our nation has a promising potential of renewable energy sources.\n  Wind power is the fastest growing source of electricity in the world. \nPrices have dropped 90 percent since 1980. At the Nevada Test Site, a \nnew wind farm will provide 260 megawatts to meet the needs of 260,000 \npeople--more than 10 percent of Nevada's population within 5 years.\n  Nevada is sometimes referred to as the ``Saudi Arabia of Geothermal \nEnergy.'' Our state has already developed 230 Megawatts of geothermal \npower, with a longer-term potential of more than 2,500 Megawatts, \nenough capacity to meet half the state's present energy needs.\n  The Department of Energy has estimated that we could increase our \ngeneration of geothermal energy almost ten fold, supplying ten percent \nof the energy needs of the West, and expand wind energy production to \nserve the electricity needs of ten million homes.\n  As fantastic as it sounds, enough sunlight falls on an area measuring \n100 miles by 100 miles in southern Nevada that--if covered with solar \npanels--could power the entire nation. Obviously, covering this area of \nNevada with solar panels is not a practical answer to our current \nenergy challenges. However, the example does make one very practical \npoint: our nation does not lack for renewable energy potential.\n  In addition, we need a permanent credit to provide business certainty \nand signal America's long-term commitment to renewable energy \nresources.\n  To illustrate the need for a permanent tax credit, I recently learned \nthat the wind farm project in Nevada is now experiencing delays in \nsecuring loans from banks due to the uncertain nature of the production \ntax credit for wind energy. Without a permanent credit, we can't \nprovide the business certainty for utilities to invest in renewable \nenergy resources. This we must do.\n  This amendment allows for co-production credits to encourage blending \nof renewable energy with traditional fuels and provides an additional \n0.25-cent credit for renewable facilities on native American and native \nAlaskan lands.\n  Finally, my amendment provides a production incentive to tax exempt \nenergy production facilities like public power utilities by allowing \nthem to transfer their credits to taxable entities.\n  Growing renewable energy industries in the U.S. will also help \nprovide growing employment opportunities in the U.S., and help U.S. \nrenewable technologies compete in world markets.\n  In states such as Nevada, expanded renewable energy production will \nprovide jobs in rural areas--areas that have been largely left out of \nAmerica's recent economic growth.\n  Renewable energy--as an alternative to traditional energy sources--is \na common sense way to ensure the American people have a reliable source \nof power at an affordable price.\n  The United States needs to move away from its dependence on fossils \nfuels that pollute the environment and undermine our national security \ninterests and balance of trade.\n  We need to agree to this amendment to send the signal to utilities \nthat we are committed in the long term to the growth of renewable \nenergy. We must accept this commitment for the energy security of the \nU.S., for the protection of our environment, and for the health of the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I have already expressed my \nopposition, in general, to the tax reconciliation bill the Senate is \ncurrently considering. But I want to take a moment, while Senator \nBingaman's amendment is pending before us, to highlight a provision in \nthat amendment which I believe can play a significant role in \naddressing our Nation's current energy problems. This provision is \nmodeled after a bill I cosponsored, S. 217, the Commuter Benefits \nEquity Act, and represents an important step forward in our efforts to \nfight pollution and congestion by supporting public transportation.\n\n[[Page S5224]]\n\n  The Internal Revenue Code currently allows employers to provide a \ntax-free transit benefit to their employees of up to $65 per month to \npay for the cost of commuting by public transportation or vanpool. This \nprogram is designed to encourage Americans to leave their cars behind \nwhen commuting to work.\n  However, despite the success of this program in taking cars off the \nroad, our tax laws still reflect a bias toward driving. The Internal \nRevenue Code allows employers to offer a tax-free parking benefit to \ntheir employees of up to $180 per month. The striking disparity between \nthe amount allowed for parking, $180 per month, and the amount allowed \nfor transit, $65 per month, undermines our commitment to supporting \npublic transportation use. The pending amendment would address this \ndiscrepancy by raising the maximum monthly transit benefit to equal the \nparking benefit.\n  I believe the potential of mass transit to help address our Nation's \ncurrent energy crunch has been consistently overlooked. With gas prices \nsoaring and congestion increasing, public transit offers one of the \nbest solutions to America's growing pains. I am pleased that this \nmeasure has been included in this package of energy-related tax \nprovisions, because I believe support for mass transit should be a \ncomponent of any energy package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired on this \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the 6 hours is now \ngone or about to be gone; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 16 minutes on the Republican side of \nthe aisle and no time remaining----\n  Mr. REID. On this amendment of the Senator from New Mexico?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, also with regard to all \namendments.\n  Mr. REID. I would like to know if anyone wishes to speak against the \namendment of the Senator from New Mexico. If there is no one who wishes \nto speak, I know there is at least one Senator who is next in order to \noffer an amendment, the Senator from Arizona. I understand the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire wished to speak generally on the bill for about 3 \nminutes or to offer an amendment.\n  If there is someone who has authority to yield back the time, we \ncould get to these amendments. Otherwise, I don't know how we can get \nto the amendments.\n  Could the Senator on behalf of Senator Grassley yield back the time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. On behalf of Senator Grassley and his capable staff, who \nwill take the responsibility if this is wrong, I yield back the \nremaining time on this side.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator proceeds, we have now less than 20 \nminutes before 4 o'clock. It will be my suggestion the two Senators who \nwish to offer amendments be recognized for up to 5 minutes each. Then \nit will be the turn of the Democrats to offer an amendment, and then it \nwill be again the Republican's turn. Does that sound reasonable?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have to temporarily object because Senator Grassley \nwould have to be asked. I would like to go ahead with my amendment. He \nwill be back shortly.\n  Mr. REID. I have no objection to the Senator from Arizona offering \nhis amendment but with a limit of 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have an amendment and motion to recommit. Will you give \nme 7 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to 7 minutes? The Chair \nhears none, and it is so ordered. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 660\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk numbered \n660. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 660.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To limit the reduction in the 39.6 percent rate bracket to 1 \npercentage point and to increase the maximum taxable income subject to \n                          the 15 percent rate)\n\n       On page 9, in the matter between lines 11 and 12, strike \n     ``37.6%'' in the item relating to 2005 and 2006 and insert \n     ``38.6%'' and strike ``36%'' in the item relating to 2007 and \n     thereafter and insert ``38.6%''.\n       On page 13, between lines 15 and 16, insert:\n\n     SEC. 104.

Mr. President, the principle that guides my judgement of \na tax reconciliation bill is tax relief for those who need it the \nmost--lower- and middle-income working families. I am in favor of a tax \ncut, but a responsible one that provides significant tax relief for \nlower- and middle-income families. And I commend Senator Grassley for \nmoving in that direction. But I am concerned that debt will overwhelm \nmany American households. That is why tax relief should be targeted to \nmiddle-income Americans. The more fortunate among us have less concern \nabout debt. It is the parents struggling to make ends meet who are most \nin need of tax relief.\n  I had expressed hope that when the reconciliation bill was reported \nout of the Senate Finance Committee, the tax cuts outlined would \nprovide more tax relief to working, middle-income Americans. However, I \nam disappointed that the Senate Finance Committee preferred instead to \ncut the top tax rate of 39.6 percent to 36 percent thereby granting \ngenerous tax relief to the wealthiest individuals of our country at the \nexpense of lower- and middle-income American taxpayers.\n  This amendment would, instead, cut the top tax rate for the \nwealthiest individuals from 39.6 percent to 38.6 percent and devote the \nresulting savings that would have gone to this group to lower- and \nmiddle-income taxpayers by increasing the number of individuals who pay \nthe 15 percent tax rate. When it is finally phased in, this amendment \ncould place millions of taxpayers now in the 28 percent tax bracket \ninto the 15 percent tax bracket. This amendment targets tax relief to \nthe individuals who feel the tax squeeze the most: lower- and middle-\nincome taxpayers. Under this amendment, unmarried individuals can make \nnearly $30,000 and married individuals can make $50,000, and still be \nin the 15 percent tax bracket.\n  Mr. President, this is a modest amendment. I would have preferred \nthat we be able to have a larger increase in the number of taxpayers in \nthe 15 percent bracket, but given the constraints of the modest savings \nfrom cutting the top rate by only 1 percent, this will have to do for \nnow. But it is an important first step towards further reform.\n  I support this amendment because it helps ordinary middle-class \nfamilies who are struggling to make ends meet\n\n[[Page S5225]]\n\nand it promotes future economic prosperity by increasing the amount of \nmoney taxpayers have available for their own saving and investment.\n  We must provide American families with relief from the excessive rate \nof taxation that saps job growth and robs them of the opportunity to \nprovide for their needs and save for the future. This amendment would \ndeliver tax relief to more middle-class taxpayers by increasing the \nnumber of individuals who pay the 15 percent tax rate.\n  This amendment results in millions of taxpayers being able to keep \nmore of the money they earn. This extra income will allow individuals \nto save and invest more. Increased savings and investment are key to \nsustaining our current economic growth.\n  In sum, the measure is a win for individuals, and a win for America \nas a whole. Therefore, Mr. President, on behalf of the millions of \nAmericans in need of relief from over-taxation, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  This amendment targets tax relief to the individuals who feel the tax \nsqueeze the most: lower and middle-income taxpayers. Under this \namendment, unmarried individuals can make nearly $30,000 and married \nindividuals can earn up to $50,000 and still be in the 15-percent tax \nbracket.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I send a motion to commit with instructions on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Conrad, and Senator Levin to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe laid aside and the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Conrad, and Mr. Levin, moves that the Act, H.R. 1836, as \n     amended, be committed to the Senate Finance Committee with \n     instructions to report back forthwith.\n\n  The motion is as follows:\n       (1) strike any reduction in the top 2 income tax rates, and \n     it shall not be in order for the Committee or the Senate to \n     consider any such reductions--\n       (A) until the President has submitted a comprehensive \n     defense budget amendment to the Congress; and\n       (B) until the Congressional Budget Office has submitted to \n     the Committees on Budget, Appropriations, and Armed Services \n     a re-estimate of the budget authority and outlays necessary \n     to implement the policies proposed by the President in such \n     budget amendment through fiscal year 2011; and\n       (2) any other bill reported by the Committee containing \n     reductions in the 2 top income tax rates--\n       (A) shall be considered as a reconciliation bill in \n     accordance with the Budget Act; and\n       (B) shall provide that any such reductions to the 2 top \n     income tax rates reflect any adjustment necessary to \n     accommodate the additional outlays estimated by the \n     Congressional Budget Office under paragraph (1)(B) of this \n     motion to be necessary to fund the President's defense budget \n     amendment and to ensure that such outlays, taken in \n     combination with the revenue impact of the income tax rate \n     reduction bill, do not reduce the Federal budget surplus in \n     any year below the levels necessary to preserve the estimated \n     surplus under current law in either the Medicare Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund or the Social Security Trust Fund.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, without knowing what the administration \nintends to spend on our national defense, it is difficult for me to \nsupport the Budget Reconciliation bill. In the wake of large tax cuts, \nnon-defense spending initiatives, and uncertain surplus projections, we \ncannot be sure how much money will remain to fund such defense \npriorities as National Missile Defense, force modernization, spare \nparts, flight hours, overdue facility maintenance, training programs, \nand the care of our service members.\n  My motion would ensure that those funds needed for these critical \ndefense priorities are available, especially in light of an article \nfrom today's Defense Week, which I will include in the Record, that \nsuggests the so-called reserve fund for defense may be much smaller \nthan predicted for the next ten years.\n  Mr. President, we have the world's finest military, but that is \nprincipally because of the fine people in the military who continue to \ndo more with less. Our ability to field credible front-line forces is \ndue to the efforts of our servicemembers, as we live off of the \nremnants of the Reagan military buildup. That may be difficult to \nadmit, unless you have reviewed the list of aircraft, ships, artillery, \nand tanks in our current weapons inventory, and recognized the extent \nof this problem.\n  Anyone who dismisses our military forces' serious readiness problems, \nconcerns with morale and personnel retention, and deficiencies in \neverything from spare parts to training, is either willfully uninformed \nor just not ready to face reality. Highly skilled service men and \nwomen, who have made ours the best fighting force the world, have been \nleaving in droves--unlikely to be replaced in the near future. The \nreason for deciding to leave the service is simple; if one is \noverworked, underpaid, and away from home more and more often, why \nstay? Potential recruits say why join? Failure to fully and quickly \naddress our readiness problem will be more damaging to both the near \nand long-term health of our all-volunteer force than we can imagine.\n  The cure for our defense decline will be neither quick nor cheap. We \nshould not only shore up the services' immediate needs, but also should \naddress the modernization and personnel problems caused by years of \nchronic under-funding.\n  The administration must take several important steps: propose \nrealistic budget requests; specifically budget for ongoing contingency \noperations; provide adequately for modernization; ensure equipment and \nbase operations maintenance is adequately funded; and resolve the wide \npay and benefits disparity between the military and civilian sector. In \nturn, civilian and uniformed leadership must be willing to break from \nservice parochialism and institutional affinities for ``cold war'' \nlegacy weapons systems and funding priorities.\n  Recently, I voted in favor of the Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year \n2002 in the interest of moving the budget process forward. But I did so \nin the hope that the Reconciliation bill would address many of the \nreservations I had about the priorities and assumptions contained in \nthe resolution.\n  My chief concern was that the Reconciliation bill should explicitly \nprovide sufficient resources for our national security. Our military \nservices have been neglected for too many years. But with appropriate \nincreases and money freed up from eliminating waste and inefficiency in \nthe defense budget, we can make progress toward restoring the morale \nand readiness of our Armed Forces.\n  Currently, the administration is conducting a defense review. My \nmotion would ensure that the reconciliation bill before us provides not \nonly the resources for these overdue reforms, but also funds to \nsubstantially strengthen air, sea, and land forces in the near term.\n  Today in Defense Week there is a very interesting article entitled \n``Federal Spending Blueprint Limits Defense Dollars'':\n\n       Congress has set aside so much of the $5.6 trillion budget \n     surplus--for a tax cut, Social Security, Medicare and more--\n     that just $12 billion in outlays is left for fiscal 2002 \n     spending increases across the federal government, according \n     to officials and documents. . . .\n       The annual budget reserve figures have not been previously \n     disclosed. They demonstrate the limits within which military \n     programs must compete against other priorities. These \n     constraints are tighter than is widely known. While a chorus \n     of voices have advocated increasing the Pentagon budget by up \n     to $100 billion a year, the new figures show how difficult \n     even a fraction of that increase will be to attain.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from Defense \nWeek be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Defense Week, May 21, 2001]\n\n           Federal Spending Blueprint Limits Defense Dollars\n\n                         (By John M. Donnelly)\n\n       Congress has set aside so much of the $5.6 trillion budget \n     surplue--for a tax cut, Social Security, Medicare and more--\n     that just $12 billion in outlays is left for fiscal 2002 \n     spending increases across the federal government, according \n     to officials and documents.\n       The relatively small pot of money for budget boosts sets \n     tight limits on the resources available for Defense Secretary \n     Donald Rumsfeld's emerging plans for the military.\n       In the budget resolution that Congress passed earlier this \n     month, lawmakers pencilled in plans for the massive surplus \n     that largely ignore the Pentagon. All told, $504 billion of \n     the $5.6 trillion surplus is reserved for any spending, \n     defense or otherwise, above what's currently planned in \n     federal budgets. But in not one of the next five fiscal years\n\n[[Page S5226]]\n\n     does the amount in the reserve exceed $20 billion in outlays, \n     said William Hoagland, majority staff director of the Senate \n     Budget Committee, in an interview.\n       The annual budget reserve figures have not been previously \n     disclosed. They demonstrate the limits within which military \n     programs must compete against other priorities. Those \n     constraints are tighter than is widely known. While a chorus \n     of voices have advocated increasing the Pentagon budget by up \n     to $100 billion a year, the new figures show how difficult \n     even a fraction of that increase will be to attain.\n       Still the Department of Defense and Energy national \n     security programs will not be starved for cash next year: \n     They'll get at least $325 billion in budget authority, about \n     5 percent more than was appropriated this fiscal year.\n       Although the $504 billion surplus is a lot of money, on an \n     annual basis, it becomes available only slowly, according to \n     the plan.\n       After the $12 billion in outlays reserved for the fiscal \n     year that begins Oct. 1, Congress left $19 billion reserved \n     for fiscal 2003, $10 billion for fiscal 2004, $11 billion for \n     2005 and $20 billion for 2006, Hoagland said. Those figures \n     taken into account the annual rate at which taxes would be \n     slashed in the Senate-passed tax-cut bill, he said.\n       He hastened to add that those reserve dollars could \n     increase, because the budget resolution is a blueprint and \n     Congress has yet to actually authorize and appropriate the \n     money. On the other hand, many analysts contend that the pool \n     of reserve money is likely to be smaller than the current \n     projection.\n\n\n                            How big a raise?\n\n       Calls for annual Pentagon budget boosts of between $50 \n     billion and $100 billion have become commonplace as the \n     rising cost of maintaining an aging force structure and 2 \n     million active-duty military and civilian personnel has \n     become more evident. Recent press reports have indicated the \n     Pentagon may even ask for increases of up to $50 billion a \n     year.\n       The annual dollar amounts described by Hoagland represent \n     what's left in the next five years to increase the budget of \n     any federal department or agency above President Bush's plan. \n     Once Rumsfeld and Bush unveil the findings of a review of \n     military priorities in the coming weeks, the Pentagon is \n     expected to ask for a raise in fiscal 2002 above what Bush \n     put forth in a ``placeholder'' defense budget in late \n     February.\n       The question of the hour is: How much of a raise?\n       ``Budget authority'' is the total amount that Congress \n     empowers the executive branch to make available for programs; \n     the ``outlay'' figure applicable in this case is the \n     estimated value of the checks the government will sign. In a \n     given year, the Pentagon's outlays typically represent about \n     60 percent of its budget authority.\n       Consequently, assuming that all the reserve $12 billion in \n     outlays is slated for the Pentagon alone (an arguably risky \n     assumption), then Bush would need to ask for perhaps an \n     additional $20 billion in budget authority, roughly speaking.\n       The president's February budget requested $325 billion in \n     budget authority for Defense and Energy security programs. \n     That was $16 billion more than President Clinton's plan for \n     fiscal 2002 and $14 billion over Congress's appropriation for \n     the current fiscal year.\n       Consequently, $20 billion in a additional budget authority \n     now would make the Pentagon's budget $36 billion higher than \n     Clinton had planned for fiscal 2002 and $34 billion above \n     this year's mark. That's big money, but far less than the $90 \n     billion a senior defense official recently told Defense Week \n     was required.\n       Although far less of an increase than many have predicted \n     or hoped for, such an increase would not be insignificant and \n     would be criticized in some quarters as unneeded a decade \n     after the Cold War ended.\n\n\n                         assumptions questioned\n\n       There are several reasons to suspect that the $504 billion \n     reserve for the next 10 years may end up smaller than \n     predicted.\n       According to a non-partisan analyst, Steven Kosiak of the \n     Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a defense \n     think tank in Washington, D.C., the budget blueprint assumes \n     that non-defense spending will not grow much faster than \n     inflation.\n       But if those programs grow by 1 percent above inflation, \n     then the $504 billion reserve over 10 years would be cut more \n     than 50 percent, Kosiak says. Domestic programs have been \n     kept below inflation only in 1996 and during two years of the \n     Reagan administration, a Democratic aide said. Over the past \n     decade, the growth has averaged 2 percent, Kosiak said.\n       If past is prologue, the reserve won't materialize. But \n     Bush has promised to hold the line on government outlays.\n       All told, when a host of other non-defense priorities are \n     considered, Kosiak sees $700 billion in non-military items \n     competing for the $504 billion pot.\n       In addition, many Republicans are committed to adding to \n     the 11-year $1.35 trillion tax cut now being debated or to \n     pass separate tax cut measures in the future. That, too, \n     would threaten the Pentagon's share of the pie.\n       Finally, the Congressional Budget Office's assumptions \n     about the economy's growth undergird the projected surplus. \n     If those assumptions fail to come true, the surplus itself \n     may not materialize, some experts warn. For example, \n     according to Kosiak, CBO concedes there's a 50-50 chance that \n     its five-year projections of the surplus could be off by $250 \n     billion, either plus or minus.\n       If CBO has overstated economic growth, the impact on the \n     reserve could be substantial. Kosiak says that ``even a very \n     modest reduction'' of future growth could completely \n     eliminate the $500 billion reserve.\n       However, when the CBO has been wrong lately, it has \n     underestimated the economy's strength and so understated the \n     size of U.S. revenues. New revenue numbers are due this \n     summer, and they may change the fiscal picture.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I asked the Office of Management and Budget Director to \nsend me information as to how much we were going to spend on defense \nboth this year and in the next 10 years. No answer. There has not been \neven an estimate as to what the supplemental will be. We are about to \nenact one of the most massive tax cuts in history, and we do not have \nany idea how much money is going to be devoted to defense spending and \nhow much is going to be left over for it.\n  I believe the American people and Members of this body have a right \nto know that answer. This motion basically says that we should wait, as \nfar as the top tiers are concerned, until we find out how much money is \ngoing to be spent on defense.\n  It instructs the Budget Committee to come up with the information \nthat is necessary for us to make these decisions in the overall context \nof other spending but most importantly defense spending.\n  I campaigned all across this country telling service men and women \nthat help was on the way. So far not one penny of help has been on the \nway. So far we have not had a supplemental appropriations bill to meet \nthe pressing, compelling needs just to keep our planes flying, our \nships at sea, and our men and women in the military. We do not have the \nsupplemental. We have no estimate of what our defense spending needs \nare going to be for the next 10 years. According to recent information, \nincluding from Defense Week, there will be very little.\n  I urge the adoption of the motion to commit with instructions.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator from New Hampshire ready to proceed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Nevada yield back time \non the McCain amendment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes. Mr. President, all time in opposition to the \namendment is yielded back.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I say to my friend, my understanding is that \nSenator Conrad wanted to speak on this motion to commit, so I want to \nreserve 2 minutes of my time remaining for Senator Conrad, if he wants \nto speak. If not, I will yield it back.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield back all time. If Senator Conrad wants to speak \nfor 2 minutes later on during the day, I think we can find time to let \nhim speak on the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is the point? What is the problem? I reserve the 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. So we can go on with this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has reserved 2 minutes.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire is next in \norder to speak for not more than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I \nask unanimous consent that following the two previously scheduled votes \nthat will begin at approximately 6:08 this evening, the Senate proceed \nto votes in relation to the pending amendments in the order in which \nthey were offered. I ask consent that there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided for debate between the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, that time may \nslide a little bit because the two leaders have their leader time \nreserved. They may use that. So with that in mind, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. On behalf of Senator McCain, I ask \nunanimous consent that it be in order for me\n\n[[Page S5227]]\n\nto ask for the yeas and nays on the McCain amendment and on the McCain \nmotion to commit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask for the yeas and nays on the McCain \namendment and the McCain motion to commit.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. What is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 5 minutes.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 680\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. \n680.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 680.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To remove the limitation that certain survivor benefits can \n only be excluded with respect to individuals dying after December 31, \n                                 1996)\n\n       On page 802, after line 21, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 803. REMOVAL OF LIMITATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 101(h) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to exclusion of survivor benefits from \n     gross income) is amended by adding after paragraph (2) the \n     following new paragraph:\n       ``(3) Application.--This subsection shall apply to amounts \n     received after December 31, 2000.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, there is no more noble \ncalling than for those who choose to put their lives on the line every \nday to serve and protect our families.\n  On November 29, 1989, about 12 years ago, New Hampshire State Trooper \nGary P. Parker from Wolfeboro, NH, was tragically killed in the line of \nduty. He left behind his wife Amy, a 16- month-old son Gregory, and a \ndaughter Lindsay, who was to be born just 10 weeks after Trooper Parker \nlost his life.\n  Amy Parker is now alone with her grief and was faced with raising \nboth her son and daughter alone, something that I can certainly \nunderstand since my father died in the Second World War when I was 3. I \nwas raised by my mother, with my brother, without a dad.\n  But, fortunately, because her husband had prepared for the \nunthinkable, both children were left with a small survivor benefit \npension. Believe it or not, they were forced to hand over a large \nportion of those benefits in taxes to the Federal Government, leaving \nthe family very little on which to live.\n  In 1996, Congress recognized the unfairness of this provision and \nrightly corrected the oversight. However, the correction only applied \nto those who died after 1997, leaving all of those families who were \ncurrently living with the grief and hardship of a tragic death with \nthat additional burden still there.\n  This amendment that I am offering, amendment No. 680, is a very \nsimple amendment. I hope I will have the support of my colleagues. It \nwill correct this oversight and bring relief to all the families of law \nenforcement officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty and \nare currently living under this inequity in the law.\n  This is an important amendment that will send a message to our law \nenforcement community and their families that we hold them in the \nhighest esteem, and we honor them for their service and sacrifice. We \nought not have the Tax Code of the United States of America \ndiscriminate against them. I hope we will correct this inequity by \nadopting my amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 723 to Amendment No. 680\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, before yielding the floor, \nI send a second-degree amendment to the desk and ask for the yeas and \nnays on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 723 to amendment No. 680.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. REID. Objection. Let's read this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PERMANENT MORATORIUM ON IMPOSITION OF TAXES ON THE \n                   INTERNET.\n\n       Section 1101(a) of the Internet Tax Freedom Act (title XI \n     of division C of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999; 47 U.S.C. 151 note) is \n     amended by striking ``during the period beginning on October \n     1, 1998, and ending 3 years after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act'' and inserting ``after September 30, 1998''.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this amendment will \npermanently extend the current moratorium on the imposition of taxes on \nthe Internet. It will also stop those who wish to establish a national \nsales tax from doing so. In May of last year, the House overwhelming \npassed this legislation, and the American people strongly oppose taxing \nthe Internet and they vehemently oppose a national sales tax.\n  Mr. President, let us not forget, as a result of leaving the Internet \nto its own device, we have seen an explosion in Internet trade, \ncommerce and information available to consumers. Numerous organizations \nhave backed my amendment to extend the moratorium on Internet taxes, \nincluding the Association of Concerned Taxpayers, U.S. Business and \nIndustrial Council, and United Seniors Association. Now some have \nargued that it is not a level playing field because Internet companies \ndon't pay taxes. Well, this is absolutely not true. Every business and \nevery person is required to pay all tax demanded by their state and \nlocal government, and just about every business does. And those that \ndon't can expect the tax man to come a knock'n.\n  Mr. President, my amendment would only continue the current \nmoratorium. It does not abolish any sales or use tax nor does it \nprevent any government from taking or even increasing sales or use \ntaxes on its own residents. And it also prohibits local or state \ngovernment in one state from imposing a tax on businesses or people in \nanother state without a proper nexus--nor could they impose a national \nsales tax.\n  If we don't pass this legislation, businesses will not only be \nsubject to the state and local governments from which they reside, but \ncould be open to nearly 30,000 state, local, and municipal cities and \ntowns looking to squeeze businesses and individuals for a few extra \ndollars.\n  Indeed, the vast array of federal, state, and even international \nbureaucrats needed to implement these programs and regulations would \nadd on enormous amount of cost, paperwork and redtape which would not \nonly hinder commerce and growth, but will crush small businesses.\n  Local governments argue that if they can require so-called brick and \nmortar businesses to pay sales taxes on main street, then they should \nbe allowed to force business men and women in other states to collect \nthese taxes as well.\n  Well, I disagree. And the Supreme Court disagrees as well. In \nNational Bellas Hess v. Illinois (1967), Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. \nBrady 333 (1977), and the Supreme Court's ruling (in Quill v. North \nDakota, 1992) held that states attempting to tax out-of-state commerce \nwithout a proper nexus was unconstitutional. By allowing states to tax \nbusinesses and people in another state, and if we establish a national \nsales tax, we do this at our own peril.\n  Mr. President, we must say ``no'' to those who want to raise taxes--\nwe must say ``no'' to those who want to tax the Internet--and we must \nsay ``no'' to those who want a national sales tax.\n\n[[Page S5228]]\n\n  Mr. President, I urge passage of my amendment.\n  Mr. President, I renew my request for the yeas and nays on the second \ndegree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? At the moment, \nthere is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to address the underlying \namendment. It is a good idea. There is no reason for the exclusion of \ncertain income under survivor benefits with respect to persons who died \nbefore 1996. Sometimes those benefits are distributed after 1996, and I \nthink the amendment offered by the Senator from New Hampshire is a good \none.\n  I must say, I am a little bit surprised by the second-degree \namendment. It is not an improvement on the first degree. It is an \nentirely different subject. It is a subject which is not in the \njurisdiction of this committee. I urge the Senator, frankly, to \nwithdraw it or maybe offer the amendment later on. We have not debated \nthat issue at any length. At least with respect to the underlying \namendment, I think the Senator has a good idea.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nexplain that while I wholeheartedly support extending the current \nmoratorium on Internet access taxes, I must oppose this amendment.\n  I believe that we should, and I am confident that we will, pass \nlegislation this year that extends the moratorium on Internet access \ntaxes. However, I think it is crucial that the legislation we pass to \nextend the ban on access taxes also address the ability of states to \nrequire remote sellers to collect and remit sales taxes.\n  The Internet is still a growing and dynamic innovation and I believe \nthat we must ensure that its development is not encumbered by \ndiscriminatory taxation. However, as the Internet becomes an \nincreasingly important medium for the transaction of commerce, an \nunlevel playing field is emerging. While sales transacted at main \nstreet businesses are subject to state sales taxes, goods sold over the \nInternet are often free of such taxes.\n  This creates two distinct problems. First, brick-and-mortar retailers \nare being subjected to a competitive disadvantage as consumers are able \nto purchase goods over the Internet without having to pay state sales \ntax on them. This situation provides a disincentive to shop at \ntraditional retail locations and could have very negative long-term \nconsequences for main street retailers.\n  The second problem is that state and local governments rely on sales \ntax revenues for education, transportation infrastructure, law \nenforcement services, fire protection and more. The rise in untaxed \nelectronic commerce is eroding state and local governments' revenue \nbases and may eventually compromise their ability to provide these \nessential services.\n  Therefore I believe that we must address the issue of the collection \nof state sales taxes, and I fear that if this amendment is adopted, the \nimpetus to deal with such issues will be diminished.\n  I look forward to the opportunity to support an extension to the \ncurrent moratorium in the context of a larger bill that also deals with \nthe ability of states to require remote sellers to collect and remit \nsales taxes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Kennedy, I call up \namendment No. 684.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is still time remaining on the second-\ndegree amendment--25 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If the Senator from New Hampshire is willing, I am \nwilling to yield back the remainder of our time on both the first- and \nsecond-degree amendments.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield back.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield back the remainder of our time as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 684\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 684.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Kennedy, for \n     himself, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Johnson, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 684.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 9, between lines 14 and 15, insert:\n       ``(4) Delay of top rate reduction.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding paragraph (2), with \n     respect to a calendar year, no percentage described in that \n     paragraph shall be substituted for 39.6 percent until the \n     requirement of subparagraph (B) is met.\n       ``(B) Fully funding basic education services.--The \n     requirement of this subparagraph is that legislation be \n     enacted that appropriates funds for core education programs \n     at or above the levels that have been authorized for such \n     programs by the Senate in the following amendments to Senate \n     bill 1 (the Better Education for Students and Teachers Act, \n     107th Congress):\n       ``(i) Senate Amendment 360 (107th Congress; as offered by \n     Senator Hagel and Senator Harkin), which passed the Senate on \n     a voice vote with no dissenters, to honor the Federal \n     commitment to provide States with 40 percent of the cost of \n     implementing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \n     instead of the 17 percent of costs that the Federal \n     Government currently provides.\n       ``(ii) Senate Amendment 365 (107th Congress; as offered by \n     Senator Dodd), which passed the Senate on a vote of 79 to 21, \n     to provide support under title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (as amended by the Better \n     Education for Students and Teachers Act) for 100 percent of \n     the economically disadvantaged children by 2008 rather than \n     the 33 percent who are currently aided under such title.\n       ``(iii) Senate Amendment 375 (107th Congress; as offered by \n     Senator Kennedy), which passed the Senate on a vote of 69 to \n     31, to improve teacher quality for all students under the \n     bipartisan agreement reflected in part A of title II of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (as amended by \n     the Better Education for Students and Teachers Act).\n       ``(iv) Senate Amendment 451 (107th Congress; as offered by \n     Senator Lincoln), which passed the Senate on a vote of 62 to \n     34, to improve the quality of education available to \n     bilingual students with limited English proficiency, \n     especially in light of the nation's growing immigrant \n     population.\n       ``(v) Senate Amendment 563 (107th Congress; as offered by \n     Senator Boxer), which passed the Senate on a vote of 60 to \n     39, to ensure that more of the nation's 7,000,000 latchkey \n     children have access to safe, constructive activities after \n     school while their parents are at work.\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Very briefly, Mr. President, to help clarify where the \nmanagers of the bill are on this amendment, I think it is a very good \namendment, but I cannot agree to it. Essentially, it is conditional. It \nviolates the Constitution. This is not the time and place for this \nparticular amendment, even though it is meritorious, not on this bill.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5229]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 724\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Feingold), for himself and \n     Mr. Kohl, proposes an amendment numbered 724.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n             (Purpose: To eliminate the Medicaid death tax)\n\n       On page 314, after line 21, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 803. ELIMINATION OF MEDICAID ESTATE RECOVERY \n                   REQUIREMENT.\n\n       (a) Medicaid Amendment.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1396p(b) of Title 42, U.S.C., is \n     amended--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``except that'' and all \n     that follows and inserting ``except that, in the case of an \n     individual described in subsection (a)(1)(B), the State shall \n     seek adjustment or recovery upon sale of the property subject \n     to a lien imposed on account of medical assistance paid on \n     behalf of the individual.'';\n       (B) in paragraph (2)(B), by striking ``in the case of a \n     lien on an individual's home under subsection (a)(1)(B),'';\n       (C) in paragraph (3), by striking ``(other than paragraph \n     (1)(C))''; and\n       (D) by striking paragraph (4).\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendments made by paragraph (1) \n     shall apply to individuals dying on or after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Revenue Offset.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     adjust the reductions of the rates of tax under section \n     2001(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended by \n     section 511 of this Act) with respect to estates of decedents \n     dying and gifts made in such manner as to increase revenues \n     by $120,000,000 in each fiscal year beginning before October \n     1, 2011.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment would eliminate the \nMedicaid Estate Recovery Program, the real ``death tax'' for thousands \nof elderly of modest means. It offsets the cost of eliminating this \nprogram by shaving back the reductions in the estate tax rates.\n  The Medicaid Estate Recovery Program may be the most regressive tax \nof all. It effectively imposes a 100 percent estate tax on our most \nvulnerable citizens--severely disabled seniors who are impoverished. It \nis levied against the first dollar of the estate's value.\n  At a time when we are considering completely eliminating all estate \ntaxes on the super wealthy, it is indecent to retain a 100 percent tax \non the estates of those with practically nothing.\n  The average annual cost of nursing home care is about $40,000 or \nabout $110 per day. That cost poses an enormous burden on many elderly \nor disabled individuals, many of whom are forced to spend down a \nlifetime's savings before they become poor enough to qualify for \nMedicaid. After having spent down those savings, a home may be the only \nthing they have left to leave to their children.\n  The estate recovery program not only places liens on homes, I also \nunderstand that personal property may be at risk in some areas. \nGrandma's locket may have little material worth but may have great \nsentimental value to children and grandchildren. Nevertheless, they may \ngo on the block, too, and there is strong anecdotal evidence that many \nforgo needed care in order to avoid losing their homes and personal \nproperty to the estate recovery program.\n  The estate recovery program does little to offset the cost of \nMedicaid, accounting for only one-tenth of one percent of the funding \nfor the program according to data from the Congressional Research \nService.\n  In fact, there is reason to believe that the estate recovery program \nmay not even achieve this tiny savings, but instead may actually result \nin greater Medicaid expenditures. Individuals who forgo nursing home \ncare to avoid liens on their homes and personal keepsakes may end up \nrequiring far more expensive care as a result, and the ensuing higher \ncost of care only leaves the taxpayers worse off because of this self-\nneglect.\n  The estate recovery program can work a real hardship on surviving \nspouses. After surviving the chronic illness of their loved one, and \nspending down their life's savings, they then must cope with a lien on \ntheir home. As the Congressional Research Service notes, though claims \non an individual's estate cannot be acted upon until after the death of \nthe surviving spouse, liens placed on houses can affect an individual's \nfinancial credit, preventing that spouse from mortgaging property, \ngetting a bank loan, or taking out a new credit card in order to pay \nfor essential living expenses such as home repairs like a new furnace \nor a leaking roof.\n  This program turns States into Realtors and pawn brokers. Some States \nhave simply not implemented the program, and I understand that among \nthem is the President's home State of Texas. Under my amendment the \nrest of the country would conform to the practice of Texas.\n  Mr. President, my amendment gets States out of the real estate \nbusiness. It ends a program that dissuades elderly with severe \ndisabilities from seeking the care they need while generating a \npitifully small revenue stream. It ends the 100 percent ``death tax'' \nthat is imposed on families with the most modest means.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \ntemporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, since there is nobody on the other side, I \nthink somebody should be here before we do this.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it was for that reason that I did not \nask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I wonder if we could have someone on the other side. It is \nreally unfair without someone being over there.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if there is some way we could work out \nwaiting for a couple minutes so the chairman of the committee could be \nhere, I think that would be appropriate.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized at that point.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I say to my friend from \nWisconsin, we are going to run out of time at 4 o'clock and have to go \nto 4:08; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is scheduled at 6:08, and there is to \nhave been 2 hours prior to the vote.\n  Mr. REID. Remember, at 6 o'clock the debate was supposed to start \nwith Senator Judd Gregg having 5 minutes and Senator Baucus 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Parliamentarian is \nincorrect.\n  Mr. REID. I will make sure that, under leader time, the Senator from \nWisconsin is protected to offer his amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if there is some problem that I find at a \nlater time, Senator Baucus and I find with Senator Grassley not being \nhere, it appears all Senator Feingold is doing is offering amendments, \njust as Senator Smith did and Senator McCain. Having had the break, I \ndon't see anything wrong with that. If anyone does, we will find out \nabout it later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the current \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 725\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 725.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S5230]]\n\n (Purpose: To increase the income limits applicable to the 10 percent \n               rate bracket for individual income taxes)\n\n       On page 7, line 24, strike ``$12,000'' and insert \n     ``$15,000''.\n       On page 8, line 1, strike ``$10,000'' and insert \n     ``$11,250''.\n       On page 9, in the table between lines 11 and 12, strike \n     column relating to 39.6 percent.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment is about tax fairness.\n  The bill before us is tilted heavily toward high-income taxpayers. \nAccording to Citizens for Tax Justice, when this bill's tax cuts are \nfully phased in, the highest-income one percent of taxpayers would \nreceive 35 percent of the benefits of the bill. The majority of \ntaxpayers in the bottom three-fifths of the population would get only a \nlittle more than 15 percent of the bill's benefits.\n  When this bill's tax cuts are fully phased in, the one percent of \ntaxpayers with the highest incomes would receive an average tax cut of \nmore than $44,000, while taxpayers in the middle fifth of the \npopulation would receive an average tax cut of less than $600.\n  Even as a share of their income, those with the highest incomes would \nreceive greater benefits under this bill. According to the Center on \nBudget and Policy Priorities, when fully phased in, this bill's tax \ncuts would increase the after-tax income of the highest-income one \npercent of families by an average of 5 percent, but it would increase \nthe average after-tax income of the middle fifth of families by just a \nlittle more than 2 percent.\n  Nationwide, only 907,990 taxpayers, or \\7/10\\ of a percent of \ntaxpayers are in the top tax bracket. But that group is not too small \nto capture the attentions of this tax bill. In response to an inquiry \nfrom Senator Rockefeller during the Finance Committee markup on \nTuesday, the Joint Committee on Taxation indicated that reducing the \ntop rate from 39.6 percent to 36 percent in steps over 10 years costs \n$120 billion in this bill. That's $120 billion for fewer than a million \ntaxpayers. In contrast, fully 128 million taxpayers do not fall into \nthe top tax bracket and would get no benefits whatsoever from the \nreduction in the top tax rate.\n  In my own State of Wisconsin, fewer than 15,600 taxpayers, or \\6/10\\ \nof a percent of taxpayers, are in the top tax bracket, and fully 2.5 \nmillion taxpayers are not in the top tax bracket.\n  My amendment is a simple one. It would strike the cut in the top \nincome tax rate, and use the savings to increase the amount of income \ncovered by the 10 percent income tax bracket. It would thus reduce the \nalready large benefits to that less than one percent of the population \nwith incomes of more than $297,000, and use the savings to give tax \ncuts to all income taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would restore a modicum of fairness to \nthis bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \ntemporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Motion To Commit With Instructions\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send a motion to commit to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] moves to commit \n     the bill to the Finance Committee with instructions that the \n     Committee report the bill back within 3 days, with changes \n     that would strike all the estate tax rate reductions in the \n     bill and use the savings to expand the amounts of the estate \n     tax unified credit exemption amounts.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is no secret that the benefits of \nthis bill are not fairly distributed. The highest-income one percent \nreceive 35 percent of this bill's benefits.\n  A significant contributor to this imbalance is the estate tax \nprovisions of the bill. Even under current law, roughly 98 percent of \nAmericans will never have to pay a cent of estate tax. So this bill's \n$145 billion in estate tax cuts will benefit only the wealthiest 2 \npercent of Americans, and will have no benefit for the other 98 percent \nof us.\n  But even in the estate tax provisions themselves, this bill tilts \nunnecessarily to the very wealthiest.\n  The bill would increase the unified credit exemption up to $4 million \na person, or $8 million a couple. This change alone will exempt all but \nthe very wealthiest Americans from any contact with the estate tax.\n  But the bill goes further. It would also reduce the rate of taxation \nthat the few extremely wealthy families who still have to pay the \nestate tax would pay. It thus focuses tax cuts on the very pinnacle of \nwealth.\n  Let me give you an idea of the numbers. According to an analysis done \nby the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, fewer than 50,000 \nfamilies in the entire United States paid any estate tax at all in \n1999. But of those families, fewer than 3,300 families had estates \nlarger than $5 million in size. These small numbers are indicative of \nthe very few who would benefit from the rate reductions in this bill.\n  My motion to recommit would spread the estate tax relief in this bill \nmore broadly. My motion would instruct the Finance Committee to strike \nall the estate tax rate reductions in the bill and use the savings to \nexpand the amounts of the estate tax unified credit exemption amounts. \nThus under my motion, more relatively smaller estates would be exempted \nfrom taxation altogether. I have been told that elimination of the rate \nreductions would allow the unified credit exemption to increase to $5 \nmillion, or $10 million a couple.\n  This motion would give complete estate tax relief to more families \nearlier than the underlying bill.\n  That is the direction we should go, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment \nbe temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 726\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment number 726.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To preserve the estate tax for estates of more than $100 \n  million in size and increase the income limits applicable to the 10 \n           percent rate bracket for individual income taxes)\n\n       On page 9, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n       ``(D) Adjustments after 2010.--In prescribing the tables \n     under subsection (f) which apply with respect to taxable \n     years beginning in calendar year 2011, the Secretary shall, \n     in addition to the adjustments made under subparagraph (C) of \n     this subsection, increase the initial bracket amounts for \n     subsection (a) and subsection (b) so as to decrease revenues \n     by the amount of revenues generated by the other provisions \n     of the amendment creating this provision.''\n       On page 63, strike line 4 and all that follows through page \n     64, line 16.\n       On page 65, in line 12, strike ``and before 2011''.\n       On page 66, in the table after line 1, strike ``2007, 2008, \n     2009, and 2010'' and insert ``2007 and thereafter''.\n       On page 68, between lines 14 and 15, following the item \n     relating to 2010, insert the following:\n\n  2011 and thereafter......................................$100,000,000\n       On page 106, after line 6, insert the following:\n       ``(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this \n     subtitle shall not apply to property subject to the estate \n     tax.''\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, this is a simple amendment. It limits \nthe estate tax repeal for estates of over one hundred million dollars \nand uses the savings to give tax cuts to all income tax payers.\n  This debate is about priorities. It is a debate about where we should \ndevote our resources.\n  This amendment provides a clear, easily definable choice.\n  The Senate has indicated that reforming the estate tax, especially \nfor small businesses and farms, should be a priority. I support that \ngoal, but this bill goes much further than any reasonable limit to \naddress that concern.\n  This bill goes beyond any common-sense definition of small businesses \nor modest estates. This bill provides massive amounts to money tax cuts \nto extremely wealthy multi-millionaires.\n  How can anyone suggest that distributing the nation's hard-won \nsurplus to\n\n[[Page S5231]]\n\nmulti-millionaires should be among our highest priorities? Literally \nhundreds of millions of Americans have more pressing needs.\n  Specific tax cuts or spending increases come with a price. Every time \nwe lower a tax rate or create a new tax loophole, the tax burden on \neveryone else increases.\n  Last year, the Treasury Department's Office of Tax Policy told us how \nmuch we would have saved from our amendment to cap the estate tax \nrepeal at estates of $100 million in size. At that time, their most \ncurrent data was for 1998, for people who died in 1997 and paid taxes \nin 1998. In that year, 35 estates amounted to more than $100 million. \nOf those, 31 paid taxes, and 4 did not. Those 31 estates paid $1.4 \nbillion in taxes, or 7 percent of all estate taxes. Repealing the \nestate tax for those estates would have given those estates a tax cut \naveraging $45 million each.\n  Too often, the choices we weigh are heartbreakingly difficult. This \nis not one of those cases.\n  It makes some sense to increase the current exemption on estates; it \nmakes no sense at all to repeal the estate tax for the handful of \nestates over one hundred million dollars.\n  Madam President, surely the supporters of estate tax cuts must agree \nthat eliminating the estate tax on those handful of estates over one \nhundred million dollars is not our highest priority or anywhere close \nto it.\n  My amendment eliminates the repeal of the estate tax on estates of \nmore than $100 million, and uses the savings to increase the income tax \ncut for all income tax payers. It is a simple choice.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate temporarily \nset aside the pending amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank my colleagues.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 711\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 711.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To eliminate expenditures for tuition, fees, and room and \n  board as qualified elementary and secondary education expenses for \n   distributions made from education individual retirement accounts)\n\n       On page 31, line 1, strike ``tuition, fees,''.\n       On page 31, line 11, strike ``room and board,''.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, the amendment that I am offering \nstrikes the provision within the education savings accounts language \nthat covers K-12 tuition, fees and room and board expenses while \npermitting the use of ESA tax savings for other education-related \nexpenses for all students. This amendment will create a level playing \nfield by providing the same tax benefits to all parents regardless of \nwhere they send their children to school.\n  Under my amendment, all parents will be able to take advantage of ESA \naccounts for K-12 related expenses to buy computers, uniforms, or other \nitems that children use to supplement or further their education. In \nshort, it treats all parents equally.\n  Using ESA accounts for private school tuition is simply vouchers by \nanother name. While I strongly believe in a parents' right to choose a \npublic school education or private school education for their children, \nI am concerned that providing a tax incentive to pay private school \ntuition will divert the attention and resources needed to improve our \npublic schools.\n  Strengthening our public schools should be a priority for all of us. \nThe philosopher Edmund Burke once said that ``education is the cheap \ndefense of nations.'' How true that is. If we are to continue our role \nas a world leader, we've got to make sure all of our children are \nprepared to pick up where we leave off. So in my view, education is a \nnational security issue and an economic one as well.\n  Many of you know that rural development is a priority for me, and I \nam continually looking for ways to bring jobs to the impoverished Delta \nregion where I grew up. Whenever I meet with industry folks and urge \nthem to consider the Delta, one of their first questions is: ``How are \nthe public schools?'' They don't ask about the private schools, just \nthe public schools. To attract industry anywhere in this country, we've \ngot to have strong public schools.\n  My amendment isn't the silver bullet. It is about crafting tax policy \nthat recognizes the important role public schools play in our \ncommunities, especially rural communities in poor states like Arkansas.\n  As a proud graduate of public schools of Arkansas, I have enormous \nfaith in our system of public education. And I\n\n[[Page S5232]]\n\noffer this amendment today, Madam President, because I am passionate \nabout fulfilling our responsibility at the federal level to give \nschools and parents the support and resources they need to be \nsuccessful.\n  I urge my colleagues to resist the false promise the current ESA \nprovision provides to parents and public schools and support a tax \npolicy that treat all parents equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that when I suggest the absence of a quorum \nmomentarily, the time run equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Starting now, the 2 hours is evenly divided.\n  Mr. REID. That is right, except for the 2 minutes we have already \nused.\n  Madam President, has the unanimous consent agreement been agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, it has been suggested by some of those \nwho are opposed to our legislation that the tax cuts are backloaded, \nand there is some legitimacy to that argument, although don't forget \nthat the tax rate reduction that benefits most Americans--in fact, \nevery income-tax payer in America--the new 10-percent bracket, going \nback to January 1, 2001, benefits everybody. From that standpoint, this \nlegislation is very frontloaded. But we are dealing with a \ncongressional budget resolution that was adopted earlier this month.\n  The budget surplus, excluding Social Security, will be $2.3 trillion \nover the next 11 years. The proposed tax reductions over the next 11 \nyears will be $1.3 trillion of that $2.3 trillion.\n\n  When one looks at the budget surplus and the tax cuts on a year-by-\nyear basis, one will see that tax cuts are designed to stay within the \navailable surplus each and every year. Twenty-nine percent of the \nbudget surplus occurs over the next 5 years, and 29 percent of the tax \ncut is phased in over the next 5 years. Sixteen percent of the budget \nsurplus occurs in the last year, while only 14 percent of the tax cuts \noccur the last year. In other words, the tax cuts are phased in to \nreflect the surpluses available to pay for them.\n  To the extent one argues that our bill is backloaded, our tax relief \nis frontloaded for the lower income taxpayers, particularly that 10-\npercent new bracket about which I have been talking. The tax cuts for \nthe higher income taxpayers who pay the bulk of the Federal tax burden \ncome later.\n  The reason for this is we want to help lower income taxpayers first, \nand the tax surplus itself is phased in. So additional tax relief needs \nto wait until the year 2006. As a result, lower and middle-income \ntaxpayers benefit by getting their money back first and for the time \nvalue of having that money in their pocket longer than higher rate \ntaxpayers.\n  It amazes me; if we had $1.6 trillion the President wanted for tax \ncuts, we would not have to backload some of these benefits. Wouldn't \nyou know that the people who are complaining about backloading are the \nsame ones who voted against the $1.6 trillion tax cut authority that is \nin the budget resolution. They deny us the tools then to enact full tax \ncuts today and then complain because we have to wait a few years to \nmake the tax cuts. These are the same people who, during the budget \nreconciliation debate, cried that 10-year projections are unreliable. \nNow they rely on 20-year projections to claim that our tax cut will \nhave negative effects in the second 10 years.\n  It is a fictitious argument because the bill ends in 2011. Under \nSenate rules, the bill will not be in effect in the second 10 years.\n  We are about national priorities, but that issue was settled last \nweek during the budget resolution debate. The budget resolution itself \ndecides what our national priorities are. This bipartisan tax bill \nbefore us then is one part of the priorities the entire Senate set 2 \nweeks ago when we voted for the budget resolution by a vote of 52-48.\n  The Senate Finance Committee in this bipartisan tax bill is \nresponding to the majority of the Senate in bringing this bill before \nus as one part of everything that was decided in that budget \nresolution.\n  We have had people tell us that we cannot rely on projected surpluses \nto pay for our tax cuts. However, the biggest threat to fiscal \ndiscipline is higher spending, not lower taxes. In 1997, Congress and \nthe President agreed to cap discretionary spending in an effort to \nbalance the Federal budget. Unfortunately, as Federal revenues rose to \nrecord levels and our deficits turned into surpluses, these spending \ncaps were broken.\n  Since 1997, discretionary spending has exceeded the budget caps by \n$272 billion. Over the next 10 years, discretionary spending will \nexceed the levels established in 1997 by $1.3 trillion and, as one can \nsee, that is so close to what this tax bill is that it is enough to pay \nfor our entire tax reduction.\n  No one seems to worry about how unreliable the surplus projections \nare when we add trillions of dollars in higher spending to the Federal \nbudget. It seems as if there is plenty of money in these 10-year \nprojections if we want to appropriate money, spend more money, but, lo \nand behold, we bring a tax bill before the Senate to let people keep \nthe money they have earned rather than sending it to Washington, and \nsomehow these 10-year budget projections we rely upon to make policy \ndecisions are undependable.\n\n  I have come to the conclusion, or I would not be a part of this \nbipartisan tax bill, and I would not have voted for the budget \nagreement, that there is plenty of money from the tax surplus to give \ntax relief to working men and women and to do it in a way that is \nfiscally disciplined but, more importantly, imposes fiscal discipline \non a lot of the big spenders around this Congress who think they know \nmore how to handle the taxpayers' money than the taxpayers do, who \nbelieve if we spend more money, we are going to create more wealth.\n  Common sense dictates that the Government does not create wealth. \nCommon sense dictates that individual Americans using the resources of \ntheir labor and their brain create wealth.\n  On the other hand, if that money were in the pockets of Members of \nCongress, it would burn a hole. So we return it to the taxpayers of \nAmerica, and it allows them, through individual decisionmaking, to \ndecide what they want to do with that money.\n  The process is going to turn over many more times in the economy, \nparticularly if it is invested, than if we spend it in Washington in a \npolitical decision as to how the goods and services in our country \nought to be distributed. It is better not to make a political decision \nbut let the marketplace empower the individuals to make a choice. We \nare going to create more wealth, and the money is going to turn over \nmore times in the economy that way and do more good.\n  We have also heard the accusation that we are raiding the trust \nfunds. Some people continue to suggest that the tax cut will do this to \nthe Social Security trust fund and the Medicare trust fund. Let me \nexplain it this way.\n  The budget resolution for which I voted is the basis for this \nbipartisan tax bill and also, to some extent, what the President said \nin his budget to the Congress: We can fund our priorities, we can give \ntax relief to working men and women, we can preserve the Social \nSecurity trust fund and the Medicare trust fund, and we can pay down \nevery dollar due on the national debt throughout the 10-year projection \nof our budget resolution.\n  There are people who disagree with that, but obviously the vast \nmajority of this body understands that to be a fact.\n  Under current law, when Social Security and Medicare collect more \nthan they spend--in other words, more income than outgo yearly in the \nMedicare trust fund and the Social Security trust fund--that money is \ninvested in U.S. Government bonds. These bonds are held by the trust \nfund until needed to pay benefits. That will be roughly\n\n[[Page S5233]]\n\n2017 for Social Security, probably roughly 2010 for Medicare. In the \ncase of Social Security, that will keep benefits at 100 percent, at \nleast through the year 2037.\n\n  So when people talk about raiding the trust fund--I don't know \nwhether this is their intent--they do mislead Americans. They want \npeople to believe we are reducing the balance in the trust fund to pay \nfor tax reduction. They know that is not true. The balance in the trust \nfund can only be reduced to pay for Social Security and Medicare \nbenefits. The tax cuts cannot reduce the balance in the trust fund.\n  Once again, the chart emphasizes what I first said. It shows we will \ncontinue to have tax surpluses, indicated by the blue bar, each of the \nnext 10 years. The tax cuts are the red bar and are a small part of \neach of those tax surpluses each year. We can see the charge of \nbackload. Albeit we are giving relief to every taxpayer this year, in \n2001, the tax reductions of this bill kick in over the next few years \nto reflect the growing tax surplus we have coming into the Federal \nTreasury.\n  I hope people see that as a responsible way to make sure we are able \nto fund our priorities, maintain the Social Security/Medicare trust \nfunds, pay down every dollar due on the national debt over the next 10 \nyears, and still give tax relief to working men and women.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask the Senator from North Dakota, does he have an \namendment he wishes to offer?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have amendments as discussed, for which we just \nreceived the scoring, so the amendments are being redrafted and will be \nhere momentarily. I would like to talk about the bill if I may, and I \nask for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I don't know if we have 10 minutes. There are a lot of \nSenators desiring to speak.\n  Mr. REID. I think the ranking member on the Budget Committee deserves \n10 minutes. He indicated he would make sure you were adequately \nprotected with time, and I told him you are.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have several Members on my side of the aisle who want \npart of the 1 hour. I would like to know who they are and have them get \nover here and take up their share; otherwise, I will use it.\n  Mr. REID. I think the Senator from Iowa raises a very good point. We \nhave attempted this afternoon to get people to offer amendments. We are \nabout out of time. I say the same to people on my side of the aisle. \nAnyone who wants to speak or has an amendment to offer, time is just \nabout gone.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is yielded 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank Senator Reid on behalf of the leadership for the \ntime.\n  Madam President, the New York Times said it best of all: ``More Tax-\ncut Follies.'' They made the point that while some of the provisions \nhave been improved over what President Bush proposed, nonetheless, \noverall this bill amounts to ``another gross abdication of fiscal \nresponsibility.'' That sums it up. That is what this tax bill is, an \nabdication of fiscal responsibility.\n  Sometimes I wonder if we learn anything from history. If we look back \nat the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations, we can go back to the \ntime of the Reagan administration where we saw a proposal for a massive \ntax cut, a massive defense buildup, and an overall package that did not \nadd up. The results were to absolutely explode the budget deficit of \nthe United States. We went from an $80 billion deficit to over $200 \nbillion. We quadrupled the national debt. Then President Bush came in \nand the deficits doubled again to nearly $290 billion.\n  It was not until 1993, when we put in place a plan that actually \nraised income taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent and cut spending that \nwe were able to get back on a path to fiscal responsibility, balancing \nthe books. Then in 1997 we passed a bipartisan plan that finished the \njob that put us into surplus.\n  Madam President, it seems we are forgetting those lessons completely. \nWe are now headed back to deficits, back to debt based on a rosy \nscenario, based on a massive tax cut, based on a massive defense \nbuildup. The numbers we have not yet seen; they are not even part of \nthe budget resolution; that is the fatal flaw of the budget resolution. \nWe don't have the defense numbers. We don't have the money to \nstrengthen Social Security even though President Bush says we should. \nWe don't have the money to fix the alternative minimum tax. We don't \nhave the money for item after item. The reason is, that when we get all \nthose items together, we will find that the overall package does not \nadd up.\n  The Philadelphia Inquirer said it well: ``Tax-slashers at Work: Once \nStarted, They Can't Seem to Stop.''\n  Just like the frat brothers, the Senators are going through weird \ncontortions. In the bipartisan mess of a bill that the committee worked \non yesterday, one gimmick is to phase in ballyhooed tax breaks over \nperiods as long as a decade.\n  With other tax breaks, the bill does the opposite trick: Providing \ntax relief right away, then supposedly ending it a few years down the \nroad.\n  That is called backloading, and this bill is loaded with it. The bill \ncosts $1.35 trillion in the years 2001 to 2011. But look what happens \nin the second 10 years. It explodes. The cost goes up to over $4 \ntrillion. That is because item after item is back-loaded.\n  The estate tax is one example. The cost in the first 10 years is \n$1.45 billion. Look at what happens in the second 10 years when they \ncompletely eliminate the estate tax. The cost goes up to $790 billion \nright at the time the baby boomers retire.\n  The same thing happens with the estate tax rate. The 2011 repeal \nmasks massive costs. We can see the cliff effect of the estate tax.\n  It does not end there. It continues with the marriage penalty but in \na different way. With the marriage penalty, they don't put it into \nplace until the year 2004. There is no marriage penalty relief until \nthen. Then they increase relief so it takes full effect in the year \n2008.\n  But it doesn't stop there because they have done the same thing with \nthe alternative minimum tax. They hide backloading by sunsetting the \nalternative minimum tax relief right in the middle of the period. It is \nbizarre. They start out by providing alternative minimum tax relief, \nand then they take it away.\n  What will happen with the alternative minimum tax? We are going to go \nfrom 1.5 million people being affected by the alternative minimum tax \nto, when this bill passes, nearly 40 million people.\n  It is just not the back end loading that makes no sense; it is the \nlack of fairness. This bill we have before the Senate gives the top 20 \npercent of taxpayers 70 percent of the benefits. It gives the bottom 20 \npercent 1 percent of the benefits. It doesn't strike me as fair.\n\n  But the evidence of unfairness goes on and on. The top 1 percent gets \ntwice as much of the benefits as the bottom 60 percent. The top 1 \npercent of taxpayers who earn on average $1.1 million a year get 33.5 \npercent of the benefits. The bottom 60 percent of American taxpayers \nget 15 percent of the benefits, one-half as much.\n  The evidence of the unfairness in this bill is in item after item. \nPerhaps the most interesting part of this bill is the various rate \nbrackets. There are five rate brackets. Every one of them gets rate \nrelief except one. What do you think the one is? The one is the 15-\npercent bracket where 70 percent of American taxpayers are; 70 percent \nof American taxpayers get no rate relief under this bill. But as you go \nup the income ladder, you get more and more generous relief. The big \nbucks, the big benefits go to those at the very top. The biggest, \nhighest income folks get the biggest rate relief of all. It is not \nfair.\n  We have heard discussion in this Chamber that it is a big improvement \nover what President Bush proposed. There is some improvement but not \nmuch. Under the Bush plan, the top 20 percent of taxpayers got 72 \npercent of the benefits. Under this plan, the top 20 percent get 70 \npercent of the benefits.\n  The other thing that has been said about this bill is it is a \nstimulus to lift the economy. There is precious little stimulus in this \nbill. We passed in the Senate $85 billion of stimulus. What\n\n[[Page S5234]]\n\ncame back from conference and what is in this bill is $10 billion, $10 \nbillion in nearly a $9 trillion economy. There is precious little \nstimulus in this bill.\n  As I pointed out, this bill is flawed in even more ways. The number \nof taxpayers affected by the alternative minimum tax explodes under \nthis bill. Boy, are those folks in for a big surprise. Today, 1.5 \nmillion people are caught up in the alternative minimum tax. Under this \nbill, at the end of the 10-year period nearly 40 million people will be \naffected by the alternative minimum tax. Those folks, nearly 1 in 4 \nAmerican taxpayers, are not getting a tax cut. They are going to get a \ntax increase. They are going to have it as a result of the flaws of \nthis bill.\n  There has been a lot of talk that this bill is reducing the debt. It \nis reducing the publicly held debt. That is this red line on this \nchart. It will go from $3.4 trillion today down to about $800 billion. \nBut another part of the debt is increasing. That is the debt that is \nowed to the trust funds of the United States. You can see that this \ndebt is going to go from about $2 trillion to over $5.5 trillion. And \nthe overall, the gross debt of the United States is actually increasing \nfrom $5.6 trillion today, to $6.7 trillion at the end of this 10-year \nperiod.\n  So all the talk about paying down debt, one part of the debt is being \npaid down, but the overall debt is actually increasing.\n  Here is the sad history of Federal debt. This is what has happened to \nit from 1950 to 1999. In 1981, the last time we followed the fiscal \npolicy that is embraced by this bill, we saw the debt of the United \nStates absolutely explode to $5.6 trillion, which is where it is today. \nAt the end of this period, the gross debt of the United States is going \nto be $6.7 trillion. Here we are passing a massive tax cut. Shame on \nus. Shame on us for pushing this debt onto our kids. We are the ones \nwho ran up this debt. This was during our time. This was on our watch. \nThis is while we were in charge and we ran up this debt and it is going \nto continue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask my colleagues to think carefully and oppose this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nIowa for yielding the time.\n  I am going to be submitting for the Record an amendment which would \nprovide for a tax credit for clean coal technology research, but I am \nnot going to be pressing for a vote at this time because of the very \ncrowded calendar and the limitation of time for debate. But in an era \nwhen we are struggling with a national energy policy, it is my view \nthat we ought to be relying on coal as a major source of supply to \navoid reliance on foreign oil, and to ease off on a great many of the \ncontroversies which are present as we look to oil exploration in a \nvariety of places.\n  My own State, Pennsylvania, has some 7.2 billion tons of demonstrated \nreserves of anthracite coal in the northeastern part of the State and \nsome 21.4 billion tons of demonstrated reserves of bituminous coal. \nCoal is spread across the United States in great supply. \nNotwithstanding the tremendous problems we are having in finding \nsources of energy, we have never developed coal as a source because of \nthe problems with sulfur dioxide and the problems of pollution which we \nconfronted in the Clean Air Act of 1990.\n  The legislation I would like to see enacted would provide a tax \ncredit for clean coal technology research. The distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, has introduced legislation, S. 60, which \nprovides a broader range of tax credits regarding which I have deferred \nto the Senator's proposed legislation. I only recently joined as a \ncosponsor to S. 60 because of some concerns which I had about the \nenvironmental aspects. But more recently there has been an addressing \nof those concerns, so I think what Senator Byrd seeks to accomplish in \nS. 60 is very sound.\n  In the reconciliation bill, as we all know, with the very limited \nperiod of time for debate, there is really not an opportunity to have \nthe kind of exploration of this issue which is required. I have talked \nto a number of my colleagues about it and I am advised that in July, \nperhaps, there will be on the floor a tax bill and a energy bill which \nwould provide a better opportunity for the in-depth discussion which \nthis issue requires. But there is no doubt about the need for \nadditional energy. There is no doubt about the problems from OPEC oil \nand from drilling in many places which have been proposed, with \nenvironmental concerns. There is no doubt that coal could provide the \nanswer if we had clean coal technology and sufficient tax incentives \nfor people to move to develop coal as an alternative.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent a copy of this amendment be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the amendment was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide a business credit for 10 percent of research \n               expenses regarding clean coal technology)\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Since I have a few more minutes remaining, I would like \nto comment about the bill generally.\n  When President Bush established a target of $1.6 trillion in a tax \ncut over a 10-year period, it was my view that it was a reasonable \nfigure. It is very hard to pick out a figure without any precision, but \nI was prepared to follow the lead that President Bush had established \nwhich was based upon the projection of a surplus over the 10-year \nperiod of some $5.6 trillion.\n  I have said before that I was willing to see the figure up to $1.6 \ntrillion. It has been reduced somewhat to $1.350 trillion now over an \n11-year period. I think that is an accommodation which is reasonable. \nThe President and the Administration have come forward and accepted \nthat as a reasonable allocation, but still, in my view, it depends upon \nthat surplus materializing.\n  I am concerned about having a repeat of what happened with the Kemp-\nRoth legislation which was enacted in 1981, where we had substantial \ntax cuts. At the beginning of President Reagan's term, there was a \nnational debt of $1 trillion, and it escalated to $4 trillion in the \ncourse of 8 years. I think that is a path which we do not want to \nrepeat. A tax cut will stimulate the economy. I think it is useful, but \nat the same time we do not want to add to the national debt.\n  Paying down the deficit is also a very good way to stimulate the \neconomy by eliminating the Government's use of a portion of the capital \nand having it come into private hands. There have been quite a number \nof discussions about ways to have the so-called trigger mechanism, that \nif the surplus does not hold up, there will be a time for reevaluation \nas to what we are doing with respect to the tax cut.\n  Of course, it is always possible for Congress to revisit this as a \nlegislative matter. Although from my experience, I know it is much \nharder to get a tax increase--much, much harder to get a tax increase--\nthan it is to get a tax cut, and for good reason. The Government at the \nNational, State, and local level now takes an enormous bite.\n  We had a battle in 1993, the first year of President Clinton's \nadministration, when I opposed the tax increase. However, I do think it \nis important to keep our eye on many balls at the same time, and on the \nball to be sure that the surplus materializes.\n  I know the manager has given me 7 minutes, but I was negotiating for \n10. So I will ask Senator Grassley, if I could have his attention, for \nmy other 3 minutes at this time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Two minutes then. I have Senator Gramm who needs some \ntime. I grant the Senator 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. At the end of the 2 minutes, I will have to ask for \nanother minute, I say to Senator Grassley. It will take more time than \nthe full allocation. How about 3 minutes? Going, going----\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Please take 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The balance of my 3-minute speech, which will now be \ncondensed, relates to a concern on the estate tax. I do believe the \nestate tax is burdensome. The exemption of $675,000 is not realistic. \nWe ought not to burden small businesses and the family farm with the \nthreat of sale or disillusion or problems on the death of the \nprincipal. But, I do believe there is some ground where billionaires \nought not to escape the estate tax.\n  I am not sure exactly what that figure is, but we do not want to \ncreate a situation for inherited wealth to eliminate incentives in \nAmerica. It may be that $100 million is an appropriate figure, perhaps \neven somewhat less.\n\n  Also, in the elimination of the estate tax, which is not triggered \nfor some 11 years, there are some real problems which will be caused \nwhen there will be taxes on capital gains. Obviously, while we ought \nnot to tax twice, we ought not to have a system where people avoid \ntaxes entirely with the stepped-up basis. That is very complicated.\n  I am concerned generally with what may happen on unintended \nconsequences. Once we start to deal in the tax field, the unintended \nconsequences may take over. It is my hope that we can have some \nbalance.\n  I see the Presiding Officer with the gavel, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, how much time does the minority have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 44\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. REID.

This is an amendment which seeks to address the problem of \nthe alternative minimum tax in this bill. My amendment would exempt all \ntaxpayers with incomes of $100,000 or less from the alternative minimum \ntax, as it is known.\n  For millions of Americans, the tax cut under consideration today is a \nphantom tax cut. It is a phantom tax cut because some don't get it at \nthe outset, and it is a phantom tax cut that, because of the \nalternative minimum tax, millions will be pushed into a tax bracket \nthat they were never in previously, and that will take away from them \nthe very tax cut they are being promised.\n  The alternative minimum tax was created, as we know, in 1969, to \ncurtail the ability of high-income individuals to escape payment of \nincome tax through various deductions, exclusions, and exemptions. It \nis effectively a separate tax system that rides parallel to the normal \ntax system. It was originally intended to prevent wealthier people from \nbeing able to make use of credits and deductions and thereby escape any \ntax liability whatsoever.\n  In 1998, we began to notice that something was happening that was \nunintended. There was an encroachment of the AMT on middle-class \ntaxpayers. That year, our omnibus appropriations bill included a \nprovision allowing taxpayers to claim personal tax credits--such as the \nHOPE and lifetime learning credits, as well as the adoption credit--\nwithout being pushed into the AMT liability. In 1999, we extended this \nprovision through this year.\n  Last year, about $1.3 million taxpayers confronted AMT liability. \nUnder the current law, that number would climb to over 17 million \ntaxpayers in 2010. But under the bill before us, the number of \ntaxpayers subject to the AMT will climb to nearly 40 million by 2011. \nAs a result, overall alternative minimum tax liability will rise from \nabout $6 billion in the year 2000 to nearly $40 billion in 2010.\n  The increase in AMT liability, for the most part, is attributable to \ninflation, but unlike the AMT, the regular tax system is indexed for \ninflation. The AMT is not. The personal exemptions, standard deduction, \nand tax brackets increase annually. Under the AMT, the exemption \namounts and the tax brackets remain constant. Thus, every year \ntaxpayers whose incomes rise with inflation are taxed at the same rate \nunder the regular income tax but they are increasingly penalized by the \nAMT.\n  It is simply fraudulent to say in this tax bill that we are offering \na great number of Americans tax relief when we know we are pushing \nmillions of Americans into the alternative minimum tax. That is No. 1.\n  Secondly, everybody knows this is coming down the road, and yet we \nare under the limits of the total tax cut of $1.35 trillion. We know \nthere is going to be a cost of several hundred billion over a number of \nyears in order to pay for the tax cut we are giving because the \nconsequence of this tax cut is to create a liability on the AMT. But lo \nand behold, we do not pay for it. That means, once again, the Congress \nis prepared to defer the tough decisions from today into the future. \nAnd everybody knows what will happen in the future. That will, indeed, \nbe dealt with, and it will mean it is a much larger tax cut than is \neven being promised to the American people today.\n  For taxpayers, navigating the maze of AMT rules is a significant \nadministrative burden. The National Taxpayer Advocate at the IRS ranks \nthe AMT as one of the most burdensome areas of tax law. To comply with \nthe AMT, taxpayers must compute their regular tax liability and then \nrecalculate their AMT liability using a different base of income, \ndifferent exemptions, and different tax rates.\n  The AMT also applies different treatments to certain income \ndeductions, exclusions, and credits that may be used by taxpayers under \nthe regular income tax. In essence, taxpayers are required to apply two \nmethods of accounting--one for the regular tax and one for the AMT.\n  If Congress fails to adequately address the AMT problem, the coverage \nwill gradually shift from higher income taxpayers to more and more \nmiddle-class American taxpayers in States with high income and property \ntaxes, such as States like Massachusetts that are particularly hard \nhit, because under the AMT, taxpayers are prohibited from deducting \nState and local taxes. In addition, as the grasp of the AMT spreads, \nincentives in the regular tax systems, such as the HOPE and the \nlifetime learning credits, and the adoption credit, completely lose \ntheir effectiveness. Not only do we create a liability, but we undo a \nbenefit that we have put into effect previously.\n  Madam President, the amendment I am proposing today would ensure that \nthe AMT never touches the vast majority of middle-class Americans. It \nis simple and straightforward. It exempts all taxpayers with incomes of \n$100,000 or less from the AMT.\n  As many employees in high-tech firms have already learned, stock \noptions are another item treated differently under the AMT.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation, in its recent tax simplification \nreport, recommended complete repeal of the alternative minimum tax. The \ncommittee stated in its report, ``the alternative minimum tax can be a \ntrap for the unwary, especially for large families, and creates \ndisparate treatment of taxpayers depending on where they live.''\n  Despite the overwhelming sentiment against the AMT, the legislation \nbefore us moves in the opposite direction. While the bill would provide \nsome limited AMT relief through 2006, all such relief would be repealed \nin 2007.\n  Even with the purported AMT fix in the bill before us, during the \nnext five years, the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT will \ncontinue to rise steadily--nearly doubling next year alone. In 2002, as \na result of the bill before us--with its combination of significant \nrate reductions and limited AMT relief--thousands of taxpayers will \nfind themselves confronted for the first time by the AMT. And during \nthe second five years, the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT will \nexplode, reaching nearly 40 million in 2011.\n  In short, the tax bill's proponents want to give Americans a tax cut \nwith the right hand and take it away with the left hand. It is \nmisleading--it is deceptive--and for millions of Americans, it is a \nphantom tax cut.\n  And finally, it is fiscally irresponsible. Nobody truly believes \nCongress will allow the AMT to hit 40 million taxpayers. But the \nsolution has been put off for another day. When we finally deal with \nthe problem, it will be expensive--perhaps costing as much as $300 \nbillion.\n  The amendment I am proposing today would ensure that the AMT never \ntouches the vast majority of middle-class Americans. It is simple and \nstraightforward. My amendment would exempt all taxpayers with incomes \nof $100,000 or less from the AMT.\n  By exempting taxpayers with incomes below $100,000 from the AMT, the \namendment protects the original goal--to ensure that wealthy \nindividuals do not entirely escape taxation--while also ensuring that \nthe AMT will never touch the vast majority of maiddle-class taxpayers.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that exempting taxpayers \nwith incomes below $100,000 from the alternative minimum tax will cost \n$110 billion over the next ten years. That is a small price to pay to \nensure that middle-class Americans are able to benefit from the \nproposed tax reduction.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation further estimates that the amendment \nwould eliminate AMT liability for 18 million taxpayers. If the \namendment passes, 18 million middle-class taxpayers will be freed from \nthe unintended burden of the alternative minimum tax.\n  We should not miss our opportunity to address the growing AMT \nproblem. We should not wait. AMT reform deserves more than the token \nmeasures included in the bill before us. Anything less is misleading \nand fiscally irresponsible. I urge my colleagues to support my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Lieberman, to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 693\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise to speak on amendment No. 693 \nwhich would offer a rebate of $300 to every taxpayer, income tax and \npayroll\n\n[[Page S5237]]\n\ntaxpayer, in the United States within weeks of its passage.\n  Labels like conservative, liberal, or moderate are used very loosely \nin our politics and take on a new meaning from moment to moment. For \nexample, the tax plan in the bill before us has been described as \nmoderate or conservative. I have always understood the definition of \n``fiscal conservatism'' or ``moderation'' to be centered on fiscal \nresponsibility and balanced budgets.\n  This tax plan is not fiscally responsible because it wastes the \nprojected surpluses the American people have earned on a too big tax \ncut, more than we can afford, a tax cut that will take us back into \ndeficits and raise interest rates and, I fear, raise unemployment, and \na tax cut that commits nothing of the non-Social Security and Medicare \nsurpluses to pay down our national debt, which is still over $3 \ntrillion.\n  Because I consider myself a fiscal conservative or fiscal moderate, I \nwill therefore vote against this tax bill.\n  I have been thinking of the bill in nutritional terms lately: The old \nline ``you can have too much of a good thing,'' ``you can eat too much \nof a good thing''--ice cream, for instance. It ultimately is not good \nfor your system. We strive for a balanced diet.\n  This is an imbalanced budget proposal. Tax cuts are a good thing, but \nour economy can have too much of them. That is exactly what this bill \ndoes.\n  It leaves out business tax incentives, growth incentives, and it \nleaves out the kind of genuine short-term fiscal stimulus that our \nuncertain economy needs today and that was part of the budget \nresolution we adopted last month. Our plan adopted in the budget \nresolution was fair, fast, and fiscally responsible.\n  Unfortunately, the so-called stimulus included in this bill that is \non the floor today does none of those things. It is not fair because it \nprovides no relief to millions of Americans who do not pay income \ntaxes. It is not fast because it is phased in over 11 years. And it is \ncertainly not fiscally responsible because it is part of a budget-\nbusting tax cut.\n  That is why this amendment offers a stimulus that is the real thing, \na plan that will get cash into the hands of America's consumers and \ninto the veins of our economy in a matter of weeks.\n  This amendment will reduce, as of July 1, the 15-percent rate for all \nincome-tax payers to 10 percent, but it goes beyond that and sends a \n$300 check to every American taxpayer, income tax or payroll tax. That \nmeans individuals would receive $300; joint filers, husband and wife, \ncouple, $600; and it creates a separate category of rebate which is \n$450 this year in a check to single heads of households.\n  This is the kind of relief and rebate America's workers and taxpayers \nand families need now. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator calling up his amendment?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I was, indeed, calling up amendment No. 693.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To ensure debt reduction by providing for a mid-course review \n                                process)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC.   . MID-COURSE REVIEW.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, if at the end of fiscal year 2003 or 2010, the Secretary \n     of the Treasury certifies that the actual reduction in debt \n     held by the public since fiscal year 2001 is less than the \n     actual surplus of the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability \n     Insurance Trust Fund and the Medicare Federal Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund since fiscal year 2001, any Member of \n     Congress may introduce and may make a privileged motion to \n     proceed to a bill that implements a mid-course review.\n       ``(b) Mid-Course Review Legislation.--To qualify under \n     subsection (a), a bill must delay any provision of this Act \n     or any subsequent Act that takes effect in fiscal year 2004 \n     or 2011 and results in a revenue reduction or causes \n     increased outlays through mandatory spending, and must also \n     limit discretionary spending in fiscal year 2004 or 2011 to \n     the level provided for the prior fiscal year plus an \n     adjustment for inflation.

Madam President, this is a very simple amendment. There \nwill be a vote on a trigger amendment later. I am adamantly opposed to \nthat. It is very poor economic policy for the Congress to put itself in \na straitjacket where if we were in a recession in the future, we could \nlock America into a tax increase and, in the process, make the economy \nworse and potentially turn a recession into a depression.\n  Secondly, the trigger amendment which will be voted on later tonight, \nin addition to holding out the prospect of putting us in a straitjacket \nand having an automatic tax increase in a recession, holds out the \nprospect that Congress could literally spend itself into a tax increase \nwithout ever having to vote for the tax increase. What the amendment \nactually says is, if we are not meeting our deficit reduction targets, \ntaxes would go up automatically.\n  There are only two reasons you would not meet the targets. One is you \nare spending a lot more money than you said you were going to spend in \nthe budget, in which case we ought not to be rewarding profligate \nspending by pouring more gasoline on the fire with a tax increase to \nfund more spending. Or, two, we are in a recession and we don't want to \nturn a recession into a depression.\n  Knowing that my colleagues are determined to deal with this issue, I \nhave put together an amendment that does it in a rational way. It has \ntwo mid-course reviews--one in 2003, one in 2010--that if we don't meet \nour debt reduction targets, if the Secretary of the Treasury certifies \nwe don't, on a highly privileged basis a resolution would come before \nthe Senate that would allow us to debate controlling spending and \ndeferring the tax cut, but there would be a rational decision. And the \ntax cut would not become permanent until we have at least exercised \nthat decision in terms of the decisions we make in the Senate to act or \nnot act.\n  It is the rational way to do something. I hope my colleagues will \nlook at doing it in that rational way.\n  I have covered triggers in my remarks. I am hoping that if the \ntrigger amendment fails, that my amendment would be accepted. In fact, \nif the trigger amendment passed, I would still hope my amendment would \nbe accepted.\n  There is an amendment before us that tries to say that there is \nsomething wrong with the way the President gave the tax cut to the \nlowest bracket. What the President did, instead of cutting the 15-\npercent rate, he gives enough money in tax cuts for the 15-percent \nbracket to cut it to 14 percent and then ultimately to 13 percent for \neverybody. But in trying to help lower income people, he creates a new \nbracket at 10 percent. The net result is, for the people in the lowest \nincome part of the 15-percent bracket, he gives a 33-percent tax cut. \nFor the people in the highest part of the 15-percent bracket, he gives \na 9-percent tax cut. But the effect is exactly the same in terms of the \ndollars you pay in taxes as if you had lowered it from 14 to 13 percent \nfor people in the highest part of the income bracket.\n  We have an amendment before us that has been offered by two of my \nDemocrat colleagues that creates the impression that somehow there is \nsomething wrong with the President's plan because some people don't get \na reduction in rates.\n  The fact is, they get a dramatic reduction in rates with the new 10-\npercent bracket. It is an incredible paradox that something that was \naimed at helping the poorest workers in America the most is now held up \nby Democrats as an excuse to raise marginal tax rates on the highest \nincome workers. I trust my colleagues will not fall for that poor, weak \nargument and that it will fail.\n  Here is my point. A, this is not a huge, irresponsible tax cut, this \nis a modest tax cut. Of every dollar we are going to send to Washington \nin the next 10 years under this bill, how much do we get back? If we \nhad adopted the President's entire package, we would have gotten 6.2 \ncents. We are now talking about roughly 5.2 cents out of every dollar. \nHow does that compare with the Kennedy tax cut? That was 12.6 cents out \nof every dollar, so it is less than half that size. The Reagan tax cut \nof 1981 was 18.7 cents out of every dollar. It is roughly a third that \nsize. So we have a tax cut in 1961, 1981, and now in 2001 it is time \nfor America to have a tax cut. This is a prudent, responsible tax cut.\n  It sounds large if your objective was to spend all this money. And we \nknow our Democrat colleagues offered $1 trillion of new spending \nproposals above the budget this year alone. Also, in the last 6 months, \nthe Clinton administration approved, with the Congress, $561 billion in \nnew spending over the next 10 years--almost a third of the tax cut.\n  This is a tax cut America can afford. Even with a trillion dollars of \nnew spending contained in the budget President Bush has proposed, we \nhave a $5.6 trillion surplus. When you take out the amount of the \nsurplus that belongs to Social Security, it is $3.1 trillion. The \nPresident asked for $1.6 trillion. We are giving $1.35 trillion. This \ntax cut is less than half of the unclaimed surplus of the Federal \nGovernment. Since when is giving half the money back to the people who \nearned it irresponsible? I say only if you intended to spend it is that \nirresponsible.\n  You have heard a lot of talk here about 45 percent of Americans get \nno income tax cut. Well, 45 percent of Americans don't pay any income \ntaxes. Income taxes are for taxpayers. You have heard our colleagues \ntalking about, the President of Microsoft is going to get a Lexus. He \nalready has a Lexus. What we are trying to do is reduce the tax burden \nto promote investment and boost the economy.\n  Let me talk about the richest 1 percent, the most maligned people in \nAmerica. The only kind of bigotry that is still acceptable in America \nis not bigotry based on race, or ethnicity, or religion; you are \nrightly ostracized by every right-thinking American if you have bigotry \non that basis. But you can be bigoted on the basis of success. You can \nbe bigoted against the successful and be not only accepted in America \nbut embraced. I believe it is an outrage.\n\n[[Page S5239]]\n\n  In 1981, the top 1 percent of income earners paid 17.9 percent of the \ntax burden. By 1989, it was 25.2. By 1993, it was 29. Today, 35.6 \npercent of all income taxes are paid by the top 1 percent of income \nearners. They earn 17 percent of the income, and they pay 35.6 percent \nof the taxes.\n  Now the President did not propose to reduce that percentage, he \nproposed raising it, because he cut the bottom bracket twice as much as \nthe top bracket. So under his bill this would go up to over 36.5 \npercent. Do you know what our Democrat colleagues say? It is not \nenough. They want to pile a heavier and heavier burden on successful \nAmericans. I think enough is enough. That ought to be rejected.\n  We have reduced the top rate to 36 percent here. It will go down in \nconference. I have tried, finally, to the extent I have had the time, \nto explain the fallacy of their proposal in terms people could \nunderstand. Here is a chart representing an alumni meeting, a class \nreunion of Dimmitt High School, class of 1951. They met in 1991, and \nthey had a $100 lunch. They had five people show up, and they decided \nto divide the cost up. Do you remember Kent Hance from the House? He is \nrich now. Kent paid $60; Sally paid $20; Lamont paid $10; Sue paid $10; \nand Joe, who has done poorly, paid zero.\n  Now they meet again, 10 years later, for their 50th reunion. The \nrestaurant says: We are going to cut the rate $50 because, gosh, it is \ntheir 50th high school reunion. They were paying $100, and now they are \nonly paying $50. They say: All right, let's cut everybody's cost by 50 \npercent. So Kent pays $30, Sally pays $10, Lamont pays $5, Sue pays $5, \nand Joe doesn't pay anything. The Democrats say this is an outrage \nbecause poor Joe gets nothing back, even though the lunch cost has been \ncut in half, $50, and $30 went to Kent, $10 went to Sally, $5 went to \nLamont, Sue got $5, and poor Joe got zip. Is that not an outrage? So \nthey want to break up the class reunion. Their proposal is: Let Kent \npay $50, Sally pay $10, Lamont and Sue pay zero, but they have to give \nJoe $10 back.\n  Would that make any sense to anybody? No.\n\n       Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached \n     chart be included in the Record at the conclusion of my \n     remarks.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Dimmitt High School, Class of 1951\n\n                           40TH REUNION, 1991\n                      [Total cost for lunch: $100]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                Alumnus\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKent...................................          $60  3X Cost.\nSally..................................          $20  Full Cost.\nLamont.................................          $10  Half Cost.\nSue....................................          $10  Half Cost.\nJoe....................................           $0  No Cost.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                           50TH REUNION, 2001\n                       [Total cost for lunch: $50]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Standard reunion: Reduce all payments by    Democratic reunion: Reduce\n                   50%                          all payments by $10\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKent:\n    $30--3X Cost.........................  $50\nSally:\n    $10--Full Cost.......................  $10\nLamont:\n    $5--Half Cost........................  $0\nSue:\n    $5--Half Cost........................  $0\nJoe:\n    $0--No Cost..........................  -$10 (Refund)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I think I have heard it all now. My \ngood friend from Texas is talking about how outraged he is about the \ndiscrimination against the top 1 percent of taxpayers being an outrage.\n  This whole piece of legislation is really a question of a nation's \npriorities. That is basically what we are talking about. This tax \nproposal is irresponsible and unfair. It is irresponsible for the \neconomic reasons that have been spelled out by our colleagues, and it \nis unfair in the way it distributes the resources in this country.\n  You don't have to be a mathematical genius to see the enormous \ndisparities that are growing between the wealthiest and the neediest in \nour society. That has been developing over the period of the last 20 \nyears. There has to be some relief for working families and the middle \nclass. We agree with that. But I do think that the American people want \nto fund education priorities before they give the wealthiest \nindividuals in our society the kinds of tax relief they are receiving.\n  What are the kinds of priorities? We talk about education being \nimportant. We have to bring focus and attention on the investment in \nour children because our children are our future. Investing in our \nchildren is, one, to make sure all children are going to be able to \nhave a headstart experience and are eligible for it. We will have an \namendment on that.\n  Secondly, we are going to have the funding for elementary and \nsecondary education. That means we are going to commit to provide well-\ntrained teachers in the classrooms of this country. We are going to \ngive the option to local school districts to move to smaller class \nsize. We are going to have afterschool programs. We are going to also \nprovide help to local communities that are meeting their \nresponsibilities for special needs children. All of that is going to be \nincluded. We are going to defer the reduction and the highest rates in \nthis proposal until we are able to implement those kinds of \ncommitments.\n  There it is, Madam President. We will have a chance, on the one hand, \nto invest in our future, in our children, and say that this is a \npriority, and defer the reduction for the wealthiest individuals in our \nsociety.\n  This is a question of priorities. It is a question of choice.\n  Finally, I add my strongest support to the amendment that has been \noffered by Senator Rockefeller. Again, it is a question of priorities. \nDo we really mean it when we say we want to provide a prescription drug \nbenefit program for our seniors and for other needy people in our \nsociety?\n  This legislation does not do so. The Finance Committee and the \nRepublican leadership knew how to do it precisely when they wanted the \ntax cut. They knew how to get it, and they set the time and dates to \nget it, but that is not so with regard to a prescription drug program. \nThe Rockefeller amendment does so.\n  I hope our senior citizens know their interests are going to be voted \non this afternoon; not only now, but we are going to have an additional \nseries of votes to make sure this institution has an opportunity to \nmake important choices.\n  This afternoon and tonight, one of the important choices will be: Are \nwe going to really have a meaningful prescription drug program for the \nseniors in this country, which is absolutely essential, particularly \nwhen we realize about whom we are talking. We are talking about the \naverage senior being 76 years old, widowed, and having important health \nneeds that can be addressed by prescription drugs.\n  The Rockefeller amendment addresses that, and I again say this is an \nissue of choice. It is an issue of priorities. Do we want to say it is \nmore important to invest in our children, invest in our future, defer \nthe reductions for the wealthiest individuals who have done exceedingly \nwell over the years? Do we want to make a commitment to our senior \ncitizens in getting a prescription drug program?\n  Those are important priorities. Those are important choices. Those \nare issues that are going to be before the Senate. I am hopeful this \nbody will reflect what is in the real national interest and support \nthose amendments. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I offer 2 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware, Mr. Carper, and 2 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island, \nMr. Chafee. It is my understanding they have an amendment they will \noffer at a subsequent time, so 2 minutes to the Senator from Delaware \nand 2 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. Later \nthis evening, Senator Chafee and I will offer an amendment to the tax \nbill that\n\n[[Page S5240]]\n\nwe believe is consistent with the budget resolution that passed this \nChamber roughly a month ago with 65 affirmative votes, including votes \nof 15 Democrats, including this Senator.\n  That budget resolution provided for a tax cut over the next 10 years \nof about $1.2 trillion, and it also provided for an extra $300 billion \nabove the baseline for educational programs, including Head Start, \nspecial education, title I, extra learning time programs.\n  When the budget resolution came back to us from conference, the tax \ncut had grown larger by about $150 billion, and the education moneys we \nadded were gone.\n  Senator Chafee and I will offer this amendment in an effort to get us \nback to where we thought we ought to be and still believe we ought to \nbe as a body and as a country, and that is to have a tax cut of $1.2 \ntrillion over the next 10 years and provide an extra $150 billion above \nthe baseline for education funding.\n  I want to mention a couple provisions of the amendment. For example, \nwe create a new 10-percent tax bracket that will be effective at the \nbeginning of this year.\n  We also cut marginal rates for each of the other tax brackets by 1 \npercent. The lowest rate of 15 percent would drop to 14 percent. The \ntop rate of 39.6 would come down to 38.6. It is an incremental approach \nto tax cutting that I believe is more reasonable.\n  We also anticipate further reductions later, but we visit with the \nnew economic status a couple of years down the line and consider those \nfurther changes at that time.\n  We further propose to take the marriage penalty relief this bill \noffers, to move it up in time, provide estate tax relief, doubling the \nestate tax exclusion, and then indexing it to the rate of inflation as \nwe go forward.\n  We double the child tax credit and make it partially refundable, \nprovide a college tuition tax deduction of $5,000 per year, and take \nthe retirement savings incentives that are in this bill and include \nthose in our own amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired. The \nSenator from Rhode Island is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I commend Senator Grassley and Senator \nBaucus for their hard work on this tax package. I know they have worked \nhard to forge a bipartisan tax package and worked hard to make that \nhappen. However, I will join Senator Carper in offering an amendment \nwhich will reduce the size of the tax cut to $1.2 trillion.\n  The reason I join Senator Carper is I believe there is a whole \npopulation forgotten in this tax debate, and that is the property-tax \npayer. Of course, one of the Federal mandates that is the hardest and \nmost onerous on the property-tax payers is the special education costs.\n  The Supreme Court ruled in the early seventies that all students have \nto be educated in the public school system. Congress acted by passing \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act which said we will get \nthe funding up to 40 percent. Of course, we have never gotten above 12, \n13, 14 percent, and there is a very onerous cost to the communities in \nproperty taxes.\n  We are proposing to reduce this to $1.2 trillion which, of course, \nleaves about $150 billion available for the property tax relief. That \nshould be done on IDEA.\n  Property taxes are the most difficult on communities and on \nindividuals because with an income tax, if one's fortunes decline, one \npays less income tax. On a sales tax, if one does do not want to \npurchase goods, one pays less in sales tax.\n  With a property tax, it is most onerous because it is always there. \nWhether your fortunes decline, lose a job, lose a spouse, the income \npart of your property-tax-paying abilities, and also if you become \nelderly and want to keep your house, of course, that property tax is \nalways there.\n  We are not talking about taxes. We need help for the property-tax \npayers by leaving money available to give relief in IDEA, something we \npromised in the early seventies, passed in 1975, and we have not done \nit.\n  If we are not doing it with the surpluses we have, we will never do \nit. A vote for the Carper-Chafee amendment is a vote for property tax \nrelief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the manager of the \nbill on the minority side, Senator Baucus from Montana, who has worked \nso hard for so many weeks on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Nevada who has \nworked very hard in maintaining order in the Chamber. He has done a \nterrific job, and I compliment him.\n  I start by expressing my respect for Senators, especially on the \nDemocratic side, who made arguments against the bill and have proposed \namendments to it.\n  As the chairman of the committee and I have both said, this bill is a \ncompromise. It is not perfect. It is not what anybody would want if he \nor she were writing it, but it is a compromise. There has been a lot of \ngive and take. Nobody got everything he or she wanted because that is \nwhat compromises are all about.\n  It is almost inevitable that there will be legitimate, good-faith \ndisagreements about the resulting bill. This is a tax bill. There are \nlots of points of view. It is very complicated. There are going to be \nvery passionate arguments made about various provisions of this bill on \nboth sides.\n  On top of that, we have been debating under very stringent \nconditions; that is, constraints of reconciliation. This debate is \nrushed. It is hard to get revenue estimates. Many Senators have come to \nme and said it is difficult to get revenue estimates from joint tax. I \nwish we were not in such a rush mode. I wish this bill could have been \ndebated more thoroughly, but that is not with what we are faced. I \nunderstand the frustrations many of my colleagues have.\n  I also say the criticisms of the bill are very well intended. I \nappreciate how thoughtful Senators have been in this debate. I \nespecially thank the Democratic leader. As my colleagues will soon \nhear, he is no fan of this bill, but while voicing his strong opinions, \nhe has fully respected other points of view, and that, to my mind, is \nthe essence of leadership, and I highly compliment him.\n  My point is this: This is a much better bill than that proposed by \nthe administration.\n  Some may vote no against this bill because the amount is too high, \nthere is not a tax cut not too great. I respect that. I think the \namount in this bill could be a bit lower. I am concerned about the size \nof the tax cut, as well.\n  Given the budget resolution providing for $1.35 trillion over 11 \nyears, I think this is a much better bill than we would have had if \nSenator Grassley and I had not been negotiating to get a compromise. \nOtherwise, we would be faced on this floor with another bill, a bill \nthat is probably the administration bill or something very close to it.\n  I say to my friends, particularly on the Democratic side of the \naisle, there are two choices. One is to vote against the bill because \nthe tax cut is too large, a view which I respect; the other is to vote \nfor it because it is a lot better than what we otherwise would be \nfacing on the floor. It is much more progressive. There are many very \ngood provisions in the bill. The education provisions, for example, the \n10-percent bracket which is made retroactive to the beginning of this \nyear. It is much better than the bill we otherwise would have.\n  The single biggest part of this tax cut is the $435 billion provision \nthat provides for a cut from the 15-percent rate to the 10-percent \nrate. That is the biggest single provision in this bill. As a \nconsequence, 75 percent of this tax cut in this bill goes to people who \nearn $75,000 or less. We also double the child credit and make it \npartly refundable, covering 16 million more children than the \nPresident's proposal. We expand and simplify the earned-income credit \nwhich may be the best program ever created to help lower income working \nfamilies. These are for working families. This is not welfare but \nworking families.\n  We include a $35 billion package of education incentives. For the \nfirst time, one can deduct college tuition, up to $5,000. That is a \ngood start, one of which I think all will be proud. We expand IRAs, \nexpand 401(k)s. We reduce\n\n[[Page S5241]]\n\nthe marriage penalty. We address the Federal estate tax. These are a \nlot of the provisions.\n  What is the practical effect? Under this bill, every individual and \nfamily who pays income tax will get a tax cut. That is more than 100 \nmillion individuals and families. Another 10 million get a higher tax \nrefund because of refundable credits. That reduces the payroll tax. \nThere are a lot of Americans whose bigger tax is the payroll tax \ncompared to income tax. That helps them directly.\n  Nineteen million taxpayers at the lower end of the income scale have \nmarginal rates reduced from 15 percent to 10 percent. That is by a \nthird. That is not an unimportant point. There is a lot of talk about \nthe marginal rate, particularly at the top end. Let me repeat, for \nlower income taxpayers, the marginal rates, for 19 million taxpayers, \nare reduced by a full one-third. Not 1 percent but 33 percent.\n  Thirty million families get a higher child credit. For 10 million, \nthe credit is refundable. Four million low-income couples benefit from \nexpansion of the earned-income tax credit. Three million benefit from \nthe higher standard deduction. Forty million couples get relief from \nthe marriage penalty. That is 40 million, no small number. Two million \ntaxpayers benefit from the IRA limits. Another 8 million benefit from \nthe new low-income saver credit. Twelve million seniors pay lower taxes \non their Social Security income.\n  I could go on. There are many other provisions in this bill that are \nvery good. Some Senators criticized certain parts of the bill, but I \nthink it is important to know there are also many provisions that are \ngood in the bill, and those Senators who criticize the bill do not \nmention a lot of the provisions which I think otherwise they would also \nsupport.\n\n  The present proposal may have been targeted to upper income \ntaxpayers. This bill is not. It is written in a balanced way, and it \ncuts taxes and creates incentives for all Americans.\n  All in all, taking both income and payroll taxes into account, this \nbill makes our tax system more progressive than the administration's \nbill. Every income group under $75,000 will pay a lower percentage of \ntheir overall tax burden. Every income group over $100,000 will pay a \nhigher percentage of the overall tax burden than contained in the \nPresident's proposal. This bill, regarding income taxes and payroll \ntaxes, is more progressive than the President's proposal.\n  Now, briefly, the prospects for conference. It is common to say at \nthis point in the process the Senate bill constitutes a very delicate \nbalance and that nothing can be changed without jeopardizing the \nprospect of getting a bipartisan bill enacted into law. This time it \nhappens to be true. The Senate is divided, 50/50. On our side of the \naisle, there is some support for the bill, but it hinges on a series of \ncareful changes that we made to provide that balance. If, in \nconference, that balance is lost, the prospects for passing the \nconference report may be lost, as well. I hope that does not happen.\n  In conclusion, this bill is not perfect but it is balanced. It is a \ncompromise. It is good for taxpayers. It is good for working families. \nIt is good for the economy. I strongly urge Senators to support the \nbill.\n  In conclusion, I pay my highest compliments to the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Grassley, who has worked more in good faith and back \nand forth, to and fro, frankly, than any other Senator I can think of \nin any other situation. He is a real credit to the State of Iowa and a \nreal credit to the United States of America. I thank him for his \ncooperation and working together to get this bill where it is.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n       The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself 7 minutes of the 19 remaining minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 19 minutes remaining, that is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from Montana for his compliment. I \nhave said many times on the floor of the Senate, we are here with a \nbipartisan bill only because of his willingness to work with us and our \ndesire to have a bipartisan bill as opposed to a partisan debate. I \nthink that is the way the Senate Finance Committee normally works. I am \nglad to have it work in this particular instance.\n  As we come to the end of our 20 hours of deliberation and begin \nvoting on amendments, I want to make some final comments.\n  This is a bipartisan effort. This bill was drafted in concert with \nSenator Baucus and with the benefit of the comments of all the members \nof the Finance Committee with whom I consulted personally.\n  We took as a starting point President Bush's efforts to provide \nincome tax relief to all Americans. This legislation includes the four \nmain elements of President Bush's goals of providing tax relief to \nworking men and women.\n  First, this legislation reduces marginal rates at all levels and \ncreates the new 10 percent level proposed by the President. While we \ndon't go as far as the President in reducing the top rates--and I would \nadd we didn't go as far as I would like--we also began to address the \nhidden marginal rate increases such as PEPS and PEASE that complicate \nthe code.\n  As I said earlier today, America is a society of opportunity. Over 60 \npercent of all families will at one time or another be in the top fifth \nof income in this country. A man will make more at 55, after 30 years \nof hard work, then he did at 25. A family should not face a crushing \nmarginal rate tax burden when they finally get a good paycheck for a \nfew years as a reward for many, many years of hard work.\n  Second, we provide income tax relief for married families--for \nfamilies where both spouses work and where only one spouse works. In \naddition, thanks to the strong advocacy of Senator Jeffords, we expand \nthe earned income credit for married families with children. Further, \nthere was wide bipartisan agreement to simplify the earned income \ncredit which will mean that hundreds of thousands of more children will \nreceive the EIC benefits.\n  Third, the President's desire to expand the child credit to $1,000 is \nmet in this bill. And in response to the concerns of Senators Snowe, \nLincoln, Breaux, Jeffords, and Kerry the child credit was expanded to \nhelp millions of children whose working parents do not pay income tax.\n  Fourth, the burden of the death tax is reduced and finally \neliminated--as called for by President Bush. The committee was \nsuccessful in this effort due to the work of many Senators but I would \nparticularly note the efforts of Senators Kyl and Lincoln.\n  Thus, this bill contains the four main elements of President Bush's \nefforts to provide tax relief for working families--marginal rate \nreduction, relief for married families, the expansion of the child \ncredit and the reduction and ultimate elimination of the death tax.\n  I remind my colleagues again that the hallmark of this bill is that \nrelief for low income families comes first. The marginal rate drop to \n10 percent is immediate, the child credit expansion to low income \nfamilies is immediate, the expansion of EIC is immediate.\n  In addition, the numbers show that the Finance Committee took \nPresident Bush's proposal--which was already quite progressive as \ncompared to current law--that is, at the end of the day upper income \nfamilies would be paying a greater share of taxes than lower income--\nand the Finance Committee made the President's proposal even more \nprogressive.\n  The greater progressivity and ensuring that low income families are \nfirst in receiving the benefits of the tax cut is certainly due in no \nsmall part to the work of Senator Baucus.\n  So I am somewhat chagrined, reading in the press the constant carping \nof Senator Baucus' efforts to draft a bipartisan bill. It seems that \nwhile many are happy to talk about bipartisanship that can't stand to \nsee bipartisanship practiced.\n  I can assure my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that if \nSenator Baucus had not been present at the creation of this bill--it \nwould have been a very different piece of legislation. It is because of \nhis efforts that there are many elements in the RELIEF Act that members \non the other side of the aisle can enthusiastically support.\n  In addition to President Bush's proposals to provide tax relief to \nworking families, the Finance Committee also included legislation that \nhad already been considered by the Finance Committee earlier this year \nor last year.\n\n[[Page S5242]]\n\n  I believe that not all good ideas come from just one end of \nPennsylvania Avenue. Thus, we included the Grassley/Baucus pension \nreform legislation which probably would not have made it in the bill \nwithout the longtime support of Senators Hatch, Jeffords, and Graham.\n  In addition, the bill contains over $30 billion targeted for \neducation. elements of this include language to expand the prepaid \ntuition programs to help families pay for college--long advocated by \nSenators Collins, McConnell, and Sessions. In addition, we provide \ncollege tuition deduction thanks to Senators Torricelli, Snowe, and \nJeffords, private activity bonds for school construction in response to \nSenator Graham's concerns, as well as an expansion of the education \nsavings accounts--in honor of Senator Coverdell--thanks to the work of \nSenator Torricelli and the majority leaders.\n  As I have said all along, no once got everything they wanted in this \nbill, including the chairman. But I do believe that everyone got \nsomething that they believe is important included in the RELIEF Act.\n  I have provided this outline of the legislation to remind Senators of \nthe balanced approach that took place in crafting this legislation; to \nhighlight the fact that it reflects the views and priorities of a wide \nrange of members of the committee on both sides of the aisle; and, to \nexplain why the RELIEF Act took the form it did.\n  But setting aside the priorities and concerns of Senators, none of us \nshould forget the great winners of the RELIEF Act--the American \ntaxpayer. We are providing the American taxpayer the greatest amount of \ntax relief in a generation. And they deserve it. It is wrong that in a \ntime of surplus we are still imposing a record tax burden on workers.\n  With passage of the RELIEF Act struggling families will have more \nmoney to make ends meet; parents and students will be able to more \neasily afford the costs of a college education; a successful business \nwoman will be able to expand and hire more people; a father finally \ngetting a good paycheck after years of work will be able to better \nprovide for his aging mother; and, a farmer can pass on the family farm \nwithout his children having to sell half the land to pay estate taxes.\n  The examples are endless of the great benefits that we realize when \nwe give tax relief to working families.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the RELIEF Act for working families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 685, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. I send a modification of an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator Evan Bayh and others.\n  I ask the modification be reported on behalf of Senator Bayh.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A \n     joint resolution considered under this subclause shall not be \n     advanced to third reading in either House unless a motion to \n     proceed to third reading is agreed to by a majority of the \n     whole body.\n       (bb) For purposes of this subclause, a period of low growth \n     occurs when the most recent of the Department of Commerce's \n     advance, preliminary, or final reports of actual real \n     economic growth indicate that the rate of real economic \n     growth (as measured by real GDP) for each of the most \n     recently reported quarter and the immediately preceding \n     quarter is less than 1 percent.\n\n       (B) Other fiscal years.--\n       (i) In general.--In fiscal year 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, \n     2009, or 2010, if the level of debt held by the public at the \n     end of the preceding fiscal year, as determined by the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, would exceed the debt target for \n     that fiscal year in section 253A(a) of the Balanced Budget \n     and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 as a result of the \n     effect of the triggering of paragraphs (3) and (4), any \n     Member of Congress may move to proceed to a bill that would \n     defer changes in law that take effect in that fiscal year \n     that would increase direct spending (except for automatic or \n     annually enacted cost of living adjustments for benefits \n     enacted prior to the date of enactment of this Act) and \n     decrease revenues and freeze the amount of discretionary \n     spending in each discretionary spending account for that \n     fiscal year at the level provided for that account in the \n     preceding fiscal year plus an adjustment for inflation (all \n     proportionately) in a manner that would reduce the debt held \n     by the public for that fiscal year to a level not exceeding \n     the level provided in section 253A(a) of the Balanced Budget \n     and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The motion to \n     proceed shall be voted on at the end of 4 hours of debate. \n     Any amendment offered to the bill shall either defer \n     effective dates or adjust discretionary spending and maintain \n     the proportionality requirement.\n       (ii) Consideration of legislation.--A bill considered under \n     clause (i) shall be considered as provided in sections 310(e) \n     and 313 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. \n     641(e) and 644).\n       (b) Public Debt Targets.--The Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended--\n       (1) in section 250(c)(1), by inserting `` ` debt held by \n     the public' '' after ``outlays', ''; and\n       (2) by inserting after section 253 the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 253A.

Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n2 minutes. The Chair yields the Senator from New Jersey an additional \nminute.\n\n\n                            Motion To Commit\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Corzine] moves to commit \n     the pending legislation to the Finance Committee, with \n     instructions to report back within three days, with an \n     amendment that eliminates income tax reductions for \n     taxpayers with annual incomes greater than $500,000 and \n     reserves all resulting savings to provide a tax credit to \n     help families afford the costs of long-term health care.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. As my colleagues just heard, this motion would commit \nthe bill to the Finance Committee and direct it to report back promptly \nwith an amendment that eliminates an income tax for those earning more \nthan $500,000 a year, and use those savings to establish a tax credit \nto help families afford the cost of long-term care.\n  Before I explain the need for my motion, let me first commend \nSenators Grassley and Graham of Florida, who have provided true \nleadership on a critical issue for seniors across America, the issue of \nlong-term care.\n  This motion does not require adoption of their specific approach, \nthough I am proud to support their bill which would provide a $3,000 \ntax credit for long-term care expenses.\n  Now is the time to address America's long-term health care needs, \nbefore we approve one of the largest, and I believe one of the most \ninequitable, tax cuts that we could bring before the country, a tax cut \nthat would undermine the largest surplus ever and prevent us from \nmeeting critical health care needs, particularly for our seniors.\n  Over 12 million seniors and disabled Americans need long-term care, \nand as many as twice that number may need it as the population ages, as \nthe baby boomers retire. Families who are primary caregivers pay a \ntremendous price for this care. I believe no one should have to go \nbankrupt or stress their budgets to afford long-term care and no family \nshould bear the burden alone.\n  Long-term care should not be just a privilege for the wealthy. A tax \ncredit, as I propose, would provide much needed relief to the families \nwho provide long-term care for their loved ones. It is to ensure a \nbetter and fairer use of the surplus than a rate cut targeted for the \nvery wealthiest Americans.\n  This is not about class warfare. This is about providing relief for \nour elderly and for the overburdened families who care for them.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree that we should not provide a windfall \nfor those earning more than $\\1/2\\ million a year while ignoring the \nvery real needs of so many families and the loved ones for whom they \nstruggle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New \nYork, Mrs. Clinton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, let me begin by commending Chairman \nGrassley and Ranking Member Baucus for the hard work they have put in \non this very difficult assignment. I appreciate greatly their efforts.\n  It pains me that I rise in opposition to the bill which they have \npresented and that we will be voting on later this evening.\n  I wish I could support this bill. I wish I could support it because I \nbelieve in affordable, reasonable tax cuts. I believe in continuing to \npay down our budget debt. And I believe in making the kinds of \ninvestments that will enable our country to be richer and stronger and \nsmarter.\n  However, it is my analysis that, unfortunately, this bill does not \nmeet those criteria. What bothers me is that, despite the pressures \nthat have been working on the Finance Committee to come up with the \nbest possible alternative in a bipartisan way, which they just labored \nso hard to do, we read there will be additional requests for tax cuts \ncoming down the road, and that there will be additional dollars \nrequested, which might very well be fully justified, to raise our \ndefense expenditures.\n  It bothers me that we see, in the bill that has been presented to us, \nthat it will be very difficult to find the resources we need for the \ninvestments that I think everyone in this Chamber knows are demanded by \nthe people we represent: investments in education, investments in \nhealth care, such as a prescription drug benefit, or, as my colleague \nfrom New Jersey rightly pointed out, a long-term care tax credit.\n  I am concerned that, in fact, this bill does squeeze out the \nopportunity that we have to address, in a realistic way, our energy \nneeds, as well as the other priorities I have mentioned.\n  There are several considerations that are very important to the \npeople I represent. It is very difficult to look at\n\n[[Page S5244]]\n\nthis tax bill, without adequate alternative minimum tax reform, and not \nrealize that we are going to be pushing millions of Americans, many of \nthem New Yorkers, into a higher tax bracket.\n  The Joint Tax Committee estimates that 40 million taxpayers will be \nsubject to the AMT after the tax bill, now debated, is fully phased in. \nThat will have a tremendous impact. It will be a rude surprise for many \ncitizens in New York, California, Connecticut, Wisconsin, Oregon, and \nother States when they find they do not really gain much from this tax \nbill but, in fact, they get a higher tax bill.\n  I am also concerned that due to repeal of the estate tax, and the \nearlier elimination of the State credit from the estate tax, we are \ngoing to find States such as New York in a terrible budgetary dilemma. \nThey are going to be losing dollars from the State side of the estate \ntax before the Federal Government loses the revenues in 2011.\n  In some States that will be an incredible burden: several percentage \npoints out of their revenue base where they would have to find some way \nto amend their constitution or find new revenues. It seems eminently \nunfair for the Federal Government to be able to shift that burden to \nthe backs of the States with so little warning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used her 3 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the Senator 1 more minute.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. This reminds me of what we went through in 1981, so I \nwent back and read the account. I wish my colleagues would recall what \nDavid Stockman said in December of 1981. He said:\n\n       The reason we did it wrong . . . was that we said, Hey, we \n     have to get a program out fast. And when you decide to put a \n     program of this breadth and depth out fast, you can only do \n     so much . . . . We didn't think it all the way through. We \n     didn't add up all the numbers. We didn't make all the \n     thorough, comprehensive calculations about where we really \n     needed to come out. . . . In other words, we ended up with a \n     list that I'd always been carrying of things to be done, \n     rather than starting the other way and asking, What is the \n     overall fiscal policy required to reach the target?\n\n  I am afraid that is what we are doing again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I intend to use my 10 minutes this way, so if anybody \nelse is planning to speak, they will know time is used up: 3 minutes to \nthe Senator from Virginia, and 7 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, Senator Grassley, and \nthe ranking member, Senator Baucus, as well as their staffs, for their \nhard work and dedication on this tax bill, but, in particular, I thank \nthem for working with me to include an amendment, No. 673, which is my \neducation opportunity tax relief amendment.\n  This bill, with the education savings account, will be a good help \nfor parents who have children in kindergarten through the 12th grade.\n  The education savings accounts previously were only available for \nthose who had children in college or a university. It is now expanded \nfor K-12, for up to $2,000 a year that you can get in tax relief for \nthat allocation of your funds, reducing your taxes, and making it a \ntax-free withdrawal for education-related expenses.\n  What my amendment makes clear is that if a parent with a child in K-\n12 wants to buy their child a computer or educational software, or \nInternet access at home, that is permissible. The way the measure right \nnow is worded, very few schools--certainly not public schools--would \nactually require parents to purchase a computer or education-related \ntechnology as a term of enrollment. So what this does is empower \nparents to purchase those computers or educational software or Internet \naccess.\n  It is very important for us to understand that computers are \nimportant in schools, in community centers, and in libraries, but \ncomputers need to be in the home. Studies show that children who have \ncomputers at home stay in school, do better academically, and go on to \nbetter jobs because they are more technologically proficient.\n  This is an idea which will specifically allow parents of K-12 school-\naged children to use education savings accounts for the purchase of \ncomputers, related technology, and peripherals, educational software, \nand Internet access. And the purchase would not need to be a \nrequirement of enrollment or attendance at a school.\n  This also is supported by many groups in the technology area, such as \nthe Information Technology Industry Council, the Computer and \nCommunications Industry Association, Global Learning Systems, and many \nothers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters I have in support be printed in \nthe Record immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALLEN. So, Mr. President, and Members of the Senate, I thank you \nall for working with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator 15 seconds.\n  Mr. ALLEN. This amendment we are working on in a bipartisan manner is \nsupported by parents and the technology community, and it will be \nbeneficial to the schoolchildren all across America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank both mangers of the bill.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                         ITT Industries, Inc.,\n\n                                 White Plains, NY, April 12, 2001.\n     Ms. Rachael Bohlander,\n     Legislative Assistant, Office of Senator George Allen,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Bohlander: I write to thank you for your recent \n     communication to ITT Industries concerning the Education \n     Opportunity Tax Credit Act, a bill introduced by Senator \n     Allen to provide educational assistance through tax credits \n     and for other purposes.\n       ITT Industries strongly favors efforts to strengthen \n     education in the United States. As a global engineering and \n     manufacturing company with nearly 19,000 employees in this \n     country, ITT Industries shares Senator Allen's interest in \n     assisting American students to prepare for technology jobs in \n     the digital economy. We are also following the \n     administration's proposals concerning education, and will \n     take appropriate account of Senator Allen's initiative.\n       Thank you for bringing Senator Allen's bill to our \n     attention.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                             Thomas R. Martin,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Director of Corporate Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        GlobalLearningSystems,\n\n                                                       McLean, VA.\n     Hon. George F. Allen,\n     U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allen: On behalf of \n     GlobalLearningSystemsTM, I would like to express \n     our enthusiastic support for your recently introduced \n     legislation, S. 488, The Education Opportunity Tax Credit \n     Act.\n       This bill addresses major education concerns as well as the \n     looming Digital Divide, which hinders not only students, but \n     also their parents. Access to the Internet is a growing \n     necessity of everyday life. For those with modest means, your \n     forward-looking legislation assures that no family's children \n     will be left behind because they did not have the basic tools \n     to keep up.\n       Since we are a global learning and e-Learning company, we \n     particularly appreciate the impact of the inclusion of e-\n     Learning services in the provisions of the bill, which can \n     improve the success possibilities for all students. For the \n     first time, we can tailor learning to the need of the \n     individual student and make learning the motivating \n     experience all parents seek for their children.\n       Again, let me congratulate you for making such a positive \n     legislative statement with the introduction of S. 488.\n       With best wishes for your continuing efforts.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                                  Scott Sobel,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Communications and Marketing.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Information Technology\n\n\n                                             Industry Council,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2001.\n     Senator George Allen,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allen: The Information Technology Industry \n     Council (ITI) would like to applaud your leadership in \n     introducing S. 488, the Education Opportunity Tax Credit Act. \n     ITI recognizes that the success of our nation and its \n     continued global leadership in information technology depends \n     upon our ability to equip all of our children with 21st \n     century skills. S. 488 takes important steps towards \n     achieving that goal.\n       ITI is the association of leading information technology \n     companies, employing more\n\n[[Page S5245]]\n\n      than 1.3 million people in the United States and generating \n     $633 billion in worldwide revenues in 1999. ITI's member \n     companies have a long history of working with local school \n     systems to introduce technology into the learning environment \n     and have committeed over $1 billion to provide students, \n     teachers and schools with the equipment and training they \n     need to make the most of technology.\n       ITI has adopted education principles recognizing the \n     importance of integrating technology into the curriculum and \n     providing students access to that technology. In addition, \n     recent studies have shown that access to technology outside \n     the classroom can increase the benefits students get from \n     having technology in the classroom. Your legislation \n     recognizes this value and helps to bring that digital \n     opportunity to a greater number of students.\n       We look forward to working with you on this issue. If you \n     have any question please contact me or Matt Tanielian of my \n     staff at (202) 626-5751.\n           Best regards,\n                                                     Rhett Dawson,\n                                                        President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield time to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for \n6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator \nGrassley, for his leadership on this bill, as well as Senator Baucus. I \nthink they have managed it very well, both in committee and on the \nfloor.\n  I also would like to inform our colleagues that we are going to begin \na series of rollcall votes at about 6 o'clock. I urge Members to come \nto the Chamber and stay in the Chamber. We are going to have these \namendments within a strict timeframe. My guess is there will be 10 or \n12 minutes, and they will be enforced.\n  Again, our colleagues should be aware that these votes will start and \nbegin probably about 6 o'clock, and we are going to have numerous \nrollcalls, probably a lot more than we need. I urge my colleagues, many \nof whom offered amendments, to accept voice votes, if possible.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this package. It is not \nperfect. I have heard some people say it is too big. I disagree. This \nis a very timid package. This is about one-fourth of the surplus. I \nheard a couple of our colleagues say: Wait a minute, maybe we are \nreenacting the mistakes made in 1981, the massive tax cuts in 1981.\n  I looked at the amount of money we raised in 1980 from all sources in \nthe Federal Government. It was $517 billion. In 1990, the Federal \nGovernment raised over $1 trillion. It doubled in that 10-year period \nof time, the revenues that came in.\n  What happened in that interim is that spending went up even faster \nthan revenues. So I don't think it was because of the tax cuts, \nalthough we had a very significant tax cut. If you look at the 1981 tax \nbill, the 1986 tax bill, you saw maximum rates go down significantly. \nAll taxpayers had significant rate reductions. The maximum rate was 70 \npercent in 1980. It was 28 percent in 1988. So it was a big change.\n  This bill is much more timid. And for those who are saying we have \ncut too much for the wealthy, I don't think they have read the bill. \nThe maximum tax rate under the income-tax code right now is 39.6 \npercent. Guess what it will be in December of the year 2004, after this \nmassive tax cut. It will be 38.6 percent. It will go down one point. \nHow much did it increase in the 1993 tax increase? The maximum tax rate \nthen went from 31 percent to 39.6. It went up 8.6 points. In addition, \nwhat used to be a cap on the Medicare tax was eliminated. So you can \nadd another 1.45 for an individual. You can double that for a couple, \nso that is another 2.9.\n  So the effect of the 1993 tax increase was moving the maximum rate \nfrom 31 percent to 42.5 percent. That is an 11.5-point increase for \nmaximum taxpayers.\n  This bill, in the first 4 years, reduces that only 1 point, only one-\ntenth as much as the increase that we had, and it just so happens the \nincrease in 1993 was retroactive back to January of 1993.\n  So my point is, this is a very timid tax cut compared to the tax \nincrease we had in 1993. Those are just the facts.\n  We are slow, very slow in phasing in the tax cuts, the rate cuts for \nall taxpayers. They are not fully in effect until the year 2007.\n  I hope we can accelerate that. It takes us too long to get there. But \nI make this point because I keep seeing amendments: We will delay the \neffective date for the high tax payers. I guess they don't want to give \ntaxpayers tax cuts. I don't follow that. It is like using the Tax Code \nonly for redistribution of wealth. Let's load up more on the low-income \nside.\n  The bill we have before us does a lot for low-income taxpayers. It \ncreates a 10-percent rate. Those taxpayers were paying 15 percent. That \nis a 33-percent reduction. That is $600 in savings for taxpayers on the \nlow-income scale,\n\n[[Page S5246]]\n\nmarried couples. That is $600 more that they get to keep if they have \n$12,000 in adjusted taxable income. That is very positive. So that is \nweighted toward the low income.\n  There is also a $500 tax credit per child. We passed the first $500 \ntax credit per child in 1997. That is very positive. If you have four \nkids, as do I--they are grown now, so I don't get it--who are \ndependents, that is $2,000. Over the period of this bill we double \nthat. So we make it a $1,000 tax credit per child. This bill even makes \nit refundable. I don't think that is very good policy, but it is in \nthis bill.\n\n  So my point is, this bill is loaded very much towards low-income \ngroups. For those people who say we want to load it more, I disagree. \nWe ought to have a tax cut for taxpayers. The greatest percentage of \ntax reduction definitely goes towards low- and middle-income taxpayers \nin this group.\n  Certainly, individuals who have kids, certainly individuals who are \npaying that 15-percent rate, who have income on the lower side, they \nget a very significant rate reduction. And they get it retroactive to \nJanuary 1 of this year. All other taxpayers don't get a rate reduction \nuntil January of next year and only one point. In some cases, that is \nonly one-tenth of the increase they had in 1993.\n  This bill does a lot of other things that will benefit families. It \nhas educational tax provisions. It has savings provisions dealing with \nIRAs, education, making savings more affordable, enhancing individual \npensions. It does other things, including the death tax. I started to \nsay death tax repeal, but that is not until the year 2001. It does \nincrease the exemption amount or the unified credit amount up to $1 \nmillion, $2 million, $3 million, $4 million in the ninth year--that is \na positive provision--and ultimately repeal. So we don't penalize \nsomebody for dying. The taxable event would not be when somebody died. \nThe taxable event would be when the property is sold, and then that tax \nrate would be at the capital gains rate. It wouldn't be at these \nunbelievably high and punitive rates of 55 percent that are now present \nlaw.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of final passage of this bill. \nLet's give taxpayers relief. It is long overdue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time controlled by the majority has \nexpired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the bill?\n  Mr. REID. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nCorzine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the overall bill. I \ncongratulate Senators Grassley and Baucus for their effort at \nbipartisanship to put together a very complicated and difficult piece \nof legislation.\n  I also have serious reservations which lead to a conclusion that I \nthink we are overreaching, far overreaching relative to our financial \nstability. My read of this particular piece of legislation is that it \nwill potentially bring grave concerns to marketplaces around the world \nwhen people do the analyses and see the great depth of backloaded tax \ncuts that are embedded in the bill. It is a very serious concern, \nparticularly in a country that has been running the kinds of serious \ncurrent account deficits that we have had over the last few years. That \nbacks into concerns about our bond markets, as people analyze these \nnumbers and see how they fit together, particularly in the context of \nan upcoming increase in defense expenditures that have not been allowed \nfor in this bill.\n  I have very serious concerns that we will return to periods of \ndeficits--some say a ``deficit ditch.'' I think we need to be very \nmindful of that tonight as we go to the vote.\n  It is more than just the principles that are involved, which I have \nserious concerns with, too, about the distribution, who gets the \nbenefit. I think there are serious concerns about the financial \nunderpinnings that this will provide for our Nation in the years ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield such time as we have remaining to \nthe Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 676\n\n  (Purpose: To allow a credit to holders of qualified bonds issued by \n                    Amtrak, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I send up amendment No. 676.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for Mr. Biden, for \n     himself, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Baucus, \n     Mr. Allen, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Carper, Mr. Chafee, Mrs. Clinton, \n     Mr. Corzine, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Leahy, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \n     Specter, Mr. Warner, Ms. Collins, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Reid, and Mr. \n     Wellstone, proposes amendment numbered 676.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted and Proposed.'')\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 676, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is the High-Speed Rail Investment \nAct. I have worked with Senator Biden to help work out provisions to \nmake it acceptable to me, at least with respect to not infringing on \nthe highway trust fund. I support the latest amendment, but it is not \ngermane to the bill. I now withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn. \nThe Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 656\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield that time and defer to the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire who has 5 minutes under the agreement previously \nentered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Are we now back on my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators Gregg, \nEnsign, Allen, Bunning, and other in offering this capital gains tax \nrate reduction. This will provide an immediate stimulus to the economy, \nthere is no tax cut out there that can do a better job of heading off a \nrecession. A capital gains tax rate cut will encourage saving and \ninvestment in our economy. It will help entrepreneurs to start \nbusinesses and create jobs. The capital gains tax cut will raise \nrevenue for the federal government. After we cut the rate in 1997, the \nfederal government received $200 billion in additional revenue. In just \nfour years, we have $200 billion more than forecast before the rate \ncut. The tax cut will increase economic growth, increase revenues and \nreward investment in our economy. I urge my colleagues to support this \nreduction in the capital gains tax rate from 20 percent to 15 percent.\n  I think this is one of the most substantial things we can do to, \nagain, head off a recession in our economy.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the pending \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment of the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Under the order, how much time does the Senator have and \nhow much time is allocated to those in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 3 minutes. The \nSenator from New Hampshire has 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: The Senator from New \nHampshire----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Montana yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from New Hampshire had 5 minutes. He yielded 2 \nminutes. How can he end up with 5\\1/2\\ now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada yielded 3 minutes to \nthe Senator----\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Nevada yielded his time back on the bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think we can straighten this out. I ask unanimous \nconsent\n\n[[Page S5247]]\n\nthat the Senator from Montana have 3 minutes and I have 3 minutes and \nwe then move to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will use a \nbrief part of my leader time to outline the schedule of how we will \nproceed tonight after the other two speakers have spoken. I withdraw my \nreservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The pending amendment is the amendment offered by Senator \nGregg, No. 656. At the appropriate time, I am going to make a point of \norder against the amendment. On the substance, I might add, however, \nthat there are no capital gains provisions in the President's proposed \ntax cut bill. This would be adding a whole new subject, which, frankly, \nis difficult for us in the committee to incorporate along with the \nother provisions we have in the bill.\n  Second, I might add that the provision offered by the Senator \nprovides for a lower capital gains rate, which is temporary--only a \ncouple, 3 years.\n  In effect, we have heard a lot of criticisms of the bill because of \nphase-ins and phaseouts, now-you-get-it, now-you-don't, which in the \nmain are legitimate criticisms. But they are there because Senators \nwant other provisions; namely, marriage penalty relief and the child \ntax credit increased $1,000 over $500. They would like to have rates \nreduced, estate tax provisions, and they would like to have this new 10 \nyears.\n  Altogether, it is hard to fit everything within $1.35 trillion, to \nmake it fit, because Senators so strenuously argue for other \nprovisions. We have had these phase-ins and we hope at a subsequent \ndate we can reduce them.\n  I might add that we have begun to phase out the Pease amendment, and \nwe phased out the personal exemption.\n\n  I might add that this amendment adds another complexity. I don't \nthink we want to do that. There are a lot of ways to address capital \ngains. One is offered by the Senator from New Hampshire. Another is to \nprovide for exclusions up to a certain level, a 50-percent exclusion. \nAnother way is, frankly, just to change the rates in other ways. I \nmight say, because of the various different ideas of how to deal with \ncapital gains, that should be dealt with on a more comprehensive basis, \nnot as an amendment here, which has complexity and does not really help \nthe taxpayers as much as other proposed capital gains amendments would.\n  For those reasons, on the substance, I think this is not the right \ntime. I also, at the appropriate time, will make a point of order \nagainst this amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment would cut the capital gains \nrate from 20 percent to 15 percent. It is sort of trifecta tax law. We \njust saw the Preakness run here a couple days ago. If you want a triple \nwinner, this is it.\n  First off, the American taxpayer wins because the majority of \nAmerican taxpayers presently own stock. A lot of that stock is locked \nup. They are not able to convert it to cash and reinvest because they \nhave capital gains and they want to pay that tax. This frees up those \nlocked up assets and middle America wins.\n  Secondly, the Federal Government wins. Historically, and on the basis \nof the projections from the Joint Tax, this will be a revenue winner \nfor the next 3 years and, historically, for the next 10 years. We \nactually generate more revenue. Why? Because of the fact that economic \nactivity is increased and that economic activity is a taxable event.\n  Today it is not taxable because everybody is sitting on those capital \ngains. So we are not creating activity, and we are not creating a \ntaxable event.\n  This amendment creates revenue to the Federal Treasury and scores \npositively for the next 3 years. In my opinion, it scores positively \nfor the next 10 years. The Joint Tax Committee found it to lose $10 \nbillion on a $1.3 trillion bill, obviously a big number but a minor \namount in the context of the whole bill.\n  The third winning item of this is that it creates prosperity. When \nyou free up capital, people can take that capital and reinvest it in \nproductive activity, either in small business activity or in the stock \nmarket to create capital for people who are entrepreneurs, and \nentrepreneurs create jobs; they create prosperity.\n  This is a triple winner. It is a benefit to the American taxpayers, \nespecially middle-income taxpayers. It is a benefit to the Federal \nGovernment because it generates positive revenue and is a benefit to \nthe economy because it is an engine for prosperity.\n  A motion will be made that it is not germane. I argue it is germane. \nThere are two areas of capital gains in this bill, No. 1, dealing with \nAMT and, No. 2, dealing with the estate tax.\n  More importantly than that, if my colleagues want to vote on \nsomething that is a win-win-win, a trifecta for our Government, our \ncountry, and our people, this is it: a capital gains cut from 20 to 15 \npercent. I hope my colleagues will join me in this vote. I yield back \nwhatever time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane. \nTherefore, I raise a point of order that the amendment violates section \n305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nunder the leader's time, but it will only be 2 or 3 minutes. First, \nparliamentary inquiry: We are now ready to proceed with a vote on the \nfirst amendment in sequence that could very well go on for quite some \ntime; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Before we do that, I want to make two or three points.\n  First, we have reached a historic point. Tonight we are going to pass \nthis very important, significant tax relief package for working \nAmericans. When one looks at all that is in this bill, it is very \nimpressive, not just the amounts, but also what it does in reducing \nindividual income tax rates, dealing with the death tax, doubling the \nchild tax credit, and reducing the marriage penalty. It provides relief \non the alternative minimum tax, encourages savings for education, and \nit also encourages retirement security.\n  This is a very large package already in the number of provisions that \nare in it. In fact, one of the greatest dangers we face right now is \nloving it to death or loading it down because we still have a number of \namendments we may be voting on tonight that could begin to drive up the \noverall cost of the bill, but also every time colleagues add something, \nunless they can get over 60 votes, they are taking something away. So I \nhope we will stick with the package we have before us. It is a good \npackage. It will benefit the economy in America. It will help working \nAmerican families.\n  Once again, I have to give a lot of credit to the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Chuck Grassley, for working very hard and reaching \nout to everybody on both sides of the aisle. He is the new chairman of \nthe committee but has worked it as the old pro he really is.\n  He also was determined from the beginning that this was going to be \nbipartisan. He and the Senator from Montana got together and talked. \nThey came to some agreements that maybe the leaders on both sides of \nthe aisle would not have necessarily preferred, but that is the way the \nFinance Committee has worked in all the years I have watched it up \nclose and now as a member. It has come out not always on a partisan \nvote but a bipartisan vote as we have tried to get the job done.\n  I commend the chairman and the ranking Democrat. Despite the fact \nSenator Baucus, the ranking member, will be criticized on his side of \nthe aisle for crossing the aisle a little ways along the way, he did \nthe job and he deserves credit.\n  With regard to the schedule, we have a lot of work to do this week. \nThis could be a breakthrough week in which we provide tax relief for \nAmericans and pass the most fundamental education\n\n[[Page S5248]]\n\nreform in years, again, in a bipartisan way, and that would be a \ntremendous boost to the American people if they see us doing both of \nthose things this week.\n  We will begin voting now in sequence. We will limit the votes to 10 \nminutes plus not more than 5 minutes overtime. After the first vote, we \nwill cut the votes off. If we can get all the Senators to stay in the \nChamber, we can actually get votes done in 12 minutes and then, of \ncourse, have 2 minutes equally divided to explain the next amendment.\n  We are going to stick to our guns tonight. Senator Byrd has been \ncalling for that. He is right. If ever there was a time we needed to do \nit, it is tonight. If we do not do that, we will be here voting at 10 \no'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, however long it takes.\n\n  I emphasize this point. We are going to vote on the amendments on \nwhich we need to vote. I encourage Senators not to insist on a vote \nunless they absolutely have to. We are going to keep voting until we \ncomplete our work and get to final passage tonight because we must go \nback to the education bill in the morning, and we must begin to have a \nconference meeting across the aisle and across the Capitol tomorrow on \nhow we are going to proceed on tax relief.\n  We are going to limit the time on these votes. We are going to vote \non the amendments, and we are going to vote on final passage tonight. I \nhope Senators prepared for that and will not be leaving the Capitol. \nSenators will have a few minutes between votes to run and get a \nsandwich. Maybe we can get pizzas brought up. We will be glad to invite \nSenators to come into our Cloakrooms and have pizzas. We need to get \nthis bill finished, and we are going to do it tonight.\n  Mr. REID. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Nevada who has \nbeen in the Chamber again doing yeoman work. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the leader, we have approximately 40 amendments \nthat already have votes ordered on them. It does not take much math to \nfigure out, if we are lucky, we can figure that is about 10 hours.\n  I hope people will understand the difficulty the clerks have hearing \npeople respond to the votes. People in the Chamber should remain as \nquiet as possible, but also I hope the leader will end some of these \nvotes when it is required. It may mean some people will be upset at the \nleader for not waiting for them until they finish their dinner or \nfinish a speech, whatever it might be. But I say to my friend, if he \nrelents on one vote, it means it is going to happen the whole night.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I can say to the Senator, he is right, and the only way \nwe are going to complete our work is stay in the Chamber and cut them \noff in the regular time. I will do that. I ask for the Senator's \nsupport in that effort and the managers. That is the only way we are \ngoing to complete this at a reasonable hour.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That means the first vote will take how many minutes?\n  Mr. LOTT. Not more than 20 minutes; 15 minutes, and I believe \ntradition allows for 5 minutes overtime--not more than 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. And subsequent amendments?\n  Mr. LOTT. Subsequent amendments will be 10 minutes or could go as \nmuch as 5 minutes overtime. When every Senator is in, it could be as \nlittle as 12 minutes, but not more than 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate that. I encourage the leader to stick with \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I did that one time, and I found out it is actually 10 \nminutes plus 5 minutes that is allowed under the rule. Once every \nSenator is recorded, if it is 10 minutes, 11 minutes, we will cut it \noff right then. I am going to stay here and watch every vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. And that includes 2 minutes to explain votes.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was supposed to call up an amendment, and \nI did not. I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 747 of the \nSenator from Delaware, Mr. Carper, be allowed in order. It is way down \nat the bottom, but it is here.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do not believe there is an objection to \nthat request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 747\n\n (Purpose: To provide responsible tax relief for all income taxpayers, \n   by way of a $1,200,000,000,000 tax cut, and to make available an \n  additional $150,000,000,000 for critical investments in education, \n  particularly for meeting the Federal Government's commitments under \n    IDEA, Head Start, and the bipartisan education reform and ESEA \n                         reauthorization bill)\n\n  Mr. REID. Can the clerk report amendment No. 747?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Carper] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 747.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is located in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted and Proposed.'')\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment \nNo. 747.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                        Vote on Motion to Waive\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Sessions) \nand the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Stevens) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 47, the nays are \n51. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next votes \nin the series be limited to 10 minutes each, with 2 minutes before each \nvote for an explanation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 674\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the Carnahan amendment?\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, this tax bill has a glaring omission. I \ncall\n\n[[Page S5249]]\n\nupon my colleagues to correct it. One group, those in the 15-percent \nmarginal tax bracket, have been overlooked. There is no rate cut for \nthem.\n  Who are these people? They are the forgotten middle-income, working \nfamilies, those who have a gross family income of $30,000 to $65,000, \n72 million Americans--1.7 million of them in Missouri; 44 percent of \nall Missouri taxpayers. They do not walk these halls. They work every \nday. They pick up their children at daycare. They pay their bills. They \nhelp their children with their homework. They take care of their \nelderly parents. They trust us to do what is fair. We can do so by \nreducing this tax rate by 1 point, to 14 percent.\n  To overlook 17 million Americans is a sin of omission we must not \ncommit. I encourage my Democratic and Republican colleagues to correct \nthis wrong.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment guts our tax relief bill \nby $87 billion. It increases taxes, then, on families and working \npeople by $87 billion by denying the tax cuts in the bipartisan bill.\n  This amendment not only delays the reduction in marginal rates; it \nprovides only a 1-point reduction in marginal rates. This 1-point \nreduction equals the tax relief that our bipartisan tax plan provides \nin the first year alone. Our plan's additional tax cuts would be \neliminated entirely by this amendment.\n  The proposal of Senators Daschle and Carnahan would actually make our \ntax system less progressive by giving greater savings to upper income \ntaxpayers as they pass through the 14-percent bracket.\n  When you are really serious about reducing the tax burden for people \nin the 15-percent income bracket, you target your available resources \nto people at that income level. That is exactly what we have done. For \nthose earning between $12,000 and $45,000, we have provided tax relief \nranging from 9 percent on one end to 33 percent on the other. This is a \nconclusion made by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  To all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who supported the \nbudget resolution, a vote for this amendment destroys our efforts to \nprovide a $1.35 trillion tax cut.\n  I urge you to vote against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n674. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on this vote, I have a pair with the \nSenator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens. If he were present and voting, he \nwould vote ``nay.'' If I were at liberty to vote, I would vote ``yea.'' \nTherefore, I withhold my vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign).

There are 2 minutes evenly divided on the \nFitzgerald amendment No. 670.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are going to yield back all time on \nthis amendment and accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The amendment (No. 670) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 675\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Collins \namendment No. 675. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, may we have order, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask that we pass over the Collins \namendment and not vote on it now and go on to the next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 679\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next amendment is Rockefeller amendment \n679.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. The Senator \nfrom West Virginia has an amendment, and I think we all should give him \nour attention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, my amendment is a very simple one. It \nasks Senators to choose between whether or not they would rather first \nimplement a prescription drug provision for all Americans, a universal \nprescription drug provision for all Americans, before the top income \ntax bracket reduction would become available. It does not eliminate the \nincome tax reduction. It only says we have to do the prescription drug \nprovision first. We have a year and a half to do it. That is plenty of \ntime.\n  The objection raised on the floor was that it was not constitutional. \nWe consulted extensively over the weekend and OMB found it to be \nconstitutional and that, in fact, it could be and would be \nconstitutional. There was not a problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask unanimous consent for 10 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the modification that I would ask is \nthat OMB be allowed to certify the amendment as being in proper order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection----\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator seeking to modify his \namendment?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Yes, I seek to modify the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I believe the Senator has a right to \nmodify his amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It takes unanimous consent at this time to \nmodify an amendment. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, we passed the budget \nresolution. It seems as if we are involved in redebating the enacted \nbudget resolution. The budget resolution provides record levels of \nfunding for prescription drug coverage. The budget resolution also says \nwe have more than enough tax surplus to enact the tax cut before us. We \nhandle one issue at a time in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S5250]]\n\n  The Finance Committee will address the prescription drug issue at a \nlater time. I have said that I hope to do that in committee the last 2 \nweeks of July. The Senate does make one piece of legislation contingent \nupon another.\n  The pending amendment is not germane to the provisions of the \nreconciliation measure. I therefore raise a point of order against the \namendment under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I heard the Senator from Iowa, and I \nmove to waive the Budget Act and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 685, as modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on amendment No. 685 offered \nby the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Bayh.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Montana for his \ngraciousness.\n  The decisions we are soon to make will affect the welfare of our \nNation for many years to come. The estimates and assumptions that \nunderlie these decisions are uncertain and unstable, at best. The last \ntime we were called upon as a body to make decisions of this magnitude, \nwe did not make them as well as we might have, for the assumptions and \nestimates were inaccurate, leading to the largest budget deficits, the \nlargest increase in the national debt in our Nation's history and six \nseparate tax increases to right the fiscal ship of state.\n  We must do better than that. We owe it to those who have sent us to \nthe Senate to do more than hope for the best. We owe it to them to do \nmore than to hope things work out better than they did the last time.\n  This amendment will ensure that we take the fiscally responsible \ncourse to preserve Social Security and Medicare, to balance the budget, \nand to pay down the debt. I urge adoption.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise in support as a \ncosponsor of the amendment offered by Senator Bayh and other colleagues \nto create a ``Trust Fund Protection Trigger.'' this amendment is \nsimple. This amendment would keep us honest. It would prevent us from \nraiding Social Security and Medicare Trust funds. As long as specified \ndebt reduction targets are met, the phase in of tax cuts continue as \nscheduled.\n  This amendment to the tax cut reconciliation bill would create a \nsafety mechanism to address the danger of fiscally irresponsible tax \ncuts or federal spending leading our nation back to a period of budget \ndeficits. We must make sure we continue paying down our national debt \nand protecting Social Security and Medicare.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by my colleagues Senators Bayh and Snowe to create a ``trigger \nmechanism'' to make sure that the tax cuts we are considering here \ntoday will not endanger the projected surpluses or undo the hard work \nand hard choices of the past decade which have allowed us to eliminate \ndeficits and pay down the debt.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has projected a unified budget \nsurplus over the next 10 years of some $5.6 trillion, with a $3.1 \ntrillion on-budget surplus. These projected surpluses provide the basis \nfor the consideration of the tax bill before us today.\n  Indeed, the unprecedented economic expansion of the past decade and \nour current and projected budget surpluses have provided an \nunparalleled opportunity for the Congress and the administration to \ntake action to provide all working Americans with a reduction in their \ntaxes, pay down the debt, and meet urgent domestic priorities such as \nhealth care, education, and the environment, and to do so in a fiscally \nresponsible way.\n  And although there are many elements of the reconciliation bill as \nreported out of committee which I support--marriage penalty relief, for \nexample--one of my concerns with this tax bill is that there is little \nmargin for error if the surpluses not materialize.\n  In January 2000 the CBO baseline surplus estimate was $3.2 trillion. \nIn January 2001 the estimate was $5.6 trillion, a $2.4 trillion change. \nThere is no guarantee that these projections will not swing back in the \nother direction and, in fact, there is $4 trillion difference in \nsurplus projections between the CBO baseline and the CBO \n``pessimistic'' scenario.\n  Now, I am not saying that the pessimistic scenario is likely. But I \ndo believe that we have to be cautious.\n  When I first came to the Senate in 1993 we were facing mounting \ndeficits and an ocean of red ink. It took a lot of hard work and a lot \nof tough decisions to get spending under control. I am proud of what we \naccomplished, and don't want to go back to a situation where instead of \npaying down the Federal debt as we are now we are once again incurring \nmore and more debt.\n  That is why I support this amendment, which creates a trigger \nmechanism that would make the implementation of the tax cuts--or any \nnew large spending increases--dependent on the surplus projections \nactually materializing and continued success in meeting debt reduction \ntargets.\n  The amendment creates a review mechanism for Congress to make sure \nthat as we proceed with implementing the elements of the tax cuts in \nthis legislation that the surpluses have actually materialized and that \nphasing-in new elements of the tax package would not set us back down \nthe road to deficits and growing debt. Should the surplus drop, and we \ndo not meet debt reduction targets, the tax cuts scheduled to phase-in \nthe following year would be delayed by one year.\n  The advantage of this approach is that it makes tax cuts dependent on \nfiscal discipline and provides a brake against runaway spending. It is \na safety valve against a return to deficits. In fact, Federal Reserve \nChairman Greenspan endorsed this approach in testimony before the \nSenate earlier this year.\n  We have a great opportunity to provide tax cuts to the American \npeople. We need to take advantage of this opportunity, but we must do \nso in a way that is fiscally responsible. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bipartisan trigger amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, these remarks are meant as a substitution \nfor remarks regarding the trigger amendment to H.R. 1836 when debated \nMay 17, 2001. I speak in opposition to the pending amendment as it is \nbased upon uncertainty, the uncertainty layered on top of the \nuncertainty is whether the trigger will be pulled.\n  We cannot legislate certainty. We can only exercise good judgment. \nWe, as a Congress, in these next years, have\n\n[[Page S5251]]\n\nto decide what to do according to the circumstances at the time and \nexercise good judgment as to what we should do.\n  Unfortunately, we have not been able to explore the full policy \nramifications of this amendment. We have not been able to adequately \ndebate the substance of this amendment. It is because we are in this \ntime constraint where everything is rushed, and nobody has been able to \nlook at the substance. There have been no hearings on this.\n  First, you cannot and should not limit public debt management. The \nTreasury Secretary has to have discretion in debt management. Right off \nthe top, we are tying the hands of the Treasury Secretary, for whatever \nreason he or she may want to borrow more, sell more securities, sell \nmore bonds for domestic reasons or for international reasons.\n  Secretary Rubin has said consistently that we should not tie debt \nmanagement to fiscal policy. You should not do it. It is wrong.\n  I understand why the Senator from Indiana is offering this amendment, \nand I understand why the Senator from Maine is offering the amendment.\n  Let me talk about the uncertainties in this amendment. This amendment \nessentially provides, I will summarize it, scheduled debt reduction \ntargets, in even numbered years, and the Treasury Secretary will \ncertify whether these targets are being met.\n  If they are not being met, then what happens? What is triggered is \nthat reductions in taxes are automatically stopped, the growth rates \nfor discretionary spending are automatically held at the rate of \ninflation, and entitlement spending increases are automatically \nstopped.\n  What about a Medicare drug benefit? I heard that entitlement \nincreases will be stopped. No, I will stand corrected because I see the \nSenator from Indiana shaking his head. But the way it is drafted, new \nentitlement spending, as I understand it, is included in the trigger. \nBut I stand to be corrected if that is not the case, but that is how I \nread this amendment now.\n  What happens in odd-numbered years? Things are not automatic. But any \nMember can stand up in this Chamber and say the targets have not been \nmet and set a trigger process in motion. That is too much uncertainty.\n  Do we really want to tie our hands like that? Do we want to limit our \ndiscretion in future years as to what is best by putting this automatic \nprovision in the law? Do we want to tie the hands of our Treasury \nSecretary in debt management? Do we really want to do that?\n  Talk about the steepness of the yield curve. Why is the yield curve \nsteep? It is steep because the bond market today believes in the \noutyears that interest rates are going to rise. Why? Because the \nFederal Reserve has just lowered interest rates by 50 basis points. And \nbecause this tax cut is going to pass. The market thinks there is going \nto be growth because of the stimulus of this tax cut and because of the \nlowering of short-term interest rates. As a result, the market believes \nthere will be inflation in the outyears; therefore, long-term interest \nrates are going to be higher.\n  I believe the policy consequences of this amendment have not been \nfully explored and that it is based on too much uncertainty. We should \nnot adopt it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I raise two points about this amendment before I raise \na point of order. A trigger would substantially reduce the economic \nbenefits of tax cuts, making it more likely that the debt reduction \ntarget would not be met.\n  Second, there is no reason that we need a trigger to raise taxes. The \nreality is, Congress is not shy about raising taxes. We have actually \nreduced taxes in 1981, and we raised taxes in 1982, 1984, 1987, 1989, \n1990, and 1993 before we reduced taxes once again in 1997.\n  What is rare is for Congress, then, to actually give tax relief such \nas we are now.\n  The Senator from Virginia, Mr. Allen, has an amendment to the \namendment, and I defer to him at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 751 to Amendment No. 685\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment that I \nsend to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Allen] proposes an amendment numbered \n751 to amendment No. 685.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n            (Purpose: To provide for a tax cut accelerator)\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n\n                     TITLE __--TAX CUT ACCELERATOR\n\n     SEC. __. TAX CUT ACCELERATOR.\n\n       (a) Reporting Additional Surpluses.--If any report provided \n     pursuant to section 202(e)(1) of the Congressional Budget Act \n     of 1974, estimates an on-budget surplus, excluding social \n     security and medicare surplus accounts, that exceeds such an \n     on-budget surplus set forth in such a report for the \n     preceding year, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget \n     of the Senate shall make adjustments in the resolution for \n     the next fiscal year as provided in subsection (b).\n       (b) Adjustments.--The chairman of the Committee on the \n     Budget of the Senate shall make the following adjustments in \n     an amount not to exceed the difference between the on-budget \n     surpluses in the reports referred to in subsection (a):\n       (1) Reduce the on-budget revenue aggregate by that amount \n     for the fiscal years included in such reports.\n       (2) Adjust the instruction to the Committee on Finance to \n     increase the reduction in revenues by the sum of the amounts \n     for the period of such fiscal years in such manner as to not \n     produce an on-budget deficit in the next fiscal year, over \n     the next 5 fiscal years, or over the next 10 fiscal years and \n     to require a report of reconciliation legislation by the \n     Committee on Finance not later than March 15.\n       (3) Adjust such other levels in such resolution, as \n     appropriate, and the Senate pay-as-you-go scorecard.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. ALLEN. There is a great deal of discussion about slowdowns or \nbreaking on tax cuts. In my view, there ought to be an accelerator if \nmore revenues come in than anticipated. Too often the Federal \nGovernment reminds me of the Jerry Reed tune: The Federal Government \ngets the gold mine but the taxpayers get the shaft.\n  In my view, if more gold is coming in for surplus, the taxpayers \nought to get a few of those nuggets and they ought to get the first \nclaim on surplus revenues coming in at a greater rate than anticipated.\n  This amendment makes sure if there are breaks, there also is an \naccelerator for the taxpayers. I hope it would be the pleasure of the \nSenate to adopt my amendment in the event that the amendment of the \nSenator from Indiana is adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? There is 1 minute in \nopposition.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask my colleagues for the opportunity for an up-or-\ndown vote on this very important trigger. I ask we vote no on the Allen \namendment and instead support this bipartisan amendment.\n  We thank Senator Snowe for working with us on an amendment that \nsimply says we will not use Medicare and Social Security trust funds \nfor either tax cuts or increased spending. The tax cuts go into place \nunder our amendment, as does the spending, through the normal budget \nprocess, but the point at which the revenues are not available, both \nthe next phase of the tax cut and any increased spending above \ninflation, would be suspended until we had the opportunity to reassess \nthe situation.\n  This is a recommendation given by Chairman Greenspan before our \nBudget Committee that puts before us the very important value of paying \ndown our national debt first, protecting Social Security and Medicare \nfirst.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I raise a point of order on germaneness; \nthat the underlying amendment is not germane to the provisions of the \nreconciliation measure. The point of order is against the amendment \nunder section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. BAYH. I move to waive the Budget Act, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n\n[[Page S5252]]\n\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment has two principal \nprovisions. First, it stands for the principle that we should have a \nseries of tax bills before the Congress where we can consider one at a \ntime, rather than a single gargantuan bill as is before us tonight. \nSecond, we believe the purpose of the first tax bill should be to deal \nwith the first economic challenge of America, which is a slowing \neconomy.\n  I would like to call on my colleague, Senator Corzine, for \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, let me say it is clear we have a need to \ntake out an economic insurance policy on an economy for which the \nFederal Reserve judged it needed to reduce interest rates five times--\n2\\1/2\\ percent--in less than 4 months. I think there is clear need to \naddress rising unemployment, making sure that consumer confidence stays \nsecure. If we want to have those economic assumptions strong, we should \npass this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is a key amendment that would \ndestroy the bipartisan tax bill that we have before us. He proposes to \nstimulate the economy by expanding the range of the income eligible for \nthe new 10-percent rate. But Senator Graham has not emphasized the \ntremendous price that would be paid, and that would be eliminating the \nrest of the tax bill. The only thing that would survive is the 10-\npercent rate. Worst of all, the Senator's proposal would actually \nincrease taxes on middle-income Americans because a family of four with \n$60,000 in taxable income would pay $100 more in taxes under the Graham \namendment than they would pay under our bipartisan tax bill when fully \nphased in.\n  If this amendment is successful, Senator Graham then would, of \ncourse, destroy our bipartisan effort to provide $1.3 trillion tax \nrelief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when President Bush sent us his proposal \nfor the repeal of the estate tax, he suggested that both the State and \nthe Federal components of that estate tax be treated equitably. Twenty \npercent of the estate tax collected by the Federal Government is \nremitted to our 50 States in the form of a State credit. The other 80 \npercent stays in the Federal Treasury.\n  Under the bill that is before us, half of the State's share will go \nout of effect as of January 1, 2002, and the other half will go out of \neffect as of January 1, 2005, and the Federal share does not go out of \neffect until January 1, 2011.\n  So what we are essentially saying is, we are rejecting the \nrecommendation of the President. We are saying that we are going to get \nours first, and let the States have to eat a substantial amount of this \nreduction beginning January 1 of next year.\n  My State, as probably most of yours, has already passed its budget \nfor the next fiscal year. Gov. Jeb Bush told me today it is going to \ncost him approximately $200 million in this year's already-passed \nbudget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This amendment was offered at 11 p.m., Thursday, so you \nhave not had a chance to take into consideration what he proposes to \nprovide for the State treasuries at the expense of the Federal \nTreasury.\n\n[[Page S5253]]\n\n  What Senator Graham has not shared is that his zeal to protect the \nState treasuries is at the expense of the American taxpayer and, most \nimportantly, the estate tax reform provisions in this bill.\n  If you would read from his amendment: Beginning on page 64 strike \nthrough page 66. What that really says is: Strike all estate tax \nreductions. Strike all State death tax changes and slash the unified \ncredit.\n  We may have heard from Governors, obviously, on this. Do we believe \nthat the Governors really believe our bipartisan death tax reform \npackage should be slashed for the mere convenience of State treasuries?\n  Do we really believe that the American taxpayer with estates between \n$2 million and $4 million should accept the burden of funding the \nStates' coffers merely because the States have already drafted a budget \nand they do not want to get around to drafting another budget for a \ncouple years?\n  I ask that you kill this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this motion will provide $120 billion \nover the next 10 years for children and education. We do this by \ncutting the tax cuts for the top .7 percent, although a couple will \nstill be able to have tax cuts up to $8,400 a year. This is just half \nof the Harkin amendment. Fifty-two Senators voted to take money out of \nthe tax cuts and put it into children and education. We need 60 votes \non this amendment. In other words, even after this amendment passes, \nyou have $10 for tax cuts and you will have $1 for children and \neducation. That seems to be balance to me. I hope there will be a \nstrong vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Minnesota \nalways speaking strongly for the need to do more for education, but \nthis is not the place for this particular issue. In addition, this \nmotion, if it went into effect, would delay the over $30 billion of tax \nincentives for education that we already have in this bipartisan bill.\n  This amendment also is not germane. Consequently, I raise a point of \norder on the germaneness of this provision on a reconciliation measure \nand that the amendment will come under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget \nAct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                 Amendment Nos. 697 and 701, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHatch's amendment No. 697 and Senator Kerry's amendment No. 701 be \nwithdrawn. We are working on those in other ways, so that Members \nunderstand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendments are withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 703\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n703, authored by the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Congress has the opportunity to ensure the \nlong-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare. This tax cut, \nhowever, would squander that opportunity.\n  My amendment would reduce the size of the tax cut and place the \nsavings into a reserve fund for Social Security reform, Medicare \nreform, and a prescription drug benefit. This amendment would retain \nthose tax cuts included in the bill that would benefit lower and \nmiddle-income taxpayers, such as the creation of a 10-percent bracket, \nexpansion of the child credit, marriage penalty relief, pension reform, \neducation tax incentives, and alternative minimum tax relief.\n  This amendment would also retain the estate tax relief provided in \nthe bill through an increased exemption credit. But the amendment would \nstrike from\n\n[[Page S5254]]\n\nthe bill the marginal rate reductions and the estate and gift tax \nrepeal, both of which would only benefit the wealthiest taxpayers in \nthe Nation, so that those funds can be redirected into Social Security \nand Medicare reform.\n  Unlike the underlying bill, this amendment would help to ensure that \nSocial Security and Medicare benefits are available for future \nretirees, while still providing a substantial tax cut that would be \nmore evenly distributed amongst the American taxpayers.\n  I hope the Senators will vote to support the amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia has very \nwell described what his amendment does, and that description in itself \ngives the reasons why we should be against it.\n  No. 1, it would deny the death tax relief this bill provides with a \ncredit up to $4 million to help the estates from paying the estate tax.\n  This will also be a massive tax increase compared to the bill before \nus because it eliminates all relief in marginal rates except for the \n10-percent rate. And also it would eliminate the entire estate tax \namendments we have.\n  Also, I believe this amendment is not germane, and I raise the point \nof germaneness on a reconciliation measure because it does not comply \nwith section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act \nfor the purposes of the pending amendment.

The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 707, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for Mr. Jeffords, I ask unanimous \nconsent that amendment No. 707 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 707) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 695\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n695 offered by Senator Dodd of Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, what this amendment does is to \ntry to provide some resources for reducing the level of the national \ndebt. We are spending $220 billion a year in interest payments on the \ndebt, a number that is vastly in excess of what it ought to be.\n  We also believe, in addition to reducing the debt, in providing \nresources for nontransportation infrastructure needs--water, wastewater \nsystems, sewage systems, schools. We are told that some $23 billion a \nyear for the next 20 years every year will be needed just to repair \nwater and wastewater treatment facilities in the United States.\n  My amendment takes the rate reductions for the top income earners \nfrom 39.6 to 38. And it also modifies the estate tax to accommodate \nreducing that national debt and providing resources for the \ninfrastructure needs of this country.\n  You are never going to have economic growth if you continue to have \ndebt amounting to the levels we do and if you don't invest in the basic \ninfrastructure of this country. For those reasons, I urge adoption of \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I urge the defeat of this amendment. We \nhave hundreds of thousands of American taxpayers who deserve immediate \ntax relief and they are being cast aside if this amendment is adopted.\n  For instance, the unified credit would only be $2 million in the year \n2010, whereas our bipartisan RELIEF Act raises the unified credit to $4 \nmillion per person.\n  Remember, that is $8 million per family, no strings attached. You \ndon't need to have a family farm or a family business. The RELIEF Act \nmakes it simple. There is no long-term lien. It is simple. The death \ntax stays at 60 percent under this amendment. There is no repeal, no \nhelp at all. I urge the defeat of this amendment. Also, the marginal \nrate tax cuts are scaled back.\n  Finally, even though the Senator talks about infrastructure, this \namendment spends not one penny on infrastructure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The question is on agreeing to the \nKyl amendment No. 691. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, this amendment would provide a $500 tax \ncredit for contributions to scholarship funds which could then be given \nto parents and needy families to enroll their children in the school of \ntheir choice. It is an idea that is now being tried in several States, \nincluding my own State of Arizona. It is an idea whose time has come.\n  The Federal Government should provide a tax credit for this purpose, \nbut I\n\n[[Page S5255]]\n\nunderstand a point of order will be raised against the amendment. I ask \nthe Senator from Montana, will there be a point of order raised against \nthe amendment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, there will be a point of order raised.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, the point of order would be well taken, \nalthough the amendment is a darned good amendment, and I hope we will \nbe able to vote on it again some other time. In the interests of time \nthis evening, I will not move to challenge the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I appreciate the generosity and \ncooperation of the Senator from Arizona.\n  The point of order is well taken. It is not good policy. I think we \nare making progress tonight. This is the first time we are going to \nmove along here in a way that does not occupy a lot of time.\n  Madam President, the pending amendment is not germane. Therefore, I \nraise a point of order the pending amendment violates section 305(b)(2) \nof the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken. The \namendment falls.\n  Who seeks recognition? The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 713\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, if your priority is to help folks on the \nfamily farm or family business or their kids or grandkids, then support \nestate tax reform and my amendment. But if your priority is to make \nsure, as Leona Helmsley put it, ``Only little people pay taxes,'' \nsupport the committee bill.\n  The committee bill also repeals the estate tax in its entirety for \nall estates in 2011, even the most wealthy estates. My amendment does \nnot. It does abolish the estate tax for all family farms and all family \nbusinesses passed on to the qualified heirs who continue to operate \nthem in 2003. It exempts from the estate tax all family businesses and \nfamily farms in that category 8 years earlier than the committee's \ndoes. My amendment also contains the $4 million unified credit, the 45-\npercent rate. The only difference is my legislation would continue to \nimpose an estate tax on the estates of billionaires and those in the \nupper income areas. I think that is a reasonable thing to do. But I do, \nin this amendment, believe we ought to repeal the estate tax obligation \non family businesses and family farms transferred to qualified heirs. \nThis will do it in 2003. The committee bill will do it 8 years later.\n  Those who have talked about this issue as their priority certainly \nought to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, an unlimited family business deduction \nsounds good, but what does it really mean? Really in the end, nothing. \nIt totally guts the estate tax reform. It postpones rate decreases. It \npostpones meaningful unified credit increases until the year 2011. The \nRELIEF Act gives American taxpayers $3 million by the year 2006 and \nSenator Dorgan does not.\n  The RELIEF Act is simple.

The question is on agreeing to Bingaman \namendment No. 717.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on \nthis amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Reid of Nevada.\n  Last Thursday, President Bush made a series of recommendations to the \nCongress to adopt credits and deductions to encourage the country to do \nwhat is needed to deal with the energy crisis that he and many of us \nsee.\n  Many of those same tax proposals are contained in a bill that Senator \nMurkowski introduced earlier this year and are also contained in a bill \nI introduced with various Democratic colleagues earlier this year.\n  This is the time that we should step up to that challenge and pass \nthose tax recommendations to deal with our energy situation. There are \ncredits for energy-efficient appliances, energy-efficient commercial \nbuildings, and energy-efficient residential construction. There are \ncredits for hybrid vehicles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, while I support many of the \nstatements of my good friend, there are several fatal flaws in the \namendment. There are 23 provisions in the 141-page amendment. I do not \nknow the cost of all of these tax changes.\n  On the last page of this amendment, the Senator attempts to offset \nits cost by delegating to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority \nto adjust tax rates. This is an unprecedented delegation of authority. \nI believe it is unconstitutional.\n  Further, the amendment allows the unelected Secretary of the Treasury \nto raise the new 10-percent rate on low-income taxpayers to 12 percent \nor 15 percent or the Secretary could raise the 28-percent bracket on \nmiddle-income families to 29 percent or 30 percent. The Secretary of \nthe Treasury has no constitutional authority to set tax rates. That is \nwhat we were elected to do.\n  I believe we should develop an energy policy in the Energy Committee \nand in the Finance Committee, not on the floor of the Senate. We have \nnot had any hearings on the proposal. I look forward to working with \nSenator Bingaman in both committees to develop a rational energy \npolicy.\n  Madam President, the pending amendment is not germane to the \nprovisions of the reconciliation measure. I, therefore, raise a point \nof order against the amendment under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget \nAct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I move to waive the Budget Act and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question now occurs on the McCain \namendment No. 660. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, this amendment would cut the top tax \nrate for the wealthiest individuals from 39.6 percent to 38.6 percent \nand devote the resulting savings that would have gone to this group to \nlower and middle-income taxpayers by increasing the number of \nindividuals who pay the 15-percent tax rate. When it is finally phased \nin, this amendment will place millions of taxpayers now in the 28-\npercent tax bracket into the 15-percent tax bracket. Under this \namendment, unmarried individuals can make nearly $30,000 and married \nindividuals can make $50,000 and still be in the 15-percent tax \nbracket.\n  I urge its adoption and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, most of those paying the top marginal \nrate are small business owners and farmers operating their businesses \nas sole proprietorships or S-corporations. A study recently released by \nthe Treasury shows that under the President's proposal--this is the \nPresident's proposal but still germane--77 percent of the money going \nto cut the top 39.6-percent rate would go to small business owners. \nThese small business owners make up 63 percent of the tax returns that \nwould benefit from reducing the top rate. Small business owners are, of \ncourse, the engine of growth that runs our economy. These are the \npeople who plow their tax money and their tax relief right back into \ntheir businesses, increasing wages, hiring more workers.\n  The number of small businesses that could benefit from a cut in the \ntop rate, for instance, in the State of Arizona, is around 267,000 \nsmall businesses. I seriously question how much we really gain by \nattacking these small businesses with high rates.\n  Another twist is, for those of you who are interested in disabled \nchildren and kids with special needs, there are special needs trusts. \nThese trusts for the disabled can be easily subject to taxation at the \ntop rate of 39.6 percent.\n  I urge Members to vote down the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, on this vote, I have a pair with the \nSenator from Alaska (Mr. Stevens). If he were present and voting, he \nwould vote ``nay.'' If I were at liberty to vote, I would vote ``yea.'' \nTherefore, I withhold my vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is now on agreeing to the motion \nof the Senator from Arizona.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the intention of this amendment is to \ncommit until we can find out exactly what our expenditures are going to \nbe for national defense. Recent articles and information clearly \nindicate that there will be very little, if any, left over for a \nsupplemental for any funding that I personally campaigned that the men \nand women of the armed services would receive for a national defense \nsystem.\n  I don't expect to win on this, but I can assure you that with this \ntax cut going through as it is, with all of the additional spending \nthat I have observed over the last few years, which I see no change in \nwhatsoever, we will not have enough money to defend this Nation's vital \nnational security interests.\n  We are embarked on an unusual and dangerous course of action, a \nmassive tax cut without any indication or evidence whatsoever of how \nmuch we are going to need to spend to defend this Nation. I urge great \ncaution as we embark on this enterprise because it may be a very \nexpensive price to pay.\n  I will take a voice vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, first of all, we all appreciate the \nSenator's concern about defense because he is very much an authority in \nthat area. I am confident, however, that the budget resolution we \npassed has provided adequate funding for defense. This amendment would \nundo all of our efforts to provide significant cuts at all marginal \nrates. Besides, we have $500 billion in the contingency fund that we \nwill be able to use to draw on if additional money for defense is \nneeded.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on agreeing to the second-\ndegree amendment No. 723 by Senator Smith to his first-degree amendment \nNo. 680. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, my second-degree amendment \nis really quite simple. It extends the moratorium on the Internet tax, \nand that is the extent of it.\n  If my colleagues want to continue taxing the Internet or tax the \nInternet further, then they vote against me. But if they do not favor \nthe Internet tax and would like to extend the moratorium against that \ntax, then vote with me.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of my amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I will be making a motion on the germaneness \nof the amendment. First, this amendment is not quite as simple as the \nSenator from New Hampshire says. If a State has a sales tax, the \ncities, towns, and counties are desperately interested in this. They \nwill not think it is appropriate to adopt a second-degree amendment \nthat will preclude them from having any opportunity to continue the \nrevenue on which they are counting for their schools and other forms of \ngovernment.\n  The retailers in our States will not be very happy with that simple \nchange of policy allowing that tax to be destroyed. If a colleague is \nfrom a State that does not have a sales tax, he or she would want to \nvote against this amendment. The reason they would want to vote against \nit is because they would not want the other 44 States to take an \nopportunity later to take away a major source of their revenue.\n  This needs a lot of work. There has been a bipartisan group of us \nworking on this issue for almost a year. We have been working with the \nretailers, direct marketers, and all levels of government.\n  The pending amendment is not germane to the provisions of the \nreconciliation measure. I, therefore, raise a point of order against \nthe amendment under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

On this question the yeas are 11 and the nays \nare 88. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion is not agreed to.\n  The point of order is sustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to explain my vote against this \namendment to the tax bill that we are debating today. The record \nclearly shows my strong support for the Internet, which is still in its \ninfancy. I believe that Congress needs to give it the time and space to \ncontinue to grow and evolve without complex and burdensome taxation.\n  In October 1998 Congress enacted the Internet Tax Freedom Act. At \nthat time, I supported placing a three year moratorium on the \nimposition of any new state and local sales tax on Internet access and \nprecluding charging sales tax for purchases over the Internet that do \nnot apply to other mediums. I was also very supporting of the 19 member \nAdvisory Commission on Electronic Commerce that the Act created to \nreview a variety of tax issues relating to electronic commerce, \nincluding the taxation of all interstate commerce whether by the \nInternet or more traditional methods. I must say that I was \ndisappointed that the Commission was not able to make substantive \nrecommendations on most of the key issues before it.\n  However, I am hopeful that current negotiations now ongoing here in \nthe Senate will produce legislation to address this issue in an \neffective and equitable manner. For that reason, I am voting against \nthis amendment. I think that the amendment is well intentional, but \nthat we need to give the current negotiations more time to play out in \nthe Commerce Committee before taking action.\n\n[[Page S5258]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 680\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the first-\ndegree amendment No. 680 by the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The amendment numbered 680 is the law \nenforcement survivor benefits. In 1997, Congress passed legislation to \ntake care of not taxing the benefits to children whose fathers died in \nthe line of duty as law enforcement officers. Unfortunately, there was \na period of about 13 years and these children were not taken out of \nthat; therefore, families were faced with a tragedy--children were \npaying taxes on the benefits.\n  This amendment clarifies that. So for all of those children whose \nfathers or mothers died in the line of duty, those benefits will not be \ntaxed.\n  I believe the yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, speaking for myself and Senator Baucus, \nwe urge the entire Senate to vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I state for the record I am perfectly \nwilling to not have a recorded vote, but I am told others want a \nrecorded vote. I don't want to get the blame for having a recorded \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been called for.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent the yeas and nays be vitiated.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 684\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Many of our colleagues claim that the nation can afford massive tax \ncuts and adequate education investments. This amendment holds them to \ntheir word. It says that the wealthiest one percent of taxpayers will \nnot see a cut in the top income tax rate until education is funded at \nthe amounts that the Senate recently authorized.\n  In the last 2 weeks, the Senate has voted overwhelmingly--to fully \nfund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; to fully fund \nTitle I state grants for disadvantaged students; to improve teacher \nquality for all students; to improve education for students with \nlimited English proficiency; and to expand access to safe after-school \nactivities.\n  Were these cruel hoaxes on the nation's children, or were they good \nfaith statements of the education investments needed today? Let's get \nour priorities straight, and provide tax breaks to the wealthy only \nafter we have met our commitments to the nation's school children.\n  Tax breaks targeted to the richest 1 percent should not be allowed to \ncrowd out basic education services. If we do not have the resources to \nprovide the most basic education services, then we certainly do not \nhave the resources to provide new tax breaks for the wealthiest among \nus.\n  I will yield the 30 seconds to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, to underscore the point, we have voted now \non several occasions over the past number of weeks for full funding of \ntitle I, full funding of the IDEA, special education. What we are \nsaying is it is going to be difficult to meet those obligations unless \nwe provide room in the budget. The only way to do that is by reducing \nthe tax cut a marginal amount so those costs can be met. That is what \nthe amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts does. We urge its \nadoption.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment delays the tax cuts until \na certain level of funding for education is met. Everybody knows that \neducation is a top priority of this Congress, as well as of President \nBush. Hopefully, we will finish a major education reform bill this week \nin the Senate.\n  This tax bill contains over $30 billion of education tax incentives. \nThere is no reason to delay other tax relief to accomplish something \noutside the jurisdiction of this bill.\n  I believe there is a germaneness issue here, so I ask the pending \namendment be found not to be germane to the provisions of the \nreconciliation measure. I raise a point of order against the amendment \nunder section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the applicable sections of \nthat act for consideration of the pending amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Stevens) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 48, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 130 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Stevens\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 48, the nays are \n51. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, could we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request. I ask\n\n[[Page S5259]]\n\nunanimous consent that we adjourn for the evening and continue voting \non these amendments to the tax bill in the light of day tomorrow \nmorning----\n  MR. BUNNING. I object.\n  Mrs. BOXER. At a time to be determined by the two leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is very late. These are very important matters. This \ntax bill is going to change the course of this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We ought to go home and get a good night's sleep and then \ncontinue voting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I respectfully urge the majority leader to \nput us out. Let's come back on tomorrow and finish voting on these \namendments. It is 15 minutes after 11 o'clock. We have several \namendments yet listed. I think the Senators ought to have an \nopportunity to call up those amendments. And Senators ought to be able \nto understand what they are voting on.\n  Why is it that we have to continue going tonight?\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. If Senator Byrd will yield, I note that just a few minutes \nago we even had a 99-0 vote on an amendment that the sponsor was \nperfectly willing to have accepted by a voice vote. Actually, we have a \nlimited number of amendments here. I would hope some of them would not \nbe offered or could be withdrawn or could be accepted in the manager's \npackage. We should be close to finishing this legislation.\n  We had indicated for days, including at the beginning of this bill, \nthat we needed to complete action tonight because we have other very \nimportant work to do this week. I know Senators Kennedy, Jeffords, and \nothers were ready to go back to the education bill in the morning. \nThat, too, is very important. And we need the time to go into \nconference between the Members of this body and the other body and \ncomplete action on this very important legislation. I know of no \nlegislation that will be more important than what we are doing tonight.\n  I have been very diligent as all Senators know, in trying to be \nrespectful of Senators' needs to do other events. It is getting harder \nand harder. There is an event every night. There are events during the \nday. And we try to accommodate all Senators.\n  But I think that as close as we are, and as far as we have come, if \nthe Senators will just forbear--and we will work with the managers of \nthe legislation--we could complete it tonight.\n  I am afraid if we stop now and come back tomorrow, the number of \namendments will grow. We have not been able to get a limit or agreement \nto withhold on amendments. I had hoped we could do that.\n  As difficult as it may be, Senators are minding the store, staying in \nthe Chamber. Most of these votes have been occurring in less than 12 \nminutes, or 15 minutes at the most. If we will continue on, we should \nbe able to complete this by midnight and then go on to other important \nlegislation.\n  I thank Senator Byrd for yielding to me in order to respond to his \nquestion.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield to me for 1 \nminute?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I don't have the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been here since 9:30 this morning \nwith Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus. I would like to go home. I am \nwilling to work through whatever time it takes. I say to my friend from \nMississippi, the majority leader, we are not going to finish by \nmidnight. We have on this side 20 more amendments at least. I wish it \nwere not so, but that is the fact of life. We are not going to finish \nby midnight. At four amendments per hour, there are 5 more hours at a \nminimum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we are not going to finish this bill \ntonight. We are just not going to finish it. I hope the majority leader \nwill let us go home. Not everybody in this Chamber has a wife who is as \nold as I am. We will be married 64 years next Tuesday. I think it is \ntime to go home.\n  I have been here many nights late. It has been my experience that \nwhen you reach this point in time, you don't accomplish a great deal. \nOne Senator can pretty much take a lot of time right at this point. I \ndon't want to do that. I ask the distinguished majority leader to get a \nunanimous consent request and put us out. Let us come back in tomorrow, \nand we will all feel better. I need to get home. I just plead with the \nleadership, we don't have to finish this bill tonight. We don't have \nto.\n  This is Monday, isn't it? So we have several days yet left in the \nweek. There is no reason why we have to pass this bill tonight and stay \nuntil midnight or 1 or 2 in the morning. To begin with, this is a bad \nbill. It ought not pass.\n  I am going to ask the majority leader once more to put us out.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know from past experience in the Senate, \nand from observing the Senate from the House, there have been many \noccasions when the Senate stayed late, beyond even midnight. I believe \none time, in the case of a gas deregulation bill, they went very late. \nThere is need to finish this legislation tonight. If it goes over to \ntomorrow, we should just continue going.\n  This is very important legislation, to be followed by other very \nimportant legislation. If we had some sort of understanding, some \nfinite list of amendments, that would be certainly worth considering. \nIt is important, from my conversation with Senator Daschle, to note \neven now, without completing this legislation, we still will have work \nto do on Friday and possibly Saturday.\n\n  Again, it is important that we complete this work. It is important \nthat we complete it so we can go on and begin the conference and go \nback to the education bill. It is not that late by comparison. I urge \nthe Senate to continue its work.\n  I know there had been a feeling that we should not complete it \ntonight. We need to do it. We have been working on this legislation one \nway or another for at least 3 months. We know how the final result will \ngo, and I urge the Senate to move forward with the amendments that are \noffered and get to a final conclusion tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has made a unanimous consent \nrequest. Is there objection? Without objection, the Senator is \nrecognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, what was the request?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I asked unanimous consent to address the Senate for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask the Senator from Mississippi whether he would be \nwilling to entertain putting us out tonight so long as we can develop a \nlist of subsequent amendments to be offered, say, by tomorrow? I say \nthat to my friend because there are so many amendments that could \notherwise be offered tonight, we are going to be here until 6 in the \nmorning at least.\n  I very much agree with the Senator from West Virginia. There is a \ntime and a place for everything. The time to end is probably about now. \nPerhaps we could put together a list of amendments with the \nunderstanding that that is the list, those are the amendments because, \nas we all know, at this point any number of amendments could be offered \neven subsequent to those that are being contemplated. I ask the Senator \nif he would contemplate that?\n\n[[Page S5260]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield, there has been no end to the \namendments that might be offered. I know a number of Senators have \nthree or four more amendments. I would be interested in seeing if we \ncan get an agreement on the amendments that would be proposed. That \nwould give us something we could at least consider. But in the \nmeantime, we could continue to make progress on the legislation while \nwe are seeing if there is some sort of list that can be developed. I \nthink that to stop now, without even knowing what the final product is \ngoing to be, what amendments might be offered or when the final \nconclusion would come, is not the way to proceed.\n  I know there are those who don't want us to ever complete this \nlegislation. I understand that. But we have had a full debate. We have \ncomplied with the rules that apply. And we have made it very clear for \ndays, including before we began this series of votes, that our intent \nwas to go until we concluded.\n  At this point, let's proceed with the amendments that are pending. I \nbelieve Senator Feingold has an amendment that he is ready to offer, \nand I would be glad to discuss with anybody what the final package of \namendments, what list of amendments might be developed, and we will see \nwhere we are. I will be glad to yield to Senator Nickles.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the majority leader has requested that we \nproceed with the next vote, and during the next vote Senator Reid and I \nwill see if we can't collect a list and come up with a finite list of \namendments to see what we have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the Feingold amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am entitled to recognition. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A quorum call is not in order at this time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I appeal the decision of the Chair, and I \nask for the yeas and nays. I appeal the decision of the Chair and ask \nfor the yeas and nays. I appeal the decision of the Chair, Mr. \nPresident. I am entitled to that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Let the Chair state the request.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appeal the decision of the Chair on this, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is appealing the decision of the \nChair that a quorum call is not in order at this time while 2 minutes \nremain on the amendment. Does the Senator seek the yeas and nays on the \nappeal?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is it the Chair's ruling that a request for a quorum is \nnot in order because there are still 2 minutes remaining on the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would a request for a quorum be in order at the \nconclusion of the 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nMassachusetts be recognized at the conclusion of the 2 minutes to make \nhis suggestion.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I seek recognition under leader time so I \ncan propound a unanimous consent request and get an understanding as to \nhow we are going to proceed at this point.\n  First of all, I think it is unfortunate that we see there is a delay \nbeing forced. I understand there are Senators who think we have gone \nlate enough tonight and would like for us to resume tomorrow. It is \nvery important we complete this work, and obviously we will not go to \nany other legislation until we complete this very important work of the \npeople.\n  I have listened to Senators on both sides of the aisle and am trying \nto find a way to give Senators a chance to offer their amendments and \nhave them considered. I hope that it will not be delayed indefinitely. \nCertainly that would be a subversion of the rules, but we will take a \ntime out here and hopefully tomorrow Senators will be prepared to \nresume our work and bring it to a conclusion.\n  I believe Senator Daschle intends to work with me and the managers of \nthe legislation to try to find a way to bring this debate to a \nreasonable conclusion. But I emphasize again, we have work we need to \ndo this week, and if we have to go on into Friday or Saturday, I think \nwe should be prepared to do that. Senators on both sides have indicated \nthey would be willing to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/21/senate-section/article/S5260-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

APPROVAL OF WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL SITE AND DESIGN.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the World War \n     II Memorial described in plans approved by the Commission of \n     Fine Arts on July 20, 2000 and November 16, 2000, and \n     selected by the National Capital Planning Commission on \n     September 21, 2000 and December 14, 2000, and in accordance \n     with the special use permit issued by the Secretary of the \n     Interior on January 23, 2001, and numbered NCR-NACC-5700-\n     0103, shall be constructed expeditiously at the dedicated \n     Rainbow Pool site in the District of Columbia in a manner \n     consistent with such plans and permits, subject to design \n     modifications, if any, approved in accordance with applicable \n     laws and regulations.\n\n     SEC. 2. APPLICATION OF COMMEMORATIVE WORKS ACT.\n\n       Elements of the memorial design and construction not \n     approved as of the date of enactment of this Act shall be \n     considered and approved in accordance with the requirements \n     of the Commemorative Works Act (40 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 3. JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n       The decision to locate the memorial at the Rainbow Pool \n     site in the District of Columbia and the actions by the \n     Commission of Fine Arts on July 20, 2000 and November 16, \n     2000, the actions by the National Capital Planning Commission \n     on September 21, 2000 and December 14, 2000, and the issuance \n     of the special use permit identified in section 1 shall not \n     be subject to judicial review.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I believe that it is time to honor the \nsacrifices of the World War II generation. Eight years after Congress \nauthorized the construction of this memorial, and six years from the \nfirst of 22 public hearings on its site and design, the memorial's \nconstruction remains delayed by a procedural issue involving the \nNational Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), one of the agencies \nrequired by law to approve the memorial, and a lawsuit filed by a small \ngroup of opponents. This legislation would remove those obstacles and \nrequire the construction process to promptly go forward.\n  The legislation accomplishes that goal as follows:\n  Through sections one and three, the site and design for the World War \nII Memorial are finalized, expeditious construction is directed, and \nthe prospect of further delay through judicial challenges or other re-\nconsiderations of the selected site and design are eliminated. Section \none also includes a provision regarding design modifications which is \nsolely intended to address the highly unlikely event that a technical \nimpossibility could occur in the course of construction that might \nrequire a limited deviation from the selected design. In light of the \ncareful review the existing plans have already been subject to by the \nmemorial's design, engineering, and construction management \nprofessionals, the General Services Administration (GSA), the American \nBattle Monuments Commission (ABMC), the National Park Service (NPS), \nthe Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) and the National Capital Planning \nCommission (NCPC), no exercise of this authority is expected. Moreover, \nas a result of these provisions, funds donated for the Memorial would \nnot be diverted to preparation of the additional mock-up of the \nMemorial or further presentations on the selected design that have been \nrequested of the NPS by NCPC to administratively redress that agency's \nprocedural issue resolved by this legislation.\n  The second section directs that the procedural steps of the \nCommemorative Works Act shall be used for the approval of those few \naspects of the Memorial not already finalized. These items are \nessentially the color of the granite, the flag poles, sculptural \nelements, the wording of the inscriptions to be placed on the memorial, \nand final adjustments to the level of lighting. These matters will be \npresented in due course by the NPS, representing the Secretary of the \nInterior and acting on behalf of the ABMC, to the two approving \ncommissions designated by the Commemorative Works Act: the CFA and the \nNCPC.\n  To further place this legislation in context it is important to \nbriefly describe the extensive, democratic deliberative process through \nwhich the site and design were selected.\n  After receiving Congressional approval in October 1994 to locate the \nMemorial within the National Monumental Core, many public hearings \nregarding site selection were conducted including meetings of the \nNational Capital Memorial Commission (NCMC), (May 9 and June 20, 1995), \nthe CFA (July 27 and September 19, 1995), and the NCPC (July 27 and \nOctober 5, 1995). In the course of these meetings, the CFA and NCPC, in \nconsultation with the ABMC and NCMC, reviewed eight proposed sites for \nthe Memorial. Through review of these proposals, the possibility of \nincluding the Rainbow Pool in the site for the Memorial arose at the \nJune 20, 1995, NCMC public meeting. As the deliberations continued \npursuant to the Commemorative Works Act, the appropriateness and \npotential of the Rainbow Pool as a site for the Memorial became readily \napparent. The Rainbow Pool Site was approved at an open, public meeting \nof the CFA on September 19, 1995, and the NCPC on October 5, 1995. \nPresident Clinton formally dedicated the Rainbow Pool site on Veterans' \nDay 1995.\n\n  In 1996, a national two-stage competition to select the designer for \nthe Memorial was conducted in accordance with the GSA's Design \nExcellence program. Over four hundred entries were reviewed by a \ndistinguished Evaluation Board that selected six competition finalists. \nFrom these six finalists, a design jury composed of outstanding \narchitects, landscape architects, architectural critics and WWII \nveterans, independently and unanimously recommended a design team \nheaded by Friedrich St. Florian of the Rhode Island School of Design. \nThe Evaluation Board concurred and ABMC approved the recommendation on \nNovember 20, 1996. On January 17, 1997, President Clinton announced the \nFriedrich St. Florian team as the winning design team, with Leo A. \nDaly, a pre-eminent national firm, serving as architect-engineer.\n  Through the Commemorative Works Act process, the World War II \nMemorial design underwent three general phases of public review and \napproval: design concept, preliminary design and final design. The \nMemorial design has evolved through input and participation by the \nreviewing commissions and the public. In particular, at public hearings \nheld in July of 1997, both the CFA and the NCPC considered Friedrich \nSt. Florian's initial design concept and reconsidered the approvals of \nthe Rainbow Pool Site. Both commissions reaffirmed selection of the \nRainbow Pool site on more than one ocassion; however, both also \nrequested the consideration of substantial changes to the design \nconcept. The design team subsequently undertook extensive efforts to \naddress all concerns raised by the reviewing commissions and the \npublic. Over the course of three years and nine more public meetings, \nthe Memorial design continued to evolve to its finally approved form. \nAs a result of the extensive public participation and careful review by \nthe respective commissions and other governmental agencies, the final \ndesign is one which enhances the site, preserves its historic vistas, \nand preserves the Rainbow Pool by restoring it and making it a part of \na national commemorative work.\n\n[[Page S5262]]\n\n  Finally, in the course of authorizing this Memorial, Congress asked \nthe American people to support the project through voluntary donations. \nThey certainly responded. The memorial fund-raising campaign, under the \nleadership of Senator Bob Dole and Frederick W. Smith, Chairman and CEO \nof FedEx Corporation, received financial support from half a million \nindividual Americans, hundreds of corporations and foundations, dozens \nof civic, fraternal and professional organizations, 48 state \nlegislatures, 1,100 schools, and more than 450 veterans groups \nrepresenting 11 million veterans providing the funds necessary to \nconstruct the Memorial.\n  I would like to thank my fellow World War II veterans Senator Inouye, \nSenator Thurmond, and Senator Hollings for joining me in this \namendment. I would also like to thank Senator Thompson, Senator \nMurkowski, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Thomas for their co-\nsponsorship and for their hard work on this important legislation. I \nalso want to thank the sponsor of this legislation, Congressman Stump, \nfor all of his work and dedication to insure that World War II veterans \nwill see the monument to their service. It is my hope that the House \nwill act quickly on Congressman Stump's bill with our amendment. With \nthis legislation, we will ensure that the Memorial is created within \nthe lifetimes of a significant number of those we honor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 745) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill, as \namended, be advanced to third reading and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1696), as amended, was considered read the third time \nand passed.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senate today passed H.R. 1696, \nlegislation authorizing expeditious construction of the World War II \nMemorial at the Rainbow Pool site on the National Mall in a manner \nconsistent with previously approved plans, but ``subject to design \nmodifications'' that may subsequently be approved by the National \nCapital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts under the \nCommemorative Works Act. In rejecting the original House bill in favor \nof this legislation, the Senate today recognizes that appropriate \nmodifications to the design may be warranted. The bill permits the \nNational Capital Planning Commission to proceed with its plans to view \nan on-site mock-up of the memorial and to consider modifications to the \ndesign that will ensure that the memorial respects the open, historic \ncharacter of the Mall, that significant vistas are not obstructed, and \nthat the height and mass of this memorial are appropriate for the site. \nConsistent with this legislation, such modifications ought to be \nexpeditiously considered and approved by the National Capital Planning \nCommission and the Commission of Fine Arts so that construction of the \nmemorial may proceed without undue delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/21/senate-section/article/S5262-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECSTASY EXPLOSION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in March I held a hearing on the growing \nthreat of Ecstasy use in America. For a long time we've been hearing \nthat the Ecstasy problem is coming. Well, it's arrived. We heard some \ndisturbing news at this hearing. We heard first-hand testimony from two \nformer users how this ``feel-good'' drug ruined their lives and almost \nkilled them. It's clear to me that this drug is destroying families and \nlives. Ecstasy, like all drug use, is a serious challenge facing our \ncountry.\n  Ecstasy is a synthetic stimulant. It is called a club drug because it \nis most commonly used at parties and all-night dance clubs called \nraves. Its use by youth to enhance the experience of the music and the \ndancing in clubs, has become very popular. Because it is marketed in \nclubs, most users are young, as well as most sellers.\n  At the hearing in March, the White House released the latest Pulse \nCheck report that outlined the recent trends in Ecstasy use. This \nreport confirmed that most users are children and young adults. These \ndrugs are clearly targeted at youths. Ecstasy is found primarily in \npill form and manufacturers put cartoons and flashy corporate logos on \nthe pills to make them more appealing.\n  Ecstasy use is spreading around the country and is affecting all \nareas. The Pulse Check report shows that both rural and urban areas are \nexperiencing an Ecstasy explosion. In fact, 18 of the 20 cities in the \nreport labeled Ecstasy as an emerging drug. This isn't the drug of the \nbig city anymore, it is now in hometown America.\n  As the demand is increasing, the availability of Ecstasy is \nincreasing too. The report shows that widespread usage and availability \nincreased dramatically over the past year. Ninety percent of all drug \ntreatment and law enforcement experts say that Ecstasy is readily \naccessible. If we continue to allow easy access to this drug at clubs \nand in schools, then this problem will just get worse.\n  One of the greatest dangers of Ecstasy is how it is used. The report \nstated that Ecstasy is losing its purity and is now commonly \nadulterated with other, even more dangerous drugs, such as heroin and \namphetamines. Users usually don't know the level of the drug they are \ntaking and will overdose easily. And at parties and dances, Ecstasy is \nmost often taken with several other drugs, most commonly alcohol, but \nalso LSD, marijuana, and cocaine. This deadly cocktail of drugs is \nmaking ambulances at clubs an all too common sight. These ambulances, \nthat are now shuttling more unconscious youth than ever before from \nnightclubs to hospital emergency rooms, are often private ambulances \nthat are hired by the nightclubs themselves. They wait outside the \nclubs until someone overdoses from the use of Ecstasy, thus bypasing \n911 and the attention of the police. My outrage with this practice is \nheightened by the low level of care and lack of advanced life support \nthat these ambulance crews provide at such dangerous moments. Many \nyouth are not safely making it to hospital emergency rooms.\n  The situation is becoming an emergency. We need to make it clear to \ntoday's youth that this drug is very dangerous and that using it \ncarries heavy consequences. This drug rips apart families and ruins \nlives at a very young age. Many youth start using this drug before they \nare old enough to fully grasp the results of their actions. We need to \neducate our youth and crack down on sellers to combat the increasing \navailability of this drug. We cannot let this attack on our Nation's \nyouth go unchecked.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/21/senate-section/article/S5262-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5262-S5263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy last month. The \nLocal Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current \nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a heinous crime that occurred March 1, 2000 \nin Salt Lake City, Utah. Two defendants pleaded guilty to misdemeanor \nassault charges for their part in a 45-minute crime spree that began \noutside a gay bar. During the crime spree, two people were beaten and \nthree others terrorized. ``Are you a faggot?'' one of the defendants \nyelled. ``He is a faggot!'' another replied as they chased the first \nvictim to his car and pounded on his vehicle until the victim was able \nto escape to call the police. Later, the defendants yelled anti-gay \nslurs and threw beer bottles at another car that had two men in it. \nForty-five minutes after the initial attack, the defendants waited \noutside the gay bar and beat two men who had just exited the bar. One \nof the defendants told the arresting officer they were ``just out for a \ngood time.''\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe\n\n[[Page S5263]]\n\nthat by passing this legislation, we can change hearts and minds as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/21/senate-section/article/S5263-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the life \nof Bill Ellison, a courageous and heroic man from my home State of \nOhio, who died on March 20, 2001, at the age of 38. Bill was a \nparamedic and firefighter who died of burn injuries he incurred while \nfighting a house fire in Miami Township, OH. I am honored to recognize \nhim today for his heroism and his commitment and dedication to his \nlocal community and State.\n  Since 1997, Bill Ellison served as a full-time firefighter for \nAnderson Township, OH, as well as a part-time firefighter for Miami \nTownship. He also worked for the Western Joint Ambulance District. Bill \nbegan dedicating himself to his community early on, when, at age 16, he \nfirst volunteered for the Melbourne, OH, Fire Department. His \nexceptional commitment to protecting his community deserves our respect \nand thanks.\n  On March 8, 2001, Bill left the Miami Township fire station to \nrespond to a nearby house fire. Upon learning of a possible victim \ntrapped in the house, he joined other firefighters to search for the \nindividual. During the search, Bill fell through the first floor of the \nhome into the basement, where he was knocked unconscious and sustained \nserious burn injuries. Nearly two weeks after the fire, he passed away \nas a result of these critical injuries.\n  Bill's many friends and colleagues often called him ``Doc,'' because \nhe was constantly reading medical texts.

As the father of \ntwo daughters, Maryssa and Michaela, and husband to Victoria, Bill \nEllison and his legacy will live on through his family and his work.\n  It is the work of people, like Bill Ellison, that provides us with \npeace of mind, with the knowledge that there are people who we can \ncount on in case of an emergency. These individuals, who often make \ngrave sacrifices on our behalf, are role models for our communities. I \ncannot adequately emphasize how important their work, and the work of \nBill Ellison, are to our society.\n  Today, I express my deep gratitude to Bill Ellison, his colleagues, \nand his family and friends.

Mr. President, I would like take this \nopportunity to commend the University of Nebraska baseball team for \nwinning a third-straight Big 12 Conference Series Championship. \nYesterday, in what has become a typical display of terrific teamwork \nand fierce talent, the Huskers defeated Texas A to sweep the series.\n  The University of Nebraska baseball team boasts a 45-14 record, and \nnow, thanks to their dominance at the Big12 tournament, they will \nlikely earn a top-eight seed on the national level. To add to the \nexcitement, the Huskers will play next month at the College World \nSeries in Omaha, which President Bush is scheduled to attend.\n  In fact, to honor the President's upcoming trip, I have considered \nseeking an appropriation for the repainting of Air Force One in Husker \nRed and putting the block ``N'' on the tail of the plane; however, \nshould that scheme fail, I have an alternate plan to ensure that the \nPresident roots for the home team.\n  Last week, I personally delivered a Huskers baseball cap to the \nPresident, and I intend to accompany him aboard Air Force One to make \ncertain he wears it as he disembarks the plane in Nebraska. The College \nWorld Series is always exciting, but this year, with our terrific team, \nthe President will have the opportunity to see college baseball at its \nbest.\n  Again, I offer my heartiest congratulations to each member of the \nteam, and I applaud Coach Dave Van Horn for his leadership. I wish them \nthe very best as they continue to play ball.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/21/senate-section/article/S5263-4", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5263-S5264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DORIS CASEY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, a recently released study from \nDuke University found that older Americans are enjoying a more vigorous \nold age. Fewer people over the age of 65 require nursing home care and \nmore are living on their own, with little or no outside help.\n  The image of a ``senior citizen'' is dramatically different than it \nwas just a generation ago. Since 1963, the month of May has helped the \nNation focus on the contributions and achievements of America's older \ncitizens. Older Americans Month honors the leadership of older persons \nin our families, workplaces and communities. One of these leaders is an \n81-year-old woman from Reinbeck. Doris Casey is a champion for Iowa's \nolder citizens. Through her initiative, concern, and commitment, she \nhas touched the lives of seniors in Reinbeck and throughout northern \nIowa.\n  When the Casey's moved to Reinbeck in 1967, the family planned to \nstay for only six weeks. As a way to get to know neighbors and make \nfriends, Mrs. Casey began volunteering at the local nursing home once a \nweek and played cards with the residents. Thirty-four years later, Mrs. \nCasey still lives in Reinbeck. She worked at that nursing home for 17 \nyears and has become a treasured resource in the community for her \nknowledge and action on senior-related issues. Mrs. Casey has been a \nmember of the Grundy County Commission on Aging for 28 years. She \nplayed a key role in starting the county's congregate meal program \nsixteen years ago. Although the program has since changed to home-\ndelivered meals, Mrs. Casey is still involved. She does the books, \ntakes orders and solicits deliverers. In addition, Mrs. Casey helps \ncoordinate a community meal for approximately 40 seniors in Reinbeck \neach month.\n  For the last 27 years, Mrs. Casey has been an active volunteer with \nthe Hawkeye Valley Area Agency on Aging and until recently was a member \nof their board of directors. The staff at Hawkeye Valley call her a \ngodsend. She volunteers in the administrative office, helps with \nspecial projects and answers the hotline for those alleging Medicare \nfraud and abuse under Operation Restore Trust. Mrs. Casey works hard to \nensure that seniors in her community have the latest information on \nissues affecting their lives. She is a monthly presenter at the county \nnutrition site and writes a weekly column for her local paper. She \nprovides assistance to those applying for Medicaid and low-income \nheating assistance, and she serves on the State's consumer Medicare \ncommittee. People know that if Mrs. Casey doesn't have the answer on a \nparticular senior issue, she will likely know the person who does.\n  Last but certainly not least, Mrs. Casey is a caregiver. When her \nlate husband, John, was suffering from Alzheimer's Disease, she served \nas his full-time caregiver. Mrs. Casey is currently a guardian for a \nsenior with a disability. And, she still visits the local nursing home \nto share devotions with the residents a few times a year. Mrs. Casey \ncarries out each of these activities with joy, determination and \nhumility. Even a recent hip surgery won't\n\n[[Page S5264]]\n\nkeep her from carrying on with her duties. Her contributions to the \ncommunity are many, yet she describes the rewards as all hers.\n  In one month, Mrs. Casey will turn 82. Happy early birthday, Mrs. \nCasey. Thank you for your compassion for the people of Reinbeck and the \npeople of Iowa. Your commitment and concern for others is an example to \nus all that we should contribute to the lives of those around us, no \nmatter what our age.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/21/senate-section/article/S5264-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN RECOGNITION OF JIM HETTINGER: PRESIDENT AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF \n                         BATTLE CREEK UNLIMITED\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to speak today to \nacknowledge a gentleman, from my home State of Michigan, who has served \nthe citizens of Battle Creek, Jim Hettinger. On May 24th of this year, \npeople will gather to pay tribute to Jim Hettinger for his tenure as \nExecutive Director of Battle Creek Unlimited (BCU).\n  Jim Hettinger has dedicated his professional career, to the \ndevelopment of jobs and opportunities for individuals in the \ncommunities where he has worked. For the past twenty years, Jim has \nserved as the president and executive director of Battle Creek \nUnlimited, Battle Creek's economic development agency.\n  In the past two decades, Battle Creek has witnessed numerous changes \nin its economic landscape, but throughout that time period Jim has been \nworking to ensure the economic health and vitality of Battle Creek. As \ndirector of Battle Creek Unlimited, Jim Hettinger tirelessly works to \npromote Battle Creek as an ideal place for businesses to locate. His \npromotion of Battle Creek has spanned the globe, and has yielded \nimpressive results.\n  A Michigan native, Jim returned to his home State to work for Battle \nCreek United after working for the Mid-Missouri Council of Government \nwhere he was able to lure a German company to Missouri instead of \nBattle Creek. However, since arriving in Battle Creek, he has created \nan industrial park that is recognized as second to none.\n  Under Jim's guidance, BCU has turned Fort Custer, an abandoned \nmilitary base, into an industrial park that contains over ninety \nbusinesses that provide over 8,000 jobs. The Fort Custer Industrial \nPark provides good-paying jobs to thousands of individuals by \nharnessing the dynamism of the global economy. Nearly, three-quarters \nof the workers in the Ft. Custer Industrial Park are employed by \nJapanese owned companies. The willingness of international businesses \nto locate in Battle Creek is testimony to Jim's ability to bridge \ncultures and convince companies to utilize Battle Creek's world-class \nworkers and receptive business environment.\n  Jim Hettinger's hard work has been recognized by Michigan Governor \nJohn Engler who awarded him the Economic Developer of the Year Award in \n1995. Last year, the Counsel General of Japan in Detroit awarded Mr. \nHettinger with a ``Certificate of Designation'' on behalf of the \nGovernment of Japan.\n  I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in saluting Jim Hettinger \nfor his career of public service, particularly his efforts to provide \nquality jobs to the residents of the Battle Creek community while \nfostering a vibrant and dynamic relationship between the Battle Creek \narea and Japan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/21/senate-section/article/S5264-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MAERSK McKINNEY MOLLER\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues \na few remarks about a very remarkable gentlemen that visited with me \nrecently. Maersk McKinney Moller is a legendary figure in his native \nDenmark. And after our meeting, I've come to appreciate even more his \nties to the United States and the history he's lived in his 86 years.\n  Mr. Moller, as some of my colleagues may know, is the owner of the \nworld's largest shipping company--the AP Moller Group. Its U.S. \nheadquarters were founded in 1943, and its U.S. affiliate, Maersk Line, \nLimited was chartered in Delaware in 1947. Today, it generates \nemployment for approximately 9000 Americans through 10 U.S. corporate \nentities devoted to ship management, terminal operations, trucking, \nrail, transportation and logistics services. On a global scale AP \nMoller controls approximately 250 ships, 53 of which fly the stars and \nstripes of the United States. It is notably, the largest US-flag \ncommercial fleet in the world.\n  Mr. Mollers' ties to the United States go back to 1910, well before \nhe was even born. In that year his father, Arnold Peter Moller, married \nChastine Estelle McKinney, a native of Kansas City, MO. Returning to \nCopenhagen, the senior Moller had by 1940 built a fleet of 46 ships, \nmany of which were engaged by the US and its allies in WWII.\n  April 1940 saw Germany invaded Denmark and young Maersk McKinney \nMoller's life fundamentally changed. With his bride of five days, he \ncame to the United States. With personal assets blocked by the war, \ntimes were financially lean and his lifestyle was modest. The ensuing \neight years, however, marked a period that cemented his enduring bond \nwith Americans and admiration for U.S. armed forces.\n  By the time WWII ended in 1945, 148 Maersk seamen had lost their \nlives and the Maersk fleet had lost 25 vessels.\n  That personal history would color much of what followed for Maersk-\nMcKinney. After the war, he and his father rebuilt the AP Moller Group \ninto the global shipping powerhouse it is today. Along the way, he has \nmaintained a close relationship with the United States and her allies \nin ways that make a significant contribution to our national security.\n  For nearly 20 years Maersk Lines, Limited, has partnered with the \nUnited States Marine Corps to preposition ships and supplies where \nneeded. Maersk ships, in fact, were the first vessels to arrive in \nDesert Storm and off-load critically needed Marine Corps supplies and \nequipment.\n  Prior to Desert Storm, Maersk Line, Limited obtained a secret \nclearance from the Department of Defense and now has a top-secret \nclearance to operate sensitive surveillance ships for the US Navy.\n  I point these things out to my colleagues for a couple of reasons. \nFirst, as a matter of general interest, I wish more of my colleagues \ncould have the pleasure of visiting with Mr. Moller. His personal \nhistory has imbued him with a very thoughtful approach and seasoned \nperspective on global issues.\n  Second, as the man behind the largest commercial fleet of US-flag \nships, he has proven to be a valuable partner to our defense interests. \nHis ships and loading facilities and transportation infrastructure have \nmoved literally tons of supplies that support our men and women in \nuniform.\n  In the future the Maritime Security Program, MSP, one of the programs \ncritical for maintaining a US-flagged shipping fleet, will need to be \nreauthorized. During times of critical national need, MSP participants \nlike Maersk Line, Limited are contractually obligated to the \nstatutorily mandated Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement, VISA. I, \nfor one, am reassured to know that a man of Maersk McKinney Moller's \nstature and integrity is involved so strongly in this aspect of our \nnational defense. He has proven his value to our Nation many times \nover.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/21/senate-section/article/S5264-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5264-S5265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TOWNS COUNTY MIDDLE SCHOOL LAPTOP PROGRAM\n\n Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I want to affirm what TIME magazine \nhas written in its May 21, 2001, issue: Towns County Middle School in \nGeorgia is one of America's ``educational pioneers.''\n  In my native Towns County, the digital divide has become the digital \nopportunity. Every middle school student in the county totes a laptop \ncomputer from school to home, courtesy of a Federal grant and local \ndonations. Classroom wiring connects the laptops to the Internet, and \nteachers incorporate the Web into lesson plans. At home, students \nquestion teachers online about homework, and teachers email missed \nassignments to students who are out sick.\n  In a section called TIME's Schools of the Year, the magazine called \nthis 265-student school ``one of the best-wired middle schools in the \nU.S.'' and cited it as one of two middle schools in the Nation that has \n``found the most promising approaches to the most pressing challenges \nin education.''\n  Principal Stephen Smith convinced me as Governor that giving take-\nhome\n\n[[Page S5265]]\n\nlaptop computers to all middle-schoolers in Towns County would greatly \nenhance learning. We obtained a grant from the Appalachian Regional \nCommission and local donations to make this happen, and the program has \nsucceeded beyond anyone's expectations. Test scores and attendance have \nincreased, while discipline referrals have dropped. In addition, \nparents have become more involved in the school and more of them are \nearning their GEDs, and borrowing their kids' computers for \nassignments.\n  I am very proud of the achievements at Towns County Middle School, \nand I congratulate Principal Smith, his teachers and all the students \nand parents on this national recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/21/senate-section/article/S5265-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FREEDOM TOWER\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today, the Cuban \nAmerican National Foundation will dedicate Miami's ``Freedom Tower'' in \ncelebration of Cuban Independence Day. This historic landmark is known \nto many Cuban political refugees as the ``Ellis Island of the South.'' \nThe Freedom Tower served as an immigration processing center in the \n1960's and 1970's and became a symbol of democracy and freedom to \nCubans fleeing from tyranny and oppression. I rise today to recognize \nnot only this dedication, but the hard work and sacrifice of the Cuban \nAmericans in Florida who have added so much to our Nation, and who, \nthrough their work to restore the Freedom Tower, have given us yet \nanother gift.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/21/senate-section/article/S5265-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HONORING ALBERT GAMPER, GEORGE RING, AND ROSE CALI\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President I rise today to recognize Albert \nR. Gamper, George M.

Mr. Gamper has devoted \ncountless hours and tremendous energy to organizations that touch the \nlives of thousands of New Jersey's families.\n  I also wanted to salute Mr. Ring for his commitment to our Nation. He \nput his life on the line for this country when he served in the \nmilitary and has received various distinguished medals for his many \nachievements, valor and dedicated service to America.\n  Ms. Cali, founder of the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center, has \ninvested much of her time into education and the arts. As a board \nmember of a major State educational institution of higher learning and \nas a board member of her community's museum, she has made critical \ncontributions in both of these areas and continues to do so.

A joint memorial adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Washington relative to the \n     Leavenworth National Fish Hatchery; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                       Senate Joint Memorial 8006\n\n       Whereas, The Leavenworth National Fish Hatchery located on \n     the Icicle River, a tributary of the Wenatchee River, and \n     operated by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, \n     performs the admirable function of producing spring chinook \n     salmon, providing benefits to the entire Columbia River \n     region; and\n       Whereas, The Icicle River is a watershed that is home to \n     three fish species, chinook salmon, steelhead trout, and bull \n     trout, that are currently listed as threatened or endangered \n     under the federal endangered species act; and\n       Whereas, Watershed restoration efforts are being undertaken \n     on a large scale by the State of Washington, treaty Indian \n     tribes, public utility districts, county, local, and city \n     governments, and local volunteer groups, to assist the \n     recovery of Icicle River and Wenatchee River salmon and \n     trout; and\n       Whereas, The Leavenworth National Fish Hatchery currently \n     utilizes a water withdrawal design that does not provide \n     proper protection for salmon and trout, some of which are \n     naturally spawned endangered steelhead trout, endangered \n     spring run chinook salmon, or threatened bull trout; and\n       Whereas, Operation of the Leavenworth National Fish \n     Hatchery could be modified with construction of fish passage \n     devices that would result in no jeopardy to listed salmon and \n     trout;\n       Now, therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that \n     the United States Fish and Wildlife Service will make the \n     proper modifications, in a timely manner, to the water \n     withdrawal structure at the Leavenworth National Fish \n     Hatchery so that its operation will be consistent with the \n     federal endangered species act.\n       Be it resolved, That the United States Fish and Wildlife \n     Service apply for sufficient funding to construct the fish \n     passage modifications necessary at the Leavenworth National \n     Fish Hatchery, and that Congress shall see fit to appropriate \n     the necessary funds;\n       Be it further resolved, That copies of this Memorial be \n     immediately transmitted to the Honorable George W. Bush, \n     President of the United States, the United States Fish and \n     Wildlife Service, the President of the United States Senate, \n     the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member \n     of Congress from the State of Washington.\n       POM-57. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Montana relative to the reduction of Forest \n     Fuels; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the United States Forest Service was first \n     organized to protect the national forests from fire and to \n     provide a sustainable supply of timber, water, goods, and \n     services for the people of the United States; and\n       Whereas, citizens of Montana and communities throughout the \n     western United States still depend on the prudent \n     stewardship, the sustained utilization of resources, and the \n     steady production of goods and services from the multiple use \n     management of public lands in those western states; and\n       Whereas, the April 1999 U.S. General Accounting Office \n     report, ``Western National Forests, a Cohesive Strategy is \n     Needed to Address Catastrophic Wildfire Threats'' states, \n     ``the most extensive and serious problem related to the \n     health of national forests in the interior West is the \n     overaccumulation of vegetation, which has caused an \n     increasing number of large, intense, uncontrollable, and \n     catastrophically destructive wildfires''; and\n       Whereas, the April 2000 U.S. Forest Service report, \n     ``Protecting People and Sustaining Resources in Fire-Adapted \n     Ecosystems: A Cohesive Strategy'' in response to the General \n     Accounting Office report, confirmed the conclusion stated \n     above and further warns ``Without increased restoration \n     treatments in these ecosystems wildland fire suppression \n     costs, natural resource losses, private property losses, and \n     environmental damage are certain to escalate as fuels \n     continue to accumulate and more acres become high-risk.'', \n     and the report also specifies that, at a low intensity, fire \n     is ecologically beneficial and has positive effects on \n     biodiversity, soil productivity, and water quality; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. Forest Service further acknowledges that \n     39 million acres of national forest are at significant risk \n     of catastrophic wildfire and an additional 26 million acres \n     will be at similar risk due to increases\n\n[[Page S5267]]\n\n     in the mortality of trees and brush caused by insects and \n     disease; and\n       Whereas, catastrophic wildfires, such as those in \n     California in 1993, Florida in 1998, and Montana and Idaho in \n     2000, are recognized as among the defining natural disasters \n     of the past decade; and\n       Whereas, the conflagrations that engulfed hundreds of \n     thousands of acres in Montana during 2000 caused millions of \n     dollars of damage to the property of residents; and\n       Whereas, catastrophic wildfires not only cause damage to \n     the forests and other lands, but place the lives of \n     firefighters at risk and pose threats to human health, \n     personal property, sustainable ecosystems, air quality, and \n     water quality; and\n       Whereas, the escaped Cerro Grande Prescribed Fire in May, \n     2000, which consumed 48,000 acres and destroyed 400 homes \n     with losses exceeding $1 billion in Los Alamos, New Mexico, \n     and the escaped Lowden Prescribed Fire in 1999 that destroyed \n     23 homes in Lewiston, California, highlight the unacceptable \n     risks of using prescribed burning if prescribed burning, as \n     reported, was the sole forest management practice of the \n     subject federal land management agencies; and\n       Whereas, high-risk forest fuel has accumulated in \n     combination with reduced fire response capability by federal \n     agencies during the 1990s, resulting in catastrophic \n     wildfires becoming more difficult and expensive to extinguish \n     with a disproportionate burden being placed on state and \n     local resources, the costs to fight these fires has increased \n     by 150% between 1986 and 1994, and the costs of maintaining a \n     readiness force has increased by 70% between 1992 and 1997; \n     and\n       Whereas, current planning efforts of the U.S. Forest \n     Service, such as the Sierra Nevada Framework, the Interior \n     Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project, the Roadless \n     Initiative, and the federal monument proclamations rely \n     primarily on the extensive use of prescribed fire, which will \n     further exacerbate the risk of catastrophic wildfires on \n     federal lands throughout the West: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Montana:\n       (1) That in the interest of protecting the integrity and \n     posterity of Montana's forests, wild lands, wildlife habitat, \n     watersheds, air quality, human health and safety, and private \n     property, the U.S. Forest Service and other federal land \n     management agencies are urged to immediately implement a \n     cohesive strategy to reduce the overabundance of forest fuels \n     that place these resources at high risk of catastrophic \n     wildfire.\n       (2) That the agencies are urged to utilize an appropriate \n     mix of fire suppression activities and forest management \n     methodologies, including selective thinning, selective \n     harvesting, grazing, the removal of excessive ground fuels, \n     small-scale prescribed burns, and the increased use of \n     private, local, and state contracts for prefire treatments on \n     federal forest lands.\n       (3) That the Legislature urges that more effective fire \n     suppression in federal forest lands be pursued through \n     increased funding of mutual aid agreements with state and \n     local public firefighting agencies.\n       (4) That in the interest of forest protection and rural \n     community safety, the federal Department of Agriculture and \n     the Department of Interior are urged to immediately draft, \n     for public review and adoption, a national prescribed fire \n     strategy for public lands that creates a process for the \n     evaluation of worst case scenarios that present a risk of \n     escaped prescribed fires and identifies alternatives that \n     will achieve the land management objectives while minimizing \n     the risk and use of prescribed fire, and that this strategy \n     be incorporated into any regulatory land use planning program \n     that proposes the use of prescribed fire as a management \n     practice. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State send copies of this \n     resolution to President George W. Bush, Vice President \n     Richard Cheney, Department of Interior Secretary Gale Norton, \n     Department of Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman, the \n     Governors of Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, California, \n     Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, South Dakota, Colorado, Arizona, and \n     New Mexico, Montana's Congressional Delegation, the Chief of \n     the U.S. Forest Service, the Director of the U.S. Park \n     Service, and the Director of the Bureau of Land Management.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-58. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Montana relative to electricity prices in the \n     West; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, wholesale prices of electricity have soared to \n     unprecedented levels, reaching as high as 30 times the prices \n     of a year ago; and\n       Whereas, many of the state's largest businesses purchase \n     power at rates tied to wholesale price indices, and a growing \n     number of these businesses have been compelled to curtail \n     production or cease operations altogether and lay off \n     hundreds of workers because of high energy costs; and\n       Whereas, wholesale price increases will lead to sharp \n     increases in retail electricity prices for business, \n     agricultural, and residential consumers in Montana in the \n     near future, with potentially devastating economic \n     consequences; and\n       Whereas, high wholesale energy prices threaten the solvency \n     of utilities in Montana and throughout the Northwest region; \n     and\n       Whereas, taxpayer-supported public entities such as the \n     Montana university system, other public schools, and local \n     governments face unanticipated cost increases for energy and \n     may have to scale back their operations to meet these costs; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission exercises \n     jurisdiction over wholesale power generation sold in \n     interstate commerce; and\n       Whereas, actions taken to date by the federal Department of \n     Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to \n     address problems in the wholesale market have not resulted in \n     any meaningful reduction in wholesale power prices; and\n       Whereas, in December 2000 and in January, 2001 the United \n     States Secretary of Energy issued orders requiring certain \n     energy entities to generate, deliver, interchange, and \n     transmit electrical energy when requested by the California \n     independent system operator, and these orders have been \n     extended on repeated additional occasions; and\n       Whereas, several of the companies that received the energy \n     from these entities are in an unstable financial condition, \n     and there are serious questions about their ability to meet \n     their obligations to pay for this electricity; and\n       Whereas, without strong and immediate action by the federal \n     government to lower wholesale power prices, Montana and other \n     western states could suffer long-term and irreversible \n     economic harm: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Montana: That the President of the United \n     States, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission take strong, short-term measures to \n     reduce wholesale prices throughout the Western region; be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the new administration act immediately to \n     develop and implement a long-term strategy to reform the \n     wholesale energy market to avoid continued price spikes that \n     threaten to undermine the prosperity of the western United \n     States; be it further\n       Resolved, That the new administration commit to providing \n     assistance to low-income citizens who are most at risk from \n     volatile energy prices; be it further\n       Resolved, That the federal government commit to allowing \n     the western states to work toward fulfilling the region's \n     energy supply needs through existing relationships and to \n     refraining from any additional orders directing suppliers to \n     provide electricity to California; be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the \n     United States, the Honorable Spencer Abraham, Secretary of \n     Energy, the members of the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of \n     Congress from the state of Montana.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-59. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Washington relative to the trade of upland \n     acquacultural products in relations with Canada; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Senate Joint Memorial 8016\n\n       Whereas, The upland aquaculture industry in Washington \n     state produce high-quality, pathogen-free, nonanadromous \n     upland products for sale to public agencies and private \n     companies throughout the world; and\n       Whereas, Washington state's upland acquaculture industry \n     employs hundreds of people in well-paying, technical \n     positions located in many rural communities throughout the \n     state, generating forty million dollars worth of products; \n     and\n       Whereas, Canadian customers have expressed the desire to \n     purchase high-quality aquacultural products from Washington \n     state producers; and\n       Whereas, Many customers in the United States currently \n     purchase aquacultural products from Canada; and\n       Whereas, Increased freedom to engage in the commercial \n     trade of upland aquacultural products between the United \n     States and Canada will only help our two nations grow more \n     prosperous;\n       Now, therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that \n     the government of the United States emphasize the importance \n     of the free and fair trade of upland aquacultural products in \n     its relations with the government of Canada.\n       Be it resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of \n     Congress from the State of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-60.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to Americans \n     interned during World War II; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                     House Concurrent Resolution 50\n\n       Whereas, during World War II, approximately 120,000 \n     Japanese Americans and permanent resident aliens of Japanese \n     ancestry were interned, relocated, or evacuated from their \n     homes in the United States because of their race; and\n       Whereas, nearly fifty years later the country apologized \n     for this grave injustice, and passed the Civil Liberties Act \n     of 1988, authorizing payments of $20,000 to each such person \n     who suffered as a result; and\n       Whereas, the Civil Liberties Act does not cover or even \n     address the Japanese of Latin American ancestry who were \n     interned in the United States during World War II; and\n       Whereas, during World War II, the United States put \n     pressure on thirteen nations in Central and South America to \n     deport to the United States and intern their citizens and \n     legal residents of Japanese of Latin American ancestry; and\n       Whereas, 2,264 Japanese Latin Americans were so deported \n     and interned: nearly nine hundred were involuntarily \n     exchanged for prisoners of war and of the one thousand four \n     hundred who remained in United States concentration camps, \n     more than one thousand were deported to Japan after the war \n     and the majority of the remainder forced to work for \n     subminimum wages on farms, twelve hours a day, seven days a \n     week; and\n       Whereas, a small token apology was made in 1998 resulting \n     from settlement of the case of Mochizuki v. United States, in \n     which the United States offered an apology and a token \n     settlement of $5000, to be paid from the 1988 Civil Liberties \n     Act fund as long as the moneys were available; and\n       Whereas, the monetary reparation is symbolic and the \n     discrepancy between the reparations given to the Japanese \n     Americans and the Japanese Latin Americans is insulting, \n     painful, and denies the very real fact that these people were \n     ripped from their homes, deported to another country, and \n     classified as ``illegal enemy aliens'' after the war; and\n       Whereas, section 23 of the 1999 Mochizuki v. United States \n     agreement, that gave nominal reparations to a limited number \n     of Japanese Latin Americans provides: ``Nothing in this \n     agreement shall be deemed to override any subsequent \n     legislative enactment designed to compensate class members''; \n     and\n       Whereas, the approximately one thousand five hundred \n     surviving interned Japanese Latin Americans are rapidly \n     passing away and the equalization of reparations should be \n     done while they can appreciate its symbolism; and\n       Whereas, justice dictates that the suffering of the \n     interned Japanese of Latin American ancestry be recognized \n     and that this wrong be righted; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the house of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     first Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2001, the Senate concurring, That Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation is urged to support and co-sponsor legislation in \n     Congress to equalize reparations for Japanese of Latin \n     American ancestry interned during World War II; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, \n     and the members of Hawaii's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n        POM-62. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to Hawaii \n     Volcanoes National Park; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                          House Resolution 56\n\n       Whereas, the Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island \n     consisting of 217,000 acres is one of only two national parks \n     in this State; and\n       Whereas, the Volcanoes National Park attracts about \n     1,500,000 visitors each year who enjoy the natural beauty of \n     the lava fields, native forests, and ocean cliffs; and\n       Whereas, a large parcel of land lying to the south and west \n     of the Volcanoes National Park known as Kahuku Ranch \n     consisting of 117,000 acres has come up for sale; and\n       Whereas, the Kahuku Ranch is a piece of real estate that \n     contains outstanding geological, biological, and cultural, \n     scenic, and recreational value; and\n       Whereas, the National Park Service since 1945 has \n     recognized that the property contained nationally significant \n     resources and in fact, in its 1975 Master Plan, the National \n     Park service identified the property as a ``potential \n     addition to improve the geological, ecological, and scenic \n     integrity of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park''; and\n       Whereas, this sale offers an opportunity rarely imagined \n     because it gives the National Park Service an excellent \n     chance to expand and protect native plants and archaeological \n     sites from destruction; and\n       Whereas, this opportunity can benefit current and future \n     generations of residents and tourists, because expansion of \n     the of the Volcanoes National Park will preserve more open \n     space, add to the natural environment, protect affected \n     native species, and preserve cultural and historical sites; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Volcanoes National Park has been soliciting \n     comments from the public regarding possible purchase of \n     Kahuku Ranch and addressing the concerns of access for \n     hunters, cultural practices, educational purposes, jobs, and \n     small business opportunities; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     first Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2001, That this body supports the acquisition of Kahuku Ranch \n     by the United States National Park Service for expansion of \n     the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park; and be it further\n       Resolved That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the Superintendent, Hawaii Volcanoes National \n     Park; the Speaker of the United State House of \n     Representative; the President of the United States Senate; \n     and to the meeting of Hawaii's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-63.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Ohio relative to the New Markets \n     for State-Inspected Meat Act; to the Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                         Senate Resolution 126\n\n       Be it resolved by the Senate of the State of Ohio:\n       Whereas, In 1967, the Wholesome Meat Inspection Act and the \n     Wholesome Poultry Products Act authorized any state with an \n     inspection program certified by the United States Department \n     of Agriculture as at least equal to the federal program to \n     inspect meat and poultry products for distribution within the \n     state's borders. Currently, the United States Department of \n     Agriculture primarily regulates large meat-packing \n     operations, and state inspection programs have developed \n     expertise in addressing the unique needs of small meat-\n     packing operations; and\n\n[[Page S5269]]\n\n       Whereas, In spite of the fact that state programs must be \n     at least equal to the federal program, a ban exists on the \n     interstate shipment of state-inspected meat. However, meat \n     that is inspected in foreign countries is not prohibited from \n     being sold in this country; and\n       Whereas, The ban on the interestate shipment of state-\n     inspected meat has a chilling effect on the growth and \n     prosperity of small meat packers in this country. Not only do \n     the small operations face competition from large domestic \n     meat packers, they are forced to sit idly by while foreign \n     operations have access to purchasers who are off-limits to \n     the small packers; and\n       Whereas, The New Markets for State-Inspected Meat Act of \n     the 106th United States Congress reinforced a single safety \n     standard between the state programs and the United States \n     Department of Agriculture for all meat and poultry \n     inspections and authorized the interestate shipment of state-\n     inspected products. The proposed law thus provided equal \n     participation in the meat industry for all meat packers while \n     ensuring that the health of consumers would not be \n     compromised. However, the Congress adjourned without enacting \n     it; now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the State of Ohio urges the \n     107th Congress of the United States to reintroduce and pass \n     the New Markets for State-Inspected Meat Act as a means of \n     assisting small meat-packing operations and to restore \n     fairness to the meat industry in this country; and be it\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit duly \n     authenticated copies of this resolution to the Speaker and \n     Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, to the \n     President Pro Tempore and Secretary of the United States \n     Senate, to the members of the Ohio Congressional delegation, \n     and to the news media of Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/21/senate-section/article/S5269-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEE\n\n  The following executive reports of committee were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. WARNER for the Committee on Armed Services.\n       Alfred Rascon, of California, to be Director of Selective \n     Service.\n       David S.C.

A bill to provide more child support money to families \nleaving welfare, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Children First \nChild Support Reform Act of 2001, and I want to thank Senators Snowe, \nBayh, Graham, Johnson, Lieberman, Rockefeller, Breaux and Lincoln for \ncosponsoring. I am also pleased to cosponsor Senator Snowe's Child \nSupport Distribution Act of 2001, which includes the ``Children First'' \ncomponent as well as other provisions to improve child support \ncollections and enforcement. I applaud Senator Snowe for her continued \nleadership on this important issue.\n  The ``Children First'' bill takes significant steps toward ensuring \nthat children receive the child support money they are owed and \ndeserve. In Fiscal Year 1999, the public child support system collected \nchild support payments for only 37 percent of its caseload, up from 23 \npercent in 1998. Obviously, we still need to improve, but States are \nmaking real progress. It's time for Congress to take the next step and \nhelp States overcome a major obstacle to collecting child support for \nfamilies.\n  There are many reasons why non-custodial parents may not be paying \nsupport for their children. Some are not able to pay because they don't \nhave jobs or have fallen on hard times. Others may not pay because they \nare unfairly prevented from spending time with their children.\n  But other fathers don't pay because the public system actually \ndiscourages them from paying. Under current law, over $2 billion in \nchild support is retained every year by the State and Federal \ngovernments as repayment for welfare benefits, rather than delivered to \nthe children to whom it is owed. Since the money doesn't benefit their \nkids, fathers are discouraged from paying support. And mothers have no \nincentive to push for payment since the support doesn't go to them.\n  It's time for Congress to change this system and encourage States to \ndistribute more child support to families. My home State of Wisconsin \nhas already been doing this for several years and is seeing great \nresults. In 1997, I worked with my State to institute an innovative \nprogram of passing through child support payments directly to families. \nA recent evaluation of the Wisconsin program clearly shows that when \nchild support payments are delivered to families, non-custodial parents \nare more apt to pay, and to pay more. In addition, Wisconsin has found \nthat, overall, this policy does not increase government costs. That \nmakes sense because ``passing through'' support payments to families \nmeans they have more of their own resources, and are less apt to depend \non public help to meet other needs such as food, transportation or \nchild care.\n  We now have a key opportunity to encourage all States to follow \nWisconsin's example. This legislation gives States options and strong \nincentives to send more child support directly to families who are \nworking their way off, or are already off, public assistance. Not only \nwill this create the right incentives for non-custodial parents to pay, \nbut it will also simplify the job for States, who currently face an \nadministrative nightmare in following the complicated rules of the \ncurrent system.\n\n  We know that creating the right incentives for non-custodial parents \nto pay support and increasing collections has long-term benefits. \nPeople who can count on child support are more likely to stay in jobs \nand stay off public assistance.\n  This legislation finally brings the Child Support Enforcement program \ninto the post-welfare reform era, shifting its focus from recovering \nwelfare costs to increasing child support to families so they can \nsustain work and maintain self-sufficiency. After all, it's only fair \nthat if we are asking parents to move off welfare and take financial \nresponsibility for their families, then we in Congress must make sure \nthat child support payments actually go to the families to whom they \nare owed and who are working so hard to succeed.\n  Last year, a House version of this bill passed by an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote of 405 to 18, and a similar version has been \nreintroduced this year. My legislation has also been included in \nSenator Snowe's Child Support Distribution Act, and the bipartisan \n``Strengthening Working Families Act, both of which I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor.\n  I was also greatly encouraged by the statements made by Secretary \nThompson at the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related \nAgencies Appropriations hearing on April 25, 2001, in which the \nSecretary spoke about the success of Wisconsin's program and expressed \nhis support for this approach. I am hopeful that the Administration \nwill be able to fully support this legislation, as I believe it is \nconsistent with the President's goal of making sure that families, not \nthe government, keep more of the money they earn and deserve.\n  We must keep this bipartisan momentum going in this Congress. It's \ntime that we finally make child support meaningful for families, and \nmake sure that children get the support they need and deserve.\n\n[[Page S5272]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 916\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom gross income amounts received on account of claims based on \ncertain unlawful discrimination and to allow income averaging for \nbackpay and frontpay awards received on account of such claims, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Civil Rights Tax \nRelief Act of 2001, a bill designed to promote the fair and equitable \nsettlement of civil rights claims. I am very pleased to be joined today \nby Senators Bingaman, Grassley, Daschle, Jeffords, Sarbanes, Harkin, \nCorzine, and Leahy.\n  The primary purpose of this bill is to remedy an unintended \nconsequence of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, which \nmade damage awards not based on ``physical injuries or physical \nsickness'' part of a plaintiff's taxable income. Because most acts of \nemployment discrimination and civil rights violations do not cause \nphysical injuries, this provision has had a direct and negative impact \non plaintiffs who successfully prove that they have been subjected to \nintentional employment discrimination or other intentional violations \nof their civil rights. The problem is compounded by the fact that \nplaintiffs are now taxed on the entirety of their settlements or damage \nawards in civil rights cases, despite the fact that a portion of a \nsettlement or award must be paid to the plaintiff's attorney, who in \nturn is taxed on the same funds! This double taxation of awards of \nattorneys' fees serves to penalize Americans who win their civil rights \ncases.\n  I would like to share one example of how individuals can be harmed by \nthe current taxation scheme, and even discouraged from challenging \nworkplace discrimination. The example was brought to my attention by \nDavid Webbert, an attorney who practices in Maine's capitol, Augusta. \nIn the case, David represented a person who successfully challenged a \nbusiness' policy of discriminating against persons with a particular \ntype of disability. As a result of the case, the discriminatory policy \nwas declared illegal and was ended. Although the plaintiff did not seek \nany monetary damages in the case, the law did provide for payment of \nattorney's fees, which were paid by the defendant's insurance company. \nBecause of the current law's double taxation of attorney's fees, they \nwere taxable to the plaintiff in this case, despite the fact that they \nwere also taxable to the attorney. In short, plaintiffs in civil rights \ncases like this could have to pay taxes despite receiving no monetary \naward. Or, in other words, under current law, a plaintiff can be \npenalized financially for bringing a meritorious case against a \ncompany's discriminatory policies.\n  Our bill would eliminate the unfair taxation of civil rights victims' \nsettlements and court awards; taxation that adds insult to a civil \nrights victim's injuries and serves as a barrier to the just settlement \nof civil rights claims.\n  Our bill would change the taxation of awards received by individuals \nthat result from judgments in or settlements of employment \ndiscrimination cases. First, the bill excludes from gross income \namounts awarded other than for punitive damages and compensation \nattributable to services that were to be performed, known as \n``backpay'', or that would have been performed but for a claimed \nviolation of law by the employer, known as ``frontpay''. Second, award \namounts for frontpay or backpay would be included in income, but would \nbe eligible for income averaging according to the time period covered \nby the award. This correction would allow individuals to pay taxes at \nthe same marginal rates that would have applied to them had they not \nsuffered discrimination. Third, the bill would change the tax code so \nthat people who bring civil rights cases are not taxed on the portion \nof any award paid as fees to their attorney. This provision would \neliminate the double-taxation of such fees, which would still be \ntaxable income to the attorney.\n  The Civil Rights Tax Relief Act would encourage the fair settlement \nof costly and protracted litigation of employment discrimination \nclaims. Our legislation would allow both plaintiffs and defendants to \nsettle claims based on the damages, not on excessive taxes that are now \nlevied.\n  Our bill has been endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights, the American Small Business \nAlliance, AARP, the National Whistleblower Center, the National \nEmployment Lawyers Association, numerous state and local bar \nassociations and sections, including the Maine State Bar Association, \nLabor and Employment Section, and others. This bill is a ``win-win'' \nfor civil rights plaintiffs and defendant businesses. We invite our \ncolleagues to join with us in support of this common sense legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n        Johnson, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Rockfeller, Mr. Breaux, and Mrs. \n        Lincoln):\n  S. 918. A bill to provide more child support money to families \nleaving welfare, to simplify the rules governing the assignment and \ndistribution of child support collected by States on behalf of \nchildren, to improve the collection of child support, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child Support \nDistribution Act. This is companion legislation to Congresswoman Nancy \nJohnson's bill in the House. I want to begin by thanking Senator Kohl \nfor his leadership on child support issues; I am delighted to have been \nable to team up with him again in this important area.\n  I also want to thank Senator Bayh for his leadership on family \nissues. I am pleased that we could work together and incorporate each \nof our ideas in vital legislation which we have already introduced, the \nStrengthening Working Families Act. I am also pleased to have Senators \nGraham, Johnson, Lieberman, Rockfeller, Breaux, Lincoln, Bayh as \noriginal cosponsors on this bill.\n  There is no question that children are the very future of our country \nand I believe fundamentally that every child has the right to grow up \nhealthy, happy, and safe. Throughout my career, promoting children's \nwell-being and keeping our children safe is a mission that has been \nclose to my heart. While we cannot expect the government to ensure that \nevery child receives parental love and attention, we can ensure that \nthe custodial parent, not the government, receives this vital financial \nsupport.\n  Ending poverty and promoting self-sufficiency is an on-going national \ncommitment. Five years ago Congress restored welfare to a temporary \nassistance program, rather than a program that entangles and traps \ngeneration after generation. In September 2000, there were 5.7 million \nopen TANF caseloads for individual recipients, down from 12.2 million, \na 53 percent reduction, in August 1996 when Welfare Reform became law.\n  Unfortunately, while we are succeeding in promoting self-sufficiency \nand self-reliance through welfare reform, we are sending out a double-\nedged message on the need to pay child support. Current law regarding \nthe assignment and distribution of child support for families on \nwelfare is extremely complicated, depending on when families applied \nfor welfare, when the child support was paid, whether that child \nsupport was for current or past-due payments, and depending on\n\n[[Page S5274]]\n\nhow the child support was collected, in other words, through direct \npayments, through garnishing wages or other government assistance \nprograms, or the federal income tax return intercept program.\n  The ``Child Support Distribution Act of 2001'' would provide more \nchild support money to families leaving welfare; would simplify the \nrules governing the assignment and distribution of child support \ncollected by States; would improve the collection of child support; and \nwould authorize demonstration programs encouraging public agencies to \nhelp collect child support; and provide guidelines for involvement of \npublic agencies in child support enforcement.\n  Under current law, when child support is collected for families \nreceiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF, the money is \ndivided between the state and federal governments as payment for the \nwelfare the family has received. The 1996 Welfare Reform Act gave \nstates the option to decide how much, if any, of the state share of \nchild support payments collected on behalf of TANF families to send to \nthe family.\n\n  The 1996 Welfare Reform law also required that in order to qualify \nfor TANF benefits, beneficiaries must ``assign'', or give their child \nsupport rights to the state for periods before and while the family is \non welfare. This means that the State is allowed to keep, and divide \nwith the federal government, child support arrearages that were owed \neven before the family went on TANF if they are collected while the \nfamily is receiving welfare benefits.\n  The original intent of these assignment and distribution strategies \nwas to reimburse the state and federal governments for their outlays to \nthe welfare family. But how much sense does it make to tell a family \nthat is on welfare or trying to get off welfare that the State is \nentitled to the first cut of any child support payment, even if the \nabsent parent begins to pay back the child support that was owed before \nthe family went on welfare?\n  This means that the state gets the support before a parent can buy \nnew shoes for her child, before she can buy her child a new coat for \nthe approaching winter, before she can buy groceries for her family, or \npay the rent for the next month. So in the real world, not just a \npolicy-oriented world, our current law regarding child support payments \nprovides a disincentive for struggling parents to leave welfare, and it \ncertainly provides no incentive for the absent parent to pay, much less \ncatch up with, their child support bills. I wonder how we can \nrealistically expect to foster a positive relationship between a \ncustodial parent, and the parent paying child support, when the State \nis entitled to all of the support money.\n  The key provisions of the bill I am introducing today will allow \nstates to pass through the entire child support collected on their \nbehalf while a person is on welfare; will change how and when child \nsupport is ``owed'' to the states for reimbursement for welfare \nbenefits; and will expand the child support collection provisions such \nas revoking passports for past-due child support.\n  We must ensure both non-custodial and custodial parents that child \nsupport payments are directly benefitting their children. This bill \nwill enable families to keep more of the past-due child support owed to \nthem and it will further the goals of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act by \nhelping families to remain self-sufficient. This bill will give mothers \nleaving welfare an additional $4 billion child support collections over \nthe first five years of full implementation. It will also lead to the \nvoluntary payment by states of about $900 million over five years in \nchild support to families while they are still on welfare.\n  Children are the leaders of tomorrow; they are the very future of our \ngreat nation. We owe them nothing less than the sum of our energies, \nour talents, and our efforts in providing them a foundation on which to \nbuild happy, healthy and productive lives. And, when appropriate, we \nneed to help parents financially support and provide for their \nchildren. Because it simply makes little sense to ask people to be \nself-sufficient, to pay their child-support bills, and then to allow \nthe State to collect all of that child-support.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a serious look at this bill and \npass it this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND:\n  S. 919. A bill to require the Secretary of Energy to study the \nfeasibility of developing commercial nuclear energy production \nfacilities at existing Department of Energy sites; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, one does not need to look much further \nthan their mailbox and the bills they receive for filling the gas tank \nor heating the house to realize that the United States is in need of \ndirection and leadership when it comes to an energy policy. I am \npleased that President Bush and Vice President Cheney have unveiled \ntheir energy plan and I look forward to working with the Administration \non this important issue.\n  The President's National Energy Policy is a long term approach to \naddressing our Nation's energy challenges. The policy is a \ncomprehensive plan to address the needs for additional energy \nproduction and environmental protection. It will promote energy \nefficiency and new technologies to modernize the Nation's energy \ninfrastructure. The President's plan will help increase energy supply \nthrough clean coal technology, nuclear energy, renewable and \nalternative energy, and energy conservation. Now is the appropriate \ntime to address these issues before a major energy crisis jeopardizes \nour economy, national security, and our standard of living.\n  I am especially pleased that the President highlighted production \nsources that have been ignored and shunned in recent years such as \nclean coal and nuclear power as energy sources which must again be \nembraced. This is a long overdue recognition of the valuable and \nimportant roles that nuclear and coal power can and must play in \nmeeting the energy needs of the United States. These two energy sources \nhave clear benefits. However, their increased role in meeting national \nneeds will not be realized without challenge.\n  To be certain, plans to build any new nuclear production plants will \nbe opposed by some quarters. Those who refuse to recognize the \nindispensable role of nuclear power will do everything to delay and \nundermine the construction of new production facilities. Essentially \nthese anti-nuclear obstructionists will seek to create as many \nobstacles as they can. Past examples have witnessed lawsuits and \nintervener tactics that drove plant costs up by hundreds of percent and \ndelayed the facility coming on line by decades.\n  Given such examples, it would certainly not seem that building new \nproduction facilities would be a financially appealing or rewarding \nproposition to a utility company. Yet the truth of the matter is that \nwe desperately need to build new nuclear power production plants. \nPresently, the United States gets approximately 20 percent of its power \nfrom nuclear plants. Even under the most optimistic projections, the \nmajority of the Nation's 103 nuclear power facilities will be coming to \nthe end of their service in the coming years.\n  The question before us is how do we move forward with increasing this \ncritical energy infrastructure but doing so in a more timely and cost-\nefficient manner than what took place in the past. The President's \nNational Energy Policy Report recommends an expansion at existing \nutility power plant sites. I am pleased that the President addressed \nthis issue. As the report states, many existing nuclear power sites \nhave the capacity to include additional reactors. This is an \noutstanding initiative. However, I remain concerned that even with \nthese new reactors at existing sites the total percentage of energy \ncreated by nuclear power will decrease. Such a scenario would only \nexacerbate the energy shortage for years to come. Ultimately, we must \nidentify new sites for the safe expansion of nuclear energy. I believe \nthe solution to this challenge is creating ``energy campuses'' at \nexisting Department of Energy facilities throughout the United States. \nMore specifically, I am proposing co-locating civilian power production \nfacilities on Department of Energy reservations such as: Hanford; the \nNevada Test Site; the\n\n[[Page S5275]]\n\nIdaho National Environmental Engineering Laboratory; and, the Savannah \nRiver Site.\n  Creating such ``energy campuses'' would solve any number of problems \nassociated with building a new civilian production facility. To begin, \nthere is no need to secure new land or to convince the local populace \nthat having a nuclear facility nearby is not a safety issue. Simply \nput, these are pro-nuclear communities that would welcome new \nindustrial investment. Furthermore, it makes for a quicker and less \ncontentious licensing process. Finally, it reduces the amount of new \ninfrastructure required as you would be ``leveraging'' against what \nalready exists at these locations.\n  The benefits of such a plan are multiple, not the least being that it \nwould get nuclear power plants built and on line rapidly. Several are \nin the west, the Nevada Test Site, Idaho National Environmental \nEngineering Laboratory, and Hanford, Washington, and each would be able \nto directly or indirectly provide more power to energy starved \nCalifornia. Furthermore, this plan guarantees long-term energy supply \nreliability while not contributing to greenhouse gases or depleting gas \nreserves.\n  These sites were ideal for locating nuclear projects fifty years ago, \nand they remain so to this day. It makes perfect sense to use these \nexisting assets as a platform upon which to expand our civilian nuclear \npower production capabilities. I am certain that this ``energy campus'' \nplan offers something for everyone, and if the Bush Administration is \ngoing to move forward with relying more heavily on nuclear energy, then \nthis initiative is one way in which to meet the goal of making certain \nthe energy needs of the United States are met.\n  In order to take the first step toward establishing these energy \ncampuses, I am introducing a bill that will direct the Secretary of \nEnergy to undertake a study regarding the feasibility of establishing \ncivilian nuclear power production facilities at existing Department of \nEnergy sites.\n  The economy of the United States is dependent upon reasonably priced \nenergy. It is what is required to power everything from the traditional \nservice of bringing goods to market to running the computers upon which \nengineers make advances in the high technology industry. There is \nnothing that we touch that does not rely on energy, and the less \nexpensive the energy is, the more reasonably priced the goods or \nservices we are purchasing or using will be. Simply put, Americans \nenjoy, expect, and demand reasonably priced energy. If we are going to \ncontinue to provide this resource at an affordable rate, which is a \ngoal we must meet in order to keep our economy the world's strongest \nand most diverse, then we are going to have to look for innovative ways \nin which to supply power. It is time once again to recognize the value \nof nuclear power production and to find ways to bring more of these \nfacilities ``on-line'' as quickly as possible. Establishing energy \ncampuses at Department of Energy reservations will meet these \nobjectives and I am certain that my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this legislation.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na credit against income tax to individuals who rehabilitate historic \nhomes or who are the first purchasers of rehabilitated historic homes \nfor use as a principal residence; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am honored to reintroduce today, along \nwith my colleagues Senators Jeffords, Graham, Chafee, and Levin, the \n``Historic Homeownership Assistance Act of 2001''. This bill will \nprovide the necessary incentive needed to help preserve, revitalize and \nrestore our Nation's older and historic neighborhoods, which often form \nthe core of many of our Nation's most distinct urban areas. During the \n106th Congress, this legislation received bipartisan majority support \nin the House with 226 sponsors and enjoyed the support of 39 sponsors \nin the Senate. In the 107th, the House bill, H.R. 1172, sponsored by \nRep. Clay Shaw, H.R. 1172, is already endorsed by 72 Members to date.\n  This bipartisan proposal would create a historic homeowners tax \ncredit directed toward housing stock in deteriorating neighborhoods and \ncommunities located in more than 11,000 Federal, State and local \nhistoric districts in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. It \nwould allow homebuyers and homeowners to take a 40 percent federal tax \ncredit on residential properties they rehabilitate for use as their \nprimary residence. If enacted, a historic homeowners tax credit would \nbe a useful tool to preserve historic neighborhoods and homes in small \ntowns and urban areas; make homeownership more affordable for less \naffluent families; revitalize deteriorating older neighborhoods; \nstrengthen the tax base for local governments; and combat sprawl and \nurban blight.\n  The number of properties eligible for the historic homeowners credit \nis approximately one third of the almost one million structures in \nhistoric districts nationwide, and 58 percent are located in census \ntracts with a poverty rate of 20 percent or greater. In Louisiana, 91 \npercent of the historic districts in the state overlap with census \ntracts with a rate of poverty of 20 percent or more, a figure much \nhigher than the national average. My home state of Louisiana also has \none of the highest concentrations of historic properties in the Nation. \nIn a recent National Park Service survey, it was found that 109 \nNational Register Historic Districts in the State contain 45,084 \nhistoric buildings. The Louisiana Division of Historic Preservation \nreports that of these 45,000 plus structures, 20 percent are in poor \ncondition, 20 percent are in only fair condition and 60 percent are \nowner-occupied housing. The City of New Orleans alone is reported to \nhave 30,000 vacant housing units, of which 10,000 would qualify for the \nhistoric homeownership tax credit.\n\n  I cannot emphasize enough how much enactment of this incentive would \nmean to my State and the Nation at large. This bill will make ownership \nof a rehabilitated older home more affordable for residents and \nhomebuyers of modest means and incomes while increasing the tax base of \nour most economically distressed urban areas.\n  This legislation also includes unique provisions to assist developers \nand mortgage lenders in saving our most vulnerable historic \nneighborhoods. Under the bill, developers could rehabilitate historic \nproperties, sell them, and pass the credit onto homebuyers. This \nfeature would allow nonprofit housing providers to utilize the credit \nto further the goal of affordable homeownership. In addition, the bill \noffers an option to convert the tax credit to a mortgage credit \ncertificate which could be transferred to a bank or mortgage lender to \nreduce the mortgage interest rate, lowering monthly mortgage payments \nto benefit low- and\n\n[[Page S5276]]\n\nmoderate-income families who do not have enough tax liability to use \nthe credit. In Empowerment Zones, Enterprise Communities, Community \nRenewal areas and distressed census tracts, the credit could also be \nused to lower the cost of the down payment on a historic home.\n  America's priceless heritage is being threatened by urban sprawl as \nresidents abandon the historic districts for the suburbs. The Historic \nHomeownership Assistance Act is an excellent incentive to aid in the \nrestoration of our national, State and local historic districts that \nare currently threatened by abandonment and decay. It would encourage \nlocal residents to invest in their communities and give first time \nhomebuyers an opportunity to move into older neighborhoods. This bill \nwill not only preserve our heritage, but also help local governments by \nputting deteriorated ad abandoned properties back on the tax rolls. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 920\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``William \nHoward Taft National Historic Site Boundary Adjustment Act of 2001.'' \nThis legislation would do three things: First, it would authorize the \nexpansion of the historic grounds of the William Howard Taft's \nchildhood home; second it would allow the Secretary of the Interior, \nthrough the National Park Service, to swap one section of equal-valued \nland for another; and third, it would allow the National Park Service \nto extend the boundary line of the Historic Site.\n  As you may know, I strongly support the preservation of Presidential \nHistoric Sites. Sadly, a number of these Presidential Historic sites \nare becoming run down and are in dire need of our help to secure their \nexistence for future generations. These sites are great educational \ntools for our children. We must ensure their survival. If we don't, we \nwill lose a valuable part of our American history.\n\n[[Page S5278]]\n\n  That is why I introduced the Presidential Sites Improvement Act last \nyear and plan to reintroduce it later this year. This legislation is \ndesigned to provide grant money for the protection and improvement of \nPresidential sites, like the William Howard Taft home in Ohio.\n  President Taft was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1857. He was the son \nof a distinguished judge and former Ohio Attorney General. Taft \ngraduated from Yale, and then returned to Cincinnati to study and \npractice law. As my colleagues know, Taft went on to become our 27th \nU.S. President. He is the only President in U.S. history who went on to \nbecome the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. In describing his \nillustrious career as a public servant, Taft once wrote that he always \nhad his ``plate the right side up when offices were falling.''\n  With the bill I am introducing today, we can make a lasting \ncommitment to future generations by preserving the memory and \ncontributions of our nation's former leaders. Our children and \ngrandchildren should have the opportunity to understand the richness of \nour country's history.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last year's Loan Deficiency Payments, \nLDPs, were made available to producers for crops grown on farms not \ncovered by Production Flexibility Contract, PFC, under the 1996 farm \nbill. In Iowa there are 6200 farms that do not participate in the farm \nprogram. Non-participating farms are classified as farms not enrolled \nin 1996 at the beginning of the program, or farms that changed hands \nduring the farm bill that were not properly re-enrolled.\n  The Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000, which we passed into \nlaw last year, furnished LDP's to farmers who produced a 2000 crop \ncontract commodity on a farm not covered by a PFC. Senator Nelson and I \nare offering legislation to extend this one-year opportunity for \nproducers. Our legislation provides an extension of this opportunity \nthat will run for the remainder of the 1996 farm bill.\n  Not all of the 6200 non-participating farms will choose to use and \nbenefit from an LDP, but for the family farmers in Iowa who are not in \nthe program, guaranteeing close to $1.78 on corn and $5.26 on soybeans \nis significant assistance.\n  With the record low prices Iowa producers have experienced recently, \nI think that the Federal Government should do everything it can to keep \nproducers on the farm. This by no means solves all their problems, but \nit helps and it's something we should have done for these individuals \non a permanent basis when we provided a one-year opportunity for \nparticipation in the LDP program last year. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 923\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 91\n\n       Whereas on September 6, 2000, a paramilitary mob in the \n     West Timor town of Atambua killed 3 United Nations aid \n     workers, including United States citizen Carlos Caceres;\n       Whereas Caceres and the other victims were stabbed and \n     hacked to death with exceptional brutality, and their bodies \n     were then set on fire and dragged through the streets;\n       Whereas Caceres, an attorney originally from San Juan, \n     Puerto Rico, whose family now resides in the State of \n     Florida, had e-mailed a plea for help saying that ``the \n     militias are on their way'', and that ``we sit here like \n     bait'';\n       Whereas on May 4, 2001, an Indonesian court in Jakarta \n     meted out only token sentences to the murderers of Carlos \n     Caceres and the other United Nations workers, and failed to \n     allot any punishment whatsoever to the Indonesian military \n     commanders alleged to have sanctioned this attack;\n       Whereas these token sentences have been condemned as \n     ``wholly unacceptable'' by United Nations Secretary General \n     Kofi Annan, and described by the Department of State as acts \n     that ``call into question Indonesia's commitment to the \n     principle of accountability'';\n       Whereas the self-confessed killer of Carlos Caceres, a pro-\n     government militia member named Julius Naisama, was sentenced \n     to spend not more than 20 months in jail, and remarked \n     afterwards, ``I accept the sentence with pride'';\n       Whereas the murders of Carlos Caceres and the other United \n     Nations workers fit a pattern of killings perpetrated or \n     sanctioned by the Indonesian military in Aceh, Irian Jaya, \n     and other parts of the Indonesia, both during and since the \n     end of the Suharto regime;\n       Whereas, despite Indonesian government promises of judicial \n     accountability, since the initiation of democratic rule in \n     Indonesia in 1998, no senior military official has been put \n     on trial for human rights abuses, extrajudicial killings, \n     torture, or incitement to mob violence; and\n       Whereas the Government of Indonesia could have prevented \n     both the murder of the United Nations workers and the \n     subsequent miscarriage of justice if the Government had--\n       (1) upheld its explicit commitment, made after the August, \n     1999 referendum in East Timor, to ensure that Indonesian \n     military forces would safeguard United Nations workers and \n     Timorese refugees from attacks by the paramilitary militias \n     who had killed approximately 1,000 East Timorese civilians in \n     the preceding weeks;\n       (2) brought charges of murder or manslaughter against the 6 \n     men who proudly admitted to killing the United Nations \n     workers in an unprovoked attack, rather than only the lesser \n     charge of conspiring to foment violence; and\n       (3) brought charges against senior military commanders who, \n     according to the United Nations, the Department of State, and \n     the Government of Indonesia itself, are suspected of arming \n     and directing the paramilitary militias responsible for the \n     carnage in East Timor: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That (a) the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the brutal murder of Carlos Caceres, a United \n     States citizen;\n       (2) decries the inadequate sentences given by the \n     Indonesian judicial system to the self-confessed killers of \n     the 3 United Nations aid workers;\n       (3) calls on the Government of Indonesia to indict and \n     bring to trial the senior military commanders described in a \n     September 1, 2000, statement by the Government of Indonesia \n     itself, as suspects in the mass killings following the \n     August, 1999 East Timor referendum; and\n       (4) offers condolences to the family, friends, and \n     colleagues of Carlos Caceres and the other victims of the \n     September 6, 2000, attack.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President should, at every appropriate meeting with \n     officials of the Government of Indonesia, stress the \n     importance of ending the climate of impunity which shields \n     those individuals, especially senior members of the \n     Indonesian military, suspected of perpetrating, collaborating \n     in, or covering up extra judicial killings, torture, and \n     other abuses of human rights; and\n       (2) the President should consider the willingness of the \n     Government of Indonesia to make rapid and substantive \n     progress in judicial reform when determining the level of \n     financial support provided by the United States to Indonesia, \n     whether directly or through international financial \n     institutions.\n       Sec. 2.

DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AND \n                   EMPLOYEES WEEK.\n\n       That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning June 3, 2001, as \n     ``National Correctional Officers and Employees Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe the \n     week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution to \nhonor correctional officers and employees. This resolution reaffirms \nour support for the thousands of correctional officers and employees \nwho work in the face of danger each day, while reforming hardened \ncriminals. They deserve our respect and support.\n  Nationally more than 200,000 corrections professionals work hard to \nmaintain the safety of our communities. We must never forget that this \nis an often stressful and dangerous occupation. Nor can we forget the \nsacrifices made by those courageous individuals who have been injured \nor killed in the line of duty. Officers put their lives on the line \nevery time they begin a shift.\n  Tragically, correctional officers have been permanently injured and \nkilled in the line of duty. There have been over 356 men and women who \nhave died while on duty. This year, we honor Wilmot A. Burnett, Lee \nDunn, Raymond Curtis, Michael Price, Allen Gamble, Peter Hillman, Jason \nActon, Leon Egly, William Giacomo, Alvin Glenn, and Allen Myers, who \nhave all been killed during the past year.\n  Most of us leave for work knowing that we will return home safe and \nsound at the end of the day. While we take this peace of mind for \ngranted, correctional officers are not afforded this luxury.\n  On June 6, 2000, Sergeant Allen Gamble, a correctional officer at \nOklahoma State Reformatory was fatally stabbed in the throat as he \nattempted to help a fellow officer who was being attacked by a \nprisoner. Sergeant Gamble was survived by his wife, Sherri and his four \nchildren. Equally disturbing is the case of Officer Jason Coryell, a \ncorrectional officer at the Arizona State Prison Complex. On August 25, \n200, Officer Jason Croyell was stabbed three times in the stomach when \nan inmate refused to be handcuffed. Though the wound was severe, \nOfficer Coryell returned to work in November, 2000.\n  Officers Gamble and Coryell exemplify the heroism that takes place \neach day in our nation's correctional facilities. They remind us how \nindividual acts of heroism are a regular part of the job among \ncorrectional officers and employees.\n  In addition to dealing with society's most hardened criminals, \ncorrectional officers and employees also seek to reform offenders. They \nplay an important role in lowering recidivism rates. And through \nliteracy programs and vocational training they help transform criminals \ninto productive, law abiding members of society. This is not an easy \ntask.\n  Correctional officers and their families and friends endure a \ntremendous amount of stress and sacrifice. Prison security never takes \na break, which often means that officers work all hours of the day and \nnight, weekends, and holidays. I hope with this resolution we can honor \nand recognize this sort of commitment and sacrifice, not just this \nweek, but throughout the year.\n  America's correctional officers and employees efforts to make our \nworld a better, safer place too often go unnoticed. Few of us can truly \nappreciate the perils faced daily by our correctional officers. With \nthis resolution we reflect on the contributions correctional officers \nhave made to keep our communities safe. This is why I am pleased to \nsubmit this resolution to establish June 3-10, 2001, as Correctional \nOfficers and Employees Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/21/senate-section/article/S5279-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5279-S5280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 689.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE MODIFICATIONS TO THE \n                   CHILD TAX CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) There are over 12,000,000 children in poverty in the \n     United States--about 78 percent of these children live in \n     working families.\n       (2) The child tax credit was originally designed to benefit \n     families with children in recognition of the costs associated \n     with raising children.\n       (3) There are 15,400,000 children whose families would not \n     benefit from the doubling of the child tax credit unless it \n     is made refundable and another 7,000,000 children live in \n     families who will not receive an increased benefit under the \n     bill unless the credit is made refundable.\n       (4) A person who earns the Federal minimum wage and works \n     40 hours a week for 50 weeks a year earns approximately \n     $10,300.\n       (5) The provision included in section 201 would give \n     families with children the benefit of a partially refundable \n     child tax credit based on 15 cents of their income for every \n     dollar earned above $10,000.\n       (6) For a family earning $15,000 that is an additional $750 \n     to help make ends meet.\n       (7) Doubling the child tax credit to $1,000 and making it \n     partially refundable will benefit over 37,000,000 families \n     with dependent children.\n       (8) The expansion of the child tax credit included in \n     section 201 is a meaningful and a responsible effort on the \n     part of the Senate to address the needs of low income working \n     families to promote work and such an expansion would provide \n     the benefit of a child tax credit to 10,700,000 more children \n     than the provision passed by the House of Representatives.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the ``10-15'' child tax credit provision included in \n     section 201 is a worthy start, and should be maintained as \n     part of the final package.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 742.
