Mr. President, I am delighted that our opening prayer \nthis morning was so eloquently delivered by my good friend, Father \nJames L. Nadeau, the rector of the Cathedral of the Immaculate \nConception in Portland, ME, and a native of my hometown of Caribou, ME.\n  Father Jim is an inspiring testament to the power of faith and \neducation. My family takes special pride in Father Jim because of our \nclose connections growing up in Northern Maine. Both our families \nattended the same church in Caribou, Holy Rosary, where my mother was \nthe director of religious education. Father Jim and his brother have \nboth become priests. So we take special pride.\n  Father Jim has a truly inspiring story. He was the first member of \nhis family to graduate from college, and he credits this accomplishment \nto the academic preparation and support he received from the Upward \nBound program at Bowdoin College.\n  I wish to quote from Father Jim's own words, which describe his \nfamily background:\n\n       Growing up in a rural Franco-American background, I was \n     expected to follow my ancestors who for over 250 years were \n     farmers and woodsmen. . . . I recall my parents not even \n     wanting me to think about college. They could not afford it; \n     plus, no one had gone to college in my family. In fact, my \n     mother and father only studied to 8th grade. My mother, the \n     oldest girl of 15 children, had to stay home and take care of \n     her brothers and sisters. My father, when just a teenager, \n     began working on the farms and at a french fry processing \n     plant.\n\n  For young Jim Nadeau, everything changed in his life when he first \nmet the director of the Bowdoin College Upward Bound program in 1977. \nShe encouraged him to go to college, and, indeed, after graduating from \nCaribou High School as valedictorian, he enrolled at Dartmouth College \nin the fall of 1979. With Pell grants and other financial aid making \nhis education possible, he excelled in his studies.\n  After graduating from college, Father Jim studied at Gregorian \nUniversity in Rome for 5 years where he received two graduate degrees \nin theology. Father Jim also worked with Mother Teresa of Calcutta in \nher Roman missions and was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1988. \nFather says that he truly can credit the Upward Bound program with \nchanging his life.\n  We are, indeed, fortunate that the power of God and education \ntransformed the life of young Jim Nadeau. He is an inspiration to us \nall and continues his important work today as rector of the Cathedral \nof the Immaculate Conception in Portland, ME. There he has guided many \nfinancially disadvantaged students and encouraged them to go to \ncollege.\n  I am delighted to have him with us today. It is a great honor and \nprivilege\n\n[[Page S2682]]\n\nto have this outstanding priest join us and offer to us his inspiring \nopening prayer.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield for a minute, I had the pleasure \nof briefly meeting Father Jim Nadeau this morning downstairs. I welcome \nhim to the Senate. I thank him for his beautiful prayer this morning. \nIt is good to have a New Englander opening the Senate with us this \nmorning.\n  I thank our distinguished colleague from Maine for extending the \ninvitation and sharing with us an inspiring story about Father Nadeau's \nfamily and his contributions to the State of Maine and this country. We \nthank him immensely for all the wonderful work he has done. I thank my \ncolleague from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his kind words.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I associate myself with the \nobservations of the Senator from Connecticut and congratulate the \nSenator from Maine for bringing this outstanding citizen of her State \nhere this morning to open the Senate with a prayer. I wish him well in \nhis endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/22/senate-section/article/S2682-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of the Hatch amendment No. 136 on \nwhich there shall be 30 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual \nform.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I hope we will not take the whole 30 \nminutes. I understand some of our colleagues need to make some special \nappointments. I will try to be brief.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will support this modest, straightforward \namendment. We are here this week and next, debating so-called campaign \nfinance reform. I do not understand how anyone can purport to favor any \nreform of our current system without being willing to offer the most \nbasic right of fairness to the hard-working men and women of this \ncountry.\n  Let's be clear about what we are talking about. We are talking about \nletting workers who pay dues and fees to labor organizations be \ninformed about what portions of the money they pay to unions are being \nspent on political activities. In my view, that is basic fairness.\n  Is there some big secret here? Is there some reason workers should \nnot be told how their money is being spent?\n  The hypocrisy of the opposition is quite extraordinary. The \nunderlying bill severely limits the ability of political parties to \nengage in the types of activities that this amendment simply asks \nunions to inform their members about. How can someone on the one hand \nargue for a restriction on these activities by parties and then secure \na free pass and not even disclose the same information by others? This \nis simply remarkable.\n  Then we hear the argument that this simple disclosure requirement is \ntoo burdensome. Give me a break. During these weeks in March and April \nwhen hard-working Americans are hovering over their tax forms, how can \nanyone call this straight-forward disclosure requirement on the unions \ntoo onerous? What is going on?\n  Labor organizations collect dues and fees from American workers. Can \nanyone tell me they are not already keeping track of this money? If \nthis disclosure amendment is too onerous, that suggests to me there \nmight be an even bigger issue of accountability on how and where this \nmoney is being spent.\n\n  I trust my colleagues will remember these arguments about ``onerous \nburdens'' when we are trying to do regulatory reform.\n  The issue in this simple amendment is, do America's hard-working men \nand women have the right to know whether and how the dues and fees they \npay are being used for political activities, or don't they? It is that \nsimple. This ought to be the most basic of worker rights and \nprotections.\n  I hope my colleagues cast their votes in favor of the right of \nAmerican workers to know how their money is being spent.\n  Finally, let me emphasize, this amendment does not require the \nconsent of employees. It simply requires disclosure. That is all, pure \nand simple, disclosure to the hard-working teachers, janitors, \nelectricians, carpenters, and others on what the union leadership is \nactually spending these workers' hard earned money. It doesn't seem to \nme to be much of a burden or requirement. It seems to me if we are \ninterested in having true campaign finance reform, this is one of the \nbasic reforms.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nproceed for about 3 minutes. If the Chair will advise me when 3 minutes \nexpires.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I inquire how much time remains on this side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Eleven and a half minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate appropriately rejected \nthe original amendment requiring corporations and labor organizations \nto get prior consent from shareholders and their members in order to \nuse their general treasury funds for political activities. That \nproposal was appropriately rejected rather overwhelmingly--69-31--in \nthis body for reasons explained in a bipartisan fashion.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles, and Senator Kennedy pointed \nout this was a cumbersome, almost unworkable proposal that would have \nliterally placed businesses and unions in a very precarious position. \nWe made the suggestion if the amendment was going to be seriously \nconsidered by this body, of which corporations and business would have \nvehemently opposed, it would have required them to engage and perform \ncertain functions and duties that never before had been required of \nthem.\n  There is no parity for a democratic organization such as a labor \nunion, where Federal laws require the opening of books, the revealing \nof financial data information, the free election and secret balloting \nof officers, and a corporation where none of those union requirements \npertain to a corporation management structure.\n  The same could be said in many ways about this amendment. While this \namendment is simpler than the original amendment, the failure or the \nproblems with this one are not much different. This is a tremendously \ncumbersome mandate that will make it very difficult for some of these \nbusinesses and corporations to comply. There are different levels of \nactivities as well.\n  According to the Federal Election Commission, in the area of \ncontributions since 1992, as a general matter, corporations have \noutspent labor unions in Federal elections by almost 16-1. So there has \nbeen a huge disparity in the amount of money contributed to candidates.\n\n  On the other hand, we have labor unions and labor organizations, and\n\n[[Page S2683]]\n\ntheir members engage in grassroots political activities, and \ncorporations historically do not.\n  This amendment is not a balanced in its approach to corporations and \nlabor organizations. All of a sudden, this amendment attempts to \npenalize organizations that are trying to get people to participate in \nthe political life of the country. It says to them, we are going to \nstart demanding this kind of minutia and disclosure of information. As \na matter of fact, there is no parity in asking corporations to do the \nsame kind of disclosure when they don't engage in the activities that \nrequire the disclosure at issue. This amendment is truly not a balanced \nrequest or approach.\n  Second, there are many other types of organizations that engage in \npolitical activities. While the Federal campaign law governs these \norganizations to a certain extent, this amendment completely excludes \nthem. Membership Organizations, such as the National Rifle Association, \nthe National Right to Life organizations, Sierra Clubs, and other \ngroups are also subject to certain provisions of the FECA. This \namendment does not address those organizations nor require them to \ndisclose any detailed information regarding disbursements, \ncontributions or expenditures with respect to their political \nactivities.\n  This amendment is impermissible ``selective application.'' It would \nonly apply to one group of people, those involved in organized labor in \nthe country.\n  I understand my friend from Utah doesn't like organized labor. He \ndoesn't like labor unions or labor organizations. He disagrees. These \nare people who take positions on the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nprescription drug benefits, and minimum wage, and a whole host of \nissues involving child care. I have a long list of items that working \nfamilies, through their leadership, support. My good friend from Utah \nhas usually disagreed with them on these matters. However, you don't go \nout and discriminate against one organization that is engaged in \nencouraging people to participate in the political life of the country \nby attaching a set of obligations and burdens on them that has the \neffect of discouraging political participation. We ought to be \nencouraging more participation.\n  Finally, this amendment should be primarily opposed because it serves \nas a ``poison pill'' for the entire McCain-Feingold campaign finance \nreform legislation.\n  For those reasons and others my colleagues will identify, we strongly \noppose this amendment. This destroys the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  I see my colleague from Wisconsin. I yield to him 3 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote against the Hatch amendment \nand I urge all supporters of the McCain-Feingold bill to do the same. \nOnce again, the effort of the Senator from Utah to treat unions and \ncorporations equally sounds good but just doesn't work.\n  There is no doubt that increased disclosure of election spending is a \nlaudable goal. The Buckley decision explicitly upheld the disclosure \nprovisions in the Federal Election Campaign Act. Disclosure is aimed at \nincreasing the information available to the voter. That is a good \nthing. No one questions the benefits of disclosure.\n  But disclosure requirements have to be clear and well drafted. They \nhave to actually work. They can't be too burdensome or they will chill \nconstitutionally protected speech. And they can't be one-sided, aimed \nat one player in the election system and not at others.\n  I am sorry to say that the provision offered by Senator Hatch fails \nall of these tests. First of all, his provision only applies to unions \nand those corporations that have shareholders. It doesn't cover \nbusinesses that don't have shareholders. It doesn't cover membership \norganizations such as the NRA, the Sierra Club, National Right to Life, \nor NARAL. Why should unions have to report to their members how much \nthey are spending on get-out-the-vote drives, while all of these \nadvocacy groups do not?\n  The disclosure requirements are also incredibly burdensome and \nconfusing. A union is required to send a report to all of its members, \nand nonmember employees every year on the spending not only of the \nunion itself but all international, national, State, and local \naffiliates. And this is not a one-way chain either. Nationals have to \nreport everything that locals do, and locals have to report everything \nthat nationals do. A corporation has to report on the activities of all \nof its subsidiaries.\n\n  Now remember, this amendment is not a requirement that these entities \nfile a report once a year to the FEC. No, the reports have to be sent \nto every union member or corporate shareholder. A corporate PAC has to \nsend a report every year to all of the shareholders of the corporation \nthat is connected to the PAC. The content of the report is mostly going \nto be what the PAC has always reported to the FEC. What is the point of \nthat?\n  Now as to what has to be reported, the amendment is vague, almost \nunintelligible. Direct activities such as contributions to candidates \nand political parties have to be reported. I understand what \ncontributions are, but what else does the term ``direct activities'' \ncontemplate? The amendment is silent on that. In the definition of \n``political activities,'' which is what the general disclosure \nrequirement covers, the amendment includes the following language--\n``disbursements for television or radio broadcast time, print \nadvertising, or polling for political activities.'' That is a circular \ndefinition. What broadcast expenditures have to be reported?\n  Certainly not commercials for products, but the amendment gives us no \nreal guidance. Public communications that refer to and expressly \nadvocate for or against candidates are covered, but corporations and \nunions are prohibited from making those kinds of communications, and \nPACs already disclose their spending to the FEC.\n  Finally, Mr. President, no matter how hard the Senator from Utah has \ntried to make this amendment seem evenhanded, there can be no doubt \nthat the real purpose of this amendment is to try to get information \nfrom unions about their political spending. There is nothing inherently \nwrong with that, but any such disclosure requirements just have to be \nevenhanded. These are not, so I must oppose the amendment and ask my \ncolleagues who support reform to join me in voting to table it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, every public company with shareholders is \nmandated to send financial disclosures to every shareholder--every \npublic company. This is not a burden, it is done so they know how their \nmoney is spent.\n  Labor union financial disclosures--you would think they were already \ngiving disclosures to their members, but they are not at all. The labor \nunion financial disclosures only go to the Department of Labor and not \nto a single union member. And for union men to get those disclosures, \nthey have to show cause. That is how bad it is, and that is how one \nsided it is.\n  I have heard these arguments that the Hatch amendment does not go far \nenough.\n  Some are trying to avoid disclosure of corporate and union political \nexpenditures to shareholders and union members on the grounds that the \nHatch amendment doesn't make ideological groups, such as NRA, Sierra \nClub, and other nonprofit advocacy groups disclose their donors or \nexpenditures.\n  In response to that, I first note that it is a clever ruse to try and \nchange the argument from disclosing expenditures to disclosing donors.\n  As a constitutional matter, disclosure of expenditures is \nfundamentally different than disclosure of donors, supporters, or \nmembers. Disclosure of expenditures implicates no one's freedom of \nassociation. Senator Hatch understands that and this is why he limited \nhis amendment to disclosure of expenditures only.\n  Moreover, the Hatch amendment limits disclosure of expenditures to \nonly corporations and unions, and makes sure that such disclosure only \ngoes to union members and shareholders, not the general public.\n  He does not apply disclosure of political expenditures to ideological \ngroups such as the Sierra Club or the NRA because people who join or \ncontribute to those groups know what those groups advocate. This is not \nalways so with corporations and unions.\n  Moreover, Federal law mandates certain democratic procedures for the \ngovernance of public companies under the\n\n[[Page S2684]]\n\nSecurities and Exchange Act and the labor laws. Federal law does not \nmandate the internal governance of ideological groups. Under securities \nlaw and labor law Congress has set up a regime that imposed fiduciary \nduties on union and corporate leaders to members and shareholders and \nthe Hatch amendment helps ensure those duties are fulfilled by shedding \nlight on an area of corporate and union activity that supporters of \nMcCain-Feingold are intent on keeping in the dark.\n  Thus, my amendment is merely seeking to improve the flow of \ninformation in federally regulated entities that Congress has already \ndecided should function as democratic institutions. And we all know \nthat transparency is good for any democracy. But supporters of McCain-\nFeingold are strangely opposed to more transparency and improved \ndemocracy in labor unions--that I think flies in the face of the rights \nof workers.\n  The argument that the requirements of my disclosure amendment are too \nvague--this is my favorite argument. Supporters of McCain-Feingold say \nthat the descriptions in the Hatch amendment of activity that must be \ndisclosed are too vague and thus unfair.\n  The Hatch amendment requires corporations and unions to disclose \nexpenditures for ``political activity'' which is defined as:\n  Voter registration;\n  Voter identification or get-out-the-vote activity;\n  A public communication that refers to a clearly identified candidate \nfor Federal office that expressly advocates support for or opposition \nto a candidate for Federal office; and\n  Disbursements for TV, radio, print ads, or polling for any of the \nabove.\n  Now that doesn't seem that unclear to me, but it is too vague for \nsupporters of McCain-Feingold. I find that fascinating.\n  It is fascinating because when I read McCain-Feingold, which they \nthink is perfectly fine, I see that it requires State and local party \ncommittees to not only report, but to pay for entirely with hard money, \nthe following in even numbered years: ``generic campaign activity'' \nwhich is defined as ``an activity that promotes a political party and \ndoes not promote a candidate or non-federal candidate.\n  Although it is far from clear to me, it must be perfectly clear to \nsupporters of McCain-Feingold what constitutes ``an activity that \npromotes a political party'' since they are not complaining about \nvagueness in the underlying bill.\n  Under S. 27, State parties must report and use hard money for\n\n       A public communication that refers to a clearly identified \n     candidate for federal office . . . that promotes or supports \n     a candidate for that office, or attacks or opposes a \n     candidate for that office.\n\n  Again, I find it interesting that no one is complaining about how \nvague this provision is. It does not say how to figure out when an ad \n``promotes or supports'' or attacks or opposes'' a candidate. McCain-\nFeingold doesn't even say who is supposed to figure that out. But this \nis just fine. Only the Hatch amendment is too vague.\n  I think it is pretty clear what is going on here.\n  Let's be clear about what my amendment does. It requires unions and \ncorporation to disclose their political expenditures. It does not \nrequire the disclosure of any contributors or the name of a single \nunion member or shareholder. By focusing solely on disclosure of \nexpenditures, the Hatch amendment avoids the constitutional infirmities \nof Snowe-Jeffords and other legislation that requires disclosure of \ndonors to advocacy groups. Merely disclosing an organization's \npolitical expenditures implicates no one's free association rights.\n  Moreover, this amendment is narrowly tailored insofar as it requires \ndisclosure of union political expenditures only to union members and \nfee payers and disclosure of corporate political expenditures only to \ncorporate shareholders. So it is not even disclosure of expenditures to \nthe general public.\n  It simply ensures that shareholders and union members will have \nclear, understandable information about how their agents--union \nofficials and corporate executives--are using the money they entrust to \nthem.\n  Under existing law, neither shareholders nor union members get such \ninformation. Why should they not have it, it is their money. Why can't \nthey see how it is being spent.\n  Let's examine the arguments being used by proponents of McCain-\nFeingold against this amendment:\n  First, it is not fair because only unions engage in the types of \npolitical activity covered: Many have said only unions and no \ncorporations do GOTV activity, voter identification, voter \nregistration, leafletting, phone bank, volunteer recruitment and \ntraining, and myriad of other party building activities that would have \nto be disclosed under this legislation. Thus, they say the amendment is \nnot balanced.\n  They are right that no corporation does these basic party building \nactivities the way unions do them for Democrats.\n  Corporations give PAC contributions, which are already subject to \nlimits and fully disclosed under existing law. They also give soft \nmoney contributions to political parties that are fully disclosed under \nexisting law and will be eliminated under McCain-Feingold. Corporations \nalso run some issues ads around election time, that will be banned for \n60 days before a general election or 30 days before a primary, as will \nunion issue ads.\n  So McCain-Feingold already pretty well takes care of what \ncorporations do, but does not touch the key things that unions do for \nDemocrats--the groundgame. On our side, no corporations do or ever will \ndo the kind of GOTV, and other groundgame activities unions do for \nDemocrats.\n  But all Democrats support banning party soft money, which is the only \nresource Republicans have to counter the massive groundgame unions do \nfor Democrats. Without soft money, the Democrats ground game will go on \nthanks to their unions allies, but the Republican counter to the unions \ngroundgame is eviscerated.\n  This amendment wouldn't stop or otherwise hinder the unions ground \ngame, it would just bring it out into the light of day and disclose to \nunion members who pay for it. But no, we can't do that, it's not fair \nto attach that to McCain-Feingold. That would not be fair and balanced. \nBut disarming the GOP in the face of the union groundgame is fair to \nsupporters of McCain-Feingold?\n  Second, disclosure under this amendment would discourage \nparticipation through GOTV activity and voter registration and other \nactivities these entities do. This argument only makes sense if we \nassume that when union members or corporate shareholders learn about \nthe political activities unions and corporations engage in that they \nwill be outraged and rise up using the mechanisms of corporate and \nunion democracy to oust the union and corporate officials using their \nmoney for GOTV and other political activities.\n  To this I can only say that if union members and corporate \nshareholders would react in this way, so what. They have a right to \npass judgment on how their money is spent and if they disagree to \nensure that it is used for purposes with which they agree. Why keep \nthem in the dark about how much of their money is used for various \nkinds of political activity? If unions are the happy, democratic \ninstitutions Democrats claim, what do union leaders have to fear from \nsunlight?\n  The only other argument for saying that disclosure of expenditures \nwould diminish such activity is that it is overly burdensome.\n  This argument has little merit. We just passed a law last year that \nrequires even the puniest section 527 organization to disclose any \n``expenditure'' for any purpose in excess of $200. No one claimed it \nwas too great a burden for them. These groups are managing and they do \nnot have nearly the resources of the AFL-CIO, Teamsters, NEA, and other \nunions.\n  Unions and corporation would just do what section 527 groups already \ndo, and what political parties already do--hire an extra accountant and \nmaybe a lawyer. That is not too much when you are the Teamsters and you \ntake in over $300,000,000 a year.\n  If opponents of this amendment were truly concerned about voter \nturnout, voter education, and voter participation, they would rail \nagainst the fact that McCain-Feingold requires the national as well as \nState and local political parties to use 100 percent hard\n\n[[Page S2685]]\n\nmoney, thereby eliminating most of the resources available to our \nparties for their GOTV, voter identification, voter registration, and \nother activities that increase participation and turnout.\n  How is mere disclosure of union and corporate political activity more \ndamaging to voter participation and education than elimination of over \none-third of the resources our parties have to do this?\n  Maybe gutting the parties isn't so bad because Democrats know that \nunions will carry the water for them on all of these groundgame \nactivities while McCain-Feingold will ensure that the Republican Party \ncannot match the unions' effort.\n  This is a one-sided bill that basically is not fair, and it is \ncertainly not fair to union men and women. These workers deserve to \nknow for just what their union dues are being spent. All we are asking \nfor is disclosure, something in this computer age they can do with ease \nif they want to, something in this computer age they ought to do \nbecause it is essential, something in this computer age they must do \nbecause it is not fair not to. To try to cloud the issue by saying we \nshould disclose the donors--that is not the issue. The issue is \nexpenditures, expenditures, expenditures; and the issue, the real \nissue, if we really want to do something about campaign finance reform, \nis disclosure, disclosure, disclosure. That is all I am asking for.\n  I reserve the remainder of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am about to yield to my colleague from \nMichigan. We on this side, the opponents, have been talking about labor \nunions. I want to make a point as I read this amendment. People buy and \nsell stock with some regularity. You can buy one share of stock, as I \nread this amendment, for one day and technically be defined as a \nshareholder of a corporation, even if you held the stock for only 15 \nminutes. As this amendment is crafted, if there was then an internal \ncommunication by that corporation during that year of some political \nmessage, despite the fact that I may have held one stock for 15 minutes \nas a shareholder, that corporation is then required to send me all this \ndisclosure information about that corporation's political activity.\n  That is incredible to me. It doesn't distinguish how long you are a \nshareholder, so a shareholder for 15 minutes, who bought and held the \nstock for 15 minutes and then sold the stock again, would be required \nto get this information.\n  We talk about the negative effect on organized labor. If you are a \ncorporate shareholder and this amendment is adopted, you ought to \nshudder, in terms of the amount of information you will be getting.\n  But let me yield 3 minutes to my colleague from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment is indeed onerous, \ncumbersome, and confusing. It not only chills first amendment \nassociation rights, it makes a mockery of those rights.\n  I want to use a few of the words from the amendment, words that were \nleft out by my good friend from Utah who, by the way, is celebrating \nhis birthday today. I think we all want to congratulate him. I heard it \non the radio today. Senator Hatch, I won't disclose the age--except to \nsay it is a few months older than I--and I would like to wish happy \nbirthday to our good friend from Utah.\n  Let me take one example of the confusing words in this amendment \nwhich make it impossible, it seems to me, to be implemented: An \nexpenditure which directly or indirectly--directly or indirectly--is \nmade for an internal communication that relates to a political cause.\n  I cannot imagine how any corporation or union could conceivably keep \ntrack of the direct or indirect expenditure that relates to an internal \ncommunication that relates to a political cause. ``Political cause'' is \nnot defined, by the way. We have the words ``political activity'' \ndefined in ways which, for the most part, only apply to unions and not \nto corporations. But that is a different problem. That is the problem \nof the paper parity--an amendment which appears to apply to \ncorporations. If it did, it would be totally impossible for a \ncorporation to comply with, as our good friend from Connecticut just \nsaid. But it is really aimed at labor unions because the activities \nwhich are identified are mainly the political activities in which \nunions engage.\n\n  But the point is, these words are so extraordinarily vague. Imagine a \nunion at every level trying to keep track of the indirect costs of an \ninternal communication that relates to a political cause--whatever all \nof that means. This is a burdensome and onerous requirement. I think it \nis confusing, and it is cumbersome.\n  Again, it is devastating to a right which all of us--Democrats and \nRepublicans--ought to protect, which is the right of free association.\n  I close by reminding our colleagues that this applies to members of \nlabor unions who join that union, and not to nonmembers. This is \nintended to control the rights of voluntary association and its \nmembers. This is an intrusion, and a heavy interference in the rights \nof association. It places impossible burdens on an association to keep \ntrack of every single expenditure and every internal communication that \ncould indirectly--I am using the words of the amendment--relate to a \npolitical cause.\n  None of those words are defined.\n  It is an onerous interference with the first amendment right of \nassociation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Five minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Utah for \noffering this amendment. This does not have anything to do with how the \nunions raise their money. We already voted down yesterday the \nopportunity for union members to get a refund of union dues spent on \ncauses with which they don't agree.\n  So the AFL-CIO is essentially batting 1,000 so far.\n  All this is about is simple disclosure.\n  I remember last year when the section 527 bill came up. We did not \nhear anybody saying that it was a poison pill or that it was too \nburdensome. Why is all of a sudden a simple disclosure burdensome, as \nSenator Hatch pointed out. For a union member to find out how the money \nof his or her union is spent, he has to go over to the Department of \nLabor and establish just cause to be permitted to see how the funds \nhave been spent.\n  Every corporation in America does more disclosure than that. They \nsend out annual reports to shareholders. No union does that.\n  This is about as mild as it gets. All we are asking is for a simple \ndisclosure to the public and to union members of how this money is \nspent.\n  It doesn't restrict their spending of the money. It doesn't in any \nway hamper their ability to raise the money. Simple disclosure is all \nthe Hatch amendment is about, disclosure and sunlight.\n  What is there to hide? After all, this money comes from union \nmembers. Why are they not entitled, without having to buy a plane \nticket and fly to the Department of Labor and convince some bureaucrat \nthey have just cause to be permitted to see the records of how their \nunion spent their money last year?\n\n  It seems to me that this is very basic and not very onerous.\n  It is interesting to listen to the opponents of this amendment try to \nthink of arguments against it. About all they can come up with is it is \nburdensome.\n  It is also burdensome to have your dues taken and spent in ways that \nyou are not entitled to find out unless you buy a plane ticket to come \nto the Department of Labor and sit down with some bureaucrat and \nestablish just cause.\n  I do not know what the AFL-CIO is afraid of on this.\n  I assume the votes will not be there to approve this amendment \nbecause it is pretty clear that anything that has any impact whatsoever \non organized labor--anything, any inconvenience, and now even simple \ndisclosure and sunlight--is perceived as a poison pill. That is where \nwe are in this debate.\n  I hope the Hatch amendment will be agreed to.\n  The reason paycheck protection didn't get more votes last night, of \ncourse, is because it also applied to corporations. And there are a \nnumber\n\n[[Page S2686]]\n\nof Members on our side who didn't want to apply that to corporations.\n  This is plain. It is simple. It is understandable, and it is \nessential to a functioning democracy.\n  It seems to me that this is an opportunity for the Senate, if it is \nserious about disclosure, to give union members and the public an \nopportunity to understand how union dues are spent.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will yield back time, but I wish to read \nwhat the amendment says: Itemize all spending, internal communications \nto members or shareholders, external communications to anyone else by \nany means of transmission for any purpose on any topic that relates to \nany Member of Congress or person who is a Federal candidate, any \npolitical party or any political cause total.\n  This is so broad that I can't imagine anyone, whether from a business \nperspective or labor perspective, would vote for this amendment. It is \nnot appropriate to include such an over broad and vague amendment on a \nconstitutionally sensitive campaign finance reform bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Just add the words ``directly or indirectly.''\n  Mr. DODD. That is right.\n  We urge rejection of this amendment. I am happy to yield back all of \nour time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is an opportunity for members of \nunions to find out how their dues are being spent without buying a \nplane ticket, going to the Department of Labor, and trying to find out \nthrough that difficult process.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 60, nays 40, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 44 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--60\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--40\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to take a minute to say that I \nthink we all agree we are making very good progress. I also want to \npoint out that we don't have any idea yet how many amendments remain. \nIt is about time now in this process that we get an idea of how many \nremaining amendments there are.\n  The majority leader is trying to figure out whether we should stay in \ntomorrow, and even Saturday, in order to complete our work. I am not \nsure I can agree to us not remaining in session, unless we have some \nidea as to the number of remaining amendments and how we continue to \naddress those.\n  Look, everybody knows the Senator from Alaska is going on a trip to \nAlaska next Thursday night and is intent on doing that. I don't want to \ninterfere with that. I don't want us to go out early tomorrow, or at \nany time, until we have some idea as to how we can bring this to an \nend, hopefully, by next Thursday or Friday.\n  I hope Members will let Senators McConnell and Dodd know of their \namendments. That doesn't mean there won't be one or two additional \namendments or additional second degrees. But we ought to know about how \nmany amendments remain so we can have an idea as to how much time we \nneed to use over the weekend.\n  I thank my friend from Mississippi for a very important amendment \nthat will take advantage of the new technology we have, as far as \nincreasing full disclosure and informing the American people.\n  Mr. DODD. If the Senator will yield, I want to underscore what the \nSenator from Arizona has said. We have considered, I think, eight \namendments since we began on Tuesday. Now, we have taken a lot of time. \nSome of them have been lengthy debates. The amendment we are about to \nconsider will be finished in about a half hour. It is a \nnoncontroversial amendment, one that will add substantially to the \nbill. But we have about 30, at least, amendments on the Democratic \nside. While many amendments probably will not be offered, I don't know \nthat yet.\n  I underscore what the Senator said, that we need to take advantage of \nthis opportunity. Several Members have said, ``I will do it next \nweek.'' That crowd is beginning to grow for next week. If we only \nhandle 8 or 10 amendments this week, I am not overly optimistic that we \nwill be able to handle the numbers I see in 4 or 5 days next week. It \nwill be important to pare the list down. I urge Members to do so.\n  With that, I thank my colleague from Mississippi for yielding. I \nsupport his amendment. There are several people who want to speak on \nit. Senator Landrieu from Louisiana would like to be heard as well on \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 137\n\n             (Purpose: To provide for increased disclosure)\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 137:\n       On page 38, after line 3, add the following:\n\n               TITLE V--ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 501. INTERNET ACCESS TO RECORDS.\n\n       Section 304(a)(11)(B) of the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 434(a)(11)(B)) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(B) The Commission shall make a designation, statement, \n     report, or notification that is filed with the Commission \n     under this Act available for inspection by the public in the \n     offices of the Commission and accessible to the public on the \n     Internet not later than 48 hours (24 hours in the case of a \n     designation, statement, report, or notification filed \n     electronically) after receipt by the Commission.''.\n\n     SEC. 502. MAINTENANCE OF WEBSITE OF ELECTION REPORTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Federal Election Commission shall \n     maintain a central site on the Internet to make accessible to \n     the public all election-related reports.\n       (b) Election-Related Report.--In this section, the term \n     ``election-related report'' means any report, designation, or \n     statement required to be filed under the Federal Election \n     Campaign Act of 1971.\n       (c) Coordination With Other Agencies.--Any executive agency \n     receiving an election-related report shall cooperate and \n     coordinate with the Federal Election Commission to make such \n     report available for posting on the site of the Federal \n     Election Commission in a timely manner.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I allowed the clerk to read the entire \namendment so the Senate would be fully informed of the exact provisions \nof this amendment.\n  It does, purely and simply, what it says it does. It requires the \nfiling of the posting by the Federal Election Commission of any filing \nmade with the Commission on the Internet. In the case of filings made \nelectronically, the posting will be done under the terms of this \namendment within 24 hours. As far as other filings are concerned, those \nthat may be filed without electronic dissemination through the \nCommission, or receipt in any other way, shall be posted within 48 \nhours.\n  We have discussed the amendment and the question of enforceability \nand\n\n[[Page S2687]]\n\ncompliance with the Federal Election Commission representatives. We \nhave been assured that this can be managed, it can be administered by \nthe Federal Election Commission.\n  It is also important to note there are a number of reports required \nunder this act we are taking up now, an amendment to the 1971 act that \nwould require filings by other than candidates for Federal office. At \nthis time, most of the filings that are done are for candidates. I am \nhopeful that under the terms of this act we are considering now, the \namendment to the Federal Election Campaign Act, we will have much more \ndisclosure. I think, for example, the amendment we have already \nadopted, offered by the distinguished Senators from Maine and Vermont, \nMs. Snowe and Mr. Jeffords, will require more disclosure to be made \nabout who is spending money to influence the outcome of Federal \nelections, and how that money is being spent.\n  These disclosures will be made under the McCain-Feingold bill. They \nwill be subject to the posting provisions of this amendment.\n  It is my hope, too, that other Federal agencies which may receive \nelection-related reports, as defined in section 502 of this amendment, \nwill cooperate with the Federal Election Commission and make those \nreports available to the Federal Election Commission so it may post on \na central Internet Web site all election-related reports relating to \nFederal election campaigns.\n  This will make it a lot simpler and easier for the general public. It \nwill make it easier for candidates, anybody interested in Federal \nelection campaigns, to go to one site and find there, through links \nmaybe to other agencies or otherwise on this Internet site, all of the \nreceipts, disbursements, and disclosures required by the Federal \nElection Campaign Act.\n  We hope this is a step toward fuller disclosure, disclosure that \nreally does create greater access by the public to what is going on in \nFederal election campaigns. I am hopeful the Senate will agree to the \namendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to my friend from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am looking at section 502 of the \nSenator's amendment, subsection (B), in how he defines all election-\nrelated reports. I know the Senator's intent, and I applaud it. I think \nit would be absolutely desirable to have a central point, a repository \ntotally transparent to the public.\n  The Senator's amendment says that all election-related reports are \nthose required ``to be filed under the Federal Election Campaign Act of \n1971.''\n\n  I am wondering if the Senator's intent is to require the reports of \nsection 527 groups whose reports are already posted on the Internet \nseparately. Those are a requirement of the IRS Code.\n  Also, does it require the FEC to put on the Internet what we call LM-\n2 forms filed with the Department of Labor, since all of these forms \nacknowledge labor PACs? In my mind, they fall under the all election-\nrelated reports. It just so happens there are others outside the 1971 \nlaw.\n  There is another, and this is one I find interesting. It is related \nto municipal securities dealers pursuant to what is known as the MSRB \nrule G-37, which I know absolutely nothing about, other than to say \nthere is a requirement for filing under that law because Federal \ncandidates sometimes can have bond-related responsibilities.\n  George W. Bush, as Governor of Texas, had bond-related \nresponsibilities and probably had to do filings. Those are election-\nrelated filings, but because they are not under the 1971 law, they \nwould not necessarily fall under the Senator's definition.\n  I know the intent of the Senator from Mississippi, and I applaud his \nintent. The question is, Is it as all inclusive as he intends it to be \nbecause the Senator has limited it to the 1971 law, and there are now \nother laws we have grown through over the last good number of years \nthat indicate other election-related activities?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his question and \nalso for his comments to further explain the possible inclusiveness of \nparagraph (c) of section 502. This is not an absolute requirement of \nlaw under paragraph (c). It is an encouragement. It is almost like a \nsense-of-Congress resolution when we encourage the cooperation and \ncoordination with the Federal Election Commission. We use the word \n``shall.''\n  I do not know that in a contest in litigation this would be enforced \nby the courts, but we hope the spirit of it is conveyed by the use of \nthe words ``cooperate and coordinate with'' the Federal Election \nCommission.\n  I do not want to create within the Federal Election Commission the \nidea that they are superimposed over all other Federal agencies and \ndepartments and can summons them or require of them transferring \ninformation and documents to the FEC for exhibition on this Internet \nsite, but it is our hope that this language will encourage the \ncooperation and coordination of these other Federal agencies that might \nreceive reports, such as the ones described by the Senator from Idaho, \nso the FEC can put all of these in one central location on a Web site. \nThey can do this through linking to other agencies and departments on \nthe Internet.\n  As the Senator knows, that is one way to deal with this, on the \ncentralized Web site of the FEC to provide opportunities and cross-\nreferences to other agencies and identify documents that are election-\nrelated reports. That is our hope.\n  The wording of it might be a little awkward. I am happy for the \nSenator to suggest a better way to say it, but that is the intent.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield for one last question?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, FEC reports are only filed with the FEC and \nthe Secretary of the Senate. They are filed nowhere else in our \nGovernment. In subsection (c), the Senator talks about coordinating \nwith other agencies:\n\n       Any executive agency receiving an election-related report \n     shall cooperate and coordinate with the Federal Election \n     Commission. . . .\n\n  I sense a confusion there in how that gets supplied. You file with no \none else but the FEC as a Federal candidate. The FEC files with no one \nelse, and there is no relationship to these filings now of the kind I \nhave mentioned--the bond brokerage issue with the broker having to file \nand the IRS-related issue. Those are all stand-alones, if you will, and \nalso the Internet LM-2 form filed with the Department of Labor.\n  I want to agree with the Senator in creating a central repository.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. If the Senator will yield to me and let me ask for his \nreaction to this, can we put in the first section ``included, but not \nlimited to, election-related reports''? Paragraph (b) means any report, \ndesignation, or statement required to be filed with the Commission--\nincluded but not limited to. Let's put that in between ``election-\nrelated report'' and the word ``means.''\n  Mr. CRAIG. We are all concerned about clarity, and I was concerned--\n--\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I would not want to limit it just to the Federal \nElection Campaign Act, but I did not want anybody to think we were \ngiving the FEC the authority to require other agencies to file their \nreports with the FEC. We wanted to use ``cooperate and coordinate.''\n  Mr. CRAIG. But, of course, if the Senator is intent on creating a \ncentral repository with true transparency and these are other valuable \nreports--for example, the report filed with the Labor Department is \nlabor unions and PACs and their filings which have valuable disclosure \ninformation in them.\n  I am not sure we want to be that vague. That is my frustration.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I also do not want to presume to list every report that \nis an election-related report, hence the use of a general description \nof what we are talking about. We do want to include any and all reports \nthat are required to be filed under the Federal Election Campaign Act \nof 1971 and the amendments to that.\n  We think the amendments are included in the words ``Federal Election \nCampaign Act of 1971,'' including the amendments of 1974 and the one we \nare considering in the Senate today, which is an amendment to the 1971 \nact. We want to include all filings required by that law and all \namendments to that law. That is understood.\n\n[[Page S2688]]\n\n  We also want to include, by way of suggesting cooperation and \ncoordination with other Federal agencies and departments, any other \nelection-related reports, and the Senator has correctly identified \nseveral. Those all should be included, in my view, in the meaning and \nthe intent of this amendment and should be so construed by any court of \nlaw or any administrative agency with responsibility for enforcing this \namendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. To our knowledge, there are only the three we have \nmentioned. Absolute clarity suggests you put those three in the text of \nyour amendment and then say ``and any additional'' or others that may \ncome along.\n  Obviously, if your amendment becomes the law and other reports are \nrequired that might be outside the scope of the 1971 law, you would \nidentify them with your law and make them a requirement of that filing \nfor purposes of Internet access.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator. I think his suggestions have been \nhelpful.\n  We have staff on the floor who have been working on the drafting of \nthe amendment for several days and consulting with the FEC and \nrepresentatives of the committee of jurisdiction.\n  Let me have a chance to address the concerns of the Senator with some \nsuggested modification language and discuss this with him and the \nchairman and ranking member of the Rules Committee, which has \njurisdiction over this subject.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy for the Senator to be recognized in her own \nright and speak to the issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor to support Senator \nCochran in his amendment. I think it is an excellent amendment and goes \na long way toward moving to a more full and complete disclosure.\n  I understand some of the questions that have been raised. But as I \nread this amendment, it is very good. We are doing this in Louisiana \nand perhaps other States, learning how to use this new technology in \nmany good ways.\n  It helps our campaign finance system be more transparent. For \ninstance, the Senator is correct; you can take a State such as \nLouisiana and simply make this requirement for our State agency to make \nall of these reports available over the Internet on one Web site so \npeople don't have to search through a variety of Web sites.\n  I commend the Senator for his amendment. I support his amendment and \nurge the Senator, unless absolutely necessary, not to adjust the \namendment. It is very clear. It simply takes the law and all the \nreports and urges the FEC to put them in one central site. It will make \nit easier for our constituents, easier for the news media, easier for \nus to follow those reports.\n  I will have an amendment later taking this a step further and \nrequiring the FEC to develop standardized software which will make it \nmuch easier for everyone to file the required reports in a timely \nfashion. My amendment will take this a step further by requiring it to \nbe almost instantaneously reported. Deposit a check in your bank \naccount, and it will appear on the Internet. People can follow the flow \nof money.\n\n  There are many disagreements about limits and whether there should be \ncaps or no caps, and should broadcasters have to give special rates or \nreasonable rates--since I voted for that amendment, ``reasonable \nrates''--for political candidates.\n  Frankly, in my general discussions with Senator McCain and Senator \nFeingold and many people on both sides who support campaign finance \nreform, the one area on which we all agree is more disclosure. The one \nthing everybody says, opponents of McCain-Feingold as well as \nproponents, is that we should be coming forward more aggressively in \nour disclosure.\n  That is what the amendment of Senator Cochran does. I compliment him \nfor that. I urge my colleagues to look favorably upon it. I thank him \nfor the work he is doing in regard to campaign finance reform. I hope \nwe don't change this amendment too much. It is quite simple and very \ngood in its current form.\n  Later on today, I will propose my amendment that will make it a \nvirtual reality check on all campaign contributions coming in from a \nvariety of different sources and make it much easier for Members to be \nheld accountable for moneys we are collecting and the votes we cast. \nThe Cochran amendment is very good, and I hope we will adopt it.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, yesterday in my role as ranking member on \nthe Senate Budget Committee, I met with Senator Domenici, the chairman \nof the Senate Budget Committee. He informed me he intended not to have \na markup of the budget in the Budget Committee but to come directly to \nthe floor of the Senate. This was pursuant to a request I had made that \nwe proceed to schedule a markup in the committee. I told him I thought \na decision not to have a markup in the Budget Committee would be a \nmistake.\n  We have never had a circumstance in which we have tried to bring a \nbudget for the United States to the floor of the Senate without the \nBudget Committee, which has the primary responsibility, meeting first \nto hammer out an agreement. Senator Domenici, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, told me he believes it will be impossible for us to \nreach an agreement. I don't know how anyone can be certain of that \nbefore we have tried.\n  I hope very much that he will--and I asked Senator Domenici yesterday \nto reconsider to give us a chance to debate and discuss the budget in \nthe Budget Committee and to have votes.\n  That is how we make decisions.\n  I still hold some optimism that after discussion and debate we might \nfind agreement. It might not be on precisely what the President has \nproposed. Someone recommended yesterday that we try to agree on a 1-\nyear budget.\n  But we have a country that has some serious challenges. Anybody who \nhas been watching the markets knows they continue to decline, and \ndecline precipitously. While it is true that the best immediate \nresponse is monetary policy and the Federal Reserve Board lowering \ninterest rates, that has now been done three times, and still the slide \ncontinues, and still we see warning signals about the economy. We see \nJapan in a perilous position. We have had a serious energy shock in \nthis country. We see high levels of individual debt in America. We see \nvery dramatic weakness in the financial markets.\n  I personally believe we have an obligation and a responsibility to \ntry to respond as quickly as possible. I think\n\n[[Page S2689]]\n\nthat means, on the fiscal policy side, we fast-forward the parts of the \nPresident's proposed tax cut to try to provide some stimulus to this \neconomy.\n  We can wait, and we can doddle and deliberate, or we can act. I hope \nvery much that we take the opportunity to work in the Budget Committee \nto try to find common ground, to try to find a basis on which we can \nagree so we can get a swift response on the fiscal side to provide some \nconfidence to the American people, to provide some confidence that \ntheir Government is responding to what is happening in their daily \nlives.\n  Some have said, well, if you agree on something that is other than \nprecisely what the President has proposed, that will be seen as a \ndefeat for the President. I don't think we need to be in that position. \nI think we can find perhaps an overall global agreement that would be \nseen as a win for the country, a win for the President, and a win for \nthe Congress. Nobody is defeated, nobody is hurt, but that collectively \nwe have worked together to do what is best for the country.\n\n  I really think we can do that, and at the end of the day it might be \nprecisely what the President has proposed. But it may well enjoy his \nsupport. The fact is, circumstances have changed. He made a proposal \nduring the campaign. I didn't agree with every part of it, but I \nrespect him for doing it. The question now is, What do we do in light \nof what we face today? It does not need to be exactly what was proposed \nmore than a year ago. Circumstances have changed. We have a requirement \nand a responsibility to respond to what is occurring.\n  I am again asking Senator Domenici to reconsider. I am asking \ncolleagues on both sides to urge Senator Domenici to reconsider. The \nMembers on the Budget Committee have been very diligent in their \nresponsibilities. We had an outstanding set of hearings. We ought to \ndebate and discuss a budget resolution for this country before it comes \nto the floor of the Senate. I think it really invites chaos to come out \nhere with the Budget Committee for the first time ever failing to even \nmeet and failing to even try. What kind of procedure is that?\n  I hope very much that Members of goodwill will get together in this \nChamber and try to do what is best for the country and try to go \nthrough the kind of process we normally do to reach agreement. This \nidea that we predict failure before we have tried I think is a mistake. \nWe ought to try debate and we ought to discuss and vote and provide \nsome leadership so that we have a budget resolution out on the floor \nthat has been carefully vetted by the Members who have the primary \nresponsibility--the Senate Budget Committee.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this has been cleared with the managers of \nthe bill, Senators Dodd and McConnell.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. \nFeingold, be recognized for 5 minutes as if in morning business, and \nfollowing that Senator Hollings be recognized for 10 minutes as if in \nmorning business, and the time not count against the amendment that has \nbeen filed by the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am pleased that the distinguished ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee is still on the floor because I rise at this point not to \ntalk about campaign finance reform but to strongly agree with the \ncomments he has made.\n  I am very pleased to be a member of the Budget Committee. It is \nsomething I wanted to have an opportunity to do when I came here \nbecause it was the issue on which I ran originally--and I believe the \nissue on which the Senator from North Dakota ran--getting this \ncountry's fiscal situation under control. That is actually the most \nimportant thing we can do. If you care passionately about campaign \nfinance reform, nothing is more important than the appropriate and \nthoughtful budgeting of the people's resources. I am grateful for his \nextremely skilled leadership on our side in the Budget Committee.\n  I am pleased to join with the ranking member of the Budget Committee \nand my colleagues on the committee to talk about the need for the \nmarkup in our committee of the concurrent budget resolution.\n  I, too, was disappointed to hear our chairman indicate that he may \nnot convene a markup. I believe his stated reason is that he does not \nwant to conduct a markup unless he can be assured the resulting product \nwill have the support of a majority of the committee.\n  I very much hope the chairman will reconsider his decision.\n  The principal work of a member of that committee and the reason we \nare so eager to be a part of that committee and, frankly, one of the \nbest parts of being in the Senate for me has been the experience of \ngoing through the markup of a budget resolution. It is extremely \ninteresting, and it is extremely important in terms of the priorities \nof our country. Forgoing a markup renders membership on that committee \nmuch less meaningful.\n  As many of my colleagues may know, the inability of the Budget \nCommittee to muster a majority to report out a bill would not prevent \nthe Senate from considering a budget resolution. The precedents of the \nSenate provide for just such gridlock.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that this very precedent will be used to \ncircumvent the committee entirely, leaving the writing of the budget \nresolution to unelected staff.\n  While this might have little practical effect on just about any other \nbill where debate and amendment are much more open, debate on the \nbudget resolution is severely constrained.\n  We are warning our few colleagues, including the Presiding Officer, \nthat we are about to experience ``vote-arama'' where we vote on scores \nof amendments with just a few minutes' notice because of the inability \nto find time and to have time for people to actually fully debate \namendments on the budget resolution.\n  Stringent germaneness standards severely restrict the ability of the \nbody to amend the resolution, and those standards flow form the \nbaseline resolution that comes to the Senate.\n  This makes the work of the Budget Committee on the resolution all the \nmore important. The threshold for adopting an amendment can be a simple \nmajority, or a supermajority, depending on the underlying structure of \nthe concurrent resolution crafted by the Budget Committee.\n  The chairman has considerable say in the way the concurrent \nresolution is structured even with a committee markup. But others on \nthe Budget Committee should have a say as well.\n  We are in an unusual posture with an evenly divided Senate and evenly \ndivided committees. Perhaps we are the victims of some ancient curse, \nhaving to ``legislate in interesting times.''\n  But these ``interesting times'' are all the more reason to respect \nthe rights of Members to participate fully in their respective \ncommittees.\n  I simply wanted to rise to strongly agree with the ranking member \nthat we need to have a markup in the Budget Committee.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair and my distinguished colleague from \nArizona.\n  Mr. President, I just want to reemphasize the point made by the \nSenators from North Dakota and Wisconsin relative to a markup of the \nbudget in the Budget Committee.\n  Yesterday morning, Marjorie Williams had an intriguing op-ed piece in \nthe Washington Post emphasizing that the key watchword of the Bush \nadministration is ``transparency,'' ``transparency.'' Apparently, at \nevery turn, the emphasis has been: We're transparent. We're \ntransparent. We're open.\n  This bemuses this particular Senator because the one thing they are \nabsolutely nontransparent about is the budget. I have been trying, as a \nformer chairman of the Budget Committee--and working here now for 25 \nyears on this particular problem--to get the President's budget \nfigures. We have had different people make some very interesting, \namusing, and entertaining appearances on C-SPAN, but nobody has pointed \nout the actual outlays and the spending in the President's budget.\n  We are on a collision course. What will happen come April 1st, under \nthe\n\n[[Page S2690]]\n\nbudget rule, the majority leader can propose and lay down a budget, and \nstart debating. If that is the game plan, we are headed now on a course \nof a train wreck. That is not going to fly.\n  We do not have any idea of the figures. And to just vote willy-nilly \nas an exercise, to bypass all proceedings of the budget in the Budget \nCommittee, just to get it to a conference, and then to mark up, for the \nfirst time, what the President wants, is really the process of \narrogance.\n  It is disturbing how little confidence the market has in us--in the \nCongress and the President--at this particular time. They see the \nCongress headed in one direction, and the President running around, \ncontinuing in his campaign, talking about the budget. He is out selling \nhis so-called tax cut and budget everywhere but in the Budget \nCommittee. We do not know exactly what he wants for defense, education, \nhousing, and transportation. These are all important items to be \ndiscussed.\n  At the beginning--weeks back--not having a real detailed budget, I \nthought we should take this year's budget--that we passed only in \nDecember--and just more or less have a budget freeze like you would \nhave as a Governor. You would just take the President's budget and \ndebate what cuts you had on there, and say, for any increases--the so-\ncalled pay-go rule--that you had to have offsets, and then hold up on \nthe tax cuts until it became apparent whether it was going to be a soft \nor hard landing.\n  I have to say in the same breath, this is a hard enough landing for \nthis Senator. And rather than hold up, I have amended my initiative to \nput in an immediate economic stimulus package in the Finance Committee. \nBut my budget is in the Budget Committee. I have written the chairman \nand asked him to please let me know when we are going to have a markup \nso we can discuss my budget, the President's budget, and any and all \nbudgets.\n  This is, as I say, the process of arrogance in which the debate and \nthe consideration of the individual Senators and their opinions makes \nno difference in the committee. It is a ritual: Now that we have the \nbare majority, what we have to do is ram through--right now--what we \nwant, irrespective of any debate or consideration. That is going to \nerode the confidence we have in the White House and the confidence the \nWhite House has in the Congress itself.\n  The market sees this. I think we really are eroding confidence. You \nare going to see more downturns in the economy, and everything else, \nuntil we quit running around and come back home and start working \ntogether on the nation's problems.\n\n  I see the distinguished President out talking about the Patients' \nBill of Rights. That is not before the Congress right now. But we are \nout politicking on different campaign issues. But if we could show a \nwillingness to work together, I think we would be much better off. I \nhave not seen the likes of this in my years, and particularly with \nrespect to the budget.\n  The budget process was instituted as a result of some 13 \nappropriations bills, and we did not have one look-see at the \nGovernment spending in its entirety. So we put in these particular \nrules so that we could facilitate a complete and comprehensive debate \nand treatment of the Government's financial needs.\n  Those rules are restrictions to help move it along--a mammoth \nGovernment budget of all departments--but they are being used to \nobscure any consideration rather than give comprehensive treatment and \nconsideration.\n  So instead of knowing what the President intends on education, \nhousing, crime or with respect to the Justice Department, we just \noperate in the dark, in a casual fashion, and use the limited rules of \nthe budget process--not for a comprehensive treatment and \nconsideration--but, on the contrary, to obscure any consideration, any \ntreatment, any markup, any understanding. That is fundamentally bad \nGovernment.\n  I appreciate the distinguished leaders on the opposite side of the \naisle giving me time to comment on this particular matter because I do \nhave a budget. It is a good one. It really responds to our country's \nneeds. But I have not been able to get a markup of my budget. We cannot \nconsider the President's budget.\n  We are going to take up the budget, willy-nilly, under a limited \ntime--with the leadership relinquishing back most of its time and \nsaying: All right, you Democrats, we have the votes. This is what we \nare going to pass. Go ahead and put your amendments on, and your time \nwill run out by Wednesday and we will start the ``vote-a-rama'' around \nthe clock. And the more amendments there are, the longer we will stay. \nWe will stay here Thursday, we will stay here Friday, we will stay here \nSaturday--and we will stay here Palm Sunday--and just continue to vote \nif that is what you all want to do, making it appear that there is \nobstructionism on this side of the aisle, wherein the truth is, we have \nnot had a chance to consider anything and to find out the merit or \ndemerit of the bill or the feelings of the other side on anything.\n  This is just bad congressional process legislating. I hope the \nchairman of the Budget Committee and the leadership on the other side \nof the aisle will say: All right, let's start Monday, meet in formal \nsession and start marking up this budget.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, after consultation with the managers of \nthe bill and their staffs, we have agreed to a modified amendment \nproviding additional disclosure provisions to the bill. I ask unanimous \nconsent to modify my amendment and send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 38, after line 3, add the following:\n\n               TITLE V--ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 501. INTERNET ACCESS TO RECORDS.\n\n       Section 304(a)(11)(B) of the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 434(a)(11)(B)) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(B) The Commission shall make a designation, statement, \n     report, or notification that is filed with the Commission \n     under this Act available for inspection by the public in the \n     offices of the Commission and accessible to the public on the \n     Internet not later than 48 hours (24 hours in the case of a \n     designation, statement, report, or notification filed \n     electronically) after receipt by the Commission.''.\n\n     SEC. 502. MAINTENANCE OF WEBSITE OF ELECTION REPORTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Federal Election Commission shall \n     maintain a central site on the Internet to make accessible to \n     the public all publicly available election-related reports \n     and information.\n       (b) Election-related report.--In this section, the term \n     ``election-related report'' means any report, designation, or \n     statement required to be filed under the Federal Election \n     Campaign Act of 1971.\n       (c) Coordination With Other Agencies.--Any federal \n     executive agency receiving election-related information which \n     that agency is required by law to publicly disclose shall \n     cooperate and coordinate with the Federal Election Commission \n     to make such report available through, or for posting on, the \n     site of the Federal Election Commission in a timely manner.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this simply clarifies the amendment with \nappropriate legal language. I hate to use that reference because these \nare lawyers writing these provisions and experienced staff members \nmaybe who aren't lawyers who help them. It does improve the clarity of \nthe language, and it does ensure that election-related reports, those \nprovided for in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 and \namendments thereto, be provided as quickly and as completely on an \nInternet site as they can by the FEC.\n  We think this will improve the disclosure of important information to \nthe public about who is financing election campaigns, how they are \nbeing financed, where the money is coming from that the candidates are \nspending, that are required to be filed under current reports and the \nadditional requirements that will be in effect after this legislation \nis agreed to.\n  We believe this is an improvement. It supplements and complements the \nSnowe-Jeffords amendment which has\n\n[[Page S2691]]\n\nalready been adopted by the Senate. We are hopeful the Senate will be \nable to accept this amendment as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my friend and colleague from \nMississippi. This is a good amendment. I appreciate the efforts of the \nstaff who worked on this over the last half an hour or so.\n  What I thought we might do, for those who want to understand this \nbetter, the Senator from Mississippi and I, along with my colleague \nfrom Kentucky, will have a colloquy that we will write up providing \nmore specificity on exactly what changes we made here and the \nrationale. Basically, this is a coordinating effort. We are saying that \nunder existing law, where there are requirements of public disclosure, \nthere ought to be a way to coordinate that information so that it is \nmore transparent, more readily available for those who seek that \ninformation. It does not expand the requirements in law beyond those \nthat already exist for public disclosure.\n  I thank my colleague from Mississippi and my colleague from Kentucky. \nI know of no reason that we need a recorded vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I, too, commend the Senator from \nMississippi for his amendment and thank the various staffs who have \nbeen working on the clarifications. I am in support of the amendment \nand see no particular reason we should have a rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cochran. He has worked \nlong and hard. It is a chance for us to take advantage of new \ntechnology so that literally 100 million Americans will be able to \nreceive this information in a timely and informative fashion. This is \nin keeping with what all of us are attempting to do with campaign \nfinance reform; that is, increase disclosure. We are working on an \nadditional amendment to help on the disclosure issue. I thank Senator \nCochran for his involvement. I thank Senator Dodd and Senator McConnell \nas well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 137), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe the next amendment will come \nfrom the other side.\n  Mr. DODD. Senator Wyden and Senator Collins have an amendment. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise in support of S. 27, the \nBipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2001. I would like to take \nthis opportunity to congratulate both Senators McCain and Feingold on \ndeveloping such an excellent bipartisan bill and also to Senators Dodd \nand McConnell for bringing this bill to the Senate floor. I hope we can \nconsider it expeditiously and pass it.\n  I absolutely support this legislation. Even if it is a disadvantage \nfor incumbents, I believe, we, the Senate, should be more worried about \nprotecting democracy than protecting ourselves. I want a Congress that \nis unbought and unbossed. Our current campaign finance system \ncontributes now to a culture of cynicism. It hurts our institutions, it \nhurts our government, and it is an attack on the integrity of our \npolitical process.\n  When big business blocks agencies such as the Department of Labor \nfrom issuing important regulations on ergonomics, it adds to the \nculture of cynicism. I am not saying there is a quid pro quo, but what \nare the American people to think when some of the biggest campaign \ncontributors were able to stop legislation that they oppose? Is it any \nwonder Americans don't trust their elected officials to act in the \npublic interest; instead, they believe Congress is preoccupied with \npandering to the special interest.\n  That's why I support the following principles for campaign finance \nreform, regardless of what bill is before the Senate: I want to stop \nthe flood of unregulated and unreported money in campaigns. I want to \neliminate the undue influence of special interests in elections. I want \nto encourage strong grassroots participation. I would like to return \npower to where it belongs --with the people. This is why I support the \nMcCain-Feingold bill.\n  My support for this legislation is nothing new. During my entire \npolitical career, both in the House and the Senate, I have always \nsupported campaign finance reform and other measures to open up our \ndemocratic process.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill does several things. It bans soft money \nraised by national parties and by candidates for Federal office. It \nends issue ads, which are really attack ads under the guise of \n``issues.'' I want to close the loophole which allows groups to skirt \nthe current election laws - and this bill does just that. Finally, it \nclarifies what election activities non-profits can do on behalf of our \ncandidates for Federal office.\n  Why should we ban soft money? We hear ``soft'' money. Is it like a \nsoft pretzel? What does ``soft'' mean? Is it soft currency? Really, it \nis a backdoor way to avoid the contribution limits that are now placed \non candidates. Right now soft money is influencing our process almost \nas much as direct contributions to candidates do. Republicans and \nDemocrats raised over $460 million in last year's soft money race or, \nsoft money chase. Right now, Federal candidates spend so much time and \nso much attention raising money that we sometimes wonder if we have the \ntime to do the work of our constituents. Candidates must constantly \nwork to raise money.\n  Special interest groups that contribute large sums have an influence \non the political process. Let's face it, those people with the golden \nRolodex who can approach a candidate and say, ``I'll be able to get 100 \npeople in the room and raise $1,000 for you,'' have influence. Those \nwho then say, ``I'll get 10 people in the room and have 10,000 people \ngive soft money,'' which is the unregulated but legal way of giving \nmoney to parties, funding the issue ads that are really attack ads, are \nalso in high demand.\n\n  This is why we need to pass McCain-Feingold because I think it deals \nwith these issues and deals with them in a constructive way.\n  Thirty years ago I decided to run for political office. I was a \nsocial worker who was strongly considering a doctorate in public \nhealth. I joined a wonderful group of people in Baltimore to fight a \nhighway. The more we knocked on doors, the more we saw that the doors \nwere closed to us. At that time, Baltimore was dominated by political \nmachines. It was dominated by political bosses. Grassroots, nonprofit \norganizations couldn't break into that process. I was so tired of \nbanging on doors I decided to open doors, and that's when I announced I \nwas going to run for the Baltimore city council. The smart money was \nagainst me. How could a woman run in an ethnic blue-collar \nneighborhood, someone who had a strong record in civil rights and also \nhad no personal money? While they were so busy laughing at me, I got to \nwork. Because I had no money, I had no choice, I organized a group of \nvolunteers and we went door-to-door, one hot summer in Baltimore, and I \nknocked on over 10,000 doors. By knocking on those doors with my \nvolunteers, I rolled over the political machine and I beat those two \npolitical bosses.\n  That is how I got into politics. And because of how I started, I want \nthe voices and votes of strong grassroots volunteers still to count. I \nwant the small contributor to still count. I found ways to bring people \ninto the process. Using not only door-to-door but techno door-to-door, \nusing the Internet, chatrooms for discussions on issues, new forms of \ntown halls. But we can't do that if every single day our\n\n[[Page S2692]]\n\nfocus is on raising big money, soft money, or any kind of money that we \ncan get our hands on.\n  Does McCain-Feingold solve all the problems of this situation? No. Is \nit more than a downpayment on reform? You bet. What McCain-Feingold \ndoes is dry up the soft money and focus on getting real contributors. I \nhope we can even do more reform and innovative thinking, such as \nbroadcast vouchers, for the small contributors. The more people we can \nbring in, the more people are participating in the process. The best \ncure for democracy is more democracy and more participation. That is \nwhy I am so strong about McCain-Feingold. We need to stop worrying \nabout protecting incumbents and start worrying about protecting \ndemocracy.\n  Last year we spent $3 billion on election activities. The average \nSenate race now costs $6 million. That is compared to $1 million over \n20 years ago. It seems like the cost of campaigns is going up more than \nhealth care costs. Just look at my own State of Maryland where \nadvertising is big business. For me to go on TV in the Baltimore-\nWashington corridor, it is about $300,000 or $350,000 a week.\n  Let's look at what it takes to raise $6 million--the average cost of \na Senate campaign. When you think about a 6-year term, that means you \nhave to raise $1 million a year. You take 2 weeks off for religious \nholidays or vacation; that is $20,000 a week. That means a Senator has \nto think about raising $20,000 a week.\n  Can you really believe we can focus all the time we need to on our \nnational security interests, raising 20 grand a week? Can you really \ndevote all of your time to thinking about how we can solve the health \ncare crisis? Can we really think about how we could end the trafficking \nin drugs when we are in the trafficking of fundraisers? It weakens our \ninstitution.\n  Let's look at it among ourselves. Why romanticize the old days of the \nSenate or talk about the club?\n  The club has a new look. There are 13 women in the Senate, people \ncoming from a variety of backgrounds, some very wealthy and some who \ngot here because of strong grassroots support, all bringing their \npassion to engage in public debate and fashion public policy. That is \nwhat we want to do. But where are we now? When we used to engage in \nconversation, the things that promote civility and creative thinking, \nnow we are all dashing to either our own fundraisers or someone else's.\n  This is why I hope we pass McCain-Feingold. For all of you who do not \nlike campaign finance reform, be worried, as I am, that the largest \nvoting block in America now is the no-shows. The way we can deal with \nthe cynicism is to be able to clean up our own act, do some of the \nelection reforms on which Senators Dodd and McConnell are working. They \nare very able Senators. Let's continue to open up the process but don't \nthink about opening up the process where we have to pursue open \nwallets. I would rather pursue open minds and keep knocking on those \ndoors.\n  I urge my colleagues in the strongest way I can to pass McCain-\nFeingold. It will be one of the best things we can do for democracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very pleased I was on the floor to \nhear the remarks of the Senator from Maryland. She has been incredibly \nhelpful on this issue of campaign finance reform.\n  I had the honor last Friday, with Senator McCain, to go to her State \nand visit Annapolis. The mere mention of her name in general produced a \ntremendous response, but in particular, when I shared with the audience \nhow she has been with us every minute of the way for all these years on \nthis issue, with such enthusiasm, there was a great response. I thank \nmy colleague and appreciate so much the fact that she is helping us get \nthe bill through.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator and I salute him and Senator \nMcCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 138\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Wyden] for himself, Ms. \n     Collins, and Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered \n     138.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide that the lowest unit rate for campaign advertising \nshall not be available for communications in which a candidate directly \nreferences an opponent of the candidate unless the candidate does so in \n                                person)\n\n       On page 37, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning with \nSenator Collins of Maine to offer a bipartisan amendment that we \nbelieve will help slow the explosive growth of negative political \ncommercials that are corroding the faith of individuals in the \npolitical process. I also thank my colleague from New Mexico, Senator \nBingaman, and Congressman Greg Walden of Oregon on the House side, who \nhas also been extremely interested in this issue over the years.\n  Negative commercials are clearly fueling citizens' cynicism about \npolitics. Those negative commercials are depressing voter participation \nand, in my view, they are demeaning all who are involved in the \npolitical process.\n  The amendment I have prepared with Senator Collins is a \nstraightforward one. In order to qualify for the advertising discounts \nthat Federal law requires candidates for Federal office receive, those \ncandidates would have to personally stand by any mention of an opponent \nin a radio or television advertisement.\n  We have asked the Congressional Research Service to do an analysis of \nour proposal. In their view, they believe it would be upheld as \nconstitutional. I am of the view that they came to that conclusion \nbecause the fact is there is no\n\n[[Page S2693]]\n\nconstitutional right to a subsidized dirty political campaign. \nEverybody in this body knows and knows full well that when candidates \nmention their opponent in an advertisement, they are not spending those \ncampaign funds to state that their opponent is the greatest thing since \nnight baseball. They are going to be spending, in so many instances, \nadvertising money where, in effect, the candidate would hide behind \ngrainy photographs of the opponent, pictures that make that opponent \nlook pretty much like a criminal, and often there is this bloodcurdling \nmusic that portrays the whole thing in such an ominous way that the \nchildren sort of run for another room.\n  What Senator Collins and I are seeking to do in this amendment is to \nmake it tough for candidates to disown their negative political \ncommercials. We say that candidates can say anything they want. We are \nnot trampling on the first amendment. A candidate is free, totally \nfree, completely unfettered, under our bipartisan proposal, to say \nanything about their opponent.\n  But what we say, however, is if you are going to mention your \nopponent, you have to own up to it. You cannot hide any longer.\n  The fact is, negative campaigning is done to obscure ownership. It is \ndone to obscure who is actually going to be held personally \naccountable.\n  A number of analysts have looked at negative commercials over the \nyears and the fact is, as they have noted, it is almost always done by \nadvertising. It is almost impossible to do a negative exchange if you \nare in a debate because the candidate on the other side has an \nopportunity to answer. The sneak punches, the low blows, are easily \ndelivered through TV and radio, especially radio.\n  As our colleagues know, a lot of the newspapers at home will do these \nad watches. So very often it is possible to blow the whistle on a \ntelevision commercial. But with respect to radio, that so often is \ncompletely under the radar so there is absolutely no accountability.\n  What Senator Collins and I seek to do is to make it clear that it is \nnot going to be so easy to skulk around, to sneak around and engage in \nthese negative ads and pretend they are not yours.\n\n  You can say anything you want about your opponent under our proposal, \nbut there is not going to be a subsidized rate if you don't own up to \nit. It just doesn't seem right to me to say the car dealer or the local \nrestaurant or the hardware store should have to pay a higher rate while \nyou get a discounted rate for running a negative advertisement.\n  A lot of our colleagues want to speak on this. I believe we have an \nhour and a half for this debate. I am very appreciative that Senator \nCollins is on the floor. She has a long history of being involved in \nreform efforts.\n  I also thank Senator Bingaman who has had a great interest in this \nissue over the years. Senator Dodd, Senator Feingold, Senator McCain, \nSenator Levin--all of them have worked with us on this proposal in \nrecent days.\n  I see Senator Dodd on the floor, and I commend him for the superb way \nin which he handled this debate. Nobody ever said this topic was going \nto be a walk in the park. He has handled it superbly, in my view.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am delighted to join the Senator from \nOregon in sponsoring this important legislation.\n  The premise of our amendment is clear. Candidates who run negative \ntelevision and radio ads against their opponents should have to stand \nby their ads. That is the premise of our amendment.\n  The Wyden-Collins amendment would require the candidate to clearly \nidentify himself or herself as the sponsor of the ad. No more stealth \ncampaign negative ads.\n  There are many legitimate policy disputes between candidates and \ncertainly an ad airing these differences is perfectly legitimate and, \nindeed, contributes to the political debate.\n  But when a candidate launches an ad that talks about his opponent--\nwhether it is a high-minded discussion of policy differences or a \nvicious attack on an opponent's character--a candidate should be \nrequired to own up to its sponsorship.\n  The public should not have to guess or decipher as to who is the \nsponsor of the ad. The candidate's sponsorship should be absolutely \nclear. Our amendment would accomplish that goal by requiring a clearly \nidentifiable picture of the candidate and statement of sponsorship for \nthe TV ad. The statement would require the candidate to say that he or \nshe has approved the broadcast.\n  Similarly, for radio, the candidate would have to identify himself, \nthe office he is seeking, and state that he has approved the radio \nbroadcast.\n  We recognize that our amendment tackles only part of the problem of \nthe deluge of negative attack ads since so many of them are sponsored \nnot just by candidates but by outside special interest groups. \nNevertheless, the Wyden-Collins amendment is an important first step. \nIt would help curb the abuse of self-negative ads sponsored by \ncandidates, and it would strengthen the underlying McCain-Feingold \nbill.\n  I hope it will be approved. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend both of my colleagues. Senator \nByrd of West Virginia is also a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield, because we have \ngone through various versions, he has indicated that he is strongly in \nsupport of this effort and is still looking at some of the specifics.\n  The Senator is absolutely right. I think the Senator from West \nVirginia has made a real contribution because he has seen from a \nhistorical standpoint how there has been such an explosion of these \nnegative commercials.\n  I want our colleagues to know that we are very appreciative of the \ninput of the Senator from West Virginia in fighting these negative ads.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for that clarification.\n  Let me emphasize again how much I appreciate his efforts and the \nefforts of the Senator from Maine and others who have been so involved \nin putting this amendment together.\n  At first blush you might say this ad is designed to probably help an \nincumbent because it is the incumbent's record that can be attacked. It \nis not a question of people disagreeing with our existing voting \nrecords. It is the personal attacks that so often are the most \ndisturbing, not to the candidates themselves but the voters.\n  We have seen too often that the effect of negative ads isn't so much \nto do damage, although it does to the reputations of good people by \ndistorting some minor difference and magnifying it beyond all sense of \nproportion, but the larger harm done is that it has a tendency to \ndiscourage people from voting.\n  There is ample data in various races around the country where there \nhas been a deluge of negative campaigning that voter participation \ndeclines. People get disgusted by it. They do not necessarily blame one \ncandidate or another when they see negative ads. It has the effect of \nsaying: Politics is such a dirty business that I don't want anything to \ndo with it. I am not going to encourage it, but I am not even going to \nvote.\n  That is my great concern and why I believe this amendment has such \nvalue. It is not to protect people who hold themselves out for public \noffice from being criticized. We understand that occurs if you hold \nyourself up for public office. We have hundreds of votes, and there are \nmany which divide us as to what is the proper course of action to take. \nSomeone may stand up and say: I disagree with Senator Dodd on how he \nstands on child care, or education issues. It is a perfectly legitimate \nactivity in a campaign.\n  We need the debate so people can have a better clarification. The \nauthors of this amendment, as I understand it, are in no way suggesting \nthat healthy debate and criticism of candidates ought to be removed \nfrom politics. They are saying, if you are going to do that, those who \nare making the criticism need to let people know from where it is \ncoming. They believe--and I think they are correct--that this will have \nthe dual effect of people being less inclined to attack people on a \npersonal level where their picture is going to be displayed; secondly, \nit will encourage\n\n[[Page S2694]]\n\nmore constructive criticism, which is perfectly legitimate and which we \nought to invite in a good campaign.\n  The effect of that goes to the very heart of what this amendment is \nlikely to do; that is, to encourage people to vote and participate.\n  I applaud both of my colleagues for this amendment because I think it \nwill encourage more people in the final analysis to engage in the \npolitical life of our country.\n  I mentioned yesterday how we were applauding, in a sense, that we had \ndone better than anticipated when 50 percent of the eligible voters in \nthis country voted in the last Presidential election. We thought that \nwas good news because it was better than what we had anticipated. What \na sad commentary it is that 50 percent of the eligible Americans who \nhave a right to choose who will be the President of the United States \ndo not participate despite all of the ads and activities. I suspect \nthat a significant percentage of that 50 percent stayed away not \nbecause they forgot, not because they were not interested in the \ndecisions that the next President might make, but I think they didn't \nparticipate because they were so disgusted by what they saw on \ntelevision, what they heard on radio, and what they saw being spent, \nwhich goes to the heart of what Senator Feingold and Senator McCain are \ntalking about and why we are debating campaign finance reform. To have \nthat discussion and not include this element would be a mistake.\n  I, again, applaud my colleagues for adding this. Again, I can't say \nfor certainty this will increase participation. But I think the \nAmerican public will applaud this effort and politics will be the \nbetter for it, in my view. Maybe we will see more people voting in the \nnext election because candidates will be more reluctant about saying \nsome of these things they wouldn't dare say otherwise about themselves, \nand articulate it in a sense by requiring that a photograph be included \nin that ad. I think they will be a little more cautious about the \nthings that have been said in campaigns in the past.\n  I applaud my colleagues' efforts. I am happy to yield to my colleague \nfrom Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend and thank our friends from Oregon \nand Maine for their amendment.\n  The bill before us is aimed at trying to close a soft money loophole, \nwhich has fueled the kind of negative TV ads which do not do justice to \nour democracy.\n  The unlimited contributions which have come into campaigns, directly \nand indirectly, have been one of the major sources for the horrendous \namount of negative attack ads which are inflicted upon our constituents \nin most of these elections.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill is trying to do something about closing that \nsoft money loophole. If we are going to restore credibility to the \nelectoral process, it is vitally important we close that soft money \nloophole. Hopefully, we will. Part of the answer, ultimately, is that \nwe require candidates for office who take out ads, if they want the \nlowest unit rate which is provided for in this McCain-Feingold \nlegislation, if they want to take advantage of that benefit which is \nconferred, that guarantee that is in the McCain-Feingold bill--they at \nleast put their name and their face at the end of the ad they are \nfunding.\n  To ask a candidate to do so is pretty fundamental for a benefit which \nis being conferred.\n  This is a very modest amendment. It is a very carefully crafted \namendment. It is not aimed at intruding on the message that is in that \ncommercial. It doesn't create a problem in terms of the message. It \ndoesn't seek to control that message. It says, if you want that lowest \nrate provided for in this law that we are guaranteeing to you, then you \nmust put your name and your face at the end of this ad for a few \nseconds so the people know who is paying for this ad; so that you can't \nhave some name of some citizens group put at the end of the ad which \nmasks or disguises who is paying for this ad. It is a very reasonable \nkind of requirement in exchange for that lowest unit rate.\n  I commend the sponsors of this amendment for the amendment. I want to \nsay one other thing.\n  I only wish it were possible to extend this to the ads that are put \non by outside groups--it is not possible constitutionally. I don't \nthink we are able to do that. I wish we could because so many of the \nads that are on television these days are not paid for by candidates \nbut are paid for with soft money, and are paid for by outside groups in \nthe form of so-called issue ads, which more often than not, about 98 \npercent of the time, indeed, are not issue ads at all but are ads that \nare clearly aimed at electing candidates and giving advantages to \ncandidates or attacking candidates.\n  This will do some significant good, in my judgment, because it at \nleast gets to the ads that are paid for by a candidate, or a \ncandidate's committee.\n  My only regret is--and I can't figure out a constitutional way yet--\nwe do not apply this same logic to the ads which are funded by outside \ngroups that are intended to help candidates get elected or to defeat \nother candidates. But, again, we should be grateful for the good that \ncan be accomplished while we seek to find ways to accomplish the same \nresult relative to the so-called issue ads of the outside groups.\n  So I commend my good friends from Oregon and Maine and the other \ncosponsors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield whatever time he may need to the \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. And I especially \nthank the Senators from Oregon and Maine for offering this amendment. \nIt is a pleasure to see this back because this is one of the original \nprovisions and ideas we tried to put forth in the original McCain-\nFeingold bill many years ago. In the process of negotiating and trying \nto get votes, it was one of the casualties that came off the bill as we \ntried to simplify it. But that was not because it was not a good idea. \nIt was always a good idea.\n  The Senator from Oregon has been diligent in mentioning this and \narguing for this over the years. I am extremely pleased that we finally \ngot the process where Senators, such as the Senator from Oregon, can \noffer his amendment. Finally--and it took us 5 years--here we are \ntalking about one of the three things that I find constituents complain \nabout in relation to campaigns.\n  First of all, they obviously say they are too expensive. We all know \nthat is one of the reasons we are doing this bill. Secondly, they say \nthe campaigns go on too long; you have to have ads all year, all the \ntime. But the third thing they say to me--and I assume the Senator from \nMaine and the Senator from Oregon have had the same experience--is they \nare so negative.\n  Of course, I believe fundamentally in the free speech right of people \nto say something negative anytime they want. But what this amendment \ndoes is make sure there is some accountability for that. So I welcome \nit. It is bipartisan. It is offered by two of the strongest reformers \nin the entire Senate. The voters deserve the chance to see the \ncandidates and know that the candidates sponsoring the ads support \nthe content and the tone of the ad. So it is an excellent bipartisan \namendment.\n\n  Just as we predicted, Senator McCain and I offered a bill that not \nonly is not a perfect bill, but it is a bill we hope will be improved \nand made better, more important, and more valuable by the amending \nprocess. This amendment does exactly that.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. For a question.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate the Senator yielding. I will be very brief.\n  I say to the Senator, I thank him for all the years he has toiled in \nthe vineyards on this issue. He and Senator McCain have been out week \nafter week for years. I was sworn in as Oregon's first new Senator in \nmore than 30 years on February 6, 1996, around noon. The first official \naction I took, as Oregon's first new Senator in more than 30 years, was \nto be a cosponsor of the McCain-Feingold legislation.\n  I just want the record to note that this Senator knows we do not get \nto this kind of opportunity by osmosis. It does not happen by accident. \nIt happens because we get two Senators such\n\n[[Page S2695]]\n\nas the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Arizona who, week \nafter week, year after year, do so much to make this action possible.\n  I want the Senator to know how much I appreciate all his leadership.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I appreciate that, Mr. President. I thank the Senator \nfrom Oregon.\n  As I look at these two Senators--Senator Collins from Maine and \nSenator Wyden from Oregon--there was a time when people were saying: \nYou only have two Republicans on the bill. It was a critical moment in \nthe history of this legislation when the Senator from Maine came on the \nbill. I remember when the Senator from Oregon came, and he made this \nhis first piece of legislation he would cosponsor. It actually gave me \na chance, for the first time in my life campaigning for this bill, to \ngo to Portland, OR, a beautiful city.\n  If I could somehow get myself to Maine for the first time, I could go \nto the other Portland and we could have this be the Portland-to-\nPortland amendment which, of course, reflects the tremendous reform \ntradition of both States, Maine and Oregon, in which Wisconsin joins as \nwell.\n  So, again, my thanks to both Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for \nhis very gracious comments. We would not be where we are today without \nhis tenacity in pushing for true campaign finance reform.\n  I want to respond, also, to the comments made by the Senator from \nConnecticut and the Senator from Michigan and thank them for their \nsupport of the Wyden-Collins proposal. Senator Dodd and Senator \nFeingold also raised a very important point, and that is, the deluge of \nnegative attack ads discourages people from voting and really turns off \nthe American public. This is exacerbated by the fact that a lot of \ntimes it is not evident who is sponsoring these ads, who is behind \nthese charges and allegations that are hurled particularly in the final \ndays of the campaign.\n  I believe the Snowe-Jeffords amendment will help in that regard and \nthat the amendment Senator Wyden and I are sponsoring today will make \nvery clear that when a candidate launches a negative ad attacking his \nopponent, that candidate will have to take responsibility for that ad.\n  It is important to note, however, that there is nothing wrong with a \ncandidate running an ad that discusses policy differences. Indeed, that \nis valuable to the political discourse and debate. And, indeed, as \nSenator Levin pointed out, there is nothing in our amendment that \nprevents a candidate from running an irresponsible attack ad that \nperhaps is a vicious attack on an opponent's character. But if that is \ndone--in either case--the candidate has to take responsibility for the \nad.\n  Under our proposal, the candidate's picture would appear at the end \nof the ad and the candidate would have to have a statement saying he or \nshe approved the ad in order to get the lowest broadcast rate. So we \nare not, in any way, attempting to regulate speech or attempting to \nimpose our ideas of what constitutes an appropriate ad. Rather, all we \nare doing is saying that if a candidate runs an ad that talks about his \nopponent, he has to own up to that ad. He has to clearly state that he \npaid for the ad, that he is responsible for its content.\n  I think that would have the very beneficial effect of making \ncandidates think twice before hurling accusations that perhaps are \nexaggerated or unfounded against an opponent. I believe it would help \nelevate the political debate and it would help curb some of the \negregious negative ads that offend all of us.\n  So I thank the Senator from Michigan, the Senator from Connecticut, \nand the Senator from Wisconsin for their support of this proposal. In \nparticular, I thank my colleague from Oregon for the opportunity to \nwork with him to craft what I think is a reasonable proposal, a modest \nbut important first step that will help improve the quality of our \ncampaigns.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent the time be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, are we under controlled time at this \npoint?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from \nOregon control the time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield myself 10 minutes on our side of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we have had a good debate on a number of \namendments this week. It has been very pleasant to cover a lot of \nground. We have made good progress on the bill. I hope we can finish \nwork on this bill next week, as our agreement in February contemplated, \nand as the majority leader has said he wanted. Getting a final up-or-\ndown vote on this legislation is what we set out to do, and it is what \nwe will do once Senators have had a chance to offer amendments and \nimprove the bill.\n  Sometimes when we spend a few hours on an amendment, we can get \nbogged down in the minutia. When I say ``minutia,'' I don't mean any \ndisrespect. This is very important. This is how the laws actually work. \nThis is how campaigns will be conducted. So we have to go through this \naction. But I think sometimes when people observe us from afar, or on \ntelevision, they wonder, what are we talking about? What is the big \npicture?\n  I want to take us back to why we are here in the first place. Why are \nwe spending 2 weeks on this issue? What is this bill all about? We are \nhere because we have a crisis of confidence in this country and in this \nCongress. We labor long and hard on legislation, and I am afraid the \npublic doesn't trust us to do the right thing. For example, here is a \nheadline in Business Week's February 26 issue: ``Tougher Bankruptcy \nLaws--Compliments of MBNA?''\n  The article says:\n\n       MBNA is about to hit pay dirt. New bankruptcy legislation \n     is on a fast track. Judiciary panels in the House and Senate \n     held perfunctory hearings, and a bill could be on the House \n     and Senate floors as early as late February.\n\n  The implication is clear that it is widely assumed the credit card \nissuers called the shots on the substance of the bankruptcy bill we \npassed right before we started this debate on campaign finance reform.\n  Isn't it troubling that people are so quick to assume the worst about \nthe work we do on this floor? That is why we are taking up this bill; \nwe have to repair some of that public trust. Our reputation is on the \nline. We aren't going to get a pass from the American people on this \none and, frankly, we don't deserve one. The appearance of corruption is \nrampant in our system and it touches virtually every issue that comes \nbefore us.\n  I know my friend from Oregon is familiar with this because we have \ntalked about it. That is why I have called the bankroll on the floor 30 \ntimes in less than 2 years. I do it because I think it is important \nwhen we debate a bill to acknowledge that millions and millions of \ndollars are given in an attempt to influence what we do. That is why \npeople give soft money. I don't think anyone would seriously try to \ndispute that.\n  I won't detail every bankroll here. It would actually take me all \nday. But let me review some of the issues they address to show how far \nreaching the problem really is. I have called the bankroll on mining on \npublic lands, the gun show loophole, the defense industry's support of \nthe Super Hornet and the F-22, the Y2K Liability Act, Passengers' Bill \nof Rights, MFN for China, PNTR for China, and, of course, the tobacco \nindustry. I have talked about agricultural interests, lobbying on an \nAgriculture appropriations bill, railroad interests, and lobbying on a \nTransportation appropriations bill. I have talked about contributions \nsurrounding the Financial Services Modernization Act, nuclear waste \npolicy,\n\n[[Page S2696]]\n\nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and the ergonomics issue. I have \nalso had the chance to call the bankroll on the Patients' Bill of \nRights twice, the Africa trade bill twice, and the oil royalties \namendment to the fiscal year 2000 Interior appropriations bill twice. I \nhave called the bankroll on three tax bills, four separate times, and \non our most recent legislation, the bankruptcy reform legislation.\n\n  People give soft money to influence the outcome of these issues. That \nis plain and simple. As long as we allow soft money to exist, we risk \ndamaging our credibility when we make decisions about the issues the \npeople elected us to make. They sent us here to wrestle with some very \ntough issues. They have vested us with the power to make decisions and \nto have a truly profound impact on their lives. That is a \nresponsibility that every one of us takes seriously.\n  But, today, when we weigh the pros and cons of legislation, many \npeople think we also weigh the size of the contributions we get from \ninterests on both sides of the issue. When those contributions can be a \nmillion dollars, or even more, it seems obvious to most people that we \nwill too often reward our biggest donors.\n  That is the assumption people make, and we let them make it. Every \ntime we have had the chance to close the soft money loophole, this body \nhas faltered. If we can't pass this bill, history will remember that \nthis Senate faced a great test and we failed; that the people had \naccused us of corruption and, in our failure to pass a real reform \nbill, we actually confirmed their worst fear.\n  Fortunately, the bill before us today offers a different path. If we \ncan support the modest reforms in this bill, we can show the public we \nunderstand that the current system does not do our democracy justice. \nThis is just a modest bill. It is not sweeping. It is not comprehensive \nreform. It only seeks to address the biggest loopholes in our system.\n  The soft money ban is the centerpiece of this bill. Our legislation \nshuts down the soft money system, prohibiting all soft money \ncontributions to the national political parties from corporations, \nlabor unions, and wealthy individuals. State parties that are permitted \nunder State law to accept these unregulated contributions would be \nprohibited from spending them on activities relating to federal \nelections, and federal candidates and officeholders fortunately and \nfinally, would be prohibited from raising soft money under our bill. \nThat is a very significant provision because the fact that we in the \nCongress, those who are elected to Congress, are doing the asking is \nwhat I believe and many people believe gives this system an air of \nextortion, as well as bribery.\n  McCain-Feingold-Cochran also addresses the issue ad loophole, which \ncorporations and unions use to skirt the federal election law. This \nprovision, originally crafted by Senator Snowe and Senator Jeffords, \ntreats corporations and unions fairly and equally. I want to be clear. \nSnowe-Jeffords does not prohibit any election ad, nor does it place \nlimits on spending by outside organizations, but it will give the \npublic crucial information about the election activities of independent \ngroups, and it will prevent corporate and union treasury money from \nbeing spent to influence elections.\n  Senators Snowe and Jeffords described this provision of their bill \nearlier in the week. As this debate proceeds, we may debate whether it \nshould be strengthened or even removed from the bill altogether. I \nbelieve the Snowe-Jeffords provision is a fair compromise and the right \nbalance. It fairly balances legitimate first amendment concerns with \nthe goal of enforcing the law that prohibits unions and corporations \nfrom spending money in connection with Federal elections.\n  I am sure most of my colleagues are aware of the serious political \ncrisis underway as we speak in the nation of India. Journalists posing \nas arms dealers shot videos with hidden cameras on which politicians \nand defense officials were seen accepting cash and favors in return for \ndefense contracts. Those pictures have caused a huge scandal. The \nIndian defense minister has resigned, and we do not know yet how great \nthe repercussions will be.\n  One thing that struck me as I read the news reports of these events \nwas two of the people caught on tape were party leaders, including the \nleader of the ruling party, the BJP, Mr. Bangaru Laxman. Let me read \nfrom an AP story of March 16:\n\n       Laxman denied that the journalists identified themselves to \n     him as defense contractors or discussed weapons sales. He \n     said they were presented as businessmen and that accepting \n     money for the party is not illegal in India.\n\n  I am not going to say that what is happening in India is the same as \nthe system we have in the United States, and I am certainly not going \nto comment on the guilt or innocence of any party leader or political \nofficial in that sovereign country. But the Government of India is \nhanging by a thread based on possibly corrupt payments of a few \nthousand dollars by people posing as defense contractors.\n  In our country, we have literally hundreds of millions of dollars \nflowing to our political parties from business and labor interests of \nall kinds. And our defense, like Mr. Laxman's is, ``it's legal.'' We \nhave a system of legalized bribery, a system of legalized extortion, in \nthis country. But legal or not, like the videotaped payments in India, \nthis system look awful. It may be legal, but it looks awful.\n  Our debate this week has shown time and time again that we have a \nstrong majority in this body that wants to pass reform. We are ready to \ndo it. I am eager to continue our work, and get the job done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Dodd is not here. How much time does \nthe Senator request, 5 minutes?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I request not more than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 138, As Modified\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for \npointing out to the Senator from Oregon and myself that in drafting \nthis amendment we erred.\n  I ask unanimous consent to modify my amendment to correct the \nmistake, and I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, reads as follows:\n\n       On page 37, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. LIMITATION ON AVAILABILITY OF LOWEST UNIT CHARGE FOR \n                   FEDERAL CANDIDATES ATTACKING OPPOSITION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 315(b) of the Communications Act \n     of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 315(b)), as amended by this Act, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) Content of broadcasts.--\n       ``(A) In general.--In the case of a candidate for Federal \n     office, such candidate shall not be entitled to receive the \n     rate under paragraph (1)(A) for the use of any broadcasting \n     station unless the candidate provides written certification \n     to the broadcast station that the candidate (and any \n     authorized committee of the candidate) shall not make any \n     direct reference to another candidate for the same office, in \n     any broadcast using the rights and conditions of access under \n     this Act, unless such reference meets the requirements of \n     subparagraph (C) or (D).\n       ``(B) Limitation on charges.--If a candidate for Federal \n     office (or any authorized committee of such candidate) makes \n     a reference described in subparagraph (A) in any broadcast \n     that does not meet the requirements of subparagraph (C) or \n     (D), such candidate shall not be entitled to receive the rate \n     under paragraph (1)(A) for such broadcast or any other \n     broadcast during any portion of the 45-day and 60-day periods \n     described in paragraph (1)(A), that occur on or after the \n     date of such broadcast, for election to such office.\n       ``(C) Television broadcasts.--A candidate meets the \n     requirements of this subparagraph if, in the case of a \n     television broadcast, at the end of such broadcast there \n     appears simultaneously, for a period no less than 4 seconds--\n       ``(i) a clearly identifiable photographic or similar image \n     of the candidate; and\n       ``(ii) a clearly readable printed statement, identifying \n     the candidate and stating that the candidate has approved the \n     broadcast and that the candidate's authorized committee paid \n     for the broadcast.\n       ``(D) Radio broadcasts.--A candidate meets the requirements \n     of this subparagraph if, in the case of a radio broadcast, \n     the broadcast includes a personal audio statement by the \n     candidate that identifies the candidate, the office the \n     candidate is seeking, and indicates that the candidate has \n     approved the broadcast.\n       ``(E) Certification.--Certifications under this section \n     shall be provided and certified as\n\n[[Page S2697]]\n\n     accurate by the candidate (or any authorized committee of the \n     candidate) at the time of purchase.\n       ``(F) Definitions.--For purposes of this paragraph, the \n     terms `authorized committee' and `Federal office' have the \n     meanings given such terms by section 301 of the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 431).''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 315(b)(1)(A) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 315(b)(1)(A)), as \n     amended by this Act, is amended by inserting ``subject to \n     paragraph (3),'' before ``during the forty-five days''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to broadcasts made after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I will briefly explain. The Senator from \nKentucky pointed out that in drafting the amendment, we inadvertently \ndeleted the requirement that there be a disclaimer that the ad is paid \nfor by the candidate's authorized committee. We did not in any way \nintend to remove that disclaimer requirement.\n  The legislation I sent to the desk makes it clear that the \ncandidate's ad has to include the statement that the ad was paid for by \nthe candidate's authorized committee.\n  I thank the Senator from Kentucky for pointing out that error and \nallowing us to correct it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Maine and the \nSenator from Oregon, we have had an opportunity to review the amendment \nand discuss it on the floor. As everyone knows, current law already \nrequires certain things of the candidates, but this amendment is a \nuseful addition that codifies and clarifies the law.\n  Consequently, I am happy to support it and see no particular need for \na rollcall vote unless there is a desire to do so on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Oregon 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will be brief. It has been interesting that on the \nfloor of the Senate today no one has spoken in defense of negative ads. \nThe very ads that the media consultants believe are most successful or \nmost likely to win elections have not won a defense. I guess the media \nconsultants in this country are going to have to go back to school if \nthis proposal, as it makes its way down the gauntlet, becomes law, as \nthe Senator from Maine and I hope to make possible.\n  The fact is that this is a stand-by-your-ad requirement. This is a \nproposal that makes it clear that to get that lowest unit rate, you \nhave to be held personally accountable.\n  What the Senator from Maine did is useful. We believed we had made it \nclear in terms of linking it to the appropriate Federal election \nstatute. What we just did makes it even more so.\n  I, too, thank the Senator from Kentucky. This is an area in which I \nhave had a special interest since what I think was the harshest \ncampaign in Oregon history in 1995 and 1996. My friend and colleague, \nSenator Smith, and I believe that race was just completely out of hand. \nNeither of us could recognize the kinds of commercials that were being \nrun by the end.\n  This is an opportunity to draw a line in the sand and to say the \nSenate wants to make it clear that we are not going to let candidates \ndisown these corrosive, negative commercials. They are not going to be \nable to hide any longer if this becomes law.\n  I express my thanks again to the Senator from Maine.\n  There are a number of staff who have put in a huge number of hours: \nJeff Gagne and Carole Grunberg of my staff, Michael Bopp with Senator \nCollins, Linda Gustitas with Senator Levin, Bob Schiff with Senator \nFeingold, and Andrea LaRue with Senator Daschle. All of them \ncontributed to this effort to make sure that in this country we are no \nlonger subsidizing dirty campaigning. That is what happens today. We \nare subsidizing the local hardware store owner and the local restaurant \nowner is subsidizing dirty campaigns, and we are taking a step away \nfrom that.\n  With thanks to my colleague from Maine, with a pledge to the Senator \nfrom Kentucky to continue to work with him in this area, I express my \nthanks to him for taking this by voice vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, and the Senator from Maine, Ms. \nCollins, numbered 138, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 138), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment \nwas agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Connecticut \nhave graciously consented to allow the Senator from New Mexico until 1 \no'clock for morning business for the introduction of legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me say to all Members of the Senate, the next \namendment will be on this side, offered by the assistant majority \nleader, Senator Nickles. It will be laid down around 1 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New Mexico be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico will be recognized \nfor 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Reid, from \nNevada, and my friend and colleague from Kentucky, also, for their \ncourtesy in allowing me to speak as in morning business.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bingaman pertaining to the introduction of S. 596 \nand S. 597 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator leaves the floor, I extend my \ncongratulations to him for the work that he has put into this \nlegislation. I have been involved with just a little tiny bit of it. He \nhas spent as much time with me as he has with other Members making sure \nthat everyone who had questions about this legislation had their \nquestions answered.\n  I feel very comfortable with Senator Bingaman being the ranking \nmember of this most important committee. We in Nevada believe that \nproblems in California are just a little ways behind us. We are hopeful \nand confident this much needed legislation will move quickly out of his \ncommittee on to the floor so we have an opportunity to debate it.\n  So, again, I appreciate very much the work of my friend from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. President, there is no one on the floor in relation to the bill. \nIf Senator Nickles comes to offer his amendment, Senator Stabenow has \nindicated she would be most happy to give up the floor. She needs 5 \nminutes to speak as in morning business. I certainly do not want to \ntake advantage of anyone. I do not think I am. I ask unanimous consent \nthat she be allowed to speak for 5 minutes, or until the assistant \nmajority leader comes to the floor to offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chair and Senator Reid. I echo Senator \nReid's comments of congratulations to Senator Bingaman for his \nexcellent work in forging ahead a very visionary energy proposal \ncovering so many important aspects for American families and \nbusinesses.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Stabenow are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Ms. STABENOW. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2698]]\n\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 139\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator Nickles' amendment is next and \nhe will be over in a while. In his absence, I send his amendment, on \nbehalf of himself and Senator Gregg, to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. Nickles, \n     for himself and Mr. Gregg, proposes an amendment numbered \n     139.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                    (Purpose: To strike section 304)\n\n       Beginning on page 35, strike line 8 and all that follows \n     through page 37, line 14.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the debate on this amendment will begin \nshortly. In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to reserve time on this \namendment because I don't know whether Senator Nickles will want to use \nall of the time or not. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time not be charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, after having \nchecked with my friend from Kentucky, that the Senator from Washington \nbe recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n\n                     amendment no. 138, as modified\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank Senator Wyden and Senator \nCollins for offering this amendment that I think truly improves the \nMcCain-Feingold bill.\n  In the 2000 election, Seattle and Tacoma were the second and third \nlargest markets for political advertising.\n  The Seattle Post Intelligencer noted earlier this week that campaign \nads ``rained down on--or bludgeoned, according to some--viewers \nthroughout the late summer and fall. And this wasn't an intermittent, \ndrip torture kind of rain that Seattle residents know so well. It was a \ndeluge, a constant unavoidable torrent, stretching across three solid \nmonths.''\n  With this constant torrent of negative advertising, it is no wonder \nthat voting among 18 to 24 year olds has dropped from 50% to only 32%--\na much steeper decline than overall turnout.\n  Part of the reason for this disaffection with voting and with \npolitics is undoubtedly due to negative attack advertising.\n  This amendment makes candidates accountable for those ads.\n  By requiring a picture and a readable statement that the candidate \napproved the ad, it would certainly make candidates think twice before \nrunning negative ads.\n  By requiring candidates to take responsibility, the amendment also \nhelps the viewer.\n  It lets the viewer know who is paying for those ads, not just text \nthat they have to run up close to the screen to see.\n  It gives the viewer some of the information that they need as a voter \nto make a fully informed decision about the candidates.\n  Studies by the Annenberg Center for Communications have found that \nadvertising that includes a personal appearance by the candidate is \nmore accurate, less negative, and is received more positively by \nvoters.\n  This amendment also only deals with ads paid for by candidates.\n  It does not address the problem of out of control issue ads.\n  But one of the things that will happen as a result of this amendment \nis that there will be a clear contrast created between ads sponsored by \ncandidates and issue ads that are outside the candidates own control\n  This amendment is a step in the right direction. I am pleased to \nsupport it and I thank my colleagues for offering it today.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 139\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in the underlying bill it is suggested \nthat there is a codification of the Beck decision. In fact, it is just \nthe opposite. McCain-Feingold does not codify Beck; it eviscerates \nBeck. The so-called Beck codification in McCain-Feingold is a big win \nfor big labor. It does two things the unions love: No. 1, it will let \nunions keep more of the fees nonunion members pay to unions, and, No. \n2, it will make it much harder for those seeking a refund to get one \nbecause it takes away their existing right to pursue relief in Federal \ncourt and forces them into a burdensome, time-consuming, and hostile \nadministrative process.\n  The Nickles amendment, of course, will simply take out the so-called \nBeck codification in the underlying McCain-Feingold bill and go back to \nthe Supreme Court. In the Beck decision, the Supreme Court affirmed a \nfourth circuit opinion that objecting nonunion members required to pay \nagency fees as a condition of employment were entitled under section 8 \nof the National Labor Relations Act to receive a refund of the pro rata \nshare of their fees expended on activities unrelated to the union's \nrole as ``exclusive bargaining representative,'' which consisted of \n``collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance \nadjustment.''\n  The Supreme Court affirmed the fourth circuit ruling that, as a \nmatter of law, the fees unrelated to ``collective bargaining, contract \nadministration, and grievance adjustment'' that the unions had to \nrefund to objecting nonunion members, along with any accrued interest, \nincluded not only fees for political and lobbying activities but also \nunion community service projects, union charitable donations, union \norganizing, supporting strikes by other unions, and administrative \ncosts related to the above activities. All of those items were entitled \nto be refunded to agency shop nonunion members who requested such a \nrefund.\n  In the original Beck case, the court found that 79 percent of the \nobjecting nonunion member's fees had to be refunded because only 21 \npercent was used for activities related to collective bargaining, \ncontract administration, and grievance adjustment.\n  The Beck provision in McCain-Feingold limits objecting nonunion \nmembers to getting their fees reduced only by the pro rata share of \nsuch fees spent on political and lobbying activities that the union \ndeems ``unrelated to collective bargaining.''\n  According to the unions, all of their activities related to \nlegislation at the State and Federal level, including health care, \njudicial and executive appointments, as well as most State ballot \ninitiatives, are ``related to collective bargaining.'' Thus, unions \ncould continue to use nonmember dues for such activities under McCain-\nFeingold, which is great for them because they cannot use nonunion \nmember fees for most of those things under existing law.\n  McCain-Feingold will also allow unions to keep and use the portion of \nan objecting nonmember's agency fees spent on other activities that the \nBeck court affirmed were unrelated to ``collective bargaining, contract \nadministration, and grievance adjustment,'' such as a union's \ncharitable contributions and a union's support of a strike by another \nunion.\n  Thus, McCain-Feingold's Beck provision is really bogus. Instead of \ncodifying Beck, it eviscerates Beck by diminishing the scope of the \nrefund the\n\n[[Page S2699]]\n\nSupreme Court directed for objecting nonmembers required to pay agency \nfees as a condition of employment.\n  This is not the only way in which McCain-Feingold's bogus Beck \nprovision is a big gift to big labor. Unions would also love it if we \npassed this bogus Beck provision because it would close the courthouse \ndoors for nonunion members seeking relief from confiscation of their \ndues for purposes unrelated to collective bargaining, contract \nnegotiation, and grievance adjustment.\n  It does this by stating that a union's failure to adhere to the bogus \nBeck provision ``shall be an unfair labor practice'' under the National \nLabor Relations Act. Unfair labor practice claims fall within the \nexclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board.\n  A recent piece in Roll Call noted that:\n\n       The National Labor Relations Board [has] for 13 years, \n     under both Republican and Democratic administrations, \n     displayed an intense bias against workers who assert their \n     Beck Rights.\n\n  Make no mistake. Saying that nonunion members seeking to enforce \ntheir Beck rights can only pursue an unfair labor practices claim \nalters existing law. Under existing law, nonunion members can pursue an \nunfair labor practices claim or they can avoid the NLRB's time-\nconsuming, hostile and burdensome administrative process by going \ndirectly to Federal court against a labor union.\n  If we enact the bogus Beck provision in McCain-Feingold nonunion \nworkers will no longer be able to go directly to court and seek \njudicial enforcement of their rights as the plaintiff in the original \nBeck case did.\n  Instead, their only recourse would be to navigate a tedious, complex \nand hostile administrative process that, according to documents from \nthe NLRB itself, regularly takes years.\n  Unions would love this because they know that giving nonunion members \nno alternative to this administrative process will greatly deter \npeople's ability and willingness to seek refunds pursuant to Beck.\n  If we adopt McCain-Feingold's bogus-Beck provision, the other \nportions of Beck will not remain.\n  Advocates of McCain-Feingold are using a completely untrue and \nbaseless argument to assuage people concerned about their big gift to \nbig labor in the form of a bogus-Beck codification.\n  The argument is: Well, we just wanted to focus on the political part \nof Beck and, if we pass this, the rest of Beck will remain.\n  This is, of course, untrue because Beck was a decision in which the \nSupreme Court was interpreting a Federal statute, specifically section \n8 of the National Labor Relations Act.\n  At the beginning of the Supreme Court's decision in Beck, Justice \nBrennan, the author of the decision, made clear it was statutory \ninterpretation case, not a case about a constitutional right.\n  Quoting the decision:\n\n       The statutory question presented in this case, then, is \n     whether this financial core includes the obligation to \n     support union activities beyond those germane to collective \n     bargaining, contract administration, and grievance \n     adjustment. We think it does not.\n\n  And at the end of the case, in stating the Court's holding, Justice \nBrennan again made clear that Beck was a statutory interpretation case. \nAgain, quoting from the decision.\n\n       We conclude that [section] 8(a)(3) [of the National Labor \n     Relations Act] . . . authorizes the exaction of only those \n     fees and dues necessary to performing the duties of an \n     exclusive bargaining representative.\n\n  The significance of the indisputable fact that Beck was a case in \nwhich the Supreme Court interpreted a statute enacted by Congress \nrather than a portion of the Constitution is that any subsequent \ncodification by Congress in light of the Court's interpretation will \ncompletely override the court interpretation.\n  Every lawyer knows that when a court interprets a statute and the \nlegislature subsequently enacts a law clarifying what that statute \nmeans, as the bogus-Beck provision does, the court's interpretation is \ncompletely displaced by that statutory action.\n  Therefore, no serious person can give any weight to the assertion \nthat somehow any part of the Supreme Court's interpretation of section \n8 of the National Labor Relations Act in Beck will remain once we pass \nMcCain-Feingold's big gift to big labor--the evisceration of Beck.\n  Senator Nickles, as I indicated, will be over shortly to speak on \nthis amendment. Even though he may demand a rollcall vote, we \nunderstand that the proponents of the underlying bill are prepared to \naccept or vote for this provision, and we are glad to hear that. We \nthink restoring the Beck case to its original language is certainly \nappropriate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the manager of this bill, Senator Dodd, is \noff the floor doing other Senate business. He told me before he left \nthat he would not accept this amendment until there were negotiations. \nHe has a statement he wishes to make, and there are others who wish to \nspeak on this amendment.\n  In light of the fact that no one is here, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum and ask that the time be equally charged against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will speak briefly on the pending \namendment. I thank my friend and colleague, Senator McConnell, for \nsending this amendment to the desk on behalf of myself and Senator \nGregg.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to strike the language that is in \nthe bill on page 35, section 304. Under the bill, it says \n``codification of the Beck decision.'' When I initially heard that Beck \nwould be codified, I thought that was good. I support the Beck decision \nand would like to see it codified. When I read the language, I found \nout it did not codify the Beck decision. In fact, it rewrote the Beck \ndecision, undermined it in many ways, and led me to the conclusion that \nwe would be better off having no language rather than this language.\n  I very much appreciate the cooperation I have received from Senator \nMcCain and Senator Feingold, who have agreed to drop this language, and \nas I also mentioned, Senator Gregg from New Hampshire, who has been \nworking on this. Actually, we were both going to fight a big battle to \nstrike this language. We thought that once people reviewed this \nlanguage and contrasted it to the Beck decision, they would find out \nthey are not the same and this wasn't actually a codification of the \nBeck decision in many different respects.\n  I am pleased. I think everybody will be on board for striking this \nlanguage. I could go into the details regarding the difference in \nnotification in Beck, because we think all employees, union and agency \nfee employees, should be notified. Under the pending language, it would \nonly be those who are agency fee members who would be notified.\n  The Beck decision was very clear. The only instances in which a \nperson would be compelled to contribute would be when they directly \ngermane to collective bargaining, contract administration, and \ngrievance adjustment. In other words, in those instances that are \ndirectly involved in negotiating contracts, solving enforcement of the \ncontracts, and solving grievances, then a person would be compelled to \ncontribute.\n  Under the language we had in the pending bill, it was much, much \nbroader than that. Individuals could be compelled to pay in many \ninstances determined by the union, and what might be regarded as \nunrelated to collective bargaining, they might define everything as \nrelated to collective bargaining and there would be no reimbursements \nfor employees who went through the refund process.\n  Again, I think we are better off having no language in it than to \nhave the language that is in section 304. The purpose of this amendment \nis to strike section 304, and I am pleased that our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle have come to that conclusion.\n  I look forward to this section being removed from the bill, making, \nin my opinion, a significant improvement in the underlying legislation.\n\n[[Page S2700]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald).

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Democratic whip, \nMr. Reid, for his courtesy. He is always very courteous and attentive \nto the needs and wishes of his colleagues. I also thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, for his \ncharacteristic courtesy as well.\n  May I say I merely sought the floor because the Senate was in a \nquorum and had been in a quorum for quite a while; otherwise, I would \nnot have come at this time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak out of order, if the \ntime is being charged to both sides on the campaign finance \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd are located in Today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/22/senate-section/article/S2700-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2700-S2717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN REFORM ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will be supporting the Nickles amendment \nbecause I think it is the wiser course to leave this issue at this time \nto the courts and to the NLRB.\n  I will say a few things about the Beck provision in the bill. I \nbelieve this is a different perspective than what we have heard from \nthe Senator from Kentucky. However, we reached the same conclusion, \nthat it is best to leave Beck to the courts and to the NLRB rather than \nto try to see if we can distill or characterize the Beck decision at \nthis time.\n  Mr. President, it was said that the codification of Beck or the Beck \nprovision in this bill is the opposite of a codification. But, Section \n304 of McCain-Feingold goes to the heart of the Beck decision, that is, \nwhether a nonunion member can opt out of paying dues for political \nactivities. The Supreme Court says ``yes'' in Beck, and section 304 \nwould make that right to opt out statutory law. That is the technical \nholding in Beck that a nonunion member in a bargaining unit can opt \nout. It is that holding which is at the heart of Beck which is also at \nthe heart of the provision in section 304.\n  We don't believe section 304 would make it harder for nonunion \nmembers to exercise their Beck right; that, we believe, is not the case \nand we know it is not the intent.\n  The National Labor Relations Board has told unions how they can and \nshould implement Beck. The NLRB said in the California Saw and Knife \nWorks case, in 1995, the following: First, before a union can require a \nnonunion member to pay what is called an agency fee, which is similar \nto union dues for a union member, the union must tell the nonmember \nemployee of his or her right to object to paying for activities ``not \ngermane to the union's duties as bargaining agent,'' and his or her \nright to ``obtain a reduction in fees for such act.''\n  The nonmember employee can then file an objection, and the union must \nthen charge the nonmember objecting employee an agency fee reflecting \nonly that portion of the agency fee that represents the cost of \nactivities related to collective bargaining.\n  The NLRB also requires that the nonmember objecting employee must \nalso be given an explanation of the calculation made by the union, an \nopportunity to challenge the calculation, and an independent arbiter to \ndetermine the challenge.\n  These requirements have been in force since 1995 and have been \nvigorously enforced.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill incorporates both the Beck decision and that \nNLRB decision. The McCain-Feingold bill, first, makes it an unfair \nlabor practice for a union not to provide the ``objection procedure'' \nlaid out in the bill for nonmember employees. The objection procedure \nin the bill includes the same elements required by the NLRB, including \nannual notice to nonunion employees about the objection procedure; the \npersons eligible to invoke the procedure; and how, when, and where an \nobjection can be filed. The bill provides an opportunity to file an \nobjection to paying for union expenses ``supporting political \nactivities unrelated to collective bargaining.'' One opportunity must \ninclude filing an objection by mail and, if an objection is filed, the \nreduction in the amount of the agency fee by an amount that \n``reasonably reflects the ratio that the organization's expenditures \nsupporting political activities unrelated to collective bargaining \nbears to such organization's total expenditure.''\n  The union must also provide, as the NLRB decisions have required, an \nexplanation of the calculations made by the union, including \ncalculating the amount of union expenditures supporting political \nactivities unrelated to collective bargaining.\n  That is the provision in the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  Separate from the provision in the McCain-Feingold bill, any union \nemployee who doesn't want to pay for a union's political activity \nthrough his or her membership dues can terminate his or her membership \nwith the union and, like an objecting nonunion employee, seek a \nreduction in the agency fee of that sum which represents the amount \nspent on political activity.\n  So I wanted to clarify the provision in this bill. But our conclusion \non the amendment of Senator Nickles is really the same. It is best to \nleave this determination of the rights of nonunion members, and the \nmeaning and fleshing out of the Beck decision relative to those rights, \nto the courts and to the NLRB. It doesn't belong on this bill.\n  So we reach the same conclusion. We don't have the same analysis of \nthe wording of the bill and the meaning and the completeness of it or \nthe accuracy of it, obviously. We have differences on that. But the \nconclusion is the same. The intent of the bill was to incorporate Beck, \nbut, I think we will be better served if in fact the bill, then, is \nsilent on this subject and we leave it up to the NLRB and the courts to \nmake that determination, as to the meaning and implementation steps for \nBeck.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe after discussions with \nSenator Dodd we are ready to announce that there will be a vote at \n3:30. I ask unanimous consent that the time between now and 3:30 be \nequally divided and that a vote occur on the Nickles amendment at that \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me yield 4 minutes to my colleague from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I also have no problem with the \namendment proposed by the Senator from Oklahoma. I appreciate the \nopportunity to meet with him today. He made his case, and, in a spirit \nthat I hope will continue to permeate this Chamber, we listened to what \nhe had to say and agreed that perhaps the best course, as the Senator \nfrom Michigan suggested, is to delete this provision from the bill.\n  I also appreciate the fact the Senator from Oklahoma has indicated to \nme, at least in terms of his amendments on the bill, that this will \nconclude the so-called paycheck protection part of this debate on \ncampaign finance reform. It is in recognition of the fact that the \nvotes are not there to include a paycheck protection provision that \nwould be directed only at labor or even ones that would include both \nlabor and corporations. I appreciate that assurance from the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma because I know he feels very strongly about this. But \nthis is the nature of the process. We do need to move on to other \nissues.\n\n[[Page S2701]]\n\n  There really is no need to debate the question of whether section 304 \ndoes or does not codify the Beck decision. The only reason this \nlanguage is in the bill is that the Senator from Kentucky and the \nmajority leader in the past have insisted for years that campaign \nfinance reform legislation was not complete without a provision to deal \nwith the activity of organized labor.\n  Proponents of that view, of course, offered the so-called paycheck \nprotection provision as their solution. In fact, I remember a few years \nago when we reached an agreement to debate campaign finance reform, the \nmajority leader introduced a base bill for that debate, and his entire \nbill was the paycheck protection provision that is not prevailing in \nthis discussion today.\n  No changes to our current corrupt soft money system were proposed--\njust paycheck protection. Paycheck protection--or, as I like to call \nit, paycheck deception--has always been a poison pill for reform. It is \nan unfair and unnecessary attack on organized labor. But we were \nwilling to include in the bill a provision that purported to reflect \ncurrent law with respect to fees paid by nonunion members in lieu of \ndues. So we added section 304.\n  Even though this has been in the McCain-Feingold bill for 3\\1/2\\ \nyears, we are told that from the point of view of those who favor \npaycheck protection, the current law is preferable to this section in \nour bill.\n  In light of that history, I have no problem with removing the \nprovision because the issue really doesn't belong, and never really \nbelonged, in the campaign finance legislation. The whole question of \nhow labor unions collect and use dues money from their members is a \nmatter of Federal labor law, really, not Federal election law.\n  I am pleased to support the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma. I \nthink and hope this will bring an end to the amendments we have seen \nfor years and years that are aimed at interfering with the internal \nworkings of labor unions and the relationship between a union and its \nmembership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support the amendment. I think it is a \ngood thing to happen. I think maybe we have taken way too much time on \nit since basically everybody is in agreement.\n  I point out to my colleagues again, we still have a lot of pending \namendments. We would like to get through them. There are some of them \nthat will not take a maximum of 3 hours. There are some we can complete \nin a relatively short period of time.\n  The worst of all worlds is for us to continue to make the steady \nprogress we have been making but run out of time because there are \nvarious commitments next week that people have. So I hope we can not \nonly move forward with the amending process--we have spent a heck of a \nlot of time in quorum calls, and also with, albeit important, speeches \nand comments that do not have anything to do with the bill, the \nlegislation we are addressing.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues who have amendments, please let Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Dodd know so we can try to set up an orderly \nprocess for completion of the legislation at the appropriate time next \nweek.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator McCain and \nSenator Feingold for their acceptance of this amendment. I think it is \nimportant to strike this language, that section 304 which purports to \ncodify the Beck decision. I will just read a direct quote from the Beck \ndecision. It says:\n\n       The statutory question presented in this case, is whether \n     this ``financial core'' includes the obligation to support \n     union activities beyond those germane to collective \n     bargaining, contract administration, and grievance \n     adjustment.\n\n  We think it does not. In other words, what Beck says is the only \nthing somebody would have to pay for--have their dues taken away from \nthem without their consent--is to pay for negotiation for contract \ncollective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance \nprocedures, if someone has a grievance. That is the only thing. They \nwere very clear what the language was. And the reason I and Senator \nGregg--who, I might mention, is a key sponsor--objected was because \nthis language went much further.\n  I didn't want people to misunderstand and say, well, we are codifying \nBeck, or we are clarifying and codifying Supreme Court decisions where \nbasically we would be rewriting the Supreme Court decision. That is the \nreason I raised it. I very much appreciate the comments of our \ncolleagues who have said that wasn't the intent and we can drop this \nlanguage.\n  My colleague from Wisconsin asked me how many more paycheck \namendments there would be. I wrote the paycheck protection amendment \noriginally because a union person came to me and said: I don't want my \nmoney taken away from me and used for political purposes for which I \ntotally disagree.\n  It happens to be that 40 percent of union members vote Republican who \ndon't agree with some of the national agenda of their party. This \nindividual from Claremore, OK, brought it to my attention. That is the \nreason I sponsored the amendment.\n  Yesterday there was an amendment proposed that had a paycheck \nprotection provision, and, according to the media, it was completely \nunworkable. As Senator Kennedy pointed out, dealing with corporations \nand shareholders is not the same thing. Being a shareholder is not the \nsame thing as being a wage earner having money--maybe $25 a month--\ntaken away from their paycheck. It is not the same thing, whether you \nbuy shares of General Electric or Cisco, which may not have been a good \nidea the last few months. But, anyway, there is a difference in being a \nshareholder.\n  I didn't think that amendment was workable. Regretfully, I voted \nagainst it. I didn't want to, but I felt compelled to because I didn't \nthink it was workable.\n  I am trying to look at bite-size improvements that can be made in \nthis bill. I think removing this one section is an improvement in the \nbill, and I very much appreciate the cooperation of my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment. It is not my intention to offer any other \npaycheck-related amendments on this bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Nickles, has \nproposed that we remove Section 304 from McCain-Feingold. Senator \nNickles has further committed that this will be the last amendment he \nwill offer on questions relating to union use of dues or fees for \npolitical purposes.\n  Section 304 of McCain-Feingold, entitled ``Codification of Beck \nDecision,'' would require unions to establish procedures for workers to \nobject to paying dues that would go toward political activity. Unions \nwould be required to notify workers of their rights; to reduce the fees \npaid by any worker who makes an objection; and to provide an \nexplanation of their calculations.\n  Some of my colleagues claim that Section 304 expands upon and does \nnot, in fact, codify Beck. My colleague, Senator McConnell, for \nexample, asserts that McCain-Feingold goes beyond Beck by authorizing \nunions to charge objecting non-members for things that Beck clearly \nprohibited, such as community service projects, charitable donations, \nlobbying activities, and union organizing. Beck, however, did nothing \nof the sort.\n  The precise holding of Beck, and I quote, is that the National Labor \nRelations Act ``authorizes the exaction of only those fees and dues \nnecessary to `performing the duties of an exclusive representative of \nthe employees in dealing with the employer on labor-management issues.' \n'' That is it. Consistent with standard practice under Supreme Court \nlabor law holdings, Beck left development of all the details including \nwhich expenses are related to the ``duties of an exclusive \nrepresentative,'' or what procedures unions must develop to the \nNational Labor Relations Board and the courts. It did not hold that a \nunion's charitable contributions, organizing expenses and the like are \nnot related to collective bargaining. Nor did it say that lobbying \nactivities could not be related to collective bargaining. In fact, in a \ncase called Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Association, decided in 1991, the \nSupreme Court held precisely the opposite. It stated that, even under \nthe strict first amendment standards that apply to Government \nemployment, objectors\n\n[[Page S2702]]\n\nmay be charged for ``lobbying activities relate[d] . . . to the \nratification or implementation of'' a collective bargaining agreement. \nMy Republican colleagues cannot codify their view of what the law \nshould be by saying that Beck made it the law. That is simply not what \nBeck did.\n  Some of my colleagues across the aisle also claim that there is a \ndifference between the Beck holding--that unions may require only those \ndues necessary to support collective bargaining--and the McCain-\nFeingold formulation--that unions may not require dues for political \nactivities unrelated to collective bargaining. This is a distinction \nwithout a difference.\n\n  The effects of Beck and McCain-Feingold are exactly the same. The \nNLRB and the courts will interpret the requirements of the law--and \ntheir results will be the same--whether Section 304 is included in the \nbill or not. Thus, the NLRB and the courts will determine whether \npayments made by a union are related to collective bargaining or not. \nIf they are, all employees must pay for them. If they are not, then \nemployees who object may opt out of paying for those costs. Beck sets \nthis rule and McCain-Feingold codifies it.\n  For these reasons, I do not believe that the Nickles amendment is \nnecessary. Beck will be the law with or without Section 304 of McCain-\nFeingold. And since the Beck decision, close to 13 years ago, every \nunion has created a procedure to ensure that dues-paying workers can \nopt out of a union's political expenditures. These procedures \nuniversally involve notice to workers of the opt-out rights provided \nunder Beck; establishment of a means for workers to notify the union of \ntheir decision to exercise these rights; an accounting by the union of \nits spending so that it can calculate the appropriate fee reduction; \nand the right of access to an impartial decisionmaker if the worker who \nopts out disagrees with the union's accounting or calculations.\n  So why was Section 304 included in McCain-Feingold in the first \nplace? It was included only because my Republican colleagues wanted \nadditional insurance that unions would obey the law. But as the scores \nof court cases and NLRB decisions addressing Beck issues attest, there \nare ample means under existing law to ensure that unions follow the \ndictates of the Beck decision. These means will exist with or without \nMcCain-Feingold. Unions will conduct themselves in precisely the same \nway whether or not Section 304 of McCain-Feingold is enacted. Whether \nwe choose McCain-Feingold as written or Senator Nickles' amendment to \nMcCain-Feingold is irrelevant.\n  So what will happen if we remove this provision? Absolutely nothing. \nNothing, that is, unless some of my Republican colleagues use this \naction as an excuse to introduce yet more amendments that would prevent \nunions from representing the voices of working families in the \npolitical process. Senator Nickles has committed that he will introduce \nno such amendments, and I thank him for that. As my friend Senator \nFeingold has stated, we have amply debated--and resoundingly rejected--\nany such paycheck deception amendments, and we should not waste this \nbody's time by endlessly debating, and rejecting, similar bills.\n  So let me be clear. If the Senate votes for the Nickles amendment \ntoday, it will not in any way change the law that governs union \ncollection of dues for political purposes. Paycheck deception \nsupporters may claim that the Nickles amendment shows that supporters \nof McCain-Feingold have abandoned dissenting workers or shown their \nunwillingness to enforce Beck rights. This is patently false.\n  If it is adopted, the Nickles amendment will show that we acknowledge \nas all in this body must that unions are already bound by the same \nrules that would govern them if Section 304 were enacted. My colleagues \nshould not allow paycheck deception supporters to twist this basic \nunderstanding into an excuse for advancing their pro-business, anti-\nworker agenda.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this amendment \nto strike Section 304 of this bill, which pretends to codify the Beck \ndecision. It does not.\n  This section must be stricken for the following reasons. First, it \neliminates the ability of nonunion workers to pursue their claims in \ncourt. Under Section 304 of this bill, the courthouse doors will be \nclosed for nonunion members seeking relief from confiscation of their \ndues for purposes unrelated to collective bargaining, contract \nnegotiation, and grievance adjustment. In order to seek recourse \nthrough the National Labor Relations Board, nonmembers would be \nrequired to navigate a tedious, complex, and often hostile process that \ntakes years.\n  Second, it will legislatively overrule almost 40 years of decisions \nof the U.S. Supreme Court by diminishing the scope of the refund the \nSupreme Court directed for objecting nonmembers required to pay agency \nfees. Section 304 limits nonmembers to a reduction in their agency fees \nequal only to the activities that a union decides are unrelated to \ncollective bargaining. In this case, a union could decide that all of \nits activities dealing with legislation at the State and Federal level, \nas well as executive and judicial appointments or State ballot \ninitiatives, are related to collective bargaining. Under Section 304, \nunions could use nonmember dues for these purposes, which is forbidden \nunder current law.\n  Finally, Section 304 would provide nonmembers with far less \nprotection and information than under procedural safeguards that unions \nhave been required to adopt by the Federal courts. In this case, \nSection 304 requires unions to provide financial information about its \nexpenditures only to employees who file an objection. The courts have \nheld that all nonmembers, not just objectors, must be provided adequate \ndisclosure of the basis for the agency fee that they are required to \npay before they object--not after as under this bill. The courts have \nalso held that adequate disclosure includes verification by an \nindependent auditor, a requirement that S. 27 omits.\n  This section may have been drafted with the best of intentions. \nNevertheless, I believe it would do more harm than good. Striking it \nand keeping the status quo would be more beneficial to American workers \nthan this section as written. Section 304 is not a true codification of \nthe Beck decision, and this amendment should be adopted overwhelmingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nOklahoma.\n  As the Senator from Michigan pointed out, this may be not unlike the \namendment yesterday where we are arriving at the same result with maybe \na slightly different rationale for doing so but the end result produces \nthe same answer, and this is probably better out of the bill than in \nthe bill.\n  Despite the good intentions of Senator Feingold and Senator McCain, \nin their view and in mine, there needs to be some clarification or \ncodification of what the Beck decision said. But rather than debate \nthat, that is what is going on at the NLRB.\n  The Supreme Court decisions are not unlike where we craft legislation \nand then usually have boilerplate language that leaves to the \nrespective agencies the right to make decisions pursuant to legislative \nintent. Many times they do that and we object to what they do; that it \ngoes beyond what the congressional intent was. That is how Supreme \nCourt decisions are written, and then it is up to the NLRB, in this \nparticular case, to deal with the myriad questions that come to it as \nto whether or not something is in order under the Beck decision.\n  The Beck decision says: supporting political activities unrelated to \ncollective bargaining. I think that is the language of the Beck \ndecision.\n  All of these various requests come to them as to whether or not \nsomething falls within that particular sentence. There is a rich \nhistory since the adoption of the Beck decision made by the NLRB when \nsuch questions have come to them. That is where it belongs.\n  I think that is what my colleague from Wisconsin is saying and my \ncolleague from Oklahoma is saying--in effect, that we are not really \nthe best venue for making those decisions. We best leave it to those \nwho deal with these matters every day rather than trying to legislate \nit.\n  I agree with the proposal of the Senator from Oklahoma to take this \nsection out of the bill. But I wouldn't want to characterize this as \nbeing either bogus Beck or absolutely Beck. I\n\n[[Page S2703]]\n\nthink we have all come to the conclusion those decisions are best left \nto the NLRB.\n  Some might claim that McCain-Feingold is a bogus-Beck bill. It is \nnot. McCain-Feingold codifies the Beck holding, which has been \ninterpreted through scores of NLRB and court decisions. As Chief Judge \nEdwards of the District of Columbia Circuit has observed, this is \nappropriate, and precisely what the Beck court intended; in his words, \n``[i]t is hard to think of a task more suitable for an administrative \nagency that specializes in labor relations.'' Thomas v. NLRB, 213 F.3d \n651, 675 (D.C. Cir. 2000). NLRB decisions implementing Beck have \ngenerally been upheld in the courts.\n  Beck held that objecting nonmembers have the right to object to the \npayment of a portion of their contractually required agency fees. \nMcCain-Feingold says the same thing. Whether they implement Beck or \nMcCain-Feingold, therefore, the NLRB and the courts will be free to \nreach the same results. Nothing in our vote on the Nickles amendment \ntoday should change their analysis.\n  I wouldn't want the Record to show what I hope will be overwhelming \nsupport for the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma as anything but \nthat.\n  Lastly, let me say to my friend from Oklahoma that I appreciate his \nstatement that we have come to an end, I hope, of the so-called \npaycheck protection amendments. I think we have had good debates on \nthem. The Senator from Oklahoma and I agreed yesterday--I think he was \nright--as well that we are getting much too complicated in some of \nthese efforts dealing with shareholders, and we felt the same on the \nsecond Hatch amendment where someone owns a stock for 15 minutes, and \nall of a sudden they are going to be deluged with information about the \ncampaign's activities with that particular company going beyond what we \nintend to achieve in legislation.\n  With that, unless there are others who want to be heard on this \namendment, I am prepared to yield back the couple of minutes we have. \nWe said 3:30 we would start the vote. We have one other amendment we \nare going to consider this afternoon by Senator Landrieu, if that is \nappropriate with my friend from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is appropriate, as the Senator from \nKentucky just discussed, for Senator Landrieu to come next.\n  I am perfectly prepared to yield back the time on this side, and we \nwill go to a vote.\n  Mr. DODD. Do we want a recorded vote on this?\n  Mr. NICKLES. A recorded vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  All time is yielded, and the question is on agreeing to the Nickles \namendment No. 139.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 99, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 45 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--99\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kennedy\n       \n  The amendment (No. 139) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the next amendment will be on the \nDemocratic side, offered by Senator Landrieu. We are in the process of \nlooking at it now. We think it may well be accepted. Shortly, Senator \nLandrieu will send that amendment to the desk and make her statement \nabout it.\n  Let me say that after that, Senator Specter will be recognized to \noffer an amendment, and Senator Dodd and I are talking about the \npossibility of Senator Specter being followed by Senator Helms. I \nbelieve the majority leader would like for us to vote a couple more \ntimes tonight. Senators may expect additional votes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky has described \nappropriately and properly that Senator Landrieu has an amendment. It \nmight only take 10 minutes to explain the amendment. We might even hope \nfor a voice vote rather than having a recorded vote on that amendment. \nI can tentatively tell my colleague from Kentucky that with respect to \nthe Specter amendment, there has been some discussion about having an \nhour's worth of debate on that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have not yet spoken to Senator Specter about that. I \nwill do that shortly.\n  Mr. DODD. There is an indication and perhaps a willingness to support \nthat arrangement, along with the recommendation of having Senator Helms \npropose an amendment and maybe debate it this evening and make it the \nfirst vote tomorrow. We are discussing it on this side. I am using the \nopportunity to let people know with what I am going to ask them to \nagree. It sounds like a good schedule to me. If Members have some \nobjection, they ought to let us know. In the meantime, we can go to \nSenator Landrieu.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I really appreciate the leadership the \nSenator from Connecticut has brought to this issue. I thank him for \nproviding time for me to offer this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 124\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 124.\n\n  The amendment reads as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to provide \n    for weekly reporting by candidates and for prompt disclosure of \n contributions, and to make software for filing reports in electronic \n                            form available)\n\n       On page 37, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 305.

Mr. President, the Members are going to be discussing \nthe details of this amendment because there seems to be some confusion \nwith the text. I want to take a few minutes to explain it as staff is \nworking on it, and we may need a little bit more time.\n  Generally, there is broad consensus, both on the Republican side and \nthe Democratic side, that one of the best things we could do to improve \nour current system is to try to provide for greater disclosure. One of \nthe great tools we now have for disclosure is the electronic medium, \nthe electronic opportunity, the tools the Internet and new technologies \nhave provided.\n  My amendment really embraces this new technology. It is quite a \nsimple amendment. It requires the FEC to develop a standardized \nsoftware package that any Federal candidate running for Federal office \nwould be required to use in our reporting requirements. The report \nwould basically go on line. Instead of waiting a quarter, or 6 months, \nor a year, or 48 hours, whatever the current waiting period is, a \ncandidate or a political committee that is required to report would \nbasically enter the data as if he were making deposits--which we all \ndo--into a bank account. Those deposits would become transparent. The \nreport is like a report in progress, and people would have access to \nwhat contributions were being made to the candidate--in this case--or \nto a committee, basically instantaneously.\n  That is the essence of my amendment. There is no new reporting \nrequirement. It will hopefully not be onerous on us because the FEC \nwill be required to come up with this new software. We will allow them \nthe time to develop it because we don't want to rush the process. We \nwant them to do it correctly. They would give us the software, and we \nwould download it onto our computer, and as checks came in, as expenses \nwere released by the campaign, it would be available instantaneously on \nthe Internet.\n  That is the essence of my amendment. We are having a few problems \nwith the drafting of the amendment.\n\n  That is what I offer as an improvement to our current system. We have \nreports that we must file. They are quarterly or annually or, sometimes \nwhen one is close to an election, daily. This would be instantaneous \nreporting with no new work required of the candidate or the committees \nusing software that will be developed.\n  That is what I submit for consideration. I am hoping we can voice \nvote this amendment as soon as the technical difficulties are worked \nout.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what is the pending business? I believe the \npending business is the Landrieu amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Landrieu \namendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Landrieu \namendment be temporarily laid aside. I say to my colleagues, there are \nefforts at crafting the language in such a way as to bring bipartisan \nsupport to this amendment. We think it is a very good proposal, and we \nare working on some of the specifics of it.\n  While we are doing that, we will go to the Specter amendment, which I \nthink is the intention of the manager, the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania is unavoidably \ngoing to be absent from the floor for a few minutes, so I am going to \nsuggest the absence of a quorum and we will proceed to the Specter \namendment, I presume, in about 10 or 15 minutes. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 140\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 140.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide findings regarding the current state of campaign \n     finance laws and to clarify the definition of electioneering \n                             communication)\n\n       On page 7, line 24, after ``and'', insert the following: \n     ``which, when read as a whole, in the context of external \n     events, is unmistakable, unambiguous and suggestive of no \n     plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or \n     against a specific candidate.''\n       On page 15, line 20, insert the following:\n       ``(iv) promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or \n     attacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of \n     whether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or \n     against a candidate) and which, when read as a whole, and in \n     the context of external events, is unmistakable, unambiguous \n     and suggestive of no plausible meaning other than an \n     exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.''\n       On page 2, after the matter preceding line 1, insert:\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the twenty-five years since the 1976 Supreme Court \n     decision in Buckley v. Valeo, the number and frequency of \n     advertisements\n\n[[Page S2705]]\n\n     increased dramatically which clearly advocate for or against \n     a specific candidate for Federal office without magic words \n     such as ``vote for'' or ``vote against'' as prescribed in the \n     Buckley decision.\n       (2) The absence of the magic words from the Buckley \n     decision has allowed these advertisements to be viewed as \n     issue advertisements, despite their clear advocacy for or \n     against the election of a specific candidate for Federal \n     office.\n       (3) By avoiding the use of such terms as ``vote for'' and \n     ``vote against,'' special interest groups promote their views \n     and issue positions in reference to particular elected \n     officials without triggering the disclosure and source \n     restrictions of the Federal Election Campaign Act.\n       (4) In 1996, an estimated $135 million was spent on such \n     issue advertisements; the estimate for 1998 ranged from $275-\n     $340 million; and, for the 2000 election the estimate for \n     spending on such advertisements exceeded $340 million.\n       (5) If left unchecked, the explosive growth in the number \n     and frequency of advertisements that are clearly intended to \n     influence the outcome of Federal elections yet are \n     masquerading as issue advocacy has the potential to undermine \n     the integrity of the electoral process.\n       (6) The Supreme Court in Buckley reviewed the legislative \n     history and purpose of the Federal Election Campaign Act and \n     found that the authorized or requested standard of the \n     Federal Election Campaign Act operated to treat all \n     expenditures placed in cooperation with or with the consent \n     of a candidate, an agent of the candidate, or an authorized \n     committee of the candidate as contributions subject to the \n     limitations set forth in the Act.\n       (7) During the 1996 Presidential primary campaign the \n     Clinton Committee and the Dole Committee both spent millions \n     of dollars in excess of the overall Presidential primary \n     spending limit that applied to each of their campaigns, \n     and in doing so, used millions of dollars in soft money \n     contributions that could not legally be used directly to \n     support a Presidential campaign.\n       (8) The Clinton and Dole Committees made these campaign \n     expenditures through their respective national political \n     party committees, using these party committees as conduits to \n     run multi-million dollar television ad campaigns to support \n     their candidacies.\n       (9) These television ad campaigns were in each case \n     prepared, directed, and controlled by the Clinton and Dole \n     campaigns.\n       (10) Former Clinton adviser Dick Morris said in his book \n     about the 1996 elections that President Clinton worked over \n     every script, watched each advertisement, and decided which \n     advertisements would run where and when.\n       (11) Then-President Clinton told supporters at a Democratic \n     National Committee luncheon on December 7, 1995, that, ``We \n     realized that we could run these ads through the Democratic \n     Party, which meant that we could raise money in $20,000 and \n     $50,000 blocks. So we didn't have to do it all in $1,000 and \n     run down what I can spend, which is limited by law so that is \n     what we've done.''\n       (12) Among the advertisements coordinated between the \n     Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, yet \n     paid for by the DNC as an issue ad, was one which contained \n     the following:\n       [Announcer] ``60,000 felons and fugitives tried to buy \n     handguns but couldn't because President Clinton passed the \n     Brady bill--five day waits, background checks. But Dole and \n     Gingrich voted no. 100,000 new police--because President \n     Clinton delivered. Dole and Gingrich? Vote no, want to repeal \n     'em. Strengthen school anti-drug programs. President Clinton \n     did it. Dole and Gingrich? No again. Their old ways don't \n     work. President Clinton's plan. The new way. Meeting our \n     challenges, protecting our values.''\n       (13) Another advertisement coordinated between the Clinton \n     campaign and the DNC contained the following:\n       [Announcer] ``America's values. Head start. Student loans. \n     Toxic cleanup. Extra police. Protected in the budget \n     agreement; the President stood firm. Dole, Gringrich's latest \n     plan includes tax hikes on working families. Up to 18 million \n     children face health care cuts. Medicare slashed $167 \n     billion. Then Dole resigns, leaving behind gridlock he and \n     Gringrich created. The President's plan: Politics must wait. \n     Balance the budget, reform welfare, protect our values.''\n       (14) Among the advertisements coordinated between the Dole \n     campaign and the Republican National Committee, yet paid for \n     by the RNC as an issue ad, was one which contained the \n     following:\n       [Announcer] ``Bill Clinton, he's really something. He's now \n     trying to avoid a sexual harassment lawsuit claiming he is on \n     active military duty. Active duty? Newspapers report that Mr. \n     Clinton claims as commander-in-chief he is covered under the \n     Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act of 1940, which grants \n     automatic delays in lawsuits against military personnel until \n     their active duty is over. Active duty? Bill Clinton, he's \n     really something.''\n       (15) Another advertisement coordinated between the Dole \n     campaign and the RNC contained the following:\n       [Announcer] ``Three years ago, Bill Clinton gave us the \n     largest tax increase in history, including a 4 cent a gallon \n     increase on gasoline. Bill Clinton said he felt bad about \n     it.''\n       [Clinton] ``People in this room still get mad at me over \n     the budget process because you think I raised your taxes too \n     much. It might surprise you to know I think I raised them too \n     much, too.''\n       [Announcer] ``OK, Mr. President, we are surprised. So now, \n     surprise us again. Support Senator Dole's plan to repeal your \n     gas tax. And learn that actions do speak louder than words.''\n       (16) Clinton and Dole Committee agents raised the money \n     used to pay for these so-called issue ads supporting their \n     respective candidacies.\n       (17) These television advertising campaigns, run in the \n     guise of being DNC and RNC issue ad campaigns, were in fact \n     Clinton and Dole ad campaigns, and accordingly should have \n     been subject to the contribution and spending limits that \n     apply to Presidential campaigns.\n       (18) After reviewing spending in the 1996 Presidential \n     election campaign, auditors for the Federal Election \n     Commission recommended that the 1996 Clinton and Dole \n     campaigns repay $7 million and $17.7 million, respectively, \n     because the national political parties had closely \n     coordinated their soft money issue ads with the respective \n     presidential candidates and accordingly, the expenditures \n     would be counted against the candidates' spending limits. The \n     repayment recommendation for the Dole campaign was \n     subsequently reduced to $6.1 million.\n       (19) On December 10, 1998, in a 6-0 vote, the Federal \n     Election Commission rejected its auditors' recommendation \n     that the Clinton and Dole campaigns repay the money.\n       (20) The pattern of close coordination between candidates' \n     campaign committees and national party committees continued \n     in the 2000 Presidential election .\n       (21) An advertisement financed by the RNC contained the \n     following:\n       [Announcer] ``Whose economic plan is best for you? Under \n     George Bush's plan, a family earning under $35,000 a year \n     pays no Federal income taxes--a 100 percent tax cut. Earn \n     $35,000 to $50,000? A 55 percent tax cut. Tax relief for \n     everyone. And Al Gore's plan: three times the new spending \n     President Clinton proposed, so much it wipes out the entire \n     surplus and creates a deficit again. Al Gore's deficit \n     spending plan threatens America's prosperity.''\n       (22) Another advertisement financed by the RNC contained \n     the following:\n       [Announcer] ``Under Clinton-Gore, prescription drug prices \n     have skyrocketed, and nothing's been done. George Bush has a \n     plan: add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare.''\n       [George Bush] ``Every senior will have access to \n     prescription drug benefits.''\n       [Announcer] ``And Al Gore? Gore opposed bipartisan reform. \n     He's pushing a big government plan that lets Washington \n     bureaucrats interfere with what your doctors prescribe. The \n     Gore prescription plan: bureaucrats decide.

Six times the legislature tried to raise the \n     minimum wage and Bush's inaction helped kill it. Now Bush \n     says he'd allow states to set a minimum wage lower than the \n     Federal standard. Al Gore's plan: Make sure our current \n     prosperity enriches not just a few, but all families. \n     Increase the minimum wage, invest in education, middle-class \n     tax cuts and a secure retirement.''\n       (24) Another advertisement paid for by the DNC contained \n     the following:\n       [Announcer] ``George W.

President Bush and Republican Congressional leaders \n     have moved to rescind new Labor Department ergonomics rules \n     aimed at fostering a safer workplace, largely because \n     business considered them too costly. Congress is also \n     revising bankruptcy law in a way long sought by major \n     financial institutions that gave Republicans $26 million \n     in the last election cycle.''\n       (30) A New York Times article, from March 13, 2001, noted \n     that ``A lobbying campaign led by credit card companies and \n     banks that gave millions of dollars in political donations to \n     members of Congress and contributed generously to President \n     Bush's 2000 campaign is close to its long-sought goal of \n     overhauling the nation's bankruptcy system.''\n       (31) According to a Washington Post article from March 11, \n     2001, when congressional GOP leaders took control of the \n     final writing of the bankruptcy bill, they consulted closely \n     with representatives of the American Financial Services \n     Association and the Coalition for Responsible Bankruptcy, \n     which represented dozens of corporations and trade groups. \n     The 442-page bill contained hundreds of provisions written or \n     backed by lobbyists for financial industry giants.\n       (32) It has become common practice to reward big campaign \n     donors with ambassadorships, with an informal policy dating \n     back to the 1960s allocating about 30 percent of the nation's \n     ambassadorships to non-career appointees. According to a \n     Knight Rider article from November 13, 1997, former President \n     Nixon once told his White House Chief of Staff that ``Anybody \n     who wants to be an ambassador must at leave give $250,000.''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment does two things. It sets \nforth findings which I believe are indispensable in order to have \nlegislation which will pass review by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. In recent years, the Supreme Court has stricken a great deal of \ncongressional legislation starting with Lopez in 1995, upsetting 60 \nyears of solid precedents for Federal legislation under the Commerce \nClause, and has invalidated on constitutional grounds, substantial \nlegislation--the Disabilities Act, the provision of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act--on the basis that there is insufficient factual \nfoundation. This amendment seeks to provide findings to pass \nconstitutional muster. I shall deal with them in detail in this floor \nstatement. Second, this amendment deals with the definition of what is \nan advocacy ad contrasted with an issue ad.\n  The provision in the pending legislation, McCain-Feingold, says it is \nthe purpose of this provision to try to establish a test which will \npass constitutional muster under the decision of the Supreme Court in \nBuckley v. Valeo. It may be that this definition is sufficient to pass \nconstitutional muster. It is arguable.\n  It may be that this definition is not sufficient to pass \nconstitutional muster. That is also arguable.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States in Buckley, in 1976, said \nthis:\n\n       In order to preserve the provision against invalidation on \n     vagueness grounds, section 601(e)(1) must be construed to \n     apply only to expenditures for communications that, in \n     express terms, advocate the election or defeat of a clearly \n     identified candidate for Federal office.\n\n  Then the Supreme Court drops a footnote which says:\n\n       This construction would restrict the application of \n     608(e)(1) to communications containing express words of \n     advocacy of election or defeat such as ``vote for,'' \n     ``elect,'' ``support,'' ``cast your ballot for,'' ``Smith for \n     Congress,'' ``vote against,'' ``defeat,'' ``reject.''\n\n  On its face, it seems difficult to see how the language from McCain-\nFeingold, in and of itself, would satisfy the mandate articulated by \nthe Supreme Court of having language such as ``vote for, elect, \nsupport,'' et cetera, which is straightforward and unequivocal in \nexpressing a view for the election of a candidate or the defeat of a \ncandidate.\n  Constitutional interpretation is complicated because different \nmembers of the nine-person Supreme Court see the issues differently, \nand especially at different times. A great deal has happened in the \nelectoral process, with hard money and soft money and so-called issue \nads, so that it is possible that a court, looking at this language in a \ndifferent era and in a different context, might say that it is \nconstitutional.\n\n  From my view of the Constitution, it is hard to see that that would \nhappen just on the face of the language which I have read.\n  There is one opinion in a court of appeals, ninth circuit. Of course, \nthe courts of appeals are right under the Supreme Court. It is a case \nwhich has articulated a different definition. The case is the Furgatch \ncase, and that case said that the ad is an advocacy ad if the ``message \nis unmistakable, unambiguous, suggestive of only one plausible \nmeaning.''\n  This is a very complicated field and unless you have read the cases \nand/or followed this debate very closely, it is hard to put all the \npieces in place to understand the statutory and constitutional \nstructure. But the rule has been if you have an advocacy ad, then it \ncan be regulated by legislation. But if you have an issue ad, it cannot \nbe regulated by legislation. Even with some advocacy ads--according to \nthe Supreme Court decision in F.E.C. v Massachusetts Citizens For Life \nCommittee--regulation doesn't pass constitutional muster because it is \ntoo much of an infringement on freedom of speech. The Court has set the \nground rules to say that there must be corruption or the appearance of \ncorruption which would warrant an infringement on first amendment \nrights of freedom of speech. And the Court has equated money with \nspeech.\n  To my thinking, that is a far stretch. I agree with Justice Stevens \nthat the conclusion that money is speech is unreasonable because it so \nelevates money and what money can do in the electoral process.\n  But, in any event, unless you have express advocacy under the Buckley \ndecision, you cannot have any regulation at all.\n  The amendment which I am offering today would take the Furgatch \nlanguage and add it as an additional definition of what constitutes an \nadvocacy ad. This language builds upon and does not in any way change \nthe provisions of McCain-Feingold. And we do not address any other \nissue in this amendment as to who is covered or what the circumstances \nare, so that we have all the controversy about individuals, \ncorporations, labor unions, or whatever--McCain-Feingold is left \nuntouched. All we are doing is adding to the definition of an \nelectioneering message to provide a solid basis for Supreme Court \nreview to conclude that this legislation would deal with advocacy ads.\n  The language in the amendment traces the language of Furgatch, and \nprovides that there is an electioneering message which ``promotes or \nsupports a candidate for that office, or attacks or opposes a candidate \nfor that office (regardless of whether the communication expressly \nadvocates a vote for or against the candidate.)''\n  The language I just read is existing in McCain-Feingold. The \nadditional language is ``and which, when read as a whole, and in the \ncontext of external events''--that means what is happening in an \nelection--``is unmistakable, unambiguous, and suggestive of no \nplausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a \nspecific candidate.''\n\n[[Page S2707]]\n\n  What does that mean in the context of what has happened in the \nPresidential elections of 1996 and the year 2000?\n  In 1996, the Democratic National Committee--I am going to come to \nRepublican ads because this amendment is balanced between what \nRepublicans have done and what Democrats have done in a way which is \ncritical on all sides.\n  I start first with the President Clinton advertisements run by \nDemocratic National Committee. The announcer comes on and says:\n       60,000 felons and fugitives tried to buy handguns but \n     couldn't because President Clinton passed the Brady bill--\n     five day waits, background checks. But Dole and Gingrich \n     voted no. 100,000 new police--because President Clinton \n     delivered. Dole and Gingrich? Vote no, want to repeal 'em. \n     Strengthen school anti-drug programs. President Clinton did \n     it. Dole and Gingrich? No again. Their old ways don't work. \n     President Clinton's plan . . .\n\n  As that advertisement is being read, any person listening would say \nthat is an ad which advocates the election of President Clinton and \nadvocates the defeat of Robert Dole.\n  But under the interpretations of Buckley v. Valeo, because the magic \nwords ``vote for'' or ``vote against'' are not used, that is deemed to \nbe an issue ad and is not subject to the limitations of the Federal \nelection campaign laws.\n  Then turning to one of the advertisements coordinated between Senator \nDole and the Republican National Committee, the announcer comes on:\n       ``Three years ago, Bill Clinton gave us the largest tax \n     increase in history, including a 4 cent a gallon increase on \n     gasoline. Bill Clinton said he felt bad about it.''\n       [Clinton] ``People in this room still get mad at me over \n     the budget process because you think I raised your taxes too \n     much. It might surprise you to know I think I raised them too \n     much, too.''\n       [Announcer] ``OK, Mr. President, we are surprised. So now, \n     surprise us again. Support Senator Dole's plan to repeal your \n     gas tax. And learn that actions do speak louder than words.''\n\n  Obviously, anybody listening to that advertisement would say it \nadvocates the election of Senator Dole and it advocates the defeat of \nPresident Clinton. But that is not the result.\n  The result under Buckley is that it is an issue ad, even though \ncoordinated between the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National \nCommittee; and then the other ad coordinated between Senator Dole's \ncampaign and the Republican National Committee. They are issue ads and \nnot subject to Federal regulation.\n  Then the same pattern emerges in the election in the year 2000. An \nadvertisement paid for by the Democratic National Committee said the \nfollowing:\n       George W. Bush chose Dick Cheney to help lead the \n     Republican party. What does Cheney's record say about their \n     plans? Cheney was one of only eight members of Congress to \n     oppose the Clean Water Act . . . one of the few to vote \n     against Head Start. He even voted against the School Lunch \n     Program . . . against health insurance for people who lost \n     their jobs. Cheney, an oil company CEO, said it was good for \n     OPEC to cut production so oil and gasoline prices could rise. \n     What are their plans for working families?\n\n  Anybody listening to that television ad would say conclusively that \nthe purpose of the ad was to defeat Mr. Cheney, and to elect the Gore-\nLieberman ticket. But, under the Supreme Court decision in Buckley, \nthat is considered to be an issue ad and not subject to regulation.\n  How in the world can there be issue advocacy in advertisements which \ntake up the Clean Water Act passed many years ago, or the Head Start \nProgram, which is no longer in issue, or the school lunch program, or \nhealth insurance for people who lost their jobs? Those matters long \nsince ceased to be issues. But, notwithstanding that, they are \ncategorized as issue ads and not advocacy ads where the only purpose \nwould be to advocate the defeat of Dick Cheney for Vice President and \nthe defeat of the Bush-Cheney ticket.\n  Under my amendment and the language of Furgatch, there would be no \ndoubt that that message is ``unmistakable, unambiguous, and suggestive \nof only one plausible meaning.''\n  The ads of the Republican National Committee were similarly directed \nto defeat the Gore-Lieberman ticket.\n  This is an illustrative ad by the Republican National Committee.\n       [Announcer] ``Under Clinton-Gore, prescription drug prices \n     have skyrocketed, and nothing's been done. George Bush has a \n     plan: add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare.''\n       [George Bush] ``Every senior will have access to \n     prescription drug benefits.''\n       [Announcer] ``And Al Gore? Gore opposed bipartisan reform. \n     He's pushing a big government plan that lets Washington \n     bureaucrats interfere with what your doctors prescribe. The \n     Gore prescription plan: bureaucrats decide. Bush prescription \n     plan: seniors choose.''\n\n  Obviously, that is an ad which advocates the election of George Bush \nand advocates the defeat of Vice President Gore. But under the Buckley \ndecision, that would be an issue ad and not subject to Federal \nregulation.\n  The findings set forth in my amendment recite the essential facts of \nhow the candidates coordinated these advertisements with their parties.\n  Findings 7, 8, and 9, starting on page 2, line 29, recites:\n\n       During the 1996 Presidential primary campaign the Clinton \n     Committee and the Dole Committee both spent millions of \n     dollars in excess of the overall Presidential primary \n     spending limit that applied to each of their campaigns, and \n     in doing so, used millions of dollars in soft money \n     contributions that could not legally be used directly to \n     support a Presidential campaign.\n       The Clinton and Dole Committees made these campaign \n     expenditures through their respective national political \n     party committees, using these party committees as conduits to \n     run multi-million dollar television ad campaigns to support \n     their candidacies.\n       These television ad campaigns were in each case prepared, \n     directed, and controlled by the Clinton and Dole campaigns.\n\n  And finding 10, page 3, line 13:\n\n       Former Clinton adviser Dick Morris said in his book about \n     the 1996 elections that President Clinton worked over every \n     script, watched each advertisement, and decided which \n     advertisements would run where and when.\n\n  Finding 11, page 3, line 17:\n\n       Then-President Clinton told supporters at a Democratic \n     National Committee luncheon on December 7, 1995, that, ``We \n     realized that we could run these ads through the Democratic \n     Party, which meant that we could raise money in $20,000 and \n     $50,000 blocks. So we didn't have to do it all in $1,000 and \n     run down what I can spend, which is limited by law so that is \n     what we've done.''\n\n  There is no doubt about the fact of coordination when it comes from \nthe mouth of the Presidential candidate, President Clinton, running for \nreelection and from Dick Morris, his campaign manager.\n  Findings 18, 19, and 20, starting on page 5, line 9, recites:\n\n       After reviewing spending in the 1996 Presidential election \n     campaign, auditors for the Federal Election Commission \n     recommended that the 1996 Clinton and Dole campaigns repay $7 \n     million and $17.7 million, respectively, because the national \n     political parties had closely coordinated their soft money \n     issue ads with the respective presidential candidates and, \n     accordingly, the expenditures would be counted against the \n     candidates' spending limits. The repayment recommendation for \n     the Dole campaign was subsequently reduced to $6.1 million.\n       On December 10, 1998, on a 6-0 vote, the Federal Election \n     Commission rejected its auditors' recommendation that the \n     Clinton and Dole campaigns repay the money.\n       The pattern of close coordination between candidates' \n     campaign committees and national party committees continued \n     in the 2000 Presidential election.\n\n  The Supreme Court of the United States, in Buckley v. Valeo, made a \nconclusive finding that such controlled or coordinated expenditures are \ntreated as contributions rather than expenditures under the Act.\n  But notwithstanding that clear-cut statement of law, when the Federal \nElection Commission picked up the issue and had a decision to make, the \nFederal Election Commission said that there was not a violation of the \nFederal election law.\n  The findings go into some detail about the experience of the 25 years \nsince the 1976 decision of Buckley v. Valeo on the number and frequency \nof advertisements which avoid being advocacy ads because they leave out \nthe magic words.\n\n  We recite the finding that in 1996 there was an estimated $135 \nmillion spent on these so-called issue advertisements. The estimate for \n1998 ranged from $275 to $340 million. And for the 2000 election, the \nestimate for spending on such advertisements exceeded $340 million.\n  In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court of the United States said that \nlegislation affecting campaign contributions would be based on \ncorruption or the appearance of corruption. Since the Buckley decision \nwas decided, there have been many books written documenting the details \nof corruption and the public perception of the appearance of \ncorruption. It is not\n\n[[Page S2708]]\n\na cottage industry; it is a major national industry.\n  Last year, the year 2000, a book was edited by Robert Williams \nentitled ``Party Finance and Political Corruption.''\n  In 1999, a book was published ``Corruption, Public Finances, and the \nUnofficial Economy,'' by Johnson, Kaufmann and Zoido-Lobatoon.\n  In 1999, an incisive book entitled ``The Corruption of American \nPolitics: What Went Wrong and Why'' was written by Elizabeth Drew, \ntracing the Governmental Affairs hearings in 1997.\n  In 1998, a book was written by Timperlake and Triplett entitled, \n``Year of the Rat: How Bill Clinton Compromised U.S. Security for \nChinese Cash.''\n  In 1998, a book was written by Cecil Heftel, entitled, ``End \nLegalized Bribery: An Ex-Congressman's Proposal to Clean Up Congress.''\n  The findings recite a great many books, including Philip Stern's 1988 \nbook, trenchantly entitled, ``The Best Congress Money Can Buy.''\n  There is an unmistakable basis for this kind of legislation and the \ntightening of legislation that reaches these issue ads.\n  The reports on the appearance of corruption are as fresh as \nyesterday's newspaper. The New York Times reported on March 13--finding \nNo. 30--\n\n       A lobbying campaign led by credit card companies and banks \n     that gave millions of dollars in political donations to \n     members of Congress and contributed generously to President \n     Bush's 2000 campaign is close to its long-sought goal of \n     overhauling the nation's bankruptcy system.\n\n  On March 16, a New York Times editorial observed:\n\n       Business interests generously supported Republicans in the \n     last election and are now reaping the rewards.\n\n  On a bipartisan basis--the Washington Post, on September 15, 2000, \ncriticized the Democrats, noting that--finding number 27, at page 8 of \nthis amendment--\n\n       A group of Texas trial lawyers with whom former Vice \n     President Gore met in 1995, contributed thousands of dollars \n     to the Democrats after President Clinton vetoed legislation \n     that would have strictly limited the amount of damages juries \n     can award to plaintiffs in civil lawsuits.\n\n  Finding 28, page 8, line 21:\n\n       According to an article in the March 26, 2001 edition of \n     U.S. News and World Report, labor-related groups--which count \n     on their Democratic allies for support on issues such as the \n     minimum wage that are important to unions--spent more than \n     $83.5 million in the 2000 elections, with 94 percent going to \n     Democrats, prompting some labor figures to brag that without \n     labor's money, the election would not have been nearly as \n     close.\n\n  Finding 32, page 9, line 19:\n\n       It has become common practice to reward big campaign donors \n     with ambassadorships, with an informal policy dating back to \n     the 1960s allocating about 30 percent of the nation's \n     ambassadorships to non-career appointees. According to a \n     Knight Ridder article from November 13, 1997, former \n     President Nixon once told his White House Chief of Staff that \n     ``Anybody who wants to be an ambassador must at least give \n     $250,000.''\n  That, in essence, sets forth findings which, in my legal opinion, \nwarrant the legislation being considered today, although, candidly, it \nmay be wise to add even more findings in the face of what the U.S. \nSupreme Court has done recently in invalidating congressional \nlegislation on constitutional grounds, notwithstanding very strong \nfindings, as I believe these findings are.\n  The essence of the legislation goes to a standard which would satisfy \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, although, realistically, the language of \nMcCain-Feingold and even the language of Furgatch does not come \ndirectly in line with what the Supreme Court said in Buckley when they \ntalked about a ``vote for'' or ``vote against.'' I believe that in the \ncontext of what has happened with money and elections, with the \nlanguage of Furgatch supplementing the language of McCain-Feingold, \nthis bill would definitely pass constitutional muster.\n  I refer to an extensively quoted bit of language from the opinion of \nJustice Robert Jackson in a case captioned United States v. Five \nGambling Devices, decided in 1953, where Justice Jackson said the \nfollowing at page 449 of volume 346 of U.S. Reports:\n\n       This court does and should accord a strong presumption of \n     constitutionality to Acts of Congress. This is not a mere \n     polite gesture. It is a deference due to deliberate judgment \n     by constitutional majorities of the two Houses of Congress \n     that an Act is within their delegated power or is necessary \n     and proper to execution of that power. The rational and \n     practical force of the presumption is at its maximum only \n     when it appears that the precise point in issue here has been \n     considered by Congress and has been explicitly and \n     deliberately resolved.\n\n  What we are doing in this bill is seeking to overturn the direct \nholding in Buckley v. Valeo which has required the magic words ``vote \nfor'' or ``vote against.'' But as Justice Jackson has noted and as \nconstitutional doctrine has evolved, the court will give special \nconsideration to what the Congress does in a specific context where it \nappears that ``the precise point in issue has been considered by \nCongress and has been explicitly and deliberately resolved.''\n  I submit that if you take the underlying language of McCain-Feingold \non the definition of an electioneering communication and add to it the \nlanguage of Furgatch, that Congress is coming to grips explicitly and \ndeliberately with what the court has done and that, building upon the \nstrong presumption which Justice Jackson notes is present, the strong \npresumption of constitutionality to Acts of Congress, and then looking \nto Buckley itself, which said their concern arose that there not be \nconstitutional invalidity because of vagueness, I do not believe there \nis any realistic way it can be said that there is anything vague about \na standard which is ``unmistakable, unambiguous, and suggestive of no \nplausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a \nspecific candidate.''\n  That certainly satisfies the court's requirement that the legislation \nnot be vague. With this language, we will end the charade of having \nthese extraordinary ads which, on their face and in the context of \ntheir substance, urge the election of a candidate and the defeat of \nanother but, because of the absence of the magic Buckley words, are \nheld to be issue ads and outside the purview of Federal control.\n  This language will end that charade, will end the trauma caused by \nsoft money in enormous sums, and put some sense back into the campaign \nfinance laws.\n  I inquire how much time is left of the 3 hours allocated to the \nsponsor of the amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 54 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I find myself in the curious position \nof opposing the amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania but \ncontrolling the time on this side. How much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opponents have 90 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I commend my friend from Pennsylvania \nfor his understanding of the dilemma in which we find ourselves. The \nunderlying bill, in the opinion of this Senator, will dramatically \nweaken the parties' ability to get their message out. By definition, \nthis will only increase the power of third party groups who already \noutspend the parties by a factor of two to one.\n  I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania for his efforts to create a \nfair and balanced approach by restricting outside groups as well as \nparties. A year and a half or so ago, when this issue was last on the \nfloor, the Senator from Pennsylvania cast, in my view, a very \nprincipled vote by joining me in opposition to cloture on McCain-\nFeingold at that time because McCain-Feingold at that particular year \nwas only a party soft money ban. The Senator from Pennsylvania \nexpressed his concern that by not passing anything that impacted \noutside groups, we would put the parties at a particular disadvantage. \nWhat he is doing today is entirely consistent with the vote he cast \nback in 1999 on a party soft money ban only.\n  The problem with the solution my friend from Pennsylvania proposed is \nthat it can't be accomplished without violating the First Amendment. \nThis is clear from case law. Senator Specter's amendment would allow \nthe Government to regulate the speech of citizens groups far beyond the \nconstitutionally permissible express advocacy by including speech which \na person believes is candidate advocacy.\n  In the first place, this formulation seems fine. But the problem is \nthat reasonable people can, and often do,\n\n[[Page S2709]]\n\ndisagree on a speaker's intent. When it comes to political speech--the \ncore of the First Amendment--we can't tolerate such uncertainty.\n  Indeed, the Supreme Court, in Buckley versus Valeo, recognized this \nfact and therefore rejected a test for speech regulation that went \nbeyond express advocacy. Specifically, in Buckley, it was noted that:\n\n       Whether words intended and designed to fall short of \n     invitation would miss that ``mark,'' [and by that ``mark'', \n     Mr. President, the court meant some form of candidate \n     advocacy] is a question of both intent and of effect. No \n     speaker, in such circumstances, safely could assume that \n     anything he might say upon the general subject would not be \n     understood by some as an invitation [to vote for or against a \n     candidate]. In short, the supposedly clear-cut distinction \n     between discussion, laudation, general advocacy, and \n     solicitation puts the speaker in these circumstances wholly \n     at the mercy of the varied understanding of his hearers and \n     consequently of whatever influence may be drawn as to his \n     intent and meaning. Such a distinction offers no security for \n     free discussion. In these conditions it blankets with \n     uncertainty whatever may be said. It compels the speaker to \n     hedge and trim.\n\n  Mr. President, an illustration might be helpful. In 1996, the \nNational Right to Life Committee ran an ad strongly criticizing \nPresident Clinton for vetoing Congress's ban on partial-birth abortion. \nSenator Specter might very reasonably conclude that this was a form of \ncandidate opposition. Knowing the passion that Right to Life has on \nthis issue, I, however, might just as reasonably conclude that these \nefforts were an ad by a citizens group to rally public and/or official \nopinion about an issue of the utmost concern to it in order to convince \nCongress to override the veto.\n  The reason why this very reasonable difference of opinion between my \nfriend and me on this ad is so critical is that if I am the Government \nregulator, Right to Life gets to speak. But if my friend from \nPennsylvania is the speech regulator, Right to Life doesn't get to \nspeak. And because National Right to Life or the Sierra Club, or the \nACLU or whomever, knows that speech, like beauty, is in the eye of the \nbeholder, it will be chilled from speaking. This is a result that we \ndon't want in a democracy. We don't want the ``marketplace of ideas'' \nto be bereft of commodities.\n  I commend my friend for his understanding of the dilemma and for his \ngood intentions; but I strongly disagree with him, however, on the \nproposed solution.\n  The problem with relying on Furgatch, the case to which Senator \nSpecter referred, besides the fact that it is at odds with about two \ndozen other cases, is that the Ninth Circuit in Furgatch failed to cite \nthe Supreme Court's decision in Federal Election Commission v. \nMassachusetts Citizens For Life, which was decided a mere 3 weeks \nbefore Furgatch. In Massachusetts Citizens For Life, the Supreme Court \nsquarely affirmed its express advocacy test from the Buckley case. It \nseems that a law clerk in Furgatch was asleep on the job, and we should \nnot ignore Supreme Court precedent simply because of that. In fact, the \nNinth Circuit cited the First Circuit's opinion in Massachusetts \nCitizens For Life, not the Supreme Court's opinion in that case.\n\n  Furthermore, the amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania would \nallow the Government to regulate the speech of its citizens based on \n``external events.'' The Fourth Circuit not only ruled against the FEC \nwhen it tried to do this, but it actually awarded attorneys fees \nagainst the Federal Government for taking a legal position that was not \n``substantially justified,'' meaning that it did not have a good-faith \nbasis in the law.\n  If this amendment, coupled with the underlying bill, passes, the \nSecretary of the Treasury better get out his checkbook.\n  I understand what the Senator from Pennsylvania is trying to do. He \nis frustrated that the parties will be reduced and influenced under the \nunderlying bill and concerned that the outside groups will simply fill \nthe vacuum. I understand that and share that concern. Unfortunately, \nthere is simply no case law that will lead us to believe that such \nrestrictions are likely to be upheld. Therefore, it is with \nconsiderable reluctance that I have to say I will oppose the amendment \nof the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  How much time does the Senator from Tennessee wish to have?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank my friend.\n  I want to make a couple comments, partly in the nature of inquiring \nof my friend from Pennsylvania to make sure I understand his remarks. \nWe had an opportunity to talk briefly about this. I tried to listen to \nhis explanation.\n  First of all, I commend him for his good lawyering in recognizing \nthat findings of fact are certainly official in a situation such as \nthis in helping to create a record. From my perusal, I think that is \ncertainly well done. I do have a concern with regard to the other \nprovision of the amendment.\n  Buckley pretty clearly established that we could only regulate \nexpress advocacy under certain conditions or in certain ways. Buckley \nset forth the so-called magic words. In other words, if you have words \nin there saying ``vote for'' or ``vote against'' somebody, that is an \nexpress ad, and you can require people to have contribution limits, or \nnotice, or disclosure, and whatnot, with regard to those kinds of ads.\n  Clearly, time has proven that to be inadequate in many respects, and \nwhat Snowe-Jeffords does--and we will debate that later on--is it comes \nalong and says, in addition to those magic words, we think that also, \nif within 60 days of an election --and you know an election is around \nthe corner--you use the likeness of a candidate, that that also, in \neffect--and these are my words--is express advocacy. In other words, it \napplied its own bright-line test.\n  The Court in Buckley was concerned that people know what the rules of \nthe game were before they started speaking and that they not \ninadvertently get caught up in something not of their own making which \nwould penalize them in some way. They said you will certainly know if \nthe rule is words such as ``vote for'' or ``vote against.'' Anybody can \nunderstand that. Those are the rules. You know what you can and cannot \ndo.\n  I think the same thing applies to Snowe-Jeffords. You certainly know \nif you are running an ad within so many days, and if you are running \nthe likeness of someone. In either of those cases, I think you have a \nbright-line test. The average person can look at those situations and \ndecide whether or not to put themselves in the middle of that or not.\n  My concern is the language that is used. I understand that what I \nwould refer to as the unmistakable and unambiguous language of the \ncurrent amendment would be in addition to the Snowe-Jeffords \nrequirement. In other words, you would still have the likeness and 60-\nday requirement and, in addition to that, under this amendment, you \nwould have this:\n\n       . . .when read as a whole, and in the context of external \n     events, is unmistakable, unambiguous and suggestive of no \n     plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or \n     against a specific candidate. . . .\n\n  And so forth. That is my understanding. I think that is done in \naddition to tightening up Snowe-Jeffords, perhaps, in some way, to lay \nan additional requirement on Snowe-Jeffords to make it even tighter in \nsome ways.\n  That is a laudable goal, if it can be done. The only problem is that \nthis language being used to do that in and of itself is pretty clearly \nunconstitutional, it seems to me. We have a vagueness problem because \nwhen you ask yourself, do you have the bright line that you had in \nBuckley, such as ``vote for'' or ``vote against,'' or do you have the \nbright line, as in Snowe-Jeffords, such as you must use the likeness \nwithin 60 days, the answer must be no. The line here is unambiguous and \nsuggestive of no other meaning.\n\n  I think the Senator from Pennsylvania and I could agree probably on \njust about any ad as to whether or not it fit this bill, but certainly \nit is not definite enough, it seems to me, so that there could be no \nreasonable disagreement as to whether something was really a campaign \nad or not.\n  I sympathize with the effort, and I discussed this matter with my \nfriend and we jointly discussed what might and might not be done about \nit.\n  As I understand the explanation, and as I look at it, it seems to me \nthis misses the mark substantially in trying to apply some bright-line \ntest so the Supreme Court might arguably or\n\n[[Page S2710]]\n\npossibly uphold this as being, in effect, express advocacy and, \ntherefore, subject to regulation.\n  Obviously, I am going to listen with great care to my friend from \nPennsylvania, but those are my concerns.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nhis analysis and observations and the question he raises. I respond by \nnoting that where you have the likeness issue or requirement in Snowe-\nJeffords, that does not deal with the Buckley requirement of the magic \nwords ``vote for'' or ``vote against,'' and the likeness factor of \nSnowe-Jeffords is very similar to the language of McCain-Feingold which \nhas ``refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office.''\n  Buckley has said you have to do something more, and what you have to \ndo is be more explicit on voting for or against.\n  Furgatch comes to grips with that issue on the language of its \nholding by the Ninth Circuit that it meets the Buckley test, although \nit does not use the magic words because it refers to a message being \nunmistakable, unambiguous, and suggestive of no plausible meaning.\n  The ads which I read saying Clinton was wonderful and Dole was \nterrible were viewed as being issue ads--you have a clearly identified \ncandidate, which is McCain-Feingold, and you could have a likeness, \nwhich would satisfy Snowe-Jeffords, but that does not meet the Buckley \ntest.\n  I argue as strenuously as I can that if the standard is \n``unmistakable, unambiguous, and suggestive of no plausible meaning \nother than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific \ncandidate,'' that comes to grips directly--directly--with the issue of \nvagueness.\n  Let's discuss it for a minute or two, I say to Senator Thompson. How \ncan the Senator say there is anything vague about a standard which is \nunmistakable?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. May I respond to my friend? I think the difference here \nis the difference between something being unambiguous and something \nbeing called unambiguous.\n\n  In Buckley and in Snowe-Jeffords, standards are set out that one can \nlook at and conclude they are ambiguous or unambiguous. I do not \nbelieve we can in a statute just say that it must be unambiguous. In \nthe eyes of whom? In the eyes of a judge ultimately, I assume. That is \nlike saying your behavior will be legal and you will be punished, in a \ncriminal statute, behavior that is not legal. That begs the question. \nWhat behavior is allowed, and what behavior is disallowed? In this \ncase, it seems to me under the Supreme Court you have to have a bright \nline in the statute itself. You have to have something that you can \nlook at and conclude that it is unambiguous. You cannot just write in \nthe statute that this is unambiguous or it must be unambiguous to pass \nmuster in the eyes of a judge later. That is the distinction I make.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I disagree forcibly with my colleague \nfrom Tennessee. I do not think you have a bright line, you have a dull \nline. You have a definition which does not come to grips with what \nBuckley has said.\n  When the Senator from Tennessee makes an argument that it begs the \nquestion to say something is legal or not, that is a fact that turns on \na great many considerations as to whether something is legal or not. It \ninvolves a judgment and inferences.\n  When you are talking about a factual matter, about ``no plausible \nmeaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific \ncandidate,'' I again direct a question to the Senator from Tennessee: \nIn dealing with the standard of vagueness, how can you have language \nwhich is more definitive on its face?\n  Obviously, it is going to have to be applied. There is no question \nabout that. I read at some length, if the Senator from Tennessee had an \nopportunity to listen to the Dole ads, the Clinton ads, the Bush ads, \nor the Gore ads--let me start with that question.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. And a good deal of them would come under Snowe-\nJeffords, I believe, for starters.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Why would they come under Snowe-Jeffords?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. They mentioned the name of the candidate and came \nwithin 60 days of the election. Some of them can.\n  Let me get back, if I may, to the original issue. My question is, \nwhen the statute says that the words must be unambiguous, I ask: \nUnambiguous in whose eyes? Unambiguous to whom?\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may respond, that is always going to be a matter of \napplication, no matter what legal standard you have. However specific \nit is, it has to be applied.\n  When you refer, if I may direct this question to the Senator from \nTennessee, to Snowe-Jeffords covering the Dole ads, the Clinton ads, \nthe Gore ads, or the Bush ads, I think Snowe-Jeffords would cover the \nclearly identified candidate within a time limit, but it would not \nsatisfy Buckley. Those are viewed as issue ads. They do not satisfy \nBuckley.\n  With Furgatch, you advance the definition very substantially. You \nadvance the definition with as much precision as the English language \ncan give you. If you want to stick in ``vote for'' or ``vote against,'' \nOK, that is the language of Buckley.\n  My own legal judgment--and this is a legal issue which is susceptible \nto different interpretations; it is not like being unambiguous or \nsusceptible to no other interpretation--my view is that the language of \na specified candidate and a time limit and a likeness has not come to \ngrips with the specificity that Buckley looks for. They want something \nwhich is not vague.\n  Perhaps the challenge is to come up with language which satisfies the \nSenator from Tennessee that it is not vague. I am open to suggestions, \nbut I think we are not coming to grips with that clear-cut core issue \non avoiding vagueness with what you have absent a definition such as \nFurgatch.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If my friend would yield for a moment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I suppose my thinking is that the Snowe-Jeffords \nlanguage is much closer to the bright line requirement than this \nlanguage would be.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May I ask my friend from Tennessee what language he \nrefers to specifically?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. The language requiring the likeness of candidate used \nwithin 60 days of an election. That is an objective standard.\n  The Supreme Court in Buckley didn't say you must have an ad that is \nunambiguously a campaign ad. They said in that case, words such as \n``vote for'' or words such as ``vote against.'' Anybody can look at \nthat, even the Members of this body would have to all agree whether or \nnot that was in a particular ad.\n  That is a bright line.\n  Now Snowe-Jeffords comes along and provides its own bright line. We \nwill be debating that, as to whether or not it is sufficient, whether \nor not it complies with Buckley, or whether or not the Supreme Court \nmight take a look at it again and say it was unconstitutional in light \nof other circumstances.\n  Again, one can objectively look at an ad and tell whether or not it \nhas a likeness of a candidate. But you can't look at an ad and tell \nwhether or not it is unambiguous unless you get to court.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may direct this question to my colleague from \nTennessee, if the Clinton ads don't have the likeness but simply talk \nabout Gore, then would that satisfy the Snowe-Jeffords test?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I think it would--no, it would not. It requires the \nlikeness, as I recall--or does it require both?\n  It says ``refers to a clearly identified candidate.''\n  The answer is yes. I was wrong.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may reclaim the floor for the argument, if it \nrefers to a clearly identified candidate, it does not advance the issue \nbeyond the face of McCain-Feingold, which has ``refer to a clearly \nidentified candidate for Federal office.''\n  You have all of these ads which extol Clinton and defame Dole or vice \nversa, or extol Gore and defame Bush, which are held to be issue ads. \nBut you have a clearly identified candidate.\n  So I ask my friend, the Senator from Tennessee, how does that meet \nthe Buckley test, which was not met by these horrendous ads on both \nsides which, in any event, advocated the\n\n[[Page S2711]]\n\nelection of Clinton and the defeat of Dole? How does this language of \nSnowe-Jeffords, with a clearly identified candidate--which is the same \nas McCain-Feingold--advance to any extent the ads in the 1996 or 2000 \nelection which were viewed as issue ads?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If I may respond to my friend, I am not suggesting they \nadvance those ads. What I am suggesting is in McCain-Feingold, in the \nSnowe-Jeffords provisions of McCain-Feingold, it requires clear \nreference to mention of a fact that would be undisputable; that is, \nwhether or not a fellow's name, a person's name, is mentioned.\n  I believe that is closer to the Buckley standard, which says you have \nto have something objective. That is closer to the Buckley standard \nthan language which says ``in the context of external events, is \nunmistakable, unambiguous, and suggestive of no plausible meaning, \nother than an exhortation to vote.''\n  Again, that begs the question. Here is something that is unambiguous. \nHere is something you call unambiguous. That is the difference to me.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may refocus to the Senator from Tennessee: Put \naside the language of Furgatch, assume you are right about the language \nof Furgatch--and maybe we need some other language--how does Snowe-\nJeffords or language of a clearly identified candidate for Federal \noffice satisfy Buckley when the ads extolling Clinton and defaming \nDole, where there was a clearly identified candidate and you were \nwithin the time-frame and they were issue ads--would Snowe-Jeffords \ncover the Clinton ads in 1996?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I see what the Senator is getting at.\n  I think if this were passed and this were considered in the light of \na similar ad, this would catch it. Yes, I do. Because they would be \nreferring to a clearly identified candidate. If and when the Court \nconsiders the Snowe-Jeffords language, I think there is a reasonably \ngood chance they will uphold it as constitutional. If that becomes the \noperative language, or some operative language, along with the language \nthey had in Buckley--if all of that now is permissible and such an ad \nis run which mentions a clearly identified candidate, then it will be \napplicable at that time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may further pinpoint the question, does the Senator \nsay if Snowe-Jeffords had been in the Act, that the advertisement \nextolling Clinton and defaming Dole would have been held an advocacy ad \nin 1996?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I think so.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that draws the issue.\n  My own view is that it is conclusive that Snowe-Jeffords would not \nsatisfy Buckley, that we are looking for an avoidance of a vagueness \nstandard, that simply having a clearly identified candidate for Federal \noffice and a time parameter would not meet the requirement of Buckley \nwhich talks about ``vote for'' or ``vote against,'' that in the long \nhistory of many cases since 1976, over a 25-year-period, the best \nlanguage which has come forward is the Furgatch language. I believe \nthat, on its face, it passes constitutional muster.\n  There are a lot of decisions by the courts throwing out legislation \non the ground that the legislation is vague and, if legislation is \nvague, it doesn't satisfy requirements of due process of law. Many \ncourts have struggled mightily for 25 years, and the only court which \nhas come up with language is the Supreme Court of the United States. \nAnd as I say that, I know the Hornbook rule is you are supposed to not \nbe able to tell anybody if the Supreme Court denies cert. But it is \nalways mentioned the Supreme Court did not cert, and it is mentioned \nthe Supreme Court does not cert because of the impossible inference, \nbecause if the Supreme Court did not like Furgatch, it would have taken \ncert.\n  I know there is a contrary doctrine that says the Supreme Court is so \nbusy one cannot draw an inference, but I think in a practical sense you \ncan. So in 25 years of litigation and a lot of cases, the best that has \nevolved is this language which I submit to my colleagues is not vague \nwhen it says ``no plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote \nfor or against a specific candidate.'' That is not vague. But if we \nstand pat and pass this bill, there is a big risk of \nunconstitutionality. And if somebody has a way to eliminate vagueness \nmore precisely, I am open.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I stand in support of the amendment of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Delaware withhold? Who \nyields time to the Senator from Delaware?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am on the side of the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time would the Senator from Delaware like?\n  Mr. BIDEN. How much time does the Senator have? If he only has a few \nminutes--\n  Mr. DODD. How much time does my colleague need?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am a supporter of McCain-Feingold, so I \nam not inclined to be supportive of anything that is going to make the \neffort that is underway less effective in controlling these kinds of \nads. The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin indicated to me while the \nSenator from Pennsylvania was speaking--and I apologize; I did not \ncatch the intervention of the Senator from Tennessee because I was not \non the floor, so I may be being redundant, but it was indicated to me \nthat at least some who support this legislation, McCain-Feingold, fear \nthat if the standard being proposed by the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nwhich I support, is adopted, we will have inadvertently put in a two-\ntest hurdle.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Maine. Maybe she can be \nhelpful--that it would require, not only that you reach the Snowe-\nJeffords standard but that you then have to meet a second standard, \nthereby making it even more difficult to control the kinds of ads we \nare trying to get at here.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Maine or the Senator from Wisconsin--or \nanyone--could tell me why they think the Snowe-Jeffords standard would, \nin fact, capture the kinds of ads that the Senator from Pennsylvania \nhas been speaking to, which do not mention the name by name, or they \nmention by name but do not advocate whether to vote for or against that \ncandidate. Why would such ads be captured by the language of the Snowe-\nJeffords amendment? Would anybody wish to respond to that for me?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If I may, while the Senator from Maine has just \narrived, my own view is that Snowe-Jeffords captures all that it can, \nconstitutionally.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask the Senator, it would not capture an ad that said:\n\n       This is the NRA. The distinguished Senator from Tennessee \n     wishes to take away your shotgun. We think you have a right \n     to keep your shotgun. I hope you will consider this when you \n     vote.\n\n  It would not capture such an ad, would it?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If they make specific reference to me as a candidate, \nand I am running and they do it within 60 days of the election, Snowe-\nJeffords would capture that to the extent of requiring disclosure.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Even if they do not suggest whether to vote for or against \nthat Senator?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. So if a name is mentioned--it is the assertion of the \nsponsors and supporters of Snowe-Jeffords that if the name is mentioned \nin an ad, 60 days before election, by an advocacy group, that that \nwould be subject to regulation under this legislation?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Can my colleague explain to me why is that?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. It is in the bill. It is in the statute. It reads that \nway.\n  Why I think it is constitutional is that the Supreme Court for some \ntime now has said you can regulate express ads, express advocacy. What \nthe Court did in Buckley is define express advocacy--words such as \n``vote for, vote against.'' And it said the reason we are setting this \nout, in effect, is because you need a bright line. A person needs to be \nable to tell whether or not they are going to run afoul of the statute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n\n[[Page S2712]]\n\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That is what you get for asking me a question.\n  Mr. DODD. This is an important debate. I certainly yield 10 minutes \nor so, whatever.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will continue. Maybe the Senator moves on his time. It \ndoesn't matter. Continue, if the Chair will allow it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is under the control of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time does the Senator from Delaware require? \nFive minutes?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I really don't know.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. And I will yield to the Senator from Tennessee to continue \nhis answer.\n  Let me back up. If I can say to my friend from Tennessee, the \nlanguage in the McCain-Feingold bill on page 15 says:\n\n       In General.--The term ``electioneering communication'' \n     means any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication \n     which--[subsection] (i) refers to a clearly identified \n     candidate for elective office[.]\n\n  Is the interpretation of those who put that language in that it must \nmention the candidate by name?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I am going to defer to the Senator from Maine for that. \nI intruded on the time of the author of that provision enough on this. \nI will refer that question to her, if I may.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you. I thank the Senator from Tennessee and I will \nbe glad to respond to the Senator from Delaware.\n  In drafting this language, we attempted, obviously, to draw a very \nbright line, building upon the Buckley v Valeo decision back in 1976, \nthat was issued by the Supreme Court.\n  At that time, the Supreme Court was obviously responding to the law \nthat was on the books that was passed by Congress in 1974. And it used \nas examples the words, ``vote for or against'' as ways in which to \ndefine express advocacy.\n  Obviously that decision, nor their suggestions for examples, weren't \nlimited and Congress since that time has not passed legislation with \nrespect to campaign finance. So, therefore, there is nothing for the \nSupreme Court to react to.\n\n  So we looked at the various Court decisions and decided that the way \nin which we can carefully calibrate legislation that would allow for \ndisclosure and would require disclosure--and banning advertisements by \nunions and corporations within that 60-day period before a general \nelection, 30-day period before the primary--would be a way of avoiding \nany constitutional questions. And that bright line is referring to a \nclearly identified candidate for Federal office, that this \ncommunication is done 60 days before the general, 30 days before the \nprimary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, because I don't have much time, \nI understand how it comes in. What I don't understand, on whatever time \nI have remaining, and I thank the Senator for her response--I do not \nunderstand why that standard, A, would require redundancy, to have two \nstandards to be met--if the language was added by the Senator from \nPennsylvania which says--which when read as a whole in the context of \nexternal events is ``unmistakably unambiguous and suggestive of no \nplausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a \nspecific candidate.''\n  Granted three other circuits or four other circuits ruled differently \nthan the ninth circuit, but it seems to me the most damaging decision--\nthe most damaging thing that has happened to the electoral process has \nbeen Buckley. The single most damaging thing that has occurred in our \neffort to clean up the glut of money and the hemorrhaging of influence \nin the electoral process has been the Buckley decision.\n  Things were going relatively well until that decision occurred and \nthen the dam broke.\n  So I just want to say I think it is more appropriate to err on the \nside of being more specific and more inclusive, so that everyone \nunderstands that if it says ``vote against the Republican candidate'' \nbut doesn't mention the Republican candidate for the Senate, that in \nfact it is covered. If it says vote against the person who said the \nfollowing but doesn't name the person who said the following--if those \nways are used to get around what is now the attempt of having a \nprohibition on such activity and the hemorrhaging of money, it seems to \nme that is well captured by the ninth circuit language.\n  I would rather run the risk of seeing that happen because this is the \nmost damaging thing I have seen happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wonder if I can direct a question to \nthe Senator from Wisconsin. We were discussing this issue.\n  Is it the intent of this amendment to make it easier to identify an \nadvocacy ad, and to see to it that what has been seen as an issue ad, \nwhich clearly urges the election of a candidate and the defeat of an \nopponent, is classified as an advocacy ad?\n  I believe the language of Snowe-Jeffords would be consistent, and \nthis language would supplement. But if there is any doubt, the thought \noccurs to me that we might turn to page 15 where we find electioneering \ncommunications. It is i.ii.iii put into the disjunctive ``or'', and \npick up Furgatch, so that if you satisfy either standard you have an \nadvocacy ad.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That clearly would be a very different amendment. That \nis why I engaged in the conversation with the Senator from Delaware.\n  The relative process of this amendment is we have been looking at \nthis as clearly a conjunctive setup where you first have to meet the \nstandards of Snowe-Jeffords, and then you would have to meet the \nstandards of the Furgatch-like test.\n  There would be two obstacles to get over in order to be able to catch \none of these ads, which we like to call ``phony issue ads.''\n  I would be happy to consider it. The theory will not be how we work \nif it said ``or'', but this clearly says ``and''.\n  The Senator from Tennessee expressed it absolutely correctly.\n  The result will be that it will actually end up perhaps inadvertently \ncausing more of these phony issue ads to be unavailable for our desire \nto try to make them honest for what they are, which is electioneering \nads.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I don't know if the Senator from Tennessee made that \npoint.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I think the Senator from Tennessee would agree with \nthat.\n  Mr. SPECTER. But in any event, Mr. President, I can modify the \namendment--we haven't asked for the yeas and nays yet--to put in the \n``or'', the disjunctive instead of ``and'', the conjunctive so that \nthere is severability. And where one is decided to be inefficient to \nsatisfy the vagueness standards of Buckley, the other might be \nsufficient--picking up on what the Senator from Delaware said, having \nthe safeguard.\n  I am glad to yield to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I was wondering if we would not be \nreally worse off in that situation because under the Senator's original \namendment the language would be added to the Snowe-Jeffords language. \nSo we would still have the Snowe-Jeffords clearly identified candidate \nlanguage, which I think is going in the right direction. We would be \nadding that to that language.\n  Under the Senator's latest suggestion--if it was either/or--you might \nhave a situation where you would not have the Snowe-Jeffords language \nbut only the new language ``unmistakable, unambiguous,'' et cetera, \nwhich we have been discussing.\n  If I am correct this is a constitutional problem in terms of \nvagueness, then we would be less likely to have that upheld than if it \nwere coupled with what I believe is constitutionally permissible \nlanguage under Snowe-Jeffords.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may respond, if you have an ``or'', and you have \nseverability, then, if the Senator from Tennessee is correct, the \nstatute would be upheld under the Snowe-Jeffords language.\n  If the Senator from Pennsylvania is correct, and either is possible, \nif Snowe-Jeffords were stricken as being insufficient under a Buckley \ncase, but Furgatch and ``or'' was sufficient, and they are severable, \nand one was satisfactory to pass constitutional muster, we would be \nable to have the one which survived constitutional challenge.\n\n[[Page S2713]]\n\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If my friend will yield for a question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Could it be severable at that level? When we are \ntalking about severability, we are usually talking about provisions, or \nsections, and so forth. I don't have the answer to this. The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania might have the answer to this. The answer may be yes. \nBut I wonder whether or not within this very specific provision we \ncould actually have a provision where that would be severed so that \neither/or language would come under the severability provision.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may respond, I believe that is exactly what \nseverability means. That is when the Congress tries to figure out what \nthe Court is going to do. It is pretty hard to do. We really can't \ntell. We just had an extensive debate as to whether Snowe-Jeffords \nlanguage is constitutional, and whether Furgatch is constitutional. If \nwe put both of them in, and we make a legislative record that we are \nlooking for one or the other to be satisfactory, I believe that the \nlanguage of severability means just that.\n  If you have a long statute, and the Court strikes down one part of it \nsaying it is wrong, it leaves the rest of it. If the rest of it passes \nconstitutional muster, then it is constitutional. The severability \nissue really turns on constitutional doctrine as to whether the \nlegislation makes sense if it is severed. The Court will strike it down \nif by striking down a certain clause the rest of it doesn't carry out \ncongressional intent.\n\n  Congress tries to avoid that by the severability clause. But putting \nin a severability clause isn't an absolute guarantee that the Court \nmight not say it is non-severable, notwithstanding the severability \nclause, because a part was stricken leaving the rest of it as \nunintelligible, or insufficient, or not really meaningful.\n  But in this context if we say in this legislation we have Snowe-\nJeffords, or Furgatch, and if one of them measures up, then the statute \nsurvives.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Assuming for a moment that the Senator is correct--and \nhe may be--is my colleague going in this direction?\n  Knowing that we are going to have a severability vote a little bit \nlater on, knowing that as of this moment we don't know how that vote is \ngoing to turn out, would it be wise or appropriate to put this \namendment off until after that vote?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am willing to do that.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I appreciate what the Senator is trying to do with respect \nto the language. I hope we can defer in terms of the impact and what \neffect it would have on the overall language in Snowe-Jeffords. We are \nconcerned about being substantially too broad and too overreaching. The \nconcern that I have is it may have a chilling effect. The idea is that \npeople are designing ads, and they need to know with some certainty \nwithout inviting the constitutional question that we have been \ndiscussing today as to whether or not that language would affect them \nas to whether or not they air those ads.\n  That is why we became cautious and prudent in the Senate language \nthat we included and did not include the Furgatch for that reason \nbecause it invites ambiguity and vagueness as to whether or not these \nads ultimately would be aired or whether somebody would be willing to \nair them because they are not sure how it would be viewed in terms of \nbeing unmistakable and unambiguous. That is the concern that I have.\n  In terms of severability, again, I would like to know whether or not, \nin the Senator's view, the Court would consider that idea of having \nlayers of criteria, and if you do and say it is severable, in the \nmeantime there may have been an impact or a deterrent to individuals or \ngroups airing ads that are considered to be legitimate, but weren't \ncertain because of the ambiguity of the language that you are seeking \nto insert in McCain-Feingold.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Let me respond very briefly.\n  The thrust of Buckley is to require that there be a strong statement \nfor or against. You may have a sufficient standard when you have \nidentified a candidate within a given period of time. Or you may not \nbecause that may not be sufficiently forceful to meet what Buckley is \nlooking for as not being vague on ``for or against,'' for somebody or \nagainst somebody.\n\n  Then you pick up an alternative standard, which Furgatch had, where \nthe circuit court thought that was a sufficient statement: That you are \nfor a candidate or against a candidate. Then I think you have both \nlines.\n  When the Senator from Tennessee suggests deferring the vote, I am \nagreeable to that. It may lend more weight to having severability \nadopted if it has been to some specific reason in the statute.\n  I yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. First of all, this has been a very valuable discussion. \nWhile I think initially there was some concern about the Senator's \namendment, for the reasons articulated by the Senator from Tennessee, \nthe Senator from Kentucky, the Senator from Maine, the Senator from \nWisconsin, and others, the suggestion that the Senator from \nPennsylvania has made is a valuable one. The debate has been valuable.\n  There are some very serious issues that need to be thought through. \nThe Senator from Maine has raised a very worthwhile question. I would \nstrongly suggest that we lay this aside until the severability debate \noccurs. I think the Senator from Delaware agrees with that as well.\n  In the meantime, we can see if we can work on some language as well. \nSome of us may have some additional suggestions with the findings of \nfact. I say to my colleague, I could talk about some of those. I \nappreciate the need for findings of fact, but there may be a way of \ndoing this a little less graphically than he has in some instances. We \ncan see if we can reach an agreement on this, pending the outcome of \nthe severability debate. That is a very good suggestion.\n  But the Senator from Pennsylvania has made a very valuable \ncontribution to this debate this afternoon.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my friend from Connecticut.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to accede to the suggestion made by the \nSenate from Tennessee.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from North Carolina has an amendment.\n  Why don't you make that motion then, ask unanimous consent to lay it \naside?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be laid \naside until the vote has occurred on the severability amendment, and \nthat at that time the motion recur for debate. Should we set a time \nlimit at that time?\n  Mr. DODD. Why not just lay it aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Reserving the right to object, I am wondering if it \nwould be more appropriate to simply withdraw the amendment and offer it \nagain later.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I prefer to have it set aside. It has a certain status \nvalue. I will not object to any request to set it aside to offer other \namendments.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is satisfactory.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this has been a very valuable debate, \nas others have suggested. It demonstrates the complexity of regulating \nissue advocacy. I thank everyone who participated in this very \nenlightening amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 124\n\n  Now, we have Senator Landrieu on the floor with an amendment that has \nbeen cleared on both sides. And if she will call that amendment back \nup----\n  Mr. DODD. Might I inquire of my colleague, is there going to be a \nrequirement for a recorded vote on this amendment?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. No. I am prepared to have a voice vote.\n  Mr. DODD. We might be able to inform our colleagues----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I may, Senator Helms is here and prepared to offer \nan amendment. We would like to lock in Senator Helms' vote. We can't \nsay ``no more votes tonight'' unless we lock in Senator Helms' vote. He \nis prepared to\n\n[[Page S2714]]\n\noffer his amendment at the conclusion of the Landrieu amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. If I might make a unanimous consent request, I ask \nunanimous consent that when the Senate convenes at 9 a.m. tomorrow, \nthere be up to 15 minutes of debate on the pending Helms amendment, \nequally divided in the usual form, with a vote on or in relation to the \namendment to occur at the use or yielding back of that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Then we can debate that amendment tonight. I understand \nthere will be no further rollcall votes tonight; is that correct?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Would I be in order to ask unanimous consent that for \nthis amendment there be a voice vote tonight? Of course, I will abide \nby the wishes of the chairman and ranking member. I believe this \namendment has been cleared.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My understanding is there is no requirement for a \nrollcall vote on this side. So if the Senator would call up her \namendment, and tell us what it is, it is my understanding it will be \ncleared, and a voice vote would be appropriate.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am resubmitting the amendment. The staff has been \nworking on it. Basically, as I described earlier, this amendment would \nnot require any additional recording, no additional work on behalf of \nthe candidates. It would simply direct the FEC to come up with \nstandards for software so that our recording would basically be done \nelectronically, totally transparent and basically almost instantaneous.\n  There would be no changes of reports, no requirements for new \nreports, no requirements for new work, just basically instantaneous \ntransparency.\n  I think both sides have argued--and I definitely agree--that full \ndisclosure is one of the things we could do to improve it. That is what \nthis amendment does.\n  I offer it at this time.\n  Mr. DODD. Is this a modification?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. It is a modification?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. It is a modification of the original amendment. Senator \nMcConnell had some excellent points that were incorporated. We wanted \nto leave adequate time for the FEC to develop these new rules and \nprocedures. There is no deadline basically. It does not mandate the FEC \nto develop the software, but it allows them, I say to the Senator, to \ndevelop the standards. Industry develops the software and then makes it \navailable to us.\n  So for our constituents, for interested parties, and for journalists, \nour reporting will basically be as if you were accessing a Web site.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator earlier temporarily laid aside the amendment. I \nthink the Senator needs to ask unanimous consent to modify her \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. And that would be the amendment under consideration.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 124, As Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 124), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 37, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 305. SOFTWARE FOR FILING REPORTS AND PROMPT DISCLOSURE \n                   OF CONTRIBUTIONS.\n\n       Section 304(a) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 \n     (2 U.S.C. 434(a)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(12) Software for filing of reports.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Commission shall--\n       ``(i) promulgate standards to be used by vendors to develop \n     software that--\n\n       ``(I) permits candidates to easily record information \n     concerning receipts and disbursements required to be reported \n     under this Act at the time of the receipt or disbursement;\n       ``(II) allows the information recorded under subclause (I) \n     to be transmitted immediately to the Commission; and\n       ``(III) allows the Commission to post the information on \n     the Internet immediately upon receipt; and\n\n       ``(ii) make a copy of software that meets the standards \n     promulgated under clause (i) available to each person \n     required to file a designation, statement, or report in \n     electronic form under this Act.\n       ``(B) Additional information.--To the extent feasible, the \n     Commission shall require vendors to include in the software \n     developed under the standards under subparagraph (A) the \n     ability for any person to file any designation, statement, or \n     report required under this Act to be filed in electronic \n     form.\n       ``(C) Required use.--Notwithstanding any provision of this \n     Act relating to times for filing reports, each candidate for \n     Federal office (or that candidate's authorized committee) \n     shall use software that meets the standards promulgated under \n     this paragraph once such software is made available to such \n     candidate.\n       ``(D) Required posting.--The Commission shall, as soon as \n     practicable, post on the Internet any information received \n     under this paragraph.''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I commend our colleague from Louisiana. She worked very \nhard on this issue. I think it is very timely. I believe it is going to \nbe of great assistance to Members as well as the expediting of the \ninformation that will contribute significantly to the McCain-Feingold \nbill. She has made a significant and worthwhile contribution to this \nprocess. I commend her for it.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As I indicated, we have reviewed the amendment with \nthe Senator from Louisiana. It has been approved by us. There is no \nneed for a rollcall vote. We would be happy to have the amendment \nadopted on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do the Senators yield back their time?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield back whatever time I have remaining.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe we are now ready for a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has all time been yielded back?\n  Mr. DODD. The time is yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n124, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 124), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from North Carolina is \nhere, and before yielding the floor so he may offer an amendment, I \nwant to make a couple of observations about what he is trying to do, \nvery briefly.\n  With regard to union members' rights, we have had a vote on getting \nthe consent of members with regard to their dues and how it may be \nspent. That has been called a poison pill. That has been voted down. We \nhave had a vote on consent.\n  We have had a vote on disclosure, trying to get the unions to \ndisclose how they spend their money, the biggest player in American \npolitics. There was an effort made on the floor of the Senate to get \nsimple disclosure of how the money is spent. That was described as a \npoison pill. That went down.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is now, I am told, going to offer an \namendment regarding notification. If union members are denied the right \nto consent, they are denied the opportunity to learn from disclosure, \nnow the Senator from North Carolina is going to give the Senate an \nopportunity to see whether at least they can be notified when something \nis going to happen with their money.\n  Before he offers the amendment and takes the floor, I appreciate the \ngood work of the Senator from North Carolina and I look forward to \nsupporting his amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to make my remarks seated at my desk\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S2715]]\n\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 141\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nthat it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 141.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require labor organizations to provide notice to members \n concerning their rights with respect to the expenditure of funds for \n             activities unrelated to collective bargaining)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DISCLOSURE OF EXPENDITURES BY LABOR ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \n     158) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(i) Notice to Members and Employees.--A labor \n     organization shall, on an annual basis, provide (by mail) to \n     each employee who, during the year involved, pays dues, \n     initiation fees, assessments, or other payments as a \n     condition of membership in the labor organization or as a \n     condition of employment (as provided for in subsection \n     (a)(3)), a notice that includes the following statement: `You \n     have the right to withhold the portion of your dues that is \n     used for purposes unrelated to collective bargaining. The \n     United States Supreme Court has ruled that labor \n     organizations cannot force dues-paying or fees-paying non-\n     members to pay for activities that are unrelated to \n     collective bargaining. You have the right to resign from the \n     labor organization and, after such resignation, to pay \n     reduced dues or fees in accordance with the decision of the \n     Supreme Court.' ''.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I certainly thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky. He is doing a masterful job under rather difficult \ncircumstances. I congratulate him.\n  Mr. President, a healthy and meaningful political system must rest \nupon two obvious democratic principles: (1) the political freedom \nguaranteed by the first amendment must be premised on the notion of \nvoluntary participation and free association, and (2) the only \nconstitutional restraint the federal government should place upon \npolitical discourse is full disclosure of donations to assure political \naccountability of and by candidates for contributions they receive.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill before the Senate, with all due respect to \nboth Senators--and I admire both of them--fails to uphold either of \nthose essential ideals.\n  In regards to the new restraints placed upon both candidates and \ntheir supporting interest groups, the able Senator from Kentucky, Mr. \nMcConnell, and others are making the case that the McCain-Feingold bill \nfails to pass constitutional muster.\n  I certainly agree that the limitations on free speech in the McCain-\nFeingold bill are antithetical to any reasonable notion of political \nfreedom, and further, they make mockery of our time-honored tradition \nof free political discourse. I add only that limitations on the \nopportunity for citizens to participate in political debates, \nespecially during federal elections, serves only to enhance the power \nof the major news media, which consistently demonstrates their built-in \nbias against conservative candidates.\n  However, my purpose today is to focus the Senate's attention on, \narguably, a more pernicious violation of democratic principles \ncountenanced--and, in fact, in some ways, exacerbated, by the well-\nintentioned McCain-Feingold legislation before us. The problem I shall \naddress is this: the unapologetic practice by labor unions in using \ndues taken from their members as a condition of employment and the use \nof those dues for political purposes without approval of those working \npeople--indeed, without their knowledge.\n  In the context of campaign-finance reform debate, we've heard many \ntimes the words of Thomas Jefferson, who declared, ``To compel a man to \nfurnish contributions for the propagation of opinions which he \ndisbelieves is sinful and tyrannical.'' But Mr. Jefferson's declaration \ncries out for repeated repetition, less we forget it has continued to \nhappen year after year, election after election, as labor union bosses \ncontinue to spend the membership dues paid by union workers--spent on \npolitical causes bearing absolutely no relation to the collective \nbargaining process for which the union exists.\n  The amendment I propose makes certain that union members have full \naccess to their rights regarding political spending by union bosses. \nThis amendment will end the disgraceful attempt by the union bosses to \nhide the Supreme Court-guaranteed rights of union workers, making sure \nthey have clear notice of their right to object to expenditures not \nrelated to collective bargaining.\n  The workers who are forced to pay the dues to get their jobs are \nentitled to this information, Mr. President. They are also entitled to \nknow that national labor unions are pouring money into the political \nsystem at enormously unprecedented rates.\n  In fact, the unions have extensive involvement in political affairs. \nTestifying before the Senate Rules Committee, Laurence Gold, a \nrepresentative of the AFL-CIO said this about union activities:\n\n       Specifically, the AFL-CIO, its 68 national and \n     international union affiliates, and their tens of thousands \n     of local union affiliates engage in substantial legislative \n     and issue advocacy at the federal, state and local levels on \n     matters of particular concern to working families, such as \n     Social Security, Medicare, education, labor standards, health \n     care, retirement plans, workplace safety and health, trade \n     immigration, the right to organize, regulation of union \n     governance and the role of unions and corporations in \n     electoral politics.\n\n  That's a broad range of issues, Mr. President, and the union presumes \nto speak for its membership on each and every one.\n  But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Labor union activity in the \nrealm of politics goes far beyond the advocacy mentioned by Mr. Gold. \nAccording to the Americans for Tax Reform, Big Labor has mobilized for \nan array of left-wing causes, including opposition to the balanced \nbudget amendment, opposition to ending racial preferences, opposition \nto tax relief, and opposition to welfare reform. In fact, Mr. \nPresident, the Teamsters union spent almost $200,000 lobbying for a \nballot initiative in the State of California to legalize marijuana.\n  It turned out, Mr. President, that one of the reasons that the \nTeamsters had given money in support of that particular ballot \ninitiative was to further a money laundering scheme to pay for the re-\nelection of Teamsters President Ron Carey.\n  And these examples don't begin to describe the daily activities that \nunion bosses can engage in to further its political agenda. So-called \n``in-kind'' contributions, including get-out-the-vote phone banks; \ncommunications with union members; assignment of workers to precincts; \ndistribution of literature; and other unregulated union expenditures \nmake up the vast majority of union political activity.\n  Small wonder, then, that many employees forced to pay union dues as a \ncondition of employment are unhappy that they are forced to finance the \npolitical activities of the union.\n  These union workers who object to the blatant use of coerced dues \nbeing used for political speech were finally given a ray of hope in a \nseries of Supreme Court decisions that began to clarify the \nconstitutional and statutory problems with such a scheme.\n  The constitutional problem with using forced dues for political \nspeech was addressed directly in 1977, when the Supreme Court decided \nAbood v. Detroit Board of Education. The Supreme Court held in this \ncase that the first amendment guaranteed an individual ``the freedom to \nassociate for the purpose of advancing beliefs and ideas'' as well as a \ncorresponding right ``to refrain from doing so, as he sees fit.''\n  Mr. President, Abood is a landmark case debunking the notion that \ncompelled political speech is consistent with constitutional rights. \nThe Court had developed the right of freedom from coerced speech in a \nnumber of cases, the most prominent of which is Communications Workers \nof America v. Beck. In that case, a group of telephone workers \npetitioned to withhold the amount of their union dues that supported \nactivities outside the collective bargaining context.\n  The Supreme Court decided in favor of the workers, holding that an \nemployee who is compelled to join a union in order to get a job, under \na union security clause, could lawfully withhold\n\n[[Page S2716]]\n\nthe portion of his or her dues supporting activities not germane to \ncollective bargaining, contract administration or grievance adjustment. \nThe Court also held that if unions ignored an employee's objection to \nthe use of agency fees for such purposes, the union was in violation of \nits duty of fair representation.\n\n  Unfortunately, the Beck case applies only to employees who pay so-\ncalled ``agency fees,'' and a worker hoping to exercise his \nconstitutional right to free speech must first resign from a union to \npetition for the return of dues used for union activities unrelated to \ncollective bargaining.\n  This places the worker in the unenviable position of having to decide \nwhether retaining his political integrity is worth giving up any voice \nin the union decision-making process.\n  I deeply admire the courage of employees who seek to exercise their \npolitical freedom in the face of union hostility, and I believe they \ndeserve honest, timely information about the rights guaranteed to them \nby the Supreme Court. But all too often, workers may be unaware that \nthey even have such rights. Because, Mr. President, unions continue to \nhide the rights guaranteed by Beck despite clear direction from the \nNLRB that both agency-fee paying nonmembers and union members alike \nwere entitled to notification.\n  What's worse, the NLRB often acts as a collaborator with union \nbosses, issuing a line of decisions making it easier for unions to hide \nBeck rights. In California Saw and Knife Works--the main administrative \ndecision implementing the Beck case--the Board gave unions broad leeway \nto (1) bury notification of Beck rights in the back pages of monthly \nnewsletters; (2) pool its expenses in such a way as to hide costs to \nlocal bargaining units; and (3) rely on internal auditors instead of \nindependent examiners.\n  To understand how far the union is willing to go in order to hide \nunion worker rights from its members, one has to look no farther than \nthe case of Keith Thomas. v. Grand Lodge of International Association \nof Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Here's what happened in that case: \nIn 1959, Congress passed the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure \nAct of 1959 LMRDA. At that time, the IAM notified its members of their \nrights under the new law.\n  And that's it. During the next forty years, the union bosses at the \nIAM never lifted another finger to provide notice of rights guaranteed \nby Congress under LMRDA. As the Court put it, ``The union argues that \nCongress was only interested in informing 1959 union members of their \nLMRDA rights, but was perfectly willing to let ignorance reign for the \nnext forty years.'' The Court rightly noted that such a proposition was \nabsurd and went on to hold that this one-time notice was insufficient \nto guarantee worker rights.\n  So my amendment, Mr. President, proposes that what happened to Keith \nThomas and his fellow union workers not be allowed to happen to any \nunion member in regards to their rights under the Beck case. It simply \nprovides that unions be required to provide annual notice, by mail, of \nthe rights guaranteed to them by the Supreme Court.\n  Specifically, the notice states the following:\n\n       You have the right to withhold the portion of your dues \n     that is used for purposes unrelated to collective bargaining. \n     The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that labor organizations \n     cannot force dues-paying or fees-paying non-members to pay \n     for activities that are unrelated to collective bargaining. \n     You have the right to resign from the labor organization and, \n     after such resignation, to pay reduced dues or fees in \n     accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court.\n\n  The Senate has already voted to deny workers financial information \nabout the activities of the union. But even if the Senate is unwilling \nto provide reasonable disclosure of union expenditures, it can at least \nallow workers to know the rights guaranteed them by the Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I am absolutely convinced that adoption of this \namendment is the only way to make sure that union members know the \nrights guaranteed by the Supreme Court. I hope the Senate will go on \nrecord as supporting full and fair access to information for American \nworkers.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. HELMS. I understand. I will try again later.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the introduction of S. 602 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, many of us have advanced or supported \ncampaign finance reform legislation for many years, but without having \nthe votes to prevail or even to obtain a full debate. Successful \nlegislation to reform campaign finance laws usually has had to follow \non the heels of particular campaign finance scandals, such as the \nWatergate affair.\n  It is different this time. The reason that campaign finance reform \nhas been given a prominent and early place on the Senate's calendar is \nthat sufficient support has risen up from the grassroots to ensure that \nthis debate takes place. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have signed \npetitions or called their representatives in Congress. Rallies have \nbeen mounted in cities and towns from coast to coast. And Senators \nMcCain and Feingold have built enough political capital for this bill \nthat, in a very real sense, on this issue they have become the public's \nmessengers to the Congress.\n  I commend our Senate leaders, as well as Senators McCain and \nFeingold, for creating a framework for this debate that has contributed \nto its constructiveness. This is the kind of open debate that was usual \nwhen I joined the Senate 26 years ago but that has become rarer in \nrecent years. The Senate tends to be at its best in open debate like \nthis.\n  Washington has spent much of the first 3 months of this year \nfulfilling President Bush's perceived mandate to make the Nation safer \nfor huge corporations. Let us count some of the ways. First, Congress \nrushed to make its first order of business the repeal of the Department \nof Labor's 10-year quest to refine and implement ergonomics regulations \nto make workplaces safer for the American people. Next Congress spent \nweeks on a bankruptcy bill that lobbyists had convinced us to skew so \nthat it would further increase the record profits of credit card \ncompanies. And now, in rapid-fire succession, the White House is \nrolling back one environmental protection after another, affecting the \nvery air we breathe and the water we drink.\n  At last, with this debate, we are finally tackling one of the true \npriorities of the American people: the mandate that Senator McCain \nearned with his extraordinary grassroots campaign to reform the way we \nfinance our elections. We all owe Senators McCain and Feingold a debt \nfor their dedicated and persistent support of such an important and \nnecessary improvement to our election process, and I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of their bill.\n  The main component of the McCain-Feingold bill is a giant step toward \neliminating soft money from the electoral process. The raising and \nspending of soft money proliferated tremendously since we last amended \nthe Federal Election Campaign Act in 1979. In 1984, both political \nparties raised $22 million in soft money. In the 2000 election cycle, \nthey raised $463 million in soft money alone. The political parties \nraised more than 20 times as much in soft money last year than they did \nin 1984. The hundreds of millions of dollars that flow into campaigns \nwithout any accountability increase the likelihood that money will have \na corrupting influence on our electoral system.\n  The American people are being bombarded with television \nadvertisements, mailings and newspaper ads funded by soft money. Often, \nthe\n\n[[Page S2717]]\n\namount of money being spent by candidates themselves is dwarfed by the \namount of soft money spent by others in their own races.\n  The ban on soft money that the McCain-Feingold bill demands is an \nessential step to diminish the tremendous amount of money pouring into \ncampaigns. Some opponents of the bill claim that banning soft money is \nunconstitutional. Senators McCain and Feingold have taken extra \nmeasures to ensure that the provisions in this bill comply with the \nSupreme Court's 1976 decision in Buckley v. Valeo. The court ruled that \nthe Constitution permits the Government to regulate the flow of money \nin politics to prevent corruption or the appearance of corruption.\n  Political service remains a worthy calling, but anyone who enters it \nthese days encounters a campaign fundraising system that is \ndebilitating and demeaning and distasteful. The fact that we so clearly \nhave ineffective checks on the spiraling cost of campaigns and on the \nway campaigns are financed has tarnished our institutions of Government \nas well as the people we elect to those institutions.\n  It is important to bring our election process and Government back to \nthe time when elected officials felt accountable to all of the people \nthey represent, not disproportionately to the wealthy few. Our present \nsystem gives the wealthy a huge megaphone for expressing their views, \nwhile other Americans--the ``financially inarticulate''--are left \nwithout an effective voice. That is why I have felt it important to \ntake steps on my own to increase Vermonters trust in how I conduct my \ncampaigns. Though not required by law I have disclosed every nickel in \ncontributions I have ever received since I first ran for the Senate in \n1974, and I used no political action committee money in my last two \nelection campaigns. Passing the McCain-Feingold bill--without any \namendments designed to weaken it or destroy it--is a fundamental step \nall of us can take to fix a system that is in dire need of repair. \nVermonters and all Americans want to have faith in the campaign and \nelection process. They want to believe that their Government is working \nin the public's interest, not on behalf of the special interests. \nEliminating unregulated soft money will help to give elections and the \nGovernment back to the people.\n  I hope the Senate will not let this opportunity for reform slip away. \nI hope the Senate will approve this important and long-awaited bill and \nwill refrain from adding any amendments that would jeopardize or kill \nthis important effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/22/senate-section/article/S2717-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S.J.

Mr. President, I am a product of the West Virginia coal \nfields. I remember my heritage, and I am proud that it has served me \nwell throughout my political career. I remember the legendary president \nof the United Mine Workers of America, John L. Lewis, who was a great \nstudent of Shakespeare, as I recall him in those days. And he once \nadvised union coal miners of the adage:\n\n       when ye be an anvil,\n       lie very still,\n       when ye be a hammer,\n       strike with all thy will.\n\n  Mr. President, I am not an anvil--not an anvil--which explains, in \npart, why I joined the Senate Budget Committee this year. First, I am \nvery concerned about Congress approving permanent tax cuts based on \nhighly uncertain surplus estimates, which threaten to put us back in \nthe deficit ditch. Second, I strenuously oppose the use of the \nreconciliation process--now, Mr. President, that is the way I have \npronounced that word for years. I was called to order a little earlier \ntoday because I did not pronounce it ``reconciliation,'' which is all \nright with me, just so it is understood what we are talking about--to \nram a $2 trillion tax-cut package through the Senate. Such a misuse of \nthe reconciliation process abuses the rights of every Senator to debate \nthis significant legislation. That is an important thing. Third, in \nrecent years, I have become increasingly concerned about the \nunrealistically low spending levels established by the annual budget \nresolutions for programs under the jurisdiction of the Appropriations \nCommittee, on which I serve as the ranking member and which is chaired \nby the most able and distinguished Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, \nwho recently won the award ``Alaskan of the Century.'' And I would say \nat this point, I think he is the Alaskan of the Century. He deserves \nthat award.\n\n  These unrealistically low funding levels in recent budget resolutions \nhave forced the Appropriations Committee to resort to all manner of \ngimmicks and creative bookkeeping to ensure that we could adequately \nfund the 13 annual appropriations bills, despite not having sufficient \nresources to address the ongoing infrastructure needs of the Nation, \nmuch less begin to address the funding backlog in those funding needs \nin many critical areas.\n  So as a member of the Budget Committee, my hope was that this year I \nwould be able to assist in crafting a budget resolution that would more \naccurately determine the spending levels that will be necessary to \nproduce the FY 2002 appropriations bills. I wanted to actively \nparticipate in that committee in a markup of the budgetary blueprint \nthat will guide the Nation's fiscal policy, not only for FY 2002, but \nfor the next decade. This year's budget resolution will address not \nonly the discretionary funding needs to which I have alluded, but also \nwill involve efforts to allow for perhaps a massive tax cut of $2 \ntrillion or more, over the next 10 years. That is a big--$2 trillion is \njust something that is beyond my comprehension, and probably that of \nmost Members of this body.\n  I might say to the distinguished Senator who presently presides over \nthe Senate that, much to his surprise, perhaps, it would take 32,000 \nyears to count $1 trillion at the rate of $1 per second. At the rate of \n$1 per second, it\n\n[[Page S2718]]\n\nwould take 32,000 years to count $1 trillion. That is a little more \nmoney than we are used to counting in West Virginia. But when we talk \nabout a $2 trillion tax cut, that means it would take 64,000 years to \ncount $2 trillion at the rate of $1 per second. Perhaps that will give \nus some better idea of how much $1 trillion really is.\n  This year's budget proposal will also be based on flimsy 10-year \nsurplus projections, that, I assure you, are not worth the paper on \nwhich they are written.\n  Marvel at how much confidence we put in projections of the surpluses \nover the next 10 years when we cannot really judge 24 hours ahead that \nthe stock market is going to drop 436 points.\n  It was for these reasons, Mr. President, that I was pleased to see \nthat the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici, and his very capable ally on the Budget Committee, Senator \nConrad, scheduled a series of highly informative hearings in order to \nenable the 22 members of the committee to have the views of an \noutstanding group of experts before it was time for those committee \nmembers to vote on this year's budget resolution. Committee members did \nbenefit by actively participating in those hearings and by interacting \nwith a vast array of expert witnesses, who addressed such important \nsubjects as: the Nation's infrastructure needs; the need for \nprescription drug benefits for Medicare recipients; the need to reform \nSocial Security and Medicare, and other health care issues, education \nneeds; national security needs, including the need for a national \nmissile defense system; the problems of our Nation's farmers; and \nquestions as to how much of the national debt can be retired over the \ncoming decade. We had an opportunity to have the views of such experts \nas Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on such questions as to \nwhether a tax cut should be enacted, and if so, how large. We had the \nDeputy Director of the Congressional Budget Office, Mr. Barry Anderson, \ntestify on the CBO's projections of surpluses and the likelihood that \ntheir 10-year projections would come to pass. I know, that I gained a \ngreater understanding through these hearings in virtually all of the \naforementioned areas of national policy. Not only did my increased \nknowledge come from these expert witnesses, but also from the very \nincisive questioning of the witnesses by virtually every member of the \nSenate Budget Committee.\n  Having heard these witnesses, Mr. President, and having had a chance \nto enter into a dialog with them regarding these great issues facing \nthe Nation, I have become very concerned in recent weeks that the \nBudget Committee chairman might be entertaining the idea that there \nshould be no committee markup of the budget resolution at all this \nyear. I inquired of the very able chairman on two occasions during the \ncommittee's hearings as to whether the chairman intended to mark up the \nbudget resolution.\n  I am concerned at the prospect that the Senate will take up this \nyear's very important budget resolution without having the benefit of \nthe committee's views in the form of its marked-up resolution and an \naccompanying Budget Committee report. It is because of this concern \nthat I joined my Democratic colleagues on the committee in signing a \nletter to our able committee chairman respectfully requesting a markup \nof the budget resolution before the April 1st statutory deadline. As \npointed out in the letter, circumventing a committee markup of the \nbudget resolution is unprecedented and has never been done before in \nthe history of the Senate Budget Committee, as far as I have been able \nto determine. It ought not to be done this year, of all years. If we do \nnot intend to mark up a budget resolution, then I ask the Senate, why \ndid we go through the process of hearing the expert witnesses? Was this \nhearing process merely intended to be a charade to enable the \nleadership of the Senate to act as though it had fulfilled its \nresponsibilities, while knowing all along that there was no intention \nof allowing any member of the committee an opportunity to participate \nin a committee markup? If that be true, it didn't really matter, then, \nin the end, perhaps, what the witnesses said or what the questions of \nthe Senators on the committee revealed.\n  Is none of this knowledge to be utilized during the forthcoming days \nof debate on the resolution? Why should we not have had a markup, a \nmarkup where Senators may offer their amendments to the chairman's \nrecommendations and have those amendments debated and voted upon, \neither up or down?\n  Having been chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the Senate \nonce upon a time, I know how that works. The chairman prepares, with \nhis staff, the bill or resolution that is to be worked on by the \ncommittee, and that is what we call the chairman's mark, and, of \ncourse, it is always made available to the ranking member what the \nappropriations bill mark will be. Then laying it before the committee \ngives every member a chance to offer amendments thereto, have them \nvoted up or down, and debate the bill.\n  Apparently, there is some fear that such a markup of a budget \nresolution would result in a deadlock, that a tie vote might occur on \nadoption of the budget resolution. That concern should not in any way \nprevent the Budget Committee from marking up a budget resolution. If \nsuch an event occurs, if the committee were to be deadlocked on \nreporting this year's budget resolution, there would still be no \nimpediment to having the leadership call up the budget resolution. In \nother words, it is provided for that such a resolution can be called up \non April 1 and, if it is not reported from the committee by April 1, \nthe committee is automatically discharged of the resolution. So the \nSenate could be assured that even if there were a tie vote in \ncommittee, the resolution could still be called up by the majority \nleader.\n  The agreement that was entered into not so long ago by the majority \nleader and the Democratic leader and by the Senate as a whole provided \nthat in the case of a tie vote in committee, the majority leader could \nproceed to call up the resolution. That is in accordance with the \nagreement, as I understood it, that we entered into earlier this year.\n  In other words, the leadership would still have the ability to call \nup the Republican chairman's budget resolution. But the American \npeople, as well as other Members of the Senate and their staffs, will \nhave an opportunity to watch and listen to the debate, if we had a \ncommittee markup. This would be healthy for the budget process. It \nwould greatly enhance the knowledge of those who might participate in \nsuch a markup, as well as those who might observe it.\n  It does not bode well for the Senate or for this administration, for \nthat matter, in my judgment, to begin this year's budget cycle on such \na sour and unprecedented note. I repeat the request that we Democratic \nmembers of the committee have made in our earlier letter to the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, namely, that the committee convene at \nthe earliest practicable time to mark up the fiscal year 2002 budget \nresolution, and that the committee meet its April 1 statutory deadline \nin doing so.\n  I feel I must also address another concern that I have regarding this \nyear's budget process. After having been told several weeks ago by \nvarious administration officials that the President's detailed budget \nwould be received by the Senate on April 3, in time for Senators to \ntake into account the details behind the document entitled ``A \nBlueprint for New Beginnings,'' we were advised just a few days ago--I \nbelieve on Monday of this week--that the Senate will not receive the \ndetailed budget until April 9. It just so happens that April 9 falls on \nthe Monday beginning a 2-week Easter recess, and also occurs 3 days \nafter the Senate Republican leadership has expressed an intention of \nhaving completed Senate consideration of the budget resolution.\n  In other words, we have learned just this past Monday that Senators \nwill have no opportunity, none, to consider the details of the Bush \nadministration's fiscal year 2002 budget until after the Senate has \nfinished consideration of the budget resolution.\n  This causes me grave concern, particularly as it relates to the \nlevels of discretionary spending being proposed by the administration. \nWe do not have the details of what the President intends to propose as \nspending levels for a myriad of Federal Government programs and \nactivities that affect virtually every citizen of this Nation. In\n\n[[Page S2719]]\n\nthe document that we have received from the Bush administration \nentitled ``A Blueprint for New Beginnings,'' we find that table S-4 on \npage 188 contains the following items under the heading ``Offsets'': \nNon-repetition of earmarked funding $-4.3 billion; non-repetition of \none-time funding, $-4.1 billion; and Program decreases $-12.1 billion. \nThe figures again, to repeat them, $-4.3 billion, $-4.1 billion, and \n$-12.1 billion, minuses in each case, respectively. And following these \nthree cuts in discretionary spending for fiscal year 2002 is a footnote \nwhich states: ``The final distribution of offsets has yet to be \ndetermined.''\n  So, Mr. President, we have no idea as to what the specific reductions \nwill be for $20 billion in spending cuts that are proposed on page 188 \nof the President's ``blueprint'' for this year's budget.\n  We do know that nondefense spending overall will have to be cut $5.9 \nbillion below what the Congressional Budget Office says is necessary to \nmaintain purchasing power for current service levels. We know the \nAgriculture Department will be cut by 8.6 percent. The Commerce \nDepartment will be cut by 16.6 percent. The Energy Department will be \ncut by 6.8 percent. The Justice Department will be cut by 8.8 percent. \nThe Labor Department will be cut 7.4 percent. The Transportation \nDepartment will be cut by 15 percent.\n  What we do not know--and what we cannot know until the President \nsubmits his complete budget on April 9--is what specific programs the \nadministration proposes to cut, and by how much, in order to \naccommodate the President's $2 trillion tax cut plan. So we are \noperating in the dark; really, that is what it amounts to. Why should \nSenators be asked to take up and adopt a budget resolution calling for \na $2 trillion tax cut without knowing the specific spending cuts that \nwould be required? Why should we buy a pig in a poke? Why should we \nengage in a riverboat gamble, just like we did with the Reagan-Bush tax \ncut of 1981, which put us in the deficit ditch for 17 years? We ought \nnot make that same mistake again.\n  In recent weeks, I have seen Senators swept up in the political \nwhirlwind, a vortex that has been blown in from Texas. Neither the \nOffice of Management and Budget nor the Congressional Budget Office is \nable to accurately project surpluses at the end of the current fiscal \nyear, let alone for 10 years. Yet the Senate will soon be considering a \n10-year spending and tax cut plan. We are being asked to do so without \nthe benefit of seeing the President's complete budget, or the benefit \nof having a committee markup. So I wonder if the inmates have not \nfinally taken over the asylum.\n  Earlier, I commented on how the budget process has deteriorated in \nrecent years because of unrealistically tight spending caps that forced \nthe Appropriations Committee to resort to all manner of measures to \npass the 13 appropriations bills. Sometimes I wonder how Senator Ted \nStevens has been able to do it. The budget process has truly taken \nanother turn for the worse. It is a massive charade when Budget \nCommittee members are not even allowed to mark up this year's budget \nresolution, or to have the benefit of the details behind the \nPresident's budget blueprint before acting on this vitally important \nfiscal plan for the Nation.\n  The American people do not send us here to be anvils. They do not \nsend us here to lie very still and simply accept whatever is put before \nus. The committee should be given the opportunity to hammer out an \nacceptable budget that will benefit all Americans. Such a budget could \nbe hammered out upon the anvil of free and unlimited debate. I don't \nmind having a limitation, as far as that is concerned. I may be very \nopposed to such a radical tax cut, but I am not for killing it by \nfilibuster. That would not be my desire at all. The committee members \nshould be allowed to offer amendments and have those amendments be \nconsidered and voted upon. I studied for these hearings like a school \nboy preparing for an exam. I am new on the committee and I wanted to \nunderstand as much as I could about the budget and about the new \nPresident's proposals so that I could be a useful force--limited though \nI may be--at the committee markup. I have had my staff prepare \namendments which I had hoped to offer. But, apparently, the hearings \nwhich many members so faithfully attended are going to amount to little \nmore than a TV show with Senators on the committee serving as \nconvenient props. Why have a Budget Committee at all if the committee \nis not going to be allowed to work its will on the budget resolution? \nWhy ask questions? Why have testimony? Why take up the time of \nwitnesses and members?\n\n  Especially when the new budget embodies such radical tax cuts and \ndeep spending cuts, the committee should be able to work its will. That \nis all I am asking. So I hope the distinguished Budget Committee \nchairman will think about this more over the weekend and reconsider his \nearlier announced intentions. Especially when the budget sets fiscal \npolicy for the next 10 years, the committee should be able to work its \nwill. Especially when the American economy has lately been behaving \nlike a roller-coaster ride at the State fair, the committee should be \nable to work its will.\n  The Budget Committee hearings must not be reduced to a ``Gong Show'' \ncharade designed to make members feel good, but deny them any real \nvote. I hope the decision to avoid a markup will be revisited. I hope \nit will be revisited. The Senate deserves the full committee's judgment \nand nothing less.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. \nMcConnell, and I thank the distinguished Democratic whip, Mr. Reid, and \nall other Senators, for the opportunity to make these remarks. As I \nsaid earlier, I would not have come to the floor at this time were it \nnot for the fact that I noted on the television screen that the Senate \nwas in a prolonged quorum.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will soon suggest the absence of a \nquorum and ask that the time be charged equally to both sides. Before \nthat, if all of the time is used on this amendment, what time would the \nvote occur?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 4:35.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the Members of the Senate who may be \nlistening, or staff members, it is our hope to vote well before that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I have just come from the Senate Budget \nCommittee where we have concluded a series of hearings. We have now \nheld 16 different hearings on all facets related to the budget, tax \ncuts, and domestic spending. I am very deeply concerned about the \nconclusion that has been reached at the end of these very important \nhearings.\n  I must rise today with deep regret that the Republican leadership, in \nfact, appears to be bypassing the important work of the Budget \nCommittee in order to bring the budget resolution directly to the floor \nwithout debate about a budget resolution and without an opportunity for \nus to vote and to come together on a bipartisan budget resolution that \nreflects our values and priorities for the families that we represent \nin our States.\n  We have, in fact, been diligently at work. As a new Member of not \nonly the Senate but the Senate Budget Committee, I have taken this work \nvery seriously. We have been meeting, sometimes several days in a row, \nhearing from Chairman Greenspan, the Congressional Budget Office, the \nOffice of Management and Budget, the Secretary of the Treasury, the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Education, and \nthe Secretary of State.\n  We have held hearings on long-term budget projections and demographic \ntrends and Medicare. I have been meeting with people throughout my \ngreat State of Michigan to talk about their values and priorities for \nthe future, and how they would like to see us come together and fashion \nthis budget.\n  Unfortunately, all of this work seems to be for naught because the \nRepublican leadership wants to avoid committee debate on the budget \nresolution for the first time since Congress passed\n\n[[Page S2720]]\n\nthe Congressional Budget Act of 1974. When you think about it, this is \nat a time when we have seen our new President come forward to reach out \nhis hand and talk about bipartisanship. Yet, once again, we are forced \nto come to the floor of the Senate and ask to be partners in this \nprocess and to truly move ahead in a bipartisan fashion.\n  It is not enough just to speak about bipartisanship, just as it is \nnot enough to just speak about issues. Our constituents expect us to \nact. And we have a right to expect what will happen will fulfill the \nwords that are being talked about on Capitol Hill.\n  Our committee should debate all of the critical issues before us: How \nwe pay down the maximum public debt we can so we can put money in our \nconstituents' pockets through lower interest rates, and put money in \ntheir pockets through a tax cut, and making sure we have an economic \npolicy that means they have a job. There are several ways in which we \nneed to put dollars back into the pockets of the people we represent.\n  We also need to debate Social Security and Medicare for the future, \neducation, which drives this economy, research, technology and \neducation, increased labor productivity, which drives the economy, as \nwe have heard over and over again in the Budget Committee. We need to \ndebate national defense and protecting the environment.\n  One issue that I think needs great debate is the issue of protecting \nthe Medicare trust fund. We have found, during this budget process, \nthat the President's budget does not protect the Medicare trust fund. \nThe President's budget does not protect the Medicare trust fund. In \nfact, it takes it from a protected status and moves it over into a \ncontingency fund to be used for spending.\n  We tried a week ago, through Senator Conrad's legislation, to create \na lockbox for Social Security and Medicare, and say--as the American \npublic wants us to do--that we will keep our hands off Social Security \nand Medicare and protect it for the future.\n  In this budget, we go in the exact opposite direction. We not only \ndon't protect it and strengthen it by adding dollars for the future, it \nis put over into spending which, in fact, could cause Medicare to \nbecome insolvent 15 years sooner, when we expect the strain of the baby \nboomers coming into the system and the fact that we are going to have a \nlong-term liability on Medicare and Social Security.\n  The American people need to understand that if we don't protect the \nMedicare trust fund, there will be a severe strain when baby boomers \nbegin to retire in 2012. This could mean benefit cuts or increases in \ntaxes at that time. It is not necessary for us to be put in this kind \nof a situation.\n  I hope the Republican leadership will reconsider, as we asked the \nchairman of the committee to do today, and reach out to us to get a \nbipartisan budget and tax agreement. I was fortunate to be in the House \nof Representatives in 1997, when the President and the Congress, of \ndifferent parties, worked together to balance the budget, make critical \ninvestments in education and in our future needs, and cut taxes. If we \ndid it then, we can do it now. We have to do it together.\n  If we hold a markup in committee and work together, we can get the \njob done. If not, I fear we continue to go back to policies we have all \ndenounced--the practice of partisanship, one side versus the other. Our \ncommittee has worked hard, our members have been there and involved in \nthese hearings. I commend the Chair for holding such comprehensive \nhearings to be able to bring forward the issues that relate to this \nbudget so we can put together the values and priorities of our country \nin the form of a budget for the future.\n  It is extremely unfortunate that we find ourselves in this position \nnow, at the end of the road, when the budget hearings come to a \nconclusion, where we do not have the opportunity to work together to \ndraw up that budget resolution and show, in fact, that we can work \ntogether on behalf of the families we represent.\n  I urge the Republican leadership to allow the Budget Committee to do \nour work and allow us to come together to protect Social Security and \nMedicare for the long haul, to provide a tax cut to make sure we are \npaying down the debt for the future for our children, and to make sure \nwe have outlined the priorities for the country that are most important \nfor our families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/22/senate-section/article/S2720-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2720-S2722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, a little earlier in the day, a very \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia and a very good friend--and I \nsay that in all honesty--came to the floor and talked a little bit--\nmore than a little bit--about the budget resolution and the current \nchairman of the Budget Committee. Not in negative terms. I happen to be \nthat person. They were not negative at all.\n  There were a few things the distinguished Senator said that I seek to \nclarify. I did not do this without telling him. I sent him a copy of \nthe budget schedule for the winter-spring of 1993 because one of the \npoints the Senator from West Virginia made was we are moving ahead to \nbring a budget resolution up on April 1 or April 2.\n  I believe one of his major points was we do not yet have a detailed \nbudget from the President of the United States, George W. Bush.\n  I will soon put this schedule in the Record, but here is what \nhappened in 1993 when President Clinton was elected President. One of \nthe big differences was they had 54 votes on that side, and we had 45 \nvotes on our side. Understand, they could do what they wanted with the \nbudget resolution with or without a President's budget. They could \norder reconciliation instructions to increase taxes with or without \nRepublican support.\n  This Senator finds himself in a very different position. We have 11 \nRepublicans and 11 Democrats, and they just happen to call me chairman, \nbut I do not have any votes. I am one of the 11 Republicans and there \nare 11 Democrats.\n  The distinguished Senator said we were proceeding even without a \ndetailed final budget from the new President of the United States. Here \nis the budget schedule for the winter-spring of 1993:\n  February 17, the President issues a preliminary budget overview \ncalled a ``Vision of Change for America.'' We looked at that. It is \nvery much like what George W. Bush sent us maybe a month ago. It was a \nvery minor document when it comes to detailed budget documents.\n  On March 3, the CBO gave some preliminary estimates on that. Just \nlook at this schedule: On February 17, the President sends us this \nvision, this document of a few pages, and by March 12, less than 1 \nmonth, the Senate Budget Committee, on partisan lines--namely, they had \nthe majority, we had the minority--guess what. They reported out a \nbudget resolution.\n  Then the House Budget Committee did that by March 15, less than a \nmonth.\n  Then on March 18, 1 month after the issuance of the ``Vision of \nChange for America'' proposal--and I call it a proposal--the conference \nreport was filed on the 1994 budget resolution. The House agreed to the \nconference report, and on April 1 the Senate agreed to a conference \nreport on the 1994 budget resolution.\n  Guess when the Senate in 1993 got the budget of the President of the \nUnited States. On April 8, 8 days after they had already approved \neverything, including a budget resolution.\n  I only state that because it was suggested that it was sort of \nuntoward and maybe not the best thing for us to do the budget \nresolution before we have the President's final documents, the detailed \ndocuments.\n  President Bill Clinton asked his democratically controlled Congress \nthat they approve a budget resolution before he sent them the budget, \nand they did. That is all right with me. I was a member of the \nopposition. I argued as much as I could against what I thought was not \nthe right thing to do, but understand that by April 1 everything was \nfinished in both Houses on a budget resolution aspect, following on \nwith the President's plans, and the President had not yet put his \nbudget together in detail.\n\n  We have as much detail today, I assure you, Mr. President, as the \nSenate and House Budget Committees had when they produced budget \nresolutions less than 1 month after the President issued his vision \nplan, a rather flimsy\n\n[[Page S2721]]\n\ndocument, not much of a budget document, much like our President \nproduced. We do not call that little vision document a budget; they are \nstill working on it.\n  I want everyone to know it will not be untoward. It will be very much \nin accord with the way we have done things, to follow our Democratic \nbrethren and do the very same thing. The President will not have his \nbudget in detail. We will have a budget resolution. It is not a \ndetailed budget either, if anybody thinks it is.\n  People say: You must know about every program in the Federal budget, \nas if in every budget document we deal with every program in the \nFederal Government. It will come as a shock, but we do not. We deal in \nlarge functions, large pieces of the budget, because that is all we \nhave jurisdiction over. Nobody gave us jurisdiction over the details.\n  I sent this to Senator Byrd since he spoke about the chairman of the \nBudget Committee and wondered why we could do a budget resolution \nbefore we had a budget.\n  I repeat--they are pretty good role models on the other side of the \naisle--that is what they did for their President. We are going to try \nvery hard to do that for our President. The only difference is we do \nnot have 54 votes that carry ``R'' after the name; we have 50. We are \ntrying very hard to ask our Democratic friends--some of them--to help \nus do for our President what the Congress did for their President when \nhe was first elected to the Presidency; that is, help us get a budget \nresolution out and not just wait around for a budget; do it quickly; do \nit as fast as we can.\n  I have a commitment from the leadership that we are going to take \nthis budget resolution up as quickly as we can under the very rigorous \nschedule we now have. I know we are not going to get huge cooperation \non the other side, although I hope a couple Senators will help us, \nbecause it still has to be filled in by the committees. We just want to \nlay the groundwork that President Bush deserves to get his budget \nconsidered in exactly the same way President Clinton did. The only \nthing he can hope for is that he have 54 votes as President Clinton \nhad. Then he would get his plans adopted in both bodies in less than 1 \nmonth from the time he issued just his few pages of ``here is what I \nwant to do in the future.'' It wasn't a budget. It wasn't a budget by \neither President.\n\n  With this budget resolution, we want to do it as quickly as possible, \nApril 1 or April 2, for 4 or 5 days.\n  In addition, we want a big piece of that budget to be economic \nrecovery. That means we are going to propose, hopefully--I haven't \nworked it out with everybody yet--$60 billion of the 2001 surplus; \nthere is a big surplus sitting there this year. That $60 billion will \nbe allowed in a bill, in a composite bill, to give back to the \ntaxpayers because it is surplus that we ought to return to them. I \ndon't know what way to return it to them. That can be debated. I don't \nthink there can be any debate with what we see in the American economy. \nExpediency is a rule. Economic recovery ought to be our first venture \nand our paramount venture going in.\n  We will propose a $60 billion surplus be given back to the American \npeople in the most judicious and prudent way possible. And we pass the \nPresident's marginal tax cut along with it. We won't ask for all the \nrest of the taxes in that first round. People are worried about it \nbeing too big. This will be a package made up just of the marginal \nrates and the $60 billion this year.\n  It will send a signal, if we can get cooperation to do this. It will \nnot only send a signal that we are responding to the economic \nconditions, whatever plant closures, whatever responses there are out \nthere, and the marketplace.\n  The business executives are thinking, at least we can act quickly, \nand we have an economic recovery part of this plan which is pretty \ngood. I say to any person who thinks the marginal rate reduction should \nnot be part of whatever return of surplus we have for this year, they \njust ought to ask those who really know about what will send a positive \nsignal to the American economy as nothing else. That is in addition to \nthe refund, rebate, tax cut, whatever you want to call it, giving back \n$60 billion. If you reduce the marginal rates permanently and tell the \nAmerican people it is done, they will say, for once they did something \nquickly, they did something right, and our hats are off to them. That \nwill be their hats off to us.\n  If we can't do that and somebody thinks we can fix it all with a $60 \nbillion return of surplus and put off the rest, you can't do that and \nhave any big impact on this economy.\n  Let me repeat, if the only package is to return a portion of this \nyear's 2001 surplus, you cannot have an impact on the American economy. \nIt is not big enough, even though it is $60 billion. And you get no \npermanency built into the notion that the marginal rates for the \nAmerican taxpayers--that means everybody's tax rate--should be reduced \nfrom the top brackets to the lowest brackets.\n  That is about the way things are today. I am very pleased the \nRepublican leadership, at least as I read them, as I made this \npresentation to a group of Republican Senators--not everyone; some \nSenators were busy on the floor--I saw a willingness to move, to do \nsomething, to let the tax-writing committee quickly sit down and decide \nto do this. We will say you have free reign to do this in these \nparticular dimensions I have just described.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the budget \nschedule for winter/spring, 1993.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Budget Schedule--Winter/Spring 1993\n\n       February 17, 1993: President issues preliminary budget \n     overview, A Vision of Change for America.\n       March 3, 1993: CBO issues Preliminary CBO Estimates of the \n     Administration's Budgetary Proposals (5 pages of text, \n     double-spaced, and 3 tables); includes minor revisions to \n     January baseline, netting out to several billion dollars over \n     six years, almost entirely for deposit insurance. (The \n     baseline was next updated in The Economic and Budget Outlook \n     issued in September 1993.)\n       March 12, 1993: Senate Budget Committee reports 1994 budget \n     resolution.\n       March 15, 1993: House Budget Committee reports 1994 budget \n     resolution.\n       March 16, 1993: CBO testifies before Ways and Means \n     Committee.\n       Sometime after March 16: CBO issues An Analysis of the \n     President's February Budgetary Proposals (about 60 pages), \n     providing more detail on CBO's economic assumptions, \n     reestimates, and baseline revisions. On page A-3, it notes \n     that ``the notion that the deficit will simply fade with time \n     and continuing economic growth has largely been punctured.''\n       March 18, 1993: House passes 1994 budget resolution.\n       March 25, 1993: Senate passes 1994 budget resolution.\n       March 31, 1993: Conference report filed on 1994 budget \n     resolution; House agrees to conference report.\n       April 1, 1993: Senate agrees to conference report on 1994 \n     budget resolution.\n       April 8, 1993: President issues detailed budget documents.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If we can do it as quickly as this bill, but I don't \nthink we can.\n  Wherever I said 54 Senators, my friend says it is 56. I just come \nfrom little old New Mexico. I thought it was 54. But in any event, they \nhad good majority and proceeded with great dispatch. I will try to do \nthat, although we only have 50/50. I will ask the American people, and \nI will have the President ask them, do you want to get this done or \ndillydally? Do you want to get both pieces done, give the public back \n$60 billion and cut the marginal rates, or wait around?\n  Wait around until when? I am not answering the question.\n  It is so obvious that a markup will do no good; as this Senator sees \nit, it will split every vote, 11-11. I am not willing to say we will do \nthat before we put this package before the American people. I just \ndon't think that is what we have to do.\n  So nobody will be confused, the other side of the aisle says the \npublic ought to have a chance to participate in this committee \ndeliberation. That is a wonderful thought. It is probably what all of \nus would like to think about our committees when they work, but I think \nthe American people will get a real version of this when they get 5 \ndays on the floor of the Senate. When you can offer all kinds of \namendments, you can offer three budget resolutions if you like. We \noffer the President's as a starting point. If the other side would like \nto offer theirs, that is different; they can. If they amend the one we \ncan produce, whenever it is, they can do that. It will be full, hour to \nhour,\n\n[[Page S2722]]\n\nminute to minute, on TV. It is not assured that will occur with a \nmarkup in committee, but we will have it, full time, every moment we \nspeak.\n  Having said that, we will put together this budget as quickly as we \ncan. We will try to share it with all the Members and eventually, as \nsoon as we can, we will share it with the other side of the aisle. But \nessentially, they will have ample time in the 5 days we debate this, 50 \nhours. Do you know how long that is? We won't get out of here before \nEaster. We might meet through the night one of those nights and we will \nget out of here before Easter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/22/senate-section/article/S2722-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               CLIFF TARO\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr President, a few weeks ago I went home to \nKetchikan, AK. It was the first time since I became a U.S. Senator, 20 \nyears ago, that my good friend Cliff Taro was not there to meet me. He \nwas an exceptional man and embodied the true Alaskan pioneer spirit. \nEarlier this year, Cliff died. I truly miss him.\n  Cliff first came to Alaska in 1943, as a Sergeant in the U.S. Army \nTransports Corps. He was stationed at Excursion Inlet near Juneau. This \nwas a sub port to supply the war in the Aleutians, and was where Cliff \nreceived first hand experience and an interest in stevedoring, his \nfuture occupation. After 4 years in the Army, where he advanced to the \nrank of captain, he went to work for Everett Stevedoring in 1946. He \nmarried his wife Nan on August 21, 1949 in Bellingham Washington and in \n1952, Cliff, Nan and their two children, Jim and Debbie, moved to \nKetchikan and started Southeast Stevedoring Corporation.\n  Cliff's accomplishments, interests and awards are abundant. He was a \nmember of the Marine Section of the National Safety council for more \nthan 25 years, as well as serving on the Board of Governors of the \nNational Maritime Safety Association. Cliff was a member of the Alaska \nState Chamber of Commerce for 40 years, served on its board of \ndirectors for seven years, and was both vice president and president of \nthe Chamber. Additionally, he was a charter member of Alaska Nippon \nKai, a Japanese trade arm of the Alaska Chamber of Commerce. He was a \nmember of the Korean Business Council and co-founder and treasurer of \nKetchikan's Save Our Community. Cliff represented Alaska on the Seattle \nMayor's Maritime Advisory Committee and had been trustee and member of \nthe Alaska Council on Economic Education.\n  Cliff was a member of Governor Keith Miller's Task Force to \nWashington, D.C. to successfully lobby for the Alaska Pipeline. He \naccepted an invitation by President Jimmy Carter and Governor Jay \nHammond to participate in a seminar on Foreign Trade and Export \nDevelopment. Cliff traveled, with me, and other members of the Alaska \nState Chamber of Commerce, Native leaders and State of Alaska officials \nto England, Scotland, the Orkney Islands and Norway to survey and \nobserve the effect of off shore drilling on their communities and how \nthis might similarly affect Alaskan communities.\n  Cliff served as the Southeast Finance Chairman for my reelection to \nthe U.S. Senate. He was a life member of the Pioneers of Alaska, member \nof the B.P.O. Elks, American Legion, Theta Chi Fraternity, National \nAssociation of Independent Businessmen, National Association of \nStevedores and a 45-year member of the Rotary Club as well as a Paul \nHarris Fellow.\n  In 1985, Cliff was awarded the Outstanding Alaskan Award by the \nAlaska State Chamber of Commerce. In 1989 he was awarded an Honorary \ndegree of Doctor of Humanities from the University of Alaska Southeast. \nIn January 1992 he was elected to the Alaska Business Hall of Fame. He \nwas the 2000 Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year, and \nNancy and I were proud to be able to present him and Nan with this \ntribute.\n  Cliff was a supporter of little league and could often be found at \nthe ball park or Ketchikan High games cheering on his grandchildren.\n  Cliff's death followed the earlier passing of his wife Nan. Survivors \ninclude their son Jim, and their daughter and son in-law Debbie and Bob \nBerto. He is also survived by four grandchildren: Jennie, Ethan, Brian, \nand Anna.\n  Cliff was my friend. He will be missed by all Alaskans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/22/senate-section/article/S2722-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2722-S2723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Women's \nHistory Month. This time has been appropriately designated to reflect \nupon the important contributions and heroic sacrifices that women have \nmade to our Nation and consider the challenges they continue to face. \nThroughout our history, women have been at the forefront of every \nimportant movement for a better and more just society, and they have \nbeen the foundation of our families.\n  In Maryland, we are proud to honor those women who have given so much \nto improve our lives. Their achievements illustrate their courage and \ntenacity in conquering overwhelming obstacles. They include Margaret \nBrent, who became America's first woman lawyer and landholder, and \nHarriet Tubman, who risked her own life to lead hundreds of slaves to \nfreedom through the Underground Railroad. Dr. Helen Taussig, another \ngreat Marylander, developed the first successful medical procedure to \nsave ``blue babies'' by repairing heart birth defects. Her efforts laid \nthe groundwork for modern heart surgery. We are all indebted to Mary \nElizabeth Garrett and Martha Carey Thomas who donated money to create \nJohns Hopkins Medical School on the condition that women be admitted. \nAnd jazz music would not be complete without the unforgettable voice of \njazz singer Billie Holiday who also hailed from Baltimore City. Their \naccomplishments and talent provide inspiration not only to Marylanders, \nbut to people all over the globe.\n  A woman who illustrates the commitment of the women of Maryland is my \ngood friend and colleague from Maryland, Senator Barbara Mikulski. \nSenator Mikulski, who has served longer than any other woman currently \nin the Senate, played a key role in establishing this month. In 1981, \nshe cosponsored a resolution establishing National Women's History \nWeek, a predecessor to Women's History Month. Today, I wish to honor \nher dedication and service to the people of Maryland and this Nation.\n  While we recognize famous women, it is important that we acknowledge \nthe contributions of others who daily touch our lives. It is our \nfavorite teacher who gave us the confidence and knowledge to know that \nwe were capable of success. It is the single mother or grandmother who \ntoiled at a low-paying job for years to guarantee that the next \ngeneration in her family received better education and career \nopportunities. It is the professional women who volunteer the little \nspare time they have to read to children or speak to student groups, \ninspiring young people to aim for goals beyond what they may have \notherwise imagined. And the stay-at-home mothers who devote enormous \ntime to chauffeur their children and others from activity to activity, \nknowing that these many hobbies stimulate a child's interest and desire \nto learn. These modern day heroines, giving of their time, knowledge, \nand expertise must not be taken for granted.\n  Women have made great strides in overcoming historic adversity and \nbias but they still face many obstacles. Unequal pay, poverty, \ninadequate access to healthcare and violent crime are among the \nchallenges that continue to disproportionately affect women. Working \nwomen earn 74 cents to every dollar earned by men. What is more \ntroubling is that the more education a woman has, the wider the wage \ngap. According to a recent Census Bureau report, the average American \nwoman loses approximately $523,000 in wages and benefits over a \nlifetime because of wage inequality. Families with a female head of \nhousehold have the highest poverty rate and comprise the majority of \npoor families.\n  Women continue to be under-represented in high-paying professions and \nlag significantly behind men in enrollment in science programs. \nIncreasing the number of women in these fields begins with encouraging \ngirls' interest and awareness in school.\n  As our population ages, we must also address the special challenges \nof older women. Women live an average of 6 years longer than men. \nConsequently,\n\n[[Page S2723]]\n\ntheir reduced pay is even more detrimental given their increased life \nexpectancy as they are forced to live on less money for a longer period \nof time. In addition, more women over age 65 tend to live alone at a \ntime when illness and accidents due to decreased mobility are more \nlikely. For these women, it is imperative that we guarantee that Social \nSecurity and Medicare remain solvent for future generations.\n  I believe we should use this month as an opportunity to reflect not \nonly on the achievements and challenges of American women, but to \nrecognize those of women internationally. We know that a variety of \nills hinder the potential of women in many parts of the world--labor \npractices that oppress women and girls, the rapid spread of HIV and \nAIDS, and limited or nonexistent suffrage rights. We must broaden \naccess to education, the political process, and reproductive health \nglobally so that girls and women everywhere can maximize their options. \nTo have a credible voice in the international arena, the United States \nmust lead by example, showing that American women enjoy these rights \nfully.\n  While obstacles remain, women have achieved impressive progress. This \ngood news includes a decline in the poverty rate for single women and \nan increase in those holding advanced degrees. Recent figures show \nwomen received approximately 45 percent of law and 42 percent of \nmedical degrees awarded in this country. This is a dramatic improvement \nfrom a few decades ago and should continue as more and more women enter \nprofessional programs.\n  In my home State of Maryland, as in the Nation, women are a guiding \nforce and a major presence in our national business sector. From 1987 \nto 1999, the number of women-owned firms in the United States grew by \n103 percent. Women were responsible for 80 percent of the total \nenrollment growth at Maryland colleges and universities throughout the \nlast two decades.\n  I am pleased to report that during my service in Congress, I have \nstrongly supported efforts to address women's issues and correct gender \ndiscrimination and inequality. In the present session, I have \ncosponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would provide more \neffective remedies to victims of wage discrimination on the basis of \nsex. Along with many of my colleagues, I have supported the Equity in \nPrescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act, which would \nprohibit health insurance plans from excluding or restricting benefits \nfor FDA-approved prescription contraception if the plan covers other \nprescription drugs. In order to build a national repository of the \ncontributions of women to our Nation's history, I cosponsored \nlegislation to establish a National Museum of Women's History Advisory \nCommittee. I am proud of these efforts and I will continue my \ncommitment to bring fuller equality to all women.\n  Indeed, women have made great progress. I think it is appropriate to \npoint out the accomplishments of women in history, but it is also \nimportant to educate present and future generations about gender \ndiscrimination so that we do not repeat past mistakes. We all look \nforward to a day when these conditions will be distant and \nunimaginable. We are closer to that day than we were yesterday, but we \nstill have some distance to travel. I am confident that the women of \nAmerica will lead this journey and continue to exemplify and advocate \nfor those values and ideals which are at the heart of a decent, caring, \nand fair society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/22/senate-section/article/S2723-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2723-S2725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL SECURITY EDUCATION PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the National Security Education Program \nhas released an Analysis of Federal Language Needs. This analysis will \nappear later this year as part of its annual report to Congress. It \nconfirms the need to support foreign language instruction at the \nelementary and secondary education level.\n  It also is compelling evidence that the Senate should pass S. 541, \nthe Foreign Language Acquisition and Proficiency Improvement Act, which \nwill provide assistance to schools for foreign language instruction. I \nask unanimous consent that the March, 2001, National Security Education \nProgram Analysis of Federal Language Needs, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nNational Security Education Program (NSEP) Analysis of Federal Language \n                                 Needs\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       There is little debate that the era of globalization has \n     brought increasingly diverse and complex challenges to U.S. \n     national security. With these challenges comes a rapidly \n     increasing need for a workforce with skills that address \n     these needs, including professional expertise accompanied by \n     the ability to communicate and understand the languages and \n     cultures of key world regions: Russia and the former Soviet \n     Union, China, the Arab world, Iran, Korea, Central Asia and \n     key countries in Africa, Latin America and East Asia.\n       Some 80 federal agencies and offices involved in areas \n     related to U.S. national security rely increasingly on human \n     resources with high levels of language competency and \n     international knowledge and experience. Finding these \n     resources and, in particular, finding candidates for \n     employment as professionals in the U.S. Government, has \n     proven increasingly difficult, and many agencies now report \n     shortfalls in hiring, deficits in readiness, and adverse \n     impacts on operations. Some important documentation of these \n     needs and shortfalls can be found in September 2000 testimony \n     provided to the United States Senate Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs, Subcommittee on International Security, \n     Proliferation, and Federal Services, chaired by Senator Thad \n     Cochran.\n       Since 1994, the National Security Education Program (NSEP) \n     has funded outstanding U.S. students, both undergraduate and \n     graduate students, to study those languages and cultures \n     critical to U.S. national security and under-represented in \n     U.S. study. NSEP award recipients make an important \n     contribution to future U.S. national security by working in \n     the federal government or in higher education.\n\n\n                              nsep survey\n\n       The National Security Education Program (NSEP), as per its \n     legislative mandate, conducts a yearly survey to identify \n     those world regions, languages, and fields of study critical \n     to U.S. national security and under-represented in U.S. \n     study. The findings are used to better understand the current \n     and projected needs of the federal government by emphasizing \n     those same countries, languages, and fields of study in the \n     annual application guidelines for the NSEP Undergraduate \n     Scholarships, Graduate Fellowships, and Grants to U.S. \n     Institutions of Higher Education.\n       Using as a baseline the current annual list of world \n     regions, languages, and fields of study emphasized by the \n     program, (see Attachment A) NSEP asks a broad range of \n     Federal agencies and organizations with responsibilities in \n     the national security arena to consider the next five to ten \n     years in recommending additions and/or deletions to the \n     existing list. These changes are reflected in annual \n     guidelines for applications, released each fall.\n       NSEP, in its 2000-2001 survey, broadened the scope of the \n     survey by first, increasing the number and types of agencies \n     and/or offices queried, and second, by identifying the role \n     that professional competency in critical languages plays in \n     the capacity of the federal agencies to execute their \n     missions. This type of information is of critical importance \n     as we attempt to refine and modify existing and potentially \n     new programs to respond to the demands of the 21st century. \n     Questionnaires were mailed to 91 federal agencies and/or \n     offices that deal with international issues. Forty-eight \n     respondents from 46 agencies/offices sent their feedback to \n     NSEP. Attachment B provides a list of agencies who responded \n     to the 2000-2001 survey.\n       The purpose of this report is to provide results from this \n     analysis and to contribute to our understanding of the \n     increasing need for language and international expertise in \n     the federal sector.\n\n\n                            Survey Responses\n\n       The responses to the 2000-2001 survey confirm the \n     significant need for language expertise in the federal \n     sector. In addition, respondents indicate that when language \n     expertise is either required, or an important asset to an \n     organization's missions and functions, the language must be \n     at the advanced level. The responses show that the demand for \n     advanced language skills exists across the board. Agencies \n     from all functional areas--political/military, social and \n     economic--vouch that professional proficiency in languages \n     are imperative to the function of their missions.\n       The chart at Attachment C provides some additional insight \n     concerning languages identified by federal organizations and \n     the advanced levels of expertise associated with these \n     requirements. Eleven languages (French, Spanish, Portuguese, \n     German, Russian, Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Urdu, \n     and Arabic) were identified by at least four different \n     federal organizations. An additional 19 languages were \n     identified by at least two different federal organizations; \n     40 languages were identified by single organizations.\n       The following examples serve to provide some additional \n     insights into federal needs:\n       The National Cryptologic School of the NSA stated that \n     ``language skills tied to any\n\n[[Page S2724]]\n\n     academic discipline is a plus'', while the DIA stated that \n     ``all languages must be at the advanced level.'' The U.S. \n     Secret Service indicated needs for bilingual capabilities for \n     Special Agents assigned to certain permanent overseas posts. \n     Special Agent personnel affected by this requirement attend a \n     language immersion course and receive certification \n     documenting their level of proficiency. In addition, the \n     Service foresees a need to provide bilingual capability to \n     those personnel tasked with providing training to foreign law \n     enforcement officials and to those individuals who engage in \n     the forensic analysis of evidence, including those \n     responsible for the examination of computers used in criminal \n     activity.\n       The International Broadcasting Bureau of the Broadcasting \n     Board of Governors reported a unique need for professionals \n     with language and area expertise. While in its management and \n     daily operations language knowledge is not required, \n     intermediate or advanced proficiency in a major regional \n     language (such as Russian for Russia and the former Soviet \n     Republics) is a tremendous advantage and sometimes necessary \n     for marketing officers who place BBG programming in local \n     markets, as well as for engineers who establish, manage, and \n     maintain the Bureau's global transmission network.\n       The Centers for Disease Control of the Department of Health \n     and Human Services works in more than 140 countries each year \n     to address public health challenges. In addition, CDC has \n     more than 100 assignees in 41 countries to provide long-term \n     assistance on disease surveillance, disease eradication, HIV, \n     infectious and chronic diseases, and other priority programs. \n     Due to the nature of CDC's work, the agency may carry \n     operations in countries where the US has no diplomatic \n     relations to address critical health needs.\n       The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has \n     strong needs for proficient language skills in Russian, \n     Japanese and Spanish.\n       The Drug Enforcement Agency has 78 offices in 56 countries. \n     Language training is provided to personnel posted to these \n     offices by two contract language service companies. These \n     employees receive one-on-one instruction for the training \n     period required for the specific language. All employees must \n     achieve a competency of Level 2 for both speaking and reading \n     prior to completion of the training.\n       The Federal Bureau of Investigation has a critical need for \n     translators proficient in the following languages: Arabic, \n     Farsi, Hindi, Pashto, Punjabi, Turkish, Urdu, Hebrew, \n     Japanese, Korean, Chinese (all dialects) and Vietnamese. \n     Applicants must pass a language proficiency test 3+ \n     (Advanced/Native Speaker).''\n       The U.S. Customs Service enforces over 600 laws for 60 \n     other agencies involved in international commerce and travel. \n     ``Knowledge of a foreign language is not a mandatory \n     requirement for employment by the U.S. Customs Service. \n     However, with over 300 Customs land, sea and air ports in \n     the U.S., twenty-four Customs attache and senior \n     representative offices established at American embassies \n     and consulates in strategic areas around the globe, and \n     advisory teams in thirteen countries, possessing foreign \n     language skills is highly desirable to accomplish our \n     mission as U.S. Customs investigators, inspectors and \n     other officers.''\n       In 1999 the U.S. Coast Guard independently carried out an \n     in-depth study to determine how to best meet the foreign \n     language needs of its service. All cutters, stations, groups, \n     air stations, districts and the Coast Guard Intelligence \n     Service were tasked with reporting the number of incidents \n     requiring foreign language skills. The selected comments from \n     the study are highly instructive on the kind of repercussions \n     that lack of language expertise has for the Coast Guard:\n       ``Absence of effective communications influenced decision \n     not to board'';\n       ``Lack of interpreter reduced quality of right of approach \n     questions'';\n       ``Never determined nationality due to lack of \n     interpreter'';\n       ``All Alaskan Patrol cutters should have Russian \n     interpreter on board'';\n       ``Lack of interpreter made overall Fish Mission \n     ineffective'';\n       ``Lack of interpreters in Chinese, Russian, Polish, \n     Japanese and Korean curtail any intelligence gathering which \n     is critical to success of mission'';\n       ``50% of crew bilingual, critical to mission success'';\n       ``Heavy workload for 2 Spanish speakers during two intense \n     patrols; multiple daily interactions with immigrants'';\n       ``Delay due to sharing of Coast Guard and INS \n     interpreters'';\n       ``Delay attributed to availability of interpreter being \n     ashore and underway. Lack of Japanese interpreter resulted in \n     no radio communications'';\n       ``Lone bi-lingual crewmember over tasked. Assistance of INS \n     Asylum Pre-Screening--Officer critical to relay medical \n     problems of migrant''.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The NSEP analysis, while not intended as a comprehensive \n     survey of language needs of the federal government, provides \n     some valuable insights into the need for global skills in the \n     federal sector and, more specifically, the need for \n     professional competencies in languages critical to national \n     security. Along with other ongoing efforts to codify the need \n     for language expertise, these data serve to continue to build \n     the case for a more proactive role for federal programs like \n     NSEP.\n       The comments received in response to our survey, the \n     interactions with officials from various agencies, and the \n     congressional testimonies to the Senate Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs reveal disjunctions between the existing \n     demand for language expertise in the federal sector and the \n     corresponding capacity to meet those needs.\n\n\n             attachment a--nsep areas of emphasis 1999-2000\n\n     World Regions\n       Africa\n     Angola\n     Dem.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 180th \nanniversary of Greek Independence. On March 25, 1821, ordinary Greek \ncitizens with a conviction for freedom rose up against their \noppressors. And, much like America's patriots, they struggled against \noverwhelming odds and won, bringing about their independence. For this \nreason, I was pleased to join my colleagues in cosponsoring and passing \nSenate Resolution 20 which designates March 25 as Greek Independence \nDay: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.\n  On this anniversary, Greeks and Greek-Americans can reflect on the \nstruggle for independence and be proud. Their ancestors stood up and \nfought for their freedom, ending 400 years of rule by the Ottoman \nEmpire. History is quick to forget the details and summarize the \noutcome. That is why remembering the sacrifices, the oppression, the \nbattles, the poorly armed men standing outnumbered, and their victory \nare so important.\n  March 25th, however, is not just for those of Greek descent. It is a \nday for all who appreciate freedom and treasure democracy. \nTerritorially, the nation of Greece is smaller than the state of \nAlabama. Yet, for such a small nation it has left a large mark on \nhistory and society. The Hellenes have produced many lasting societal \nadvances and cultural contributions, art, science, philosophy, and \narchitecture are just a few. In addition, they have had a rich and \nlasting impact upon politics. Democracy, the modern day pinnacle of \ngovernment, was founded in Greece over two thousand years ago.\n  As citizens of a great democracy, we are proud to recognize the \ncontributions of the Hellenic culture in our own nation. From the \neducation of the Founding Fathers to the development of our \nConstitution, Greek ideas have shaped America. In my own state, the \nGreeks have been members of Rhode Island's communities for over 100 \nyears. Originally starting as factory workers and fishermen, today's \ndescendants of the first immigrants continue to advance both \neconomically and professionally, contributing to our state with their \nhard work and active citizenship.\n  Therefore, on the day marking the 180th anniversary of the revolution \nfor independence, I congratulate all Greeks and Greek-Americans and \nexpress my appreciation for their contributions and those of their \nancestors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/22/senate-section/article/S2725-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2725-S2726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMERICA'S FIRST TOP SECRET HERO\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I had the honor of presenting a \npersonal letter to Mr. Hiroshi H. Miyamura at an event honoring Mr. \nMiyamura and commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the Korean War. Mr. \nMiyamura is a native New Mexican, a Medal of Honor recipient, and a \ntrue American hero.\n  In honor of Mr. Miyamura and in recognition of the events surrounding \nhis contribution in the Korean War, I ask unanimous consent that a copy \nof my letter to him and a short historical sketch about Mr. Miyamura be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                   March 21, 2001.\n       Mr. Miyamura: I would like to thank the Fairfax-Lee chapter \n     of the Association of the U.S. Army for inviting me to \n     celebrate today's guest of honor. I sincerely apologize for \n     my absence at this event.\n       Recognizing the awesome deeds of our men during the Korean \n     War during the 50th Anniversary of that conflict is a \n     humbling task. And, today, we meet to recognize the heroism \n     of one particular soldier, Mr. Hiroshi H. Miyamura. Mr. \n     Miyamura's story is not only one of tremendous courage, his \n     has an element of intrigue. Mr. Miyamura is also America's \n     first secret hero.\n       Mr. Miyamura is a native New Mexican, and still resides \n     there. He enlisted in the Army during World War II and served \n     in a unique special Japanese-American regiment, but the war \n     ended before he saw combat. He got out of the service after \n     WWII and went back to Udall where he married his sweetheart, \n     who had been in an American Internment Camp during the war.\n       One year after reenlisting in the Army Reserves, North \n     Korea invaded South Korea. At this time, Corporal Miyamura \n     was activated and assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division. For \n     his actions on the night of April 24, 1951, Mr. Miyamura was \n     awarded the Medal of Honor. However, his citation was \n     classified top-secret and filed away in the Department of the \n     Army's tightest security vault. On April 25, he was captured \n     and held as a Prisoner of War (POW) for more than twenty-\n     seven months.\n       When Sergeant Miyamura, who was promoted while in \n     captivity, was finally released on August 20, 1953, in a POW \n     exchange between the United Nations command and the \n     Communists, he was greeted by Brigadier General Ralph Osborne \n     and informed for the first time that he had been awarded the \n     Medal of Honor. According to General Osborne, the citation \n     had been held top-secret because ``if the Reds knew what he \n     had done to a good number of their soldiers just before he \n     was taken prisoner, they might have taken revenge on this \n     young man. He might not have come back.'' Sergeant Miyamura \n     was presented the Medal of Honor by President Eisenhower on \n     October 27, 1953.\n       Words will fail to appropriately encompass the gratitude \n     and indebtedness Americans have to Mr. Miyamura and his \n     compatriots. The freedom and prosperity we enjoy is a \n     constant reminder of our Veterans' contribution. As a fellow \n     New Mexican and admirer of the sacrifices you made for our \n     great country, I personally thank you, Mr. Hiroshi H. \n     Miyamura.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From Military History, Apr. 1996]\n\n   For More Than Two Years, Hiroshi Miyamura's Medal of Honor Was a \n                         Tightly Guarded Secret\n\n                           (By Edward Hymoff)\n\n       It was the beginning of a long, chilly April night in 1951. \n     Red Chinese bugles howled and whistles shrieked for the \n     umpteenth time. ``They're comin' again,'' the slightly built \n     corporal whispered to his machine-gun detail. Flares burst \n     above the ridge, and an enemy mortar barrage again began to \n     creep toward the American positions.\n       The ghostly light of falling flares played across the face \n     of the machine-gun section's\n\n[[Page S2726]]\n\n     leader, accentuating the young soldier's Asian features. He \n     could have been mistaken for the enemy, but for the uniform \n     he wore and his New Mexican accent. Shells straddled the \n     trench. The bugles and whistles grew louder as shadowy \n     figures clambered up the steep, shell-pocked slope.\n       ``Stay put,'' snapped the corporal. He yanked his bayonet \n     from its scabbard and clamped it on his carbine. ``Cover \n     me,'' he ordered. He pulled himself from the trench, \n     slithered a few feet on his belly and then sprang upright and \n     charged the advancing enemy soldiers.\n       More than two years later, U.S. Army Sergeant Hiroshi H. \n     Miyamura remembered that rainy night of April 24, 1951, as if \n     it were yesterday. He had been the Company H, 7th Infantry \n     Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, corporal who had ``charged'' \n     that night. Now, on August 20, 1953, Miyamura climbed down \n     from a Soviet-built military truck with 19 fellow prisoners \n     of war at a place called Panmunjom, which he had heard \n     mentioned while in a Communist Chinese prison camp in North \n     Korea. He and his repatriated POW buddies were hustled into \n     military ambulances for a 15-minute drive to another \n     unloading point, Freedom Village, where doctors, nurses and \n     medics took over.\n       Pale and undernourished, the newly freed Americans shucked \n     off their faded blue Chinese uniforms and showered. They were \n     examined by doctors, dusted with DDT and issued oversize \n     fatigues. Each former POW was then handed a large canteen cup \n     filled with ice cream. If the doctors declared them \n     physically and mentally up to it, they were interrogated by \n     intelligence officers and then led out to meet the press.\n       As Sergeant Miyamura (who had been promoted while in \n     captivity) was led to the microphones and news cameras, he \n     was greeted by Brig. Gen. Ralph Osborne, the Freedom Village \n     commander, who raised his hands for silence. ``Gentlemen of \n     the press,'' the general announced. ``I want to take this \n     occasion to welcome the greatest V.I.P., the most \n     distinguished guest to pass through Freedom Village.\n       ``Sergeant Miyamura, it is my pleasure to inform you that \n     you have been awarded the Medal of Honor.'' Miyamura was \n     visibly shaken. ``What?'' he gulped. ``I've been awarded what \n     medal?''\n       During the nearly 130 years that the Medal of Honor has \n     been awarded for ``conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at \n     the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty,'' none of \n     the other recipients have learned about the honor quite the \n     way that 27-year old Sergeant Miyamura did. Nineteen months \n     before his release from captivity, a Medal of Honor citation \n     dated December 21, 1951, had been filed away in the \n     Department of the Army's tightest security vault. Classified \n     ``top-secret,'' it was finally removed from its Pentagon \n     security vault at the start of Operation Big Switch, the \n     exchange of POWs between the United Nations command and the \n     Communists, and delivered to U.S. Eighth Army headquarters in \n     Seoul shortly after the Korean armistice was signed in late \n     July 1953.\n       General Osborne began reading aloud from the citation that \n     had been handed to him less than a half-hour before. ``On the \n     night of 24 April, Company H was occupying a defensive \n     position near Taejon-ni, Korea, when the enemy fanatically \n     attacked, threatening to overrun the position. Corporal \n     Miyamura, a machine-gun squad leader, aware of the danger to \n     his men, unhesitatingly jumped from his shelter. . . .''\n       As the general continued reading, Sergeant Miyamura clearly \n     recalled those events. A major Chinese offensive had cracked \n     the U.N. line. The 3rd Division had been ordered to pull \n     back. H Company withdrew under a heavy enemy mortar barrage \n     followed by two separate battalion-size probes. Miyamura was \n     positioned between a light and a heavy machine gun, directing \n     their fire. Shortly before midnight, the Chinese again \n     advanced up the slope. He called out to his gunners, ``Short \n     bursts, short bursts!'' and switched his carbine to automatic \n     fire, squeezing off short bursts. He also hurled grenades \n     down the slope.\n       The attackers were finally stopped. Twenty minutes or a \n     half-hour passed. Then, enemy mortar rounds again fell along \n     the ridgeline. Flares popped overhead, and the bugle calls \n     and whistles resumed, along with shrieks of ``Kill! Kill! \n     Kill dam `mericans!''\n       Miyamura hurled more grenades and emptied his carbine. The \n     shadowy figures moving up the slope toward his position \n     dropped before his fire. Off to his right, the heavy machine \n     gun blasted away. There was silence from the .30-caliber \n     light-machine-gun position on his left. He clambered from his \n     hole and crawled to his left flank. The light weapon and its \n     crew were gone. Had they bugged out?\n       No. A runner must have instructed them to withdraw. But why \n     hadn't the runner touched base with him? Crouching low, \n     Miyamura dashed toward the heavy-machine-gun position but \n     stumbled across a body and fell flat on his face. A flare \n     popped overhead, and he dropped flat beside the body. It was \n     one of H Company's runners. No wonder he hadn't gotten the \n     message to withdraw.\n       Miyamura found two of the four GIs in the machine-gun \n     position hit by shrapnel, and he dressed their wounds. \n     Instructing them to cover him, he clamped his bayonet on \n     his carbine and left the emplacement, sliding down the \n     slope toward the enemy. Minutes later, there were \n     agonizing cries in the darkness from the direction he had \n     gone.\n       ``. . . Wielding his bayonet in close hand-to-hand combat, \n     killing approximately 10 of the enemy,'' General Osborne \n     continued. The Chinese soldiers had been cautiously moving up \n     the slope when Miyamura suddenly appeared in their midst. \n     Jabbing and slashing, he scattered one group and wheeled \n     around, breaking up another group the same way. Miyamura then \n     ran back up the slope and slid into the machine-gun position. \n     He ordered the gunners and the two wounded riflemen to fall \n     back; he would cover them. Suddenly he was alone and \n     frightened. He leaned against the machine gun and waited. It \n     didn't take long. Bugles and whistles sounded, and the \n     ``Kill! Kill!'' chant of the enemy grew louder and closer.\n       ``. . . As another savage assault hit the line, he manned \n     his machine gun and delivered withering fire until his \n     ammunition was expended,'' the general went on. Miyamura \n     broke up that attack, and when he ran out of ammunition he \n     began hurling grenades in the enemy's direction. It was time \n     for him to withdraw, but first he had to destroy the heavy \n     machine gun. He placed a grenade, its pin pulled, against the \n     gun's open breach, then ran into a nearby trench.\n       Loping down the trench, Miyamura turned a corner and \n     slammed into an enemy soldier. Both recoiled, but Miyamura \n     was faster; he shot the Chinese soldier wounding him. The \n     Chinese soldier then lobbed a grenade in Miyamura's \n     direction, but he kicked it back. It exploded, killing the \n     enemy soldier and wounding Miyamura in the leg. ``. . . He \n     killed more than 50 of the enemy before his ammunition was \n     depleted and he was severely wounded,'' the general continued \n     reading.\n       Miyamura recalled the nightmarish events leading up to his \n     capture. The eastern horizon was beginning to grow lighter, \n     and the enemy soldiers were now pouring off the ridge he had \n     evacuated. He spotted a friendly tank that had been staked \n     out to cover the withdrawal, now preparing to pull out. \n     Miyamura ran desperately toward it, only to stumble into \n     American barbed wire. Sobbing in pain, he heard the tank \n     rumble away.\n       ``When last seen, he was fighting ferociously against an \n     overwhelming number of enemy soldiers,'' the general \n     continued. But that wasn't quite the way it happened, \n     Miyamura remembered. He managed to free himself from the wire \n     and dropped into a small shellhole, throbbing with pain from \n     the barbed-wire punctures and from the grenade-fragment wound \n     in his leg. Enemy troops swarmed down the back slope and \n     walked by the hole in which he lay, ignoring what they \n     thought was a dead GI. If he could last through the day \n     playing dead, he might be able to make it back to his own \n     lines when night fell. A lone enemy soldier stopped beside \n     him and leveled a U.S. Army 45-caliber pistol at his head. \n     ``Get up,'' he ordered in English. ``I know you're alive. We \n     don't harm prisoners.''\n       Four days later, a 3rd Division task force slashed its way \n     back to the position Miyamura had evacuated. Miyamura was not \n     among the dead GIs who lay there with more than 50 enemy \n     dead, scattered on both slopes of his position.\n       Why was Miyamura's Medal of Honor citation classified top-\n     secret? General Osborne explained: ``If the Reds knew what he \n     had done to a good number of their soldiers just before he \n     was taken prisoner, they might have taken revenge on this \n     young man. He might not have come back.'' Sergeant Hiroshi H. \n     Miyamura, America's first secret hero, was formally presented \n     his Medal of Honor by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in a \n     White House ceremony on October 27, 1953.\n       Miyamura has since visited Washington several times as an \n     invited guest at presidential inaugurations. A career as an \n     auto mechanic and service station owner made it possible for \n     him to send his three children to college. Miyamura is now \n     retired in his hometown of Gallup, N.M., and ``doing the many \n     things that I now have time for.'' An avid freshwater \n     fisherman, he spends much of his time trout fishing in the \n     many lakes in the Southwest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/22/senate-section/article/S2726-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2726-S2727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, this week, as our Nation celebrates \nNational Agriculture Week, I can think of no better time for Congress \nto begin the important work of addressing the urgent needs of our \nNation's family farmers, ranchers, and rural communities.\n  Through the hard work and innovation of our farmers and ranchers, we \nhave long been the most bountiful Nation in the world. The average \nAmerican farmer produces enough every year to feed and clothe 129 other \npeople. Nowhere else do so few feed so many.\n  Although only about 2 percent of our people work on the farm, \nagriculture remains a pillar of our economy. Twenty-one million \nAmericans are employed transporting, processing, and distributing \nagricultural commodities. In Minnesota, agriculture represents 17 \npercent of the State's economy and employs roughly 22 percent of the \nState's workers.\n  Our family farmers and ranchers contribute as much to our national \ncharacter as to our economy. The hard work and determination of our \nfarmers has been the foundation and source of strength for our Nation \nsince its earliest days. As they have done for generations, American \nfarmers continue to meet adversity with the faith, fortitude, and \ningenuity.\n  But as we enter the 21st century, America's family farmers and \nranchers face a number of challenges such as continuing low commodity \nprices, the increasing consolidation and concentration in the \nagricultural economy and Congress' failure to establish a strong safety \nnet to help when good times go bad. I believe we, as a nation, should \nfocus on ways to support and strengthen family farms and rural \ncommunities while ensuring a vibrant, competitive agricultural \nmarketplace.\n  I urge Congress to take immediate action to reverse farm and trade \npolicies that have led to several years of low prices and driven \nthousands of producers in Minnesota and across the country out of \nbusiness. What better way to honor the hard-working family farmers and \nranchers who allow our Nation to enjoy the safest, most diverse, and \nmost affordable food supply in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/22/senate-section/article/S2727-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN GLEN O. WOODS, USN\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \noutstanding Naval Officer, Captain Glen Woods, as he completes 23 years \nof distinguished service. It is a privilege for me to honor his many \noutstanding achievements and commend him for his honorable and faithful \nservice to the Senate, the Navy, and our great Nation.\n  Captain Woods graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1978. Upon \ngraduation, he entered flight training and earned his ``Wings of Gold'' \nas a Naval Aviator in February 1980. Assigned as a Maritime Patrol \nAviator, Captain Woods has served in P-3 Orion squadrons in both the \nPacific and Atlantic Fleets, compiling nearly 4000 flight hours. His \nmost recent flying assignment was as the Executive Officer and \nCommanding Officer of the ``Red Lancers'' of Patrol Squadron TEN, home \nported in Brunswick, ME.\n  From airfields located in Adak, Alaska, and Keflavik, Iceland, he has \ntracked submarines above the Arctic Circle. He has flown anti-submarine \nand anti-surface warfare missions supporting our carrier battle groups \nin the Mediterranean Sea, Arabian Gulf, North Atlantic, Western Pacific \nand the Sea of Japan. His crews tracked maritime shipping in the South \nChina Sea, Red Sea, Mediterranean Sea and throughout the Indian Ocean. \nAdditionally, he has operated extensively with our NATO Allies, flying \nfrom bases in Scotland, Norway, Iceland, France, Spain, Portugal, and \nItaly.\n  Captain Woods also left his mark on a wide range of critical \nassignments ashore, serving as an instructor pilot, working on the \nstaff of the Director of Naval Intelligence, and ending his \ndistinguished career as the Deputy Director of the Navy's Liaison \nOffice here in the Senate. His integrity, enthusiasm and foresight have \nearned him the admiration of me and my colleagues.\n  The Department of the Navy, the Congress, and the American people \nhave been well served by this dedicated naval officer for over 23 \nyears. Captain Glen Woods is a passionate advocate of the Sea Services \nand has been tireless in supporting the needs of the Sailors in the \nFleet and their families. On behalf of my colleagues, I am honored to \nthank him for his service and to wish Captain Woods and his lovely wife \nPatti, ``Fair winds and following seas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/22/senate-section/article/S2727-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2727-S2728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SALUTE TO THE 2001 NORTH DAKOTA CLASS B CHAMPION NORTH BORDER BOYS \n                            BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the North \nBorder Eagles who were recently crowned state champions at the 2001 \nNorth Dakota Class B boys basketball tournament in Minot, ND. The \nEagles beat number-one ranked Cando, ND 74-65 in the tournament's \nchampionship game to claim the state's top spot in Class B basketball. \nI congratulate Eagles Coach Dave Symington, his coaching staff and the \nplayers on their accomplishment. Members of the team include Jacob \nAnderson, Aaron Bonaime, Mike Brown, Nathan Carrier, Anthony Chaput, \nMatt Defoe, Dennis Delude, Warren Eagan, Kyle Rollness, Kevin Schaler, \nTravis Stegman, Chris Stremick, Chad Symington and Jason Tryan.\n  But I stand before the U.S. Senate not only to share with you the \nboxscore of the final game of the North Dakota Class B boys basketball \nseason, but to tell you the remarkable story of how they got there. \nIt's a story that many of you from rural States may recognize. \nEveryone, though, will be inspired by this story of teamwork and \ndetermination.\n  If you look on a North Dakota map, you won't find a community called \nNorth Border. That is because North Border is not one community, it is \nthree different communities that have joined resources in education and \nathletics to compete against shrinking school enrollments.\n  North Border is a co-op of three small communities, Neche, Pembina \nand Walhalla, in the far northeastern corner of my state. The \ncommunities with populations of 434, 634 and 1,131 respectively are \njoined by rolling hills, County Road 55 and a common goal of \nmaintaining a high quality of life for its residents while facing the \nrealities of a population that is older and smaller.\n  The communities' high schools have a combined enrollment of less than \n200. The schools formed the North Border co-op due to the low athlete \nnumbers in boys basketball and other sports.\n  The schools agreed to rotate the location of practices and games to \naccommodate players and fans in all three communities. While the \nathletes had played together before in summer programs, the transition \nwas challenging. The newly formed Eagles lost its second game of the \nseason. It was against the Cando Cubs--the team the Eagles would \neventually meet again in the state tournament. The Eagles soon began \nplaying well together as a team and compiled a very impressive 23-2 \nrecord, including a victory in the regional finals over Fordville-\nLankin avenging the Eagles' second loss of the season.\n  The team's birth into the state Class B boys basketball tournament \nwas the first state tournament experience for either Walhalla or Neche, \nand the first time since 1955 that Pembina went to State. The Eagles \nreceived no beginner's breaks. All schools who made it to the \ntournament were strong teams and deserve praise for this \naccomplishment. The Eagles were paired against the defending state \nchampion Fargo Oak Grove team in the first round. As they had all \nseason, the Eagles relied on their defense and a strong balanced \noffense to move past Oak Grove and their second opponent, the Dickinson \nTrinity Titans, to advance to the championship game. Four players \nscored in double figures in the opening game and five players did the \nsame in North Border's win over the Titans.\n  The two victories put the Eagles in the title game to face the team \nthat\n\n[[Page S2728]]\n\ngave the Eagles their first loss on the season a 28 point loss at home. \nAgain, in a performance marked by team balance, four North Border \nplayers scored in double digits including a team high 21 points by \njunior guard/forward Dennis Delude to give the Eagles a victory over \npreviously unbeaten Cando. Three Eagle players--senior Aaron Bonaime, \njunior Nathan Carrier and Delude--were named to the State Class B All-\nTournament Team. The journey these three communities made to become \nstate champions is truly remarkable and inspiring. Once again, \ncongratulations to all those involved in the Eagles successful season \nand to all teams who made it to this year's tournament.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/22/senate-section/article/S2728-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VALLEY HAVEN SCHOOL\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute \nto the Valley Haven School, an important part of the Valley, AL \ncommunity. Valley Haven is a school for infants, toddlers and adults \nwho are mentally retarded or multi-handicapped. On May 5th, the school \nwill hold it's 25th Annual Hike/Bike/Run for Valley Haven, a fund \nraiser which generates the crucial local funding which is vital to the \nschool's survival.\n  Valley Haven School was started 41 years ago and has grown into a \nlarge, professionally staffed operation. With over 116 clients in ages \nranging from 3 months to 70 years, you can see, that Valley Haven must \nmeet significant financial standards each year to maintain viability. \nThe school does this outside of local tax structures, so operating \nexpenses and matching funds for grants must be raised primarily through \nthe community at large. The Hike/Bike/Run for Valley Haven is the key \nfund raiser of the year which helps to bring the community together for \nthis important cause. Among the events included in the occasion are a \n5k, 8K, 10 or 22 mile run, 10 or 5 mile walk, 22, 11, or 5 mile bike, \ntrike, and stroller event, and even a horse trail ride.\n  I take this opportunity to wish all those helping to organize the \nevent and those planning to participate my best wishes in their efforts \nto support the school. Whether contributing time, physical effort, or \nfinancial resources, working to ensure educational opportunities for \nothers is truly a worthy cause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/22/senate-section/article/S2728-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/22/senate-section/article/S2728-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/22/senate-section/article/S2728-4", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:18 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 496.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act, Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 to provide for nondiscriminatory coverage for substance abuse \ntreatment services under private group and individual health coverage, \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will ensure that private health insurance companies cover the \ncosts for drug and alcohol addiction treatment services at the same \nlevel that they pay for treatment for other disease. The purpose of \nthis bill is to end discrimination in insurance coverage for drug and \nalcohol addition treatment. This bill, entitled Fairness in Treatment: \nThe Drug and Alcohol Addition Recovery Act of 2001, offers the \nnecessary provisions to provide this assurance.\n  For too long, the problem of drug and alcohol addiction has been \nviewed as a moral issue, rather than as a disease. Too often, a cloak \nof secrecy has surrounded this problem, causing people who have this \ndisease to feel ashamed and afraid to seek treatment for their symptoms \nfor fear that they will be seen as admitting to a moral failure, or a \nweakness in character. We have all seen portrayals of alcoholics and \naddicts that are intended to be humorous or derogatory, and only \nreinforce the biases against people who have problems with drug and \nalcohol addiction. I cannot imagine this type of portrayal of someone \nwho has another kind of chronic illness, a heart problem, or who \nhappens to carry a gene that predisposes them to diabetes.\n  It has been shown that some forms of addiction have a genetic basis, \nand yet we still try to deny the serious medical nature of this \ndisease. We think of those with this disease as somehow different from \nus. We forget that someone who has a problem with drugs or alcohol can \nlook just like the person we see in the mirror, or the person who is \nsitting next to us at work or on the subway, or like someone in our own \nfamily. In fact, it is likely that most of us know someone who has \nexperienced drug and alcohol addiction, within our families or our \ncircle of friends or coworkers.\n  Alcoholism and drug addiction are painful, private struggles with \nstaggering public costs. A study prepared by Brandeis University's \nSchneider Institute for Health Policy estimated that untreated \naddiction costs America $400 billion per year. This estimate includes \ncosts for alcohol addiction treatment and prevention costs, as well as \ncosts associated with related illnesses, reduced job productivity or \nlost earnings, and other costs to society such as crime and social \nwelfare programs.\n  The medical effects of drug addiction are far-reaching. According to \nthe Physician leadership on National Drug Policy, heavy drinking \ncontributes to illness in each of the top three causes of death: heart \ndisease, cancer, and stroke. A 1996 article in Scientific American \nestimated that excessive alcohol consumption causes more than 100,000 \ndeaths in the U.S. each year. Of these deaths, 24 percent are due to \ndrunken driving, resulting in untold suffering and tragic loss of life.\n  We know that addiction to alcohol and other drugs contribute to other \nproblems as well. Addictive substances have the potential for \ndestroying the person who is addicted, their family, and their other \nrelationships. We know, for example, that fetal alcohol syndrome is the \nleading known cause of mental retardation. If the woman who was \naddicted to alcohol could receive proper treatment, fetal alcohol \nsyndrome for her baby would be 100 percent preventable, and more than \n12,000 infants born in the U.S. each year would not suffer from fetal \nalcohol syndrome, with its irreversible physical and mental damage.\n  We know too of the devastation caused by addiction when violence \nbetween people is one of the consequences. A 1998 SAMHSA report \noutlined the links between domestic violence and substance abuse. We \nknow from clinical reports that 25-50 percent of men who commit acts of \ndomestic violence also have substance abuse problems. The report \nrecognized the link between the victim of abuse and use of alcohol and \ndrugs, and recommended that after the woman's safety has been \naddressed, the next step would be to help with providing treatment for \nher addiction as a step toward independence and health, and toward the \nprevention of the consequences for\n\n[[Page S2733]]\n\nthe children who suffer the same abuse either directly, or indirectly \nby witnessing spousal violence.\n  People who have the disease of addiction can be found throughout our \nsociety. According to the 1997 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse \npublished by SAMHSA, nearly 73 percent of all illegal drug users in the \nUnited States are employed. This number represents 6.7 million full-\ntime workers and 1.6 million part-time workers. Although many of these \nworkers could and should have insurance benefits that would cover \ntreatment for this disease, they do not.\n  In addition to the health problems resulting from the failure to \ntreat the illness, there are other serious consequences affecting the \nworkplace, such as lost productivity, high employee turnover, low \nemployee morale, mistakes, accidents, and increased worker's \ncompensation insurance and health insurance premiums, all results of \nuntreated addiction problems. Whether you are a corporate CEO or a \nsmall business owner, there are simple, effective steps that can be \ntaken, including providing insurance coverage for this disease, ready \naccess to treatment and workplace policies that support treatment, that \ncan reduce these human and economic costs.\n  We know from the outstanding conducted at NIH, through the National \nInstitute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and \nAlcoholism, that treatment for drug and alcohol addiction can be \neffective. We know that treatment of addiction is as success as \ntreatment of other chronic disease such as diabetes, hypertension, and \nasthma. We know that drug treatment reduces drug use by 40-60 percent. \nAnd we know that treatment results in other positive changes in \nbehavior, such as fewer psychological symptoms and increased work \nproductivity. According to American Airlines, 75-85 percent of \nemployees who received alcohol and other drug treatment remained \nabstinent from drugs during their one year follow up.\n  We must do more to prevent this illness and to treat those who are \naddicted to drugs and alcohol. Over the past several years, the \nprinciple of parity in insurance coverage for alcohol and drug \nrehabilitation and treatment has received the strong support of the \nWhite House, the Office for National Drug Control Policy, Former \nSurgeon General C. Everett Koop, Former President and Mrs. Gerald Ford, \nthe U.S. Conference of Mayors, Kaiser Permanente Health Plans and many \nleading figures in medicine, business, government, journalism and \nentertainment who have successfully fought the battle of addiction with \nthe help of treatment. Hearings held in the 106th Congress by the \nSenate Appropriations Committee and the Committee on Labor, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions highlighted the recent major advances in scientific \ninformation about the disease; the biological causes of addiction; the \neffectiveness and low cost of treatment; and many painful, personal \nstories of people, including children, who have been denied treatment. \nRecent hearings in the Judiciary Committee have also emphasized a \ngreater Federal role in funding treatment and prevention programs.\n  We know that the failure of insurance companies to provide treatment \ncan sometimes have devastating results. In a 1999 story, the New York \nTimes highlighted the tragic suicide of a young man who desperately \nsought inpatient treatment care for his drug addiction and fought for 8 \nmonths to have the plan authorize the treatment that was in fact \nincluded in as part of his benefits. The authorization came through, \nbut too late. He had died 3 weeks earlier from a drug overdose. This \nkind of denial of care for addiction treatment is not at all unique. \nThe 1998 Hay Group Report on Employer Health Care Dollars Spent on \nSubstance Abuse showed that from 1988 through 1998 the value of \nsubstance abuse treatment benefits decreased by 74.5 percent, as \ncompared to a 11.5 percent decrease for overall health care benefits.\n  Addiction to alcohol and drugs is a disease that affects the brain, \nthe body, and the spirit. We must provide adequate opportunities for \nthe treatment of addiction in order to help those who are suffering and \nto prevent the health and social problems that it causes. This \nlegislation will take an important step in this direction by requiring \nthat health insurance plans eliminate discrimination for addiction \ntreatment. The costs for this are very low. A 1999 study by the Rand \nCorporation found that the cost to managed care health plans is now \nonly about $5 per person per year for unlimited substance abuse \ntreatment benefits to employees of big companies. A 1997 Milliman and \nRobertson study found that complete substance abuse treatment parity \nwould increase per capita health insurance premiums by only one half of \n1 percent, or less than $1 per member per month, without even \nconsidering any of the obvious savings, that will result from \ntreatment. Several studies have shown that for every $1 spent on \ntreatment, more than $7 is saved in other health care expenses, and \nthat these savings are in addition to the financial and other benefits \nof increased productivity, as well as participation in family and \ncommunity life. Providing treatment for addiction also saves millions \nof dollars in the criminal justice system. But for treatment to be \neffective and helpful throughout our society all systems of care, \nincluding private insurance plans, must share this responsibility.\n  This legislation does not mandate that health insurers offer \nsubstance addiction treatment benefits. What it does is prohibit \ndiscrimination by health plans who offer substance addiction treatment \nfrom placing unfair and life-threatening limitations on caps, access, \nor financial requirements for addiction treatment that are different \nfrom other medical and surgical services.\n  We must move forward now to vigorously address the serious and life-\nthreatening problem of drug and alcohol addiction in our country. It is \nlong past time that insurance companies do their fair share in bearing \nthe responsibility for treating this disease.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 595\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for a comprehensive and balanced national \nenergy policy; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today, I, along with many of my \ncolleagues in the Senate, members of the Democratic caucus, have \nintroduced two bills: the Comprehensive and Balanced Energy Policy Act \nof 2001, and its companion measure, the Energy Security and Tax \nIncentive Act of 2001. I expect the first of those will be referred to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the other will be \nreferred to the Committee on Finance because it does contain tax \nprovisions.\n  Mr. President, the Nation is facing important challenges to its \nenergy future. For decades, we have been able to rely on the fact that \nour energy supplies were abundant, dependable, and affordable. Events \nin recent months have shaken the faith of many in that reliance. \nVolatile prices, high prices and outright failures of supply are \nreported in newspaper headlines almost daily.\n  Why are we seeing these problems emerge now? Energy prices remained \nrelatively stable over the last decade due to increased productivity, \nlower energy use per dollar of GDP, and introduction of market \ncompetition. All of these factors acted to hold down prices, in spite \nof robust economic growth and increasing demand for energy. Before the \nintroduction of competition into energy markets we had policies that \nrequired large excess capacity margins. We paid a lot for that excess \ncapacity in the past, but we also benefitted from that buffer. It kept \nthe system functioning as markets restructured with low prices and \nrelatively minor bumps along the way. As the economic growth of recent \nyears has used up that excess capacity in the fuels, power and natural \ngas sectors, the frictions and imperfections in those markets have \nbecome apparent. That is what we are seeing today.\n\n[[Page S2736]]\n\n  Three weeks ago, when Senator Murkowski, Chairman of the Energy \nCommittee on which I serve, introduced the Republican energy message \nbill, I gave an outline of what I thought should be included in \ncomprehensive energy legislation for the Congress to put together a \nbalanced and adequate response to the energy issues that confront the \nNation.\n  At that time I said that I strongly believed that a package with \nequal emphasis on both supply and demand side measures developed with \nbipartisan support is the only way we can pass energy legislation this \nCongress.\n  The key word is balance. The bill introduced by my Republican \ncolleague is strong on the supply side and I support many of its \nprovisions but short on the demand side of the equation. Many \nprovisions of the Republican package I support, as do a number of my \nDemocratic colleagues.\n  However, after reviewing that bill overall, I believe it is \nappropriate to introduce a countermeasure, a measure that addresses our \nenergy needs as I see it in a more balanced and comprehensive way. This \nwill help our discussion for final legislation in this area and help \nfocus in on what the priorities need to be as we move forward.\n  The first of the issues left out of the Republican bill for any real \nconsideration was the issue of climate change. In 1992, the Senate \nratified the Rio Treaty calling for a reduction in carbon dioxide \nemissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. I know some in this body do \nnot believe we should have acted to approve that treaty, but we did. \nLast year, instead of reaching those 1990 levels by the year 2000, we \nwere 17 percent above those levels.\n  We and the rest of the world have recognized the vital importance of \npreventing the potential for catastrophic climate change, that our \nhuman activities are, in fact, threatening. We have made commitments, \nbut we have not met those commitments. We need to do so, not as some \nisolated exercise undertaken without regard to the economy, but as an \nintegral part of our energy policy for the 21st century.\n  In my view, we cannot separate climate change policy from energy \npolicy. To do one is to inextricably affect the other. The policy bill \nI am introducing creates a bipartisan national commission on energy and \nclimate change to be appointed by this President and to conduct a study \nof measures that could achieve stabilization of greenhouse gas \nemissions in this country at 1990 levels by the year 2010--and below \n1990 levels by the year 2020.\n  The commission would then develop recommendations concerning measures \nappropriate for implementation, for legislation, and for administrative \naction to implement this goal.\n  There are some who believe we should be looking at even deeper cuts \nto our emissions than to return to 1990 levels by 2010. I have some \nsympathy for that perspective. But if we are to take a bipartisan \napproach to the task of integrating climate change policy with energy \npolicy, it is more realistic to start with a point that the Senate is \non record as agreeing to. Most Members who were here at the time the \nvote occurred in 1992 on the Rio Treaty believe that commitment to go \nto 1990 levels by the year 2000, although on a voluntary basis, was a \ngood-faith and reasonable commitment.\n  I believe there should not be objection to reaching that same goal \ngiven an extra 10 years in which to achieve it. The answer to how we \nget to this point may help illuminate the issues of what more \naggressive actions are needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The \nbill I am introducing calls for a much more vigorous effort by the U.S. \nGovernment to get U.S. clean energy technology into developing \ncountries that are expected to experience major increases in their \ngreenhouse gas emissions over the next decade.\n  The United States cannot solve the greenhouse gas problem by itself, \nand we all know that. Other countries need to do their part. But since \nour particular strength in this country has been the development of \ntechnology, we should be making every effort to help those developing \ncountries adopt the cleanest technologies in each energy area that we \nhave to offer.\n  It makes good business sense, it makes good climate sense, and the \nappropriate Federal agencies should help facilitate the process.\n  Another missing element in the Republican bill is the area of how to \nsite energy infrastructure. There has been a lot of talk about the \nproblem, but not much action beyond finger-pointing in this area. I \nbelieve we need to recognize the wisdom of the old Pogo adage, ``We \nhave met the enemy and he is us.'' Even communities that are \nexperiencing energy crunches are having trouble siting new energy \ninfrastructure because of local sentiment against it. This is not \nprincipally a problem with environmental regulations, as some would \nsuggest. It is NIMBY-- ``not in my backyard''--pure and simple.\n  If we are to effectively deal with this siting problem, we will need \nnew tools and models. One that I think is particularly promising is \nregional cooperation, partly because most energy markets are regional. \nFor example, as technologies for transmitting electricity have \nimproved, electric utilities have come more and more to depend on the \nwholesale market for electricity supply. Those markets are increasingly \nregional in scope.\n  A similar picture can be painted for the natural gas market. In order \nto meet the challenges of these new market realities, we must change \nthe regulatory institutions to reflect the structures of the market. \nThe markets are regional. So we must think regionally.\n  We have seen regional bodies help site other important societal \ninfrastructure, such as highways. But if a similar construct is to be \nhelpful in the energy area, there will be a great need for technical \nassistance and for a regular forum where regional leaders and decision \nmakers in Federal agencies can meet to discuss the real issues and \nproblems. For that reason, the bill I am introducing has provisions \nthat have the DOE meet these needs.\n  I realize that this is a small beginning, but I believe this is an \nimportant piece of this bill. I know that a number of States, \nparticularly in the West and the Northeast, as well as other regions, \nare already engaged in varying degrees of cooperative effort to address \nthe regionalization of energy markets. I look forward to working with \nthe States, and with Federal agencies to develop a framework to support \nthese efforts.\n  The bill that I am introducing requires a review of the adequacy of \nFERC transmission policies and its interpretation of market power. It \ncalls for an investigation of the possibility using existing rights-of-\nway owned by Federal Power Marketing agencies for siting energy \nfacilities.\n  As the electricity industry has changed, the structure for assuring \nthe reliability of the power grid has come under fire. Many in the \nindustry and the regulatory community believe that the old system of \nself-policing, voluntary compliance with rules generated by the \nsuppliers will not continue to provide the reliability that we have \ncome to expect.\n  Last year the Senate passed a bill that addressed this issue by \ncreating a new entity to develop and enforce electric reliability \nrules. I have included that bill as part of this package, and the text \nis identical to what was included in the Republican bill I mentioned \nearlier.\n  This bill also contains a number of provisions intended to provide \nadditional protection for electricity consumers. Among these are \nprotections against such unfair trade practices as slamming and \ncramming; encouragement to the States to ensure universal and \naffordable service; a rural construction grant program; a comprehensive \nIndian energy program; greater transparency of information on the \navailability transmission and generating capacity; and a public \nbenefits fund to help States with various energy efficiency, renewable \nenergy and low income energy programs and to support investments in \nclimate change mitigation.\n  Perhaps most importantly, this bill contains language to address the \nimmediate crisis being experienced by California, both in terms of \nelectricity and natural gas. We cannot ignore the problem of \nCalifornia, or simply sit back and give speeches heaping blame on their \npoliticians and then think that we've done our job. The motto carved in \nstone over the desk of the Presiding Officer in this Chamber is ``E \nPluribus Unum,'' or, ``Out of Many, One.'' A more colloquial version of \nthat might be, ``We're all in this together.''\n\n[[Page S2737]]\n\n The market in California for electricity and gas is broken in several \nrespects. In the two hearings we have held before the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources, it is clear that the prices received by \nmany generators are far above the cost of production. It is also clear \nthat market signals are not getting through to consumers. The \nprovisions of this bill, which I have inserted at the request of \nSenator Feinstein, take on both of those issues. These provisions to \nhelp Californians deserve full and careful attention by the Senate, \nbecause this issue is worsening as we speak.\n  One of the best ways to protect against market volatility in energy \nis to diversify supply sources. I believe that much can be done to \nincrease energy supplies from traditional resources, and the bills that \nI am introducing, taken together have a robust mix of tax and policy \nprovisions to see that we continue to develop our domestic energy \nresources effectively. Of particular importance are countercyclical tax \nmeasures that kick in when prices fall to very low levels, so that new \ndomestic production does not come to a standstill. If we can even out \nsome of the boom-and-bust quality of our domestic oil and gas drilling, \nwe will maintain both the production and the skilled labor force in oil \nand natural gas exploration and production that this country needs.\n\n  The bill that I am introducing does not open ANWR to oil and gas \ndrilling. I find it ironic that, at the same time the President is \nseeking to open up ANWR a wildlife refuge, he is being importuned by \nhis brother, the Governor of Florida, to put a large and promising \ntract in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico off limits to oil and gas \nleasing. The policy bill that I am introducing today mandates that the \nlease sale go forward on its current schedule.\n  Let me just make reference to that with this chart. This chart shows \nthe area at issue. It is called the Sale 181 area. As you can see most \nof it is over 100 miles from Florida:\n  It is this area fully 100 miles from Florida we believe should be \noffered for development without hesitation. It is scheduled for \nDecember, and we do not believe it is good public policy for us to back \naway from developing resources in an area where we have a demonstrated \nhistory of safe and environmentally sensitive development. This area in \nthe deepwater should be made available for leasing and exploration, and \nwe believe it will be if this legislation becomes law.\n  Although the Democratic energy legislation does not open ANWR, it \ndoes take what I think is a meaningful step to make sure that the \nabundant natural gas in Alaska, which is produced around Prudhoe Bay, \nmakes it to the lower 48 States where it is needed. The Democratic \nenergy tax bill contains a tax incentive for any Alaskan gas that \nenters interstate commerce before January 1, 2009. This should be a \nsignificant inducement to producers to get the various proposals for \npipelines between Alaska and the lower 48 sorted out, and to start \nbuilding a pipeline to bring that gas to our markets as soon as \npossible.\n  In addition to traditional energy sources, both bills that I am \nintroducing encourage alternative energy supplies. This bill gives a \ngreat deal of attention to renewable resources, such as wind, solar, \ngeothermal, biomass, hydroelectric and other renewable generation \noptions, as well as encouraging development and deployment of fuel \ncells, distributed generation and combined heating and power \nfacilities. We require Federal energy facilities to set the example by \nmeeting targets for percentages of their electricity supply to be \nderived from renewable resources. We also require that the rules for \ninterconnection of electricity customers who self-generate, especially \nwith renewable resources, be spelled out and made equitable. The bill \nwould ease access to the transmission system for intermittent sources \nsuch as wind generators.\n\n  That is a brief summary of what the Democratic bill does on energy \nsupply. But, as I mentioned in the beginning of my remarks, this bill \nbalances its emphasis on supply with a strong emphasis on demand \nreduction and efficiency.\n  Increasing the efficient use of energy is the single most effective \nand least-cost energy policy for the short term and long term. Just \nyesterday, the Wall Street Journal ran an article titled ``States \nRediscover Energy Policies''.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, following my remarks, to have \nprinted in the Record this article from yesterday's issue of the Wall \nStreet Journal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the focus of the article is the fact \nthat overall the last decade a number of States reduced their \ncommitments to energy efficiency at a cost of 15,000 megawatts in power \nsavings, and that now many States, through the National Association of \nState Energy Officials, are refocusing their attention on energy \nefficiency--the easiest and least cost source of energy.\n  Energy-efficient lighting, appliances, and buildings generate \nbenefits in terms of energy savings, emission reductions and human \nhealth improvements. Improvements to installation practices for heating \nand cooling systems, including duct-work, could take considerable \npressure off the power grid and natural gas supplies almost \nimmediately.\n  We have included a number provisions that will help bring the next \ngeneration of ultra efficient appliances into the marketplace sooner. \nWe would also establish a new program to make grants to local school \ndistricts to improve energy efficiency of school buildings and expand \nthe use of renewable energy. Research has shown that better lighting, \nheating and cooling systems improve students' performance. We are \nurging the Secretary of Energy to work with energy-intensive industries \nto negotiate voluntary agreements to improve their energy intensity.\n  This bill also takes on the issue of energy efficiency in vehicles. \nThat is a controversial issue. A lot has been said on this floor about \nthe undesirability of depending on foreign sources of oil. But most of \nthat oil goes into transportation fuel uses. If we're really serious \nabout energy policy, climate policy, and national energy security, then \nwe need to address vehicle fuel efficiency.\n  Hardly a speech is given on the Senate floor that does not talk about \nhow unfortunate it is that our dependence on foreign oil continues to \ngrow. We need to recognize what the main cause of that increased \ndependence is that we are consuming more and more petroleum in the \ntransportation sector of our economy.\n  The top line on this chart shows the amount of consumption of \npetroleum in the transportation sector. This is up to the year 2000. \nThen you can see what is expected in the next 20 years with this \nenormous increase in the amount of petroleum going into our \ntransportation sector.\n  The debate on fuel efficiency has often been sidetracked into a \ndiscussion of specific proposals to change the corporate average fuel \neconomy, or CAFE standards. Disagreements on CAFE have kept us from \nmaking progress on fuel efficiency in this country at a huge cost to \nconsumers and our economy.\n  At the same time, U.S.-based automobile manufacturers have entered \ninto voluntary agreements with European countries to significantly \nincrease the fuel efficiency of vehicles sold in Europe. While I \nrecognize that there may be differences between Europe and the U.S., \nthe concept of requiring a negotiation to see what can be done to \nfurther fuel efficiency in this country sounds like a reasonable idea \nto me. We ought to let the Department of Transportation take the lead, \nand authorize as much flexibility as possible in how an agreement is \nstructured and what mechanisms are used to ensure the development of a \nvibrant market for fuel-efficient vehicles. That is exactly what this \nbill does on fuel efficiency does. It keeps the focus on the ultimate \ngoal--how much petroleum gets consumed by light-duty vehicles. It \nallows consumption to grow slightly over the next few years, but \nrequires implementation of policies that would cap the increase in fuel \nuse in the light vehicle sector by the year 2008 by no more than 5 \npercent above the level of use in 2000. The effect of this proposal is \nto increase fuel efficiency by more than just closing the light truck \n``loophole'' in the CAFE standards, while at the same time ensuring the \nlight trucks needed by farmers, ranchers and\n\n[[Page S2738]]\n\nbusinesses are still available. The flexibility with respect to the \nmechanisms, but not the final result, will protect U.S. manufacturing \njobs.\n  Let me show another chart that relates to this. The chart is entitled \n``Potential Oil Supply From Arctic National Wildlife Refuge versus the \nOil Savings From Improved Vehicle Fuel Economy.''\n  You can see the amount of oil supply anticipated from ANWR, according \nto the U.S. Geological Survey. It is this first column. If you double \nthat, if you assume that estimate is wrong and double it, you get this \nvolume.\n  Vehicle fuel economy by the year 2010 will yield a much greater \nsavings to us in oil usage than we could possibly achieve by drilling \nin ANWR, and by the year 2020 there is absolutely no comparison, as I \nam sure this chart aptly demonstrates.\n  Beyond increases in vehicle fuel efficiency, this bill also seeks to \nrelieve stress on our fuel system by studying how to move to regional \nor national fuel standards, so that there is more flexibility in the \nfuel delivery system to accommodate refinery shutdowns or pipeline \nproblems. The bill would also require Federal fleet vehicles with \nalternative dual fuel capability to increase their use of the \nalternative fuel to 50 percent of the total use by 2003, and 75 percent \nby 2005. In addition, State highway agencies would be permitted to \nallow alternative fuel vehicles to use High Occupancy Vehicle lanes on \nhighways, regardless of the number of passengers carried.\n  Along with the commitment to implementing available technologies must \ncome a long-term commitment to development of new technologies. This \nbill would establish the framework for a comprehensive research, \ndevelopment and deployment program to reduce energy intensity by 1.9 \npercent per year through 2020, reduce total consumption by eight \nquadrillion Btu in 2020 and reduce total carbon dioxide emission from \nexpected levels by 166 million tons per year by 2020.\n  This kind of commitment to a coordinated, comprehensive research and \ndevelopment program is essential if we are to meet the challenges that \nlie before us. One of the biggest disappointments of the new \nadministration to date is its lack of attention to the importance of \nscience and technology in general, and of energy R in particular. By \nall accounts, the new Bush administration is preparing to savage DOE \nenergy technology programs, particularly in renewables and energy \nefficiency, in the detailed budget that it will be sending to the \nCongress in early April. I don't see how the administration can have a \ncredible energy strategy at the same time that it is cutting energy \nR\n  The bill that I am introducing recognizes that our energy future \ndepends crucially on our ability to innovate to produce more energy, at \nlower cost, and to use the resulting energy more efficiently.\n  The Clinton administration--the previous administration-- prepared a \ncomprehensive plan for boosting energy research and development \nspending, but it could find very little support for that proposal in \nCongress. That was in 1997. We have taken that blueprint and we have \nupdated it to reflect some of the past appropriations by the Congress. \nI believe that we have come up with a broad approach to boost research \nand development spending for energy efficiency and for every energy \nsupply option that is on the table.\n  This bill also supports basic science that is related to energy that \nmay lead to discoveries that could create entirely new energy \ntechnologies, such as happened when high-temperature superconductivity \nwas discovered in the late 1980s. The Department of Energy's Office of \nScience has had a stagnant budget throughout the 1990s. We now see \nevidence that this lag negatively affected our productivity in basic \nareas such as chemistry, physics, and material sciences. The U.S. \nscientific productivity in these disciplines, which support both energy \nresearch and develpment as well as research and development in other \nhigh-tech areas, is markedly lower now than during the 1970s and 1980s. \nMany of us in Congress are talking about the need to double the budget \nfor the National Institutes of Health. The administration is talking \nabout that as well. I support doing that. But there is a similar \nnational need to greatly increase our support for basic energy research \nand development. This effort to maintain research and development in \nthis energy area is absolutely essential if Congress is going to do \nwhat needs to be done in this area.\n  Tax Policy. Along with the programs outlined above, we need to \nconsider the use of tax incentives to encourage commercial activities \nthat will meet the goals for increased efficiency and diversification \nof our energy supplies. To accomplish this we have included tax credits \nand incentives to accompany the policy programs that we have \nauthorized, such as, stimulus for residential and commercial energy \nefficiency, renewable energy development, clean coal technology, and \ndistributed generation. To complement these incentives and encourage \nfurther development of new traditional supplies we have also provided \nfor tax incentives for heating fuels and storage and oil and gas \nproduction.\n  Mr. President, the lights went off again this week in California. We \nare all aware of that. Electricity bills throughout the West are \ncausing businesses to shut down because they can't afford to operate. \nWe are threatened with that in my own state of New Mexico. Citizens \nacross the country have seen their gas bills double and in some cases \ntriple the level they were a year ago. If you drive up to the gasoline \npump you will see numbers that would have surprised and shocked you not \ntoo long ago. I think the citizens of this Nation know that the energy \nindustries are in trouble, and that actually will mean trouble for \nthem. We in Congress--we in Washington--need to respond.\n  This bill is an attempt to further the dialogue that has already \nbegun in this Congress. Consider it as an outline. We need to hold \nhearings. We need to debate how best to respond. We need to develop a \nbalanced response that takes advantage of all the options that are \navailable to us. We can't supply our way out of this unfortunate \ncircumstance. We can't just conserve our way out of it either. We must \ndo both. I expect many changes in the content of this bill before we \nare finally finished. But this is a good beginning toward a \ncomprehensive and balanced energy policy for the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of both bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 596\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as ``Energy \n     Science and Technology Enhancement Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--\n       (1) A coherent strategy for ensuring a diverse national \n     energy supply requires an energy research and development \n     program that supports basic energy research and provides \n     mechanisms to develop, demonstrate, and deploy new energy \n     technologies in partnership with industry.\n       (2) Federal budget authority for energy research and \n     development, measured in constant 1992 dollars, has declined \n     roughly three-fourths from about $6 billion in 1980 to $1.5 \n     billion in 2000.\n       (3) According to the Energy Information Administration, an \n     aggressive national energy research, development, and \n     technology deployment program can--\n       (A) result in United States energy intensity declines of \n     1.9 percent per year from 1999 to 2020;\n       (B) reduce United States energy consumption in 2020 by 8 \n     quadrillion Btu from otherwise expected levels; and\n       (C) reduce carbon dioxide emissions from expected levels of \n     166 million metric tons in carbon equivalent in 2020.\n       (4) An aggressive national energy research, development, \n     and technology deployment program can also help maintain \n     domestic United States production of energy. As one example, \n     such a program could increase the success rates of finding \n     and drilling for oil and natural gas, and thereby increase \n     United States hydrocarbon reserves in 2020 by 14 percent over \n     otherwise expected levels, and contributing to natural gas \n     prices in 2020 that would be 20 percent lower than otherwise \n     expected.\n       (5) An aggressive national energy research, development, \n     and technology deployment program is needed if United States \n     suppliers and manufacturers are to compete in future \n     markets for advanced energy technologies. Vehicles based \n     on advanced energy technologies in automotive applications \n     could account, for example, for nearly 17 percent of all \n     light-duty vehicle sales by 2020 displacing 203,000 oil \n     barrels a day equivalent.\n       (6) To achieve these results across a broad range of \n     sources of energy supply and energy end-uses, a comprehensive \n     and balanced energy research, development, and technology \n     deployment program must be supported by the Department of \n     Energy.\n\n     SEC. 1402. ENHANCED ENERGY EFFICIENCY RESEARCH AND \n                   DEVELOPMENT.\n\n       (a) Goals.--It is the sense of Congress that a balanced \n     energy research, development, and deployment program to \n     enhance energy efficiency should have the following goals:\n       (1) For energy efficiency in housing, the program develop \n     technologies, housing components, designs and production \n     methods that will, by 2010--\n       (A) reduce the time needed to move technologies to market \n     by 50 percent,\n       (B) reduce the monthly cost of new housing by 20 percent,\n       (C) cut the environmental impact and energy use of new \n     housing by 50 percent, and\n       (D) reduce energy use in 15 million existing homes by 30 \n     percent, and\n       (E) improve durability and reduce maintenance costs by 50 \n     percent.\n       (2) For industrial energy efficiency, the program should, \n     in cooperation with the affected industries--\n       (A) develop a microturbine (40 to 300 kilowatt) that is \n     more than 40 percent efficient by 2006,\n       (B) develop a microturbine that is more than 50 percent \n     efficient by 2010,\n       (C) develop advanced materials for combustion systems that \n     reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides by 30 to 50 percent while \n     increasing efficiency 5 to 10 percent by 2007, and\n       (D) improve the energy intensity of the major energy-\n     consuming industries by at least 25 percent by 2010.\n       (3) For transportation energy efficiency, the program \n     should, in cooperation with affected industries--\n\n[[Page S2769]]\n\n       (A) develop an 80-mile-per-gallon production prototype \n     passenger automobile by 2004,\n       (B) develop a heavy truck (Classes 7 and 8) with ultra low \n     emissions and the ability to use an alternative fuel that has \n     an average fuel economy of--\n       (i) 10 miles per gallon by 2007, and\n       (ii) 13 miles per gallon by 2010,\n       (C) develop a production prototype of a passenger \n     automobile with zero equivalent emissions that has an average \n     fuel economy of 100 miles per gallon by 2010, and\n       (D) improve, by 2010, the average fuel economy of trucks--\n       (i) in Classes 1 and 2 by 300 percent, and\n       (ii) in Classes 3 through 6 by 200 percent.\n       (b) Definition.--For purposes of subsection (a)(2), the \n     term ``major energy consuming industries'' means--\n       (1) the forest product industry,\n       (2) the steel industry,\n       (3) the aluminum industry,\n       (4) the metal casting industry,\n       (5) the chemical industry,\n       (6) the petroleum refining industry, and\n       (7) the glass-making industry.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary of Energy for operating \n     expenses and capital equipment for research, development, \n     demonstration, and initial deployment assistance activities \n     related to energy efficiency research and development \n     including state and local grants and the federal energy \n     management program--\n       (1) $879,000,000 for fiscal year 2002;\n       (2) $948,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;\n       (3) $1,024,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;\n       (4) $1,106,000,000 for fiscal year 2005; and\n       (5) $1,195,000,000 for fiscal year 2006.\n       (d) Special Projects in Energy-Efficient Transmission.--\n     From amounts authorized under this section, the Secretary of \n     Energy shall make not more than 3 awards for projects \n     demonstrating the use of advanced technology--\n       (1) to construct a bulk electricity transmission line of \n     not less than 35 miles based on wire fabricated from \n     superconducting materials; and\n       (2) to provide a 20 percent increase in the average \n     efficiency in electricity transmission systems in rural and \n     remote areas.\n\n     SEC. 1403. ENHANCED RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH AND \n                   DEVELOPMENT.\n\n       (a) Goals.--It is the sense of Congress that a balanced \n     energy research, development, and deployment program to \n     enhance renewable energy should have the following goals.\n       (1) For wind power, the program should reduce the cost of \n     wind electricity by 50 percent by 2006, so that wind power \n     can be widely competitive with fossil-fuel-based electricity \n     in a restructured electric industry, with concentration \n     within the program on a variety of advanced wind turbine \n     concepts and manufacturing technologies.\n       (2) For photovoltaics, the programs should pursue research \n     and development that would lead to photovoltaic systems \n     prices of $3,000 per kilowatt in 2003 and $1500 per kilowatt \n     by 2006. Program activities should include assisting industry \n     in developing manufacturing technologies, giving greater \n     attention to balance of system issues, and expanding \n     fundamental research on relevant advanced materials.\n       (3) For solar thermal electric systems the program should \n     strengthen ongoing research and development combining high-\n     efficiency and high-temperature receivers with advanced \n     thermal storage and power cycles, with the goal of making \n     solar-only power (including baseload solar power) widely \n     competitive with fossil fuel power by 2015.\n       (4) For biomass-based power systems, the program should \n     enable commercialization, within five years, integrated \n     power-generating technologies that employ gas turbines and \n     fuel cells integrated with biomass gasifiers. The program \n     should embrace an interagency bioenergy framework to triple \n     United States bioenergy use by 2010.\n       (5) For geothermal energy, the programs should continue \n     work on hydrothermal systems, and reactivate research and \n     development on advanced concepts, giving top priority to \n     high-grade hot dry-rock geothermal energy. This technology \n     offers the long-term potential, with advanced drilling and \n     reservoir exploitation technology, of providing heat and \n     baseload electricity in most areas of the United States.\n       (6) For biofuels, the program should accelerate research \n     and development on advanced enzymatic hydrolysis technology \n     for making ethanol from cellulosic feedstock, with the goal \n     that between 2010 and 2015 ethanol produced from energy crops \n     would be fully competitive in terms of price with gasoline as \n     a neat fuel, in either internal combustion engine or fuel \n     cell vehicles. The programs should coordinate this \n     development with the biopower program so as to co-optimize \n     the production of ethanol from the carbohydrate fractions of \n     the biomass and electricity from the lighting using advanced \n     biopower technology using a suite of integrated systems from \n     gas turbines to fuel cells.\n       (7) For hydrogen-based energy systems, the program should \n     support research and development on hydrogen-using and \n     hydrogen-producing technologies. The programs should also \n     coordinate hydrogen-using technology development with proton-\n     exchange-membrane fuel-cell vehicle development activities \n     under the enhanced energy efficiency program in section 1002.\n       (8) For hydropower, the program should provide a new \n     generation of turbine technologies that are less damaging to \n     fish and aquatic ecosystems. By deploying such technologies \n     at existing dams and in new low-head, run-of-river \n     applications, as much as an additional 50,000 MW could be \n     possible by 2020.\n       (9) For electric energy and storage, the program should \n     develop a high capacity superconducting transmission lines, \n     generators, and develop distributed generating systems to \n     accommodate multiple types of energy sources under a common \n     interconnect standard.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary of Energy for operating \n     expenses and capital equipment for research, development, \n     demonstration, and initial deployment assistance activities \n     related to solar and renewable resources technologies, under \n     the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, as \n     follows:\n       (1) $419,500,000 for fiscal year 2002;\n       (2) $468,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;\n       (3) $523,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;\n       (4) $583,000,000 for fiscal year 2005; and\n       (5) $652,000,000 for fiscal year 2006.\n       (d) Special Projects in Renewable Energy.--From amounts \n     authorized under this section, the Secretary of Energy shall \n     make not more than 3 awards for projects demonstrating the \n     use of advanced wind energy technology to assist in \n     delivering electricity in rural and remote locations. The \n     Secretary may provide financial assistance to rural electric \n     cooperatives and other rural entities seeking to submit \n     proposals for such projects.\n\n     SEC. 1404. ENHANCED FOSSIL ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.\n\n       (a) Goals.--It is the sense of Congress that a balanced \n     energy research, development, and deployment program to \n     enhance renewable energy should have the following goals:\n       (1) For core fossil energy research and development, the \n     program should achieve the goals outlined by the Department \n     of Energy's Vision 21 program for fossil energy research. \n     This research should aim towards increased efficiency of the \n     combined cycle using high temperature fuel cells, advanced \n     gasification technologies for coal and biomass to produce \n     power and clean fuels.

ENHANCED NUCLEAR ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.\n\n       (a) Goals.--It is the sense of Congress that a balanced \n     energy research, development, and deployment program to \n     enhance renewable energy should have the following goals:\n       (1) The program should support research related to existing \n     United States nuclear power reactors to extend their \n     lifetimes and increase their reliability while optimizing \n     their current operations for greater efficiencies.\n       (2) The program should address examine advanced \n     proliferation-resistant reactor designs, proliferation-\n     resistant and high burn-up nuclear fuels, minimization of \n     generation of radioactive materials, improved nuclear waste \n     management technologies, and improved instrumentation \n     science.\n       (3) The program should attract new students and faculty to \n     the nuclear sciences and nuclear engineering through a \n     university-based fundamental research program for existing \n     faculty and new junior faculty, a program to re-license \n     existing training reactors at universities in conjunction \n     with industry, and a program to complete the conversion \n     of existing training reactors with proliferation resistant \n     fuels that are low enriched and to\n\n[[Page S2770]]\n\n     adapt those reactors to new investigative uses.\n       (4) The program should maintain a national capability and \n     infrastructure to produce medical isotopes and ensure a well \n     trained cadre of nuclear medicine specialists in partnership \n     with industry.\n       (5) The program should ensure that our nation has adequate \n     capability for power future satellite and space missions.\n       (6) The programs should investigate the fundamental and \n     applied sciences associated with high- and low-energy \n     accelerators as a method to transmute nuclear waste, \n     particularly wastes that may be difficult to dispose of by \n     other methods.\n       (7) The program should maintain, where appropriate through \n     a prioritization process, a balanced research infrastructure \n     so that future research programs can utilize these \n     facilities.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary of Energy for operating \n     expenses and capital equipment for research, development, \n     demonstration, and initial deployment assistance activities \n     related to nuclear energy research and development:\n       (1) $433,000,000 for fiscal year 2002;\n       (2) $461,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;\n       (3) $491,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;\n       (4) $523,000,000 for fiscal year 2005; and\n       (5) $557,000,000 for fiscal year 2006.\n\n     SEC. 1406. ENHANCED PROGRAMS IN FUNDAMENTAL ENERGY SCIENCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Office of Science within the Department of Energy \n     is the nation's single largest funding source for the basic \n     physical sciences. These intellectual disciplines, which \n     include physics, chemistry, and materials science, are \n     crucial to the nation's future ability to develop energy \n     technologies. The United States should be the world leader in \n     these areas.\n       (2) Despite the importance of the physical sciences, the \n     Office of Science budget has remained stagnant over the past \n     decade.\n       (3) The stagnation in funding for the physical sciences \n     through the Office of Science has been reflected in a decline \n     in United States contributions to leading scientific \n     journals, as the share of European and Asian submissions to \n     these journals since 1990 has increased from 50 to 75 percent \n     while the United States share has decreased to 25 percent.\n       (b) Goals.--It is the sense of Congress that the Department \n     of Energy, through the Office of Science, should--\n       (1) develop a robust portfolio of fundamental energy \n     research, including chemical sciences, physics, materials \n     sciences, biological and environmental sciences, geosciences, \n     engineering sciences, plasma sciences, mathematics, and \n     advanced scientific computing;\n       (2) maintain, upgrade and expand the scientific user \n     facilities maintained by the Office of Science and insure \n     that they are an integral part of the Department's mission \n     for exploring the frontiers of fundamental energy sciences;\n       (3) maintain a leading-edge research capability in the \n     energy-related aspects of nanoscience and nanotechnology, \n     advanced scientific computing and genome research; and\n       (4) ensure that its fundamental energy sciences programs, \n     where appropriate, help inform the applied research and \n     development programs of the Department.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary of Energy for operating \n     expenses and capital equipment for fundamental energy \n     research and development in the Office of Science--\n       (1) $3,716,000,000 for fiscal year 2002;\n       (2) $4,087,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;\n       (3) $4,496,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;\n       (4) $4,946,000,000 for fiscal year 2005; and\n       (5) $5,440,000,000 for fiscal year 2006.\n       TITLE XV--MANAGEMENT OF DOE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS\n\n     SEC. 1501.

At least five governors have created \n     task forces to recommend responses to the current crisis \n     while energy legislation of all sorts is pending in nearly \n     every state capital in the nation.\n       In the Northeast, where officials fear a hot summer could \n     bring electricity shortages and soaring prices, the New \n     England Governors' Conference has, after four years of \n     dormancy, revived its power-planning arm to coordinate every \n     policy among the six states. And at ground zero, California, \n     lawmakers have filed more than 30 energy-related bills.\n\n\n                           back to the future\n\n       The policies under consideration should be familiar to \n     anyone who remembers the energy shocks of the 1970s and the \n     high prices of the 1980s--old standbys like tax breaks for \n     new power sources, such as windmills or solar cells; rebates \n     for energy-efficient appliances and renovations; and just \n     plain-old planning ahead. But this time, consumer and \n     environmental activists say, state officials ought to do \n     something different; actually follow the policies they adopt.\n       Today's situation might well be far less dire had states \n     stuck with programs adopted in the wake of the earlier energy \n     crises, particularly in energy efficiency. These programs--\n     financed by small surcharges on utility bills, administered \n     by utilities and overseen by state regulators--were key \n     components of energy policies in nearly every state. But in \n     the years leading up to the current crisis, spending on state \n     energy-efficiency programs fell by nearly half nationwide--to \n     $912.5 million in 1998 from $1.65 billion in 1993--at a cost \n     of nearly 15,000 megawatts in power savings, according to the \n     American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a \n     Washington, D.C., advocacy group.\n       California, by many estimates, would have 1,000 more \n     megawatts of power available right now had it merely \n     maintained energy-efficiency spending at 1993 levels, instead \n     of allowing it to plunge by half. That's enough generating \n     capacity to power about one million homes. In Washington \n     State, where a drought is hampering hydroelectric generation \n     and compounding the West's power shortage, steady investment \n     in energy efficiency would have produced 300 megawatts in \n     extra generating capacity (enough for about 300,000 \n     households), according to the NW Energy Coalition, a Seattle-\n     based group that advocates for conservation and alternative \n     energy sources, like wind and solar power.\n       Energy-efficiency spending fell 73% in Washington between \n     1993 and 1998. Ironically, the decline coincided with the \n     state's 1994 adoption of an energy strategy that stated its \n     main focus was efficiency. ``There's no question that had we \n     maintained that commitment to conservation, we'd be several \n     hundred megawatts better off,'' says David Danner, energy \n     policy adviser to Washington Gov. Gary Locke.\n       The West, of course, isn't alone. Two-thirds of states \n     allowed energy-efficiency spending to fall by 20% or more \n     between 1993 and 1998, including Georgia, which saw a 97% \n     reduction; Michigan, 93%; and Pennsylvania, 92%. More \n     broadly, these declines reflect a trend that relegated state \n     energy policies and programs to diminished roles. In 1989, \n     the average state energy office had 44 employees and a budget \n     of $22.5 million, according to the National Association of \n     State Energy Officials, an Alexandria, Va.-based professional \n     organization. A decade later, the average office had only 29 \n     employees and a $14.5 million budget--a cut of about 35%. \n     ``There wasn't a whole lot of interest in energy,'' says \n     Frank Bishop, executive director of the energy-officials \n     group.\n\n\n                             Market Forces\n\n       This lack of interest emerged from cheap and apparently \n     plentiful power supplies available in the mid-1990s, and a \n     national movement toward energy deregulation. In the West, \n     for example, wholesale electricity prices in 1995 plunged \n     well below $20 per megawatt hour--compared with prices that \n     today sometimes exceed $300 per megawatt hour--and energy \n     efficiency didn't seem to pay.\n       Steve King, a spokesman for the Washington Utilities and \n     Transportation Commission, says regulators there allowed \n     utilities to dramatically reduce spending on energy \n     efficiency during this period because such policies couldn't \n     deliver power as cheaply as the market.\n       At the same time, political leaders across the nation were \n     embracing the central tenet of deregulation: that the market, \n     rather than centralized state energy policy, could determine \n     the right mix of power production and energy conservation to \n     ensure stable supplies and prices. Under pressure from \n     utilities, which, in preparation for competition wanted to \n     shed any costs that might contribute to higher rates, policy \n     makers allowed energy-efficient programs to be scaled back. \n     Under Massachusetts' 1997 deregulation law, for example, \n     utility-administered efficiency programs are scheduled to be \n     phased out by 2002. Lawmakers, however, now are expected to \n     extend the program and a utility-bill surcharge of about 0.3% \n     for at least another five years.\n       ``What everybody wants to avoid is being the next \n     California,'' John Shea, director of energy and environment \n     at the New England Governors' Conference, says of the \n     newfound interest in such policies.\n\n\n                          On Again, Off Again\n\n       To be sure, some argue that the market works, and the \n     recent resurgence in energy-efficiency spending is just a \n     natural part of that. In New York, state regulators and \n     government-owned utilities recently restored energy-\n     efficiency spending to near its 1993 levels after allowing it \n     to fall by some 60%. Paul DeCotis, director of energy \n     analysis at the New York State Energy and Research \n     Development Authority, says that maintaining big energy-\n     efficiency funds when prices are low doesn't make sense. \n     Unless utility bills are high enough to justify consumers' \n     making the investment, rebates alone are unlikely to get \n     people to buy energy-efficient products.\n       ``One could argue that the responsible public policy will \n     be to turn efficiency programs on and [then] off when they \n     can no longer be economically justified,'' says Mr. DeCotis.\n       Still, many observers believe now that states are \n     rediscovering energy efficiency, they will be sticking with \n     it for the long haul. The reason: California, of course. \n     ``The severity of this problem is going to be a vivid memory \n     for long years,'' says Ralph Cavanagh, energy-programs \n     director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a New \n     York-based environmental advocacy group, ``and the desire to \n     never see this happen again is not going to fade anytime \n     soon.''\n\n\n                              Powered Down\n\n       Most states allowed reduced spending on energy-efficiency \n     programs in recent years, when power was cheap. Here are the \n     10 states with the biggest declines:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      1993 SpendinPercent\n              State                       thousandSChangeg\n----------------------------------------------------(In-----\nWest Virginia....................       $1,157           $0         -100\nNevada...........................        5,515            4         -100\nVirginia.........................        9,477          192          -98\nGeorgia..........................       42,015        1,248          -97\nMichigan.........................       55,707        3,901          -93\nIndiana..........................       28,502        2,051          -93\nPennsylvania.....................       15,498        1,236          -92\nAlabama..........................        4,863          496          -90\nIdaho............................       20,819        2,393          -89\n\n[[Page S2772]]\n\n \nNebraska.........................          530           71          -87\nU.S..............................    1,651,032      912,525          -45\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy\n\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am generally pleased to be a cosponsor of \nthis Democratic energy package. It is made up of two pieces: one on \nenergy policy named the Comprehensive and Balanced Energy Policy Act of \n2001 and the other on energy tax incentives called the Energy Security \nTax and Policy Act of 2001.\n  Unlike the President's and the Republicans' energy package, these \nbills show that the Democrats are taking leadership in correcting \ncomplex short- and long-term deficiencies in our national energy \npolicy. We choose to emphasize energy efficiency, renewables, security \nand reliability, and we recognize that our energy policy must be \nenvironmentally responsible.\n  Not everything in these bills is perfect. In fact, I have serious \nsubstantive and jurisdictional objections to an extension of the Price-\nAnderson Act, which provides a huge, hidden subsidy to the nuclear \nindustry. And, I think we could do more to address climate change. But, \nthis is a good place to start a serious and swift debate.\n  My state of Nevada will benefit greatly from these bills. My bill, S. \n249, the Renewable Energy Development Incentives Act, has been largely \nincorporated in this package. It makes the wind, solar, geothermal and \nbiomass electricity production tax credit permanent. There are also \nother important provisions that will encourage the development of \ninfrastructure to meet the specific needs of renewable and distributed \nelectricity generation.\n  Nevada is rich in renewable resources. Currently, a major wind farm \nis being built at the Nevada Test Site that will deliver 260 MW to meet \nthe needs of 260,000 Nevadans. Nevada is sometimes known as the ``Saudi \nArabia of Geothermal,'' with a long-term potential of 2,500 to 3,700 \nMW, enough capacity to meet half the state's present energy needs. And, \nrough estimates suggest that the solar energy in a 100\\2\\ mile area in \nNevada could meet the annual electricity demand for the entire US.\n  The Democratic energy policy bill includes important provisions and \nincentives to improve reliability and the development of new \ntransmission access. Nevada is inextricably linked to the Western grid \nand the California market, so we are really feeling the shockwaves of \nthe crisis there. Nearly 50 percent of the power generated in Nevada is \nsent to California, leaving us in an unenviable importing situation. \nPlus, generation and transmission access in Nevada has not kept up with \nour phenomenal growth and could lead to supply shortfalls in the north \nthis year and in the south next year.\n  Our bills are focused on avoiding supply problems like California's. \nWe want to stimulate the development of cleaner energy sources that do \nnot foul our air, land or water and encourage sources that are \neconomically sustainable. We should and can avert the need to crack \ndown further on future energy-related pollution as Congress was forced \nto do in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 to protect the public's \nhealth and the environment.\n  That's why we are working in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee on a multi-pollutant bill to reduce electric utility \nemissions. Despite the President's flip-flop on a comprehensive bill \ncovering carbon dioxide, we hope to develop a bipartisan bill that \nsignificantly reduces anticipated power plant emissions of sulfur \ndioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury and carbon dioxide. We can do this in \na sensible way that will provide long term certainty to power producers \nif they invest in the right kinds of generation capacity now. Then, we \ncan all be assured of a stable electricity supply for the future and a \ncleaner environment.\n  We are taking a major step in addressing climate change in this \npolicy bill. Science continues to show us that manmade sources of \nairborne carbon are causing the global warming that becomes clearer \nevery day. Now, experts say that average temperatures could rise from \n3-10 degrees over the next 100 years, causing extreme storms and \ndroughts, ice cap melting, sea level rising, potentially dangerous \npublic health crises, and billions, if not, trillions of dollars in \neconomic damage.\n  The President needs to lead the nation and we need leadership today \nto address the challenge of climate change. We think he should \nestablish a commission to propose an integrated way to achieve at least \nthe reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that his father, President \nBush, approved and accepted and that the Senate ratified as part of the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The nation needs \na constructive proposal to meet that target as soon as possible, and \nthe President has the administrative and technical resources to do \nthis. Greenhouse gas concentrations are dangerously high and our \ninternational trading partners are wondering if the U.S. is going to \nabrogate its responsibility to be a good global citizen. The time for \ndelay is over.\n  We have taken some important steps in this legislation to start \naddressing climate change--encouraging renewables and this new \nPresidential commission. But, we also have included a requirement that \nthe efficiency of light-duty vehicles must increase significantly. The \ntransportation sector is responsible for more than a third of U.S. \ngreenhouse gas emissions. The national fleet has become increasingly \nless fuel efficient as manufacturers sell larger and larger sport \nutility vehicles that do not meet passenger car standards. As a result, \ncarbon dioxide emissions and air pollution problems are increasing and \nour energy security is badly threatened.\n  In the energy tax bill, we also are taking a new and extraordinary \nprecaution to ensure that the energy tax incentives that we provide \nwill protect the environment. Those incentives will only be available \nwhen energy producers or investors are in full compliance with state \nand federal pollution prevention, control and permit requirements. This \nis good precedent and good tax policy.\n  For the most part, these bills are charting a new, more holistic \ndirection. We have to consider all the facets of our energy decisions, \nespecially their impact on the global climate. That's why I'm \ndisappointed that this package includes a very short-sighted section \nextending the Price-Anderson Act, and thus continuing to limit the \nliability of the nuclear industry for catastrophic accidents. That \nsection provides an unfair advantage to an industry that has yet to \nresolve serious long term public health, safety and waste issues.\n  Under the Price-Anderson Act, the owners of commercial nuclear power \nreactors and Department of Energy contractors have their liability \ncapped far below the potential cost of a nuclear incident. This system \namounts to what one economic analysis determined was a $130 billion \nsubsidy for the nuclear power industry. This seems to be an unnecessary \nbenefit for an industry that claims to be a perfectly safe alternative \nto other energy sources. But, I'm glad to note that Senators Bingaman \nand Murkowski have agreed that the Environment Committee will be \nconsulted on and will have sequential referral of any bills at all that \naffect the Price-Anderson Act.\n  In one sense, the President was right last week when he said that, \n``. . ..the nation has got a real problem when it comes to energy.'' We \ndo have a nearly unquenchable thirst for cheap power which verges on an \nunhealthy addiction. This thirst has fueled our economic growth, but it \nhas also drastically affected our environmental quality and created a \ndependency that leaves us vulnerable to market manipulation, \ndisruptions and fluctuations. Our package is designed to avoid making \nstupid choices in the rush to satisfy that thirst in the short term. We \nwant and need a dependable and replenishable supply of energy that \ndoesn't leave us always gasping for more.\n  I hope the President and his energy task force will work with us to \nmove thoughtful legislation that provides a stable and environmentally \nsustainable energy policy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS (for himself, Mr. Gramm, and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 599. A bill to amend the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of \n1988 to establish permanent trade negotiating and trade agreement \nimplementing authority; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S2773]]\n\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nestablish permanent trade promotion authority, also known as Fast Track \nTrade Negotiating Authority. I am proud, to have Senators Gramm, and \nHagel on board in this effort to give the Executive and Legislative \nbranches the capacity to claim new markets for American products and \nservices.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs, as well as a member of the Finance Committee's \nsubcommittee on International Trade, Senator Gramm is a leading \nproponent of opening markets worldwide. I believe he was the first to \nintroduce fast track legislation in the 107th Congress and his January \n22nd bill, S. 136, is the basis for the bill I introduce today.\n  As the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on \nInternational Economic Policy, Export and Trade Promotion, Senator \nHagel is also a leader on trade issues and has consistently supported \nglobal economic engagement.\n  Our bill, the Permanent Trade Promotion Authority and Market Access \nAct of 2001, amends the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 \nto extend fast track trade negotiating authority indefinitely. As \ncolleagues recall, fast track includes both trade agreement negotiating \nauthority and congressional fast track procedures, specifically \nexpedited consideration of an agreement followed by the approval or \nrejection without amendments. Fast track trade negotiating authority \nwas last authorized by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of \n1988.\n  Since expiration of the 1988 bill in early 1994, the White House has \nnot had authority to negotiate trade agreements under fast track \nprocedures. The President has been effectively prohibited from \nexecuting an aggressive trade policy, negotiating agreements when and \nwhere opportunities arise.\n  In his `2001 Trade Policy Agenda', U.S. Trade Representative Robert \nB. Zoellick noted that ``in the absence of this authority, other \ncountries have been moving forward with trade agreements while America \nhas stalled.''\n\n  What does Ambassador Zoellick mean by `moving forward'? Let us review \nsome statistics, compiled by the Business Roundtable, concerning recent \ninternational negotiating activity. Of the estimated 130 free trade \nagreements, FTAs, in force around the world today only two include the \nUnited States; only 11 percent of world exports are covered by U.S. \nFTAs, compared with 33 percent for European Union FTAs and customs \nagreements; while Western European nations have negotiated 909 \nbilateral investment treaties, BITs, the United States is party to only \n43; 16 Western European countries have BITs with Brazil--the largest \ncountry in Latin America, 16 with China, the largest country in Asia, \n10 with India, population nearly 1 billion, and 13 with Indonesia--\npopulation more than 200 million. The United States has not signed a \nsingle BIT with any of these nations. In our own hemisphere, the news \nis not much better. Mexico has FTAs with at least 28 countries; 25 of \nthese agreements were concluded since 1994.\n  The statistics indicate that the U.S. is effectively choosing not to \nparticipate. While our competitors are carving out markets left and \nrights for their products and services, we seem satisfied to avoid the \nchallenge of passing fast track trade negotiating authority and giving \na President the capability to establish opportunities for American \nproducts.\n  Specifically, our farmers need fast track. The U.S. is the world's \nleading agricultural exporter. Exports represent about 25 percent of \ngross farm income and an estimated 30 percent of U.S. crop acreage is \nexported.\n  Considering fast track expired in 1994, it is not surprising annual \nU.S. agricultural exports are down from a record of $59.9 billion in \n1996. Exports were $49.2 billion in 1999 and $50.9 billion in 2000. $53 \nbillion in U.S. agricultural exports are predicted for 2001. Indeed, \nthe Asian financial crisis caused a sizable fall in overall U.S. \nexports to Asia. Nonetheless, with fast track we could have established \nenough of a presence for our commodities in alternative markets to \noffset the impact of the crisis.\n  The bottom line on our legislation is that it permanently establishes \nfast track trade negotiating authority for this President and his \nsuccessors. Roberts-Gramm-Hagel is indeed ambitious, but it is needed \nto prevent the U.S. from being left out of expanding world trade and \nall of the economic, political, and strategic opportunities therein.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 599\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Campaign Act of 1971 to enhance \ncriminal penaltie for election law violations, to clarify current \nprovisions of law regarding donations from foreign nationals, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today Senator Lieberman and I are \nintroducing a bill designed to clarify the existing criminal provisions \nof the Federal Election Campaign Act and strengthen their enforcement.\n  Sen. Lieberman, myself, and the members of the Government Affairs \nCommittee spent a year investigating some of the worst campaign finance \nabuses in our nation's history. Despite a number of obstacles, \nwitnesses fleeing the country, people pleading the fifth amendment, \nentities failing to comply with subpoenas, our Committee uncovered \nnumerous activities that were not only improper but illegal. But \nalthough we were able to demonstrate to the American people exactly \nwhat went on in the 1996 election, I was disappointed in the failure of \nthe Justice Department to use that information to aggressively \ninvestigate and prosecute those that violated the law. After four years \nof investigation the many, wide-ranging abuses, only one person \nconnected with the presidential election, Yogesh Gandhi, will spend any \ntime in jail. The question we have to ask ourselves is ``why?''\n  Unfortunately, the primary reason is that the Justice Department \nsimply did not do its job. Leads were not pursued, subpoenas were not \nsought, suspects were ignored, agents were instructed not to ask \nquestions about certain people, the law was misapplied, and no \nindependent counsel was ever appointed to ensure a credible \ninvestigation. A hearing we held at the Governmental Affairs Committee \nprovided just one example of how the Department ran its campaign \nfinance probe. So impatient was the FBI with the Department's \nresistance to investigating Presidential friend and DNC fundraiser \nCharlie Trie that the Bureau's senior agent in Little Rock wrote an \nangry\n\n[[Page S2774]]\n\nletter to FBI Director Freeh complaining about Department incompetence \nand stalling. The plea bargains that were entered into also raise \nconcern.\n  However, we have also learned that, the federal election law itself \nalso makes prosecution of violators more difficult than it should be. \nThe bill that we are introducing today would ensure in the future that \nconscientious prosecutors can more effectively pursue those who violate \nexisting law.\n  This bill accomplishes the following five goals: First, the bill \nmakes knowing and willful violations of the Federal Elections Campaign \nAct, FECA, involving at least $25,000 in a year a felony. Currently, no \nviolations of FECA are felonies. The law does not differentiate between \nthe donor that accidentally writes a check in excess of the $1,000 \nlimit and the fundraiser that launders $100,000 to a party or campaign. \nThis bill will provide a deterrent and appropriate punishment for those \nwho knowingly and willfully flaunt the campaign finance laws.\n\n  Second, the bill will extend the statute of limitations from three to \nfive years. Outside of the Internal Revenue Code, virtually every \nviolation of federal law has a statute of limitations of at least five \nyears. This provision brings FECA into conformity with the rest of the \nlaw.\n  Third, the bill would require the Sentencing Commission to promulgate \na guideline specifically for FECA violations. In addition, the bill \nprovides specific factors for enhancement of sentences. Currently, \nwithout a specific guideline, judges are forced to turn to other \nguidelines, typically those intended to govern or set sentences for \nfraud. Unfortunately, because the donor makes the contribution with \nfull knowledge of the scheme, the enhancement factors for fraud are \nbasically useless. By providing judges with a specific election law \nsentencing guideline, they can impose appropriate sentences.\n  Fourth, the bill prohibits foreign soft money contributions. Prior to \nthe 1996 campaign, I think we all thought foreign soft money \ncontributions were illegal. Thereafter, the Justice Department \ninterpreted ``contribution'' as used in FECA to have two different \nmeanings depending on how the contribution is used, raising the \npossibility that foreign soft money did not fall within the scope of \nFECA's prohibition on foreign ``contributions.'' Indeed, in two cases a \nFederal District Court Judge in D.C. ruled that foreign soft money was, \nin fact, legal. Subsequently, he was overruled by the Court of Appeals. \nHowever, in order to clarify the law, this bill was definitively \nprohibit foreign soft money contributions. Mr. President, last year the \nFEC wrote to Congress and asked for a clarification regarding the \nlegality of foreign soft money. I believe we should provide that \nguidance.\n  Finally, this bill would prohibit conduit soft money contributions. \nUnder current law, it is illegal to give $500 of hard money in the name \nof another, but it is perfectly legal to give $500,000 of soft money in \nanother person's name. This bill would close that loophole and provide \nwhat I think we all can support--more, full disclosure.\n  Mr. President, I personally believe that we need to reform our \ncampaign finance system. However, reform will mean nothing unless we do \na much better job enforcing the law when it is violated. I believe this \nbill in the hands of prosecutors who are interested in enforcing the \nlaw will help ensure that in the future violators of the campaign \nfinance laws will not walk away with a slap on the wrist.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 600\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague in \noffering this bill. Senator Thompson and I spent the better part of a \nyear working on the Governmental Affairs Committee's investigation into \nfundraising improprieties in the 1996 federal election campaigns. That \ninvestigation sparked a lot of discussion about whether many things \nthat happened in 1996 were illegal or just wrong--things like big soft \nmoney donations, attack ads run by tax-exempt organizations, \nfundraising in federal buildings and the like.\n  But one thing I never heard argument about is whether it was illegal \nto knowingly infuse foreign money into a political campaign or to use \nunwitting straw donors to hide the true source of money that was going \nto candidates or parties. I, for one, had no doubt that the people who \ndid those things in 1996 would be prosecuted and appropriately \npunished.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, many of them were prosecuted, but I \nhave grave doubts about whether they were appropriately punished. I \nknow that there are many who blame the Justice Department for this, but \nwhen I first looked into it a couple of years ago, I was frankly \nsurprised by what I learned--and that is that prosecutors just don't \nhave the tools they need to effectively investigate, prosecute and \npunish people who egregiously violate our campaign finance laws. I \nthink Charles LaBella, the former head of the Justice Department's \nCampaign Finance Task Force, put it best in a memo he wrote assessing \nthe Department's campaign finance investigation. According to press \nreports, LaBella wrote that ``The fact is that the so-called \nenforcement system is nothing more than a bad joke.'' Unfortunately, \nit's a bad joke that has real consequences for the integrity of our \ncampaigns and our democracy.\n  Let me give you one example. Many people are understandably upset \nthat Charlie Trie and John Huang didn't go to jail for what they did in \n'96. But the Federal Election Campaign Act, or FECA, doesn't authorize \nfelony prosecutions. No matter how egregiously someone violates FECA, \nall they can be charged with is a misdemeanor. And people rarely go to \njail for misdemeanors.\n  To get around FECA's limits, prosecutors often charge campaign \nfinance abusers with other federal crimes that are felonies, which is \nwhat they did with Trie and Huang. But that still often doesn't solve \nthe problem. That's because when it comes time for sentencing, judges \nhave to turn to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which still often \nbring light sentences because there is no guideline on campaign finance \nviolations.\n  The guidelines assign what's called a ``base offense level'' for each \ncrime, and then they give a number of factors that, if present, tell \nthe judge either to increase or decrease the offense level. The higher \nthe offense level, the higher the sentence.\n  Because the Guidelines don't have a provision on campaign finance \nviolations, judges have to look for the next closest offense, and they \noften end up using the fraud guideline. But that guideline doesn't take \ninto account the factors that make campaign finance violations so \nharmful, and the factors that are there often aren't particularly \nrelevant to campaign finance violations. For example, there is nothing \nin the guideline that makes judges distinguish between a campaign \nfinance violation involving $2,000 and one involving $2,000,000. So, \nwhen judges calculate the offense level of a defendant who funneled \nmillions of foreign dollars into a US campaign, they don't end up with \na high offense level, meaning that the defendant doesn't get a lengthy \nsentence. The prosecutors know this and the defendants know this, and \nthat must be one of the reasons why prosecutors accepted plea bargains \nfrom John Huang and Charlie Trie--because they knew they wouldn't do \nmuch better even if they won convictions at trial.\n\n  Our bill would solve these problems, by putting a felony provision \ninto FECA and by directing the Sentencing Commission to promulgate a \ncampaign finance guideline. If those two things happen, we will have \ngreater confidence that those who violate the law will be appropriately \npunished.\n  I understand that some who have looked at our bill worry that it \ncriminalizes participating in the political process. That is neither \nthe intent nor the effect of our bill. Our bill would allow felony \nprosecutions only if, first, the defendant knowingly and willfully \nviolated the law, and second, if the offense involved at least $25,000. \nSo, it would not punish the donor who inadvertently goes over his \ncontribution limits, nor would it go after the Party Committee clerk \nwho makes a recordkeeping mistake. Instead, our bill aims at the \nopportunistic hustlers who come up with broad conspiracies to violate \nthe election laws--usually for personal gain--by funneling foreign \nmoney into our campaigns or using large numbers of straw donors to hide \ntheir identity or make contributions they aren't allowed to make--the \npeople everyone says should be going to jail.\n  There are three other provisions in our bill. The first would extend \nFECA's statute of limitations from three to five years to make it the \nsame as virtually all other federal crimes. The second would make it \nclear that foreign soft money is as illegal as foreign hard money \ncontributions. The third would make it clear that straw donations of \nsoft money are as illegal as straw donations of hard money. All of them \nare important.\n  Mr. President, this bill is about something that we all should be \nable to agree upon, which is that actions that are already criminal and \nthat we all agree are wrong should be punished. None of our bill's \nprovisions should be controversial, and I hope that we can see them \nenacted into law, so that we can go into the next election cycle with \nconfidence that prosecutors have the tools necessary to deter and to \npunish those who would violate our election laws.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Thompson and \nLieberman in cosponsoring this legislation to improve the Federal \nElection Campaign Act, known as FECA. This legislation would increase \ncriminal penalties for knowing and willful campaign finance violations, \ndirect the Sentencing Commission to promulgate guidelines for \nviolations, and clarify parts of FECA. This legislation is important to \nensure that we have an enforcement structure that would deter knowing \nviolations of the laws now on the books.\n  Questions about the financing of the 1996 Federal elections have been \nthe subject of multiple, expensive, overlapping, and repeated \ncongressional hearings. In 1997, the Senate Committee on Governmental \nAffairs held 32 days of hearings, calling 70 witnesses, at a cost of \n$3.5 million to investigate campaign finance violations relating to the \n1996 Federal elections. The House Committee on Government Reform and \nOversight has been investigating campaign finance violations since June \n1997, including over 45 days of hearings. The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee held its own series of hearings in the 106th Congress on the \n1996 campaign finance investigations. Needless to say, all of these \ncommittees have spent countless hours investigating, collecting and \nreviewing documents, and holding hearings on alleged campaign finance \nabuses in the 1996 campaign. This legislation is one of the most \nconstructive products to come out of those investigations.\n  Indeed, in a report to then-Attorney General Reno, the former Chief \nof the Campaign Finance Task Force at the Department of Justice, \nCharles LaBella, recommended reforms in the campaign finance laws, \nincluding the increased penalties and clarifications\n\n[[Page S2776]]\n\nto certain parts of the FECA embodied in this legislation.\n  This bill would authorize felony prosecutions of knowing and willful \nFECA violations involving improper contributions aggregating $25,000 or \nmore during a calendar year. It would also increase the statute of \nlimitations to 5 years, which is the standard statute of limitation for \nFederal offenses. In addition, the bill would direct the Sentencing \nCommission to promulgate guidelines. Finally, the bill would clarify \nthat foreign nationals who are not permanent residents may not donate \nto a candidate or political party as well as make clear that the FECA's \nprohibition on conduit contributions applies to any type of donation.\n  I am glad to join in cosponsoring this legislation again, as I did in \nthe last Congress, and urge its prompt passage.\n  To the extent that we are frustrated by campaign finance abuses, I \nbelieve passage of this legislation is a better use of this body's time \nthan the open-ended fishing expedition into open and closed cases.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY:\n  S. 601.

A bill to reform Federal election law; to the \n     Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce my own version \nof campaign finance reform, the Common-Sense Federal Election Reform \nAct of 2001.\n  I am again introducing straightforward reform legislation to deal \nwith six principal areas: (1) the super-wealthy candidate; (2) party \nsoft money; (3) inadequate hard money limits; (4) increased disclosure \nfor certain communications; (5) paycheck protection; and (6) unlawful \nfundraising activities.\n  This bill addresses the issues that I have raised over and over again \non the floor of the Senate whenever we have debated campaign finance \nreform. As I've said before, the biggest problem with our elections is \nthat they no longer belong to the voters.\n  My bill makes six fundamental changes to existing campaign finance \nlaws. First, it helps solve the wealthy candidate problem. Over the \npast decade we have witnessed the growing tide of multi-millionaire \ncandidates financing their campaigns and effectively shutting out other \nqualified candidates through the sheer power of their own wealth. \nSomething must be done to stem this tide so that the electorate hears \nthe voices of all the candidates and not just those with extraordinary \npersonal wealth.\n  The teacher, police officer, military man or woman, and the like must \nhave an equal chance to participate as candidates in our dynamic \npolitical process. Perhaps more importantly, if the current system is \nallowed to stand, the public will hear only the views of the super-\nwealthy. Elections will become, even more than today, nothing more than \na choice between two Wall Street financiers or two corporate magnates. \nMy bill helps ensure that a candidate prevails on the strength of his \nideas not the size of his personal bank account.\n  The bill tackles the problem without offending the First Amendment. \nIndeed, there are no limits on the wealthy candidate's right to spend \nhis or her own money on his or her campaign. Rather, the bill simply \nlevels the playing field by increasing the outdated individual \ncontribution limits for the opponent of the self-financing candidate.\n  Let me explain in very general terms how it works. In New Mexico, if \nthe wealthy candidate spends personal funds on his or her campaign in \nexcess of approximately $400,000, the opponent could raise \ncontributions from individuals at three times the current limit or \n$3,000 per election. If the wealthy candidate exceeded $800,000 in \npersonal expenditures, the opponent could raise individual \ncontributions at six times the current limit or $6,000. Finally, where \nthe millionaire candidate spends in excess of $2,000,000 of personal \nfunds, the party coordinated expenditure limits are eliminated for the \nopponent candidate.\n  This does not violate a wealthy candidate's constitutional right to \nuse personal funds on his or her own campaign. It merely enables the \nnon-wealthy candidate to participate in the process so that the public \nhears the opinions of all the qualified candidates regardless of their \npersonal fortune.\n  Another important aspect of this provision states that a candidate \nwho incurs personal loans in connection with his or her campaign cannot \nrepay himself or herself in excess of $250,000 with contributions \nreceived after the election. It creates a perception of impropriety for \na candidate, who once elected, uses the prestige of office to raise \ncontributions to repay personal debt incurred during the campaign.\n  In addition to the wealthy candidate problem, the bill addresses the \nsoft money issue. It caps soft money contributions at $50,000 per \nindividual during each election cycle. I have long felt that Congress \nshould limit soft money to reduce the perception that extraordinary \nwealthy people can buy influence through substantial, unregulated \ncontributions to the political parties.\n  Third, my bill modestly increases the regulated or ``hard\" money \nindividual contribution limits that are now 25 years old. For example, \nunder this legislation, individuals can contribute\n\n[[Page S2777]]\n\n$5,000 to a candidate rather than the current $1,000 limit. These \nincreases are long overdue. Campaigns are very expensive and it takes \ntoo much of a candidate's time to raise the necessary money at the \noutdated $1,000 limits. This bill will permit candidates to spend more \ntime presenting their views to the public and less time attending fund \nraisers. Certainly, no one can argue that in today's world $5,000 is \nenough to buy influence.\n  Fourth, my bill increases disclosure requirements for certain \ncommunications. The legislation calls for the disclosure of certain \ninformation by anyone who spends more than $25,000 or more on radio or \ntelevision advertising that mentions a federal candidate by name or \nlikeness. I have long felt that disclosure is the best way to pursue \ncampaign finance reform. Disclosure is the best policy because it does \nnot infringe the constitutional rights of individuals and groups to \nengage in political speech.\n  Fifth, the bill deals with the use of union dues for political \nactivities. Mr. President, I can think of no other campaign activity \nthat is more un-American than the mandatory, compulsory taking of union \ndues for political purposes. The essence of democracy is that political \nspeech must be voluntary. For many union workers, that is not the case. \nIndeed, unions are made up of forty percent Republicans, and yet nearly \nall the union money that is spent on political activity goes to the \nDemocratic party. My bill requires the unions to get the prior, written \npermission of all members before using their dues for political \npurposes.\n  Finally, my bill addresses illegal fundraising activities. It \nclarifies that soft money is a ``contribution'' under federal election \nlaws. Thus, it makes absolutely clear that government officials cannot \nuse federal property to raise any campaign funds, including soft money. \nThe bill also provides increased criminal penalties for violations of \nthe foreign national provisions and for contributions made in the name \nof another.\n  My record is clear. Today, for at least the fourth time, I am \nintroducing a comprehensive campaign finance bill so that my \nconstituents in New Mexico know where I stand on campaign finance \nreform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. \n        Snowe, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Fiengold, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Biden, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Clinton, \n        Mr. Corzine, Mr. Dayton, Ms. Mikulski, and Mrs. Boxer):\n       S.J. Res. 10. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States relative to equal \n     rights for women and men; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, Senators Schumer, Sarbanes, Snowe, \nDodd, Kerry, Feingold, Lieberman, Biden, Cantwell, Murray, Feinstein, \nClinton, Corzine, Dayton, Mikulski, Boxer and I are reintroducing the \nEqual Rights Amendment to the Constitution. In doing so, we reaffirm \nour strong commitment to the ERA and full equality for women in our \nsociety.\n  Enactment and ratification of the ERA is essential to ensure that the \nlaw reflects our country's commitment to equality by guaranteeing equal \nrights for women. Existing statutory prohibitions against sex \ndiscrimination have failed to guarantee basic educational and \nemployment opportunities for women that are equal to those available to \nmen. The need for a constitutional guarantee of equal rights continues \nto be compelling.\n  In the absence of the ERA, too little progress has been made on \nwomen's rights, especially in the area of economic opportunity. An \nunconscionable gap between the earnings of men and women persists in \nthe workforce. Today, women continue to earn only 72 cents for each \ndollar earned by men. Taking home less than 3/4 of a pay-check for a \nfull days work is still a common experience for far too many women.\n  Sex discrimination continues to permeate many areas of the economy. \nWhile women with college degrees have made significant advances in many \nprofessional and managerial occupations in recent years, more than half \nof working women remain clustered in a narrow range of traditionally \nfemale, traditionally low-paying occupations. And female-headed \nhouseholds continue to dominate the bottom rungs of the economic \nladder. When a family with children is headed by a woman, the \nlikelihood is high that the family is living in poverty. In 1999, 41.9 \npercent of all families headed by single mothers lived below the \npoverty line.\n  Plainly, much remains to be done to secure equal opportunity for \nwomen. Enactment of the Equal Rights Amendment alone will not undo \ngenerations of economic injustice, but it will encourage women in all \nparts of the country in their efforts to obtain fairness under the \nnation's laws.\n  We know from the ratification experience of the 1970's and early \n1980's that the road to adoption of the ERA will not be easy.

Res. 62\n\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State and \n     international human rights organizations, the Cuban \n     government continues to commit widespread and well-documented \n     human rights violations against the Cuban people and to \n     detain hundreds more as political prisoners;\n       Whereas the Castro regime systematically violates all of \n     the fundamental civil and political rights of the Cuban \n     people, denying freedoms of speech, press, assembly, \n     movement, religion, and association, the right to change \n     their government, and the right to due process and fair \n     trials;\n       Whereas, in law and in practice, the Cuban government \n     restricts the freedom of religion of the Cuban people and \n     engages in efforts to control and monitor religious \n     institutions through surveillance, infiltration, evictions, \n     restrictions on access to computer and communication \n     equipment, and harassment of religious professionals and lay \n     persons;\n       Whereas the totalitarian regime of Fidel Castro actively \n     suppresses all peaceful opposition and dissent by the Cuban \n     people using undercover agents, informers, rapid response \n     brigades, Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, \n     surveillance, phone tapping, intimidation, defamation, \n     arbitrary detention, house arrest, arbitrary searches, \n     evictions, travel restrictions, politically motivated \n     dismissals from employment, and forced exile;\n       Whereas, workers' rights are effectively denied by a system \n     in which foreign investors are forced to contract labor from \n     the Cuban government and to pay the regime in hard currency \n     knowing that the regime will pay less than 5 percent of these \n     wages in local currency to the workers themselves;\n       Whereas these abuses by the Cuban government violate \n     internationally accepted norms of conduct;\n       Whereas the Senate is mindful of the admonishment of \n     President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico during the last Ibero-\n     American Summit in Havana, Cuba, that ``[t]here can be no \n     sovereign nations without free men and women. Men and women \n     who can freely exercise their essential freedoms: freedom of\n\n[[Page S2778]]\n\n     thought and opinion, freedom of participation, freedom of \n     dissent, freedom of decision.'';\n       Whereas President Vaclav Havel, an essential figure in the \n     Czech Republic's transition to democracy, has counseled that \n     ``[w]e thus know that by voicing open criticism of \n     undemocratic conditions in Cuba, we encourage all the brave \n     Cubans who endure persecution and years of prison for their \n     loyalty to the ideals of freedom and human dignity'';\n       Whereas former President Lech Walesa, leader of the Polish \n     solidarity movement, has urged the world to ``mobilize its \n     resources, just as was done in support of Polish Solidarnosc \n     and the Polish workers, to express their support for Cuban \n     workers and to monitor labor rights'' in Cuba;\n       Whereas efforts to document, expose, and address human \n     rights abuses in Cuba are complicated by the fact that the \n     Cuban government continues to deny international human rights \n     and humanitarian monitors access to the country;\n       Whereas Pax Christi further reports (September 2000) that \n     these efforts are complicated because ``a conspiracy of \n     silence has fallen over Cuba'' in which diplomats and \n     entrepreneurs refuse even to discuss labor rights and other \n     human rights issues in Cuba, some ``for fear of endangering \n     the relations with the Cuban government'', and businessmen \n     investing in Cuba ``openly declare that the theme of human \n     rights was not of their concern'';\n       Whereas the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission \n     on Human Rights in Geneva provides an excellent forum to \n     spotlight human rights and expressing international support \n     for improved human rights performance in Cuba and elsewhere;\n       Whereas the goal of United States policy in Cuba is to \n     promote a peaceful transition to democracy through an active \n     policy of assisting the peaceful forces of change on the \n     island;\n       Whereas the United States may provide assistance through \n     appropriate nongovernmental organizations to help individuals \n     and organizations to promote nonviolent democratic change and \n     promote respect for human rights in Cuba; and\n       Whereas the President is authorized to engage in democracy-\n     building efforts in Cuba, including the provision of (1) \n     publications and other informational materials on transitions \n     to democracy, human rights, and market economies to \n     independent groups in Cuba; (2) humanitarian assistance to \n     victims of political repression and their families; (3) \n     support for democratic and human rights groups in Cuba; and \n     (4) support for visits and permanent deployment of democratic \n     and international human rights monitors in Cuba: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That (a) the Senate condemns the repressive and \n     totalitarian actions of the Cuban government against the \n     Cuban people.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President should establish an action-oriented \n     policy of directly assisting the Cuban people and independent \n     organizations to strengthen the forces of change and to \n     improve human rights in Cuba;\n       (2) such policy should be modeled on the bipartisan United \n     States support for the Polish Solidarity (Solidarnosc) \n     movement under former President Ronald Reagan and involving \n     United States trade unions; and\n       (3) the President should make all efforts necessary at the \n     meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in \n     Geneva in 2001 to obtain the passage by the Commission of a \n     resolution condemning the Cuban government for its human \n     rights abuses, and to secure the appointment of a Special \n     Rapporteur for Cuba.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the President.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the resolution I am privileged to \nintroduce today condemns the human rights practices in Cuba, urges \nassistance to non-governmental organizations that are working to \nachieve greater freedom and respect for human rights in Cuba, and \nsupports a strong United Nations resolution against Cuba at the UN \nHuman Rights Commission session that begins this week in Geneva. The UN \nCommission's annual meeting is an ideal opportunity to focus the \nspotlight of world opinion on the appalling human rights conditions in \nCuba and to underscore our support for those who continue to champion \nthe cause of freedom for the Cuban people.\n  The repressive situation in Cuba is not new. Indeed, the United \nStates has been closely watching events in Cuba for more than 40 years \nand trying to find ways to foster democratic changes; changes that have \nsince swept through the rest of our hemisphere and around the world. My \ndistinguished colleagues in Congress and various administrations over \nthe years have not always agreed on how best to help the Cuban people \nachieve the fundamental rights we enjoy here in America. But we \noverwhelmingly agree on what is the root of the problem in Cuba: Fidel \nCastro.\n  As we well know, his totalitarian regime has systematically repressed \nthe fundamental rights of the Cuban people and denied them the most \nbasic of freedoms. This oppression has not eased with time but has in \nfact become worse, as is documented in disturbing detail in the State \nDepartment's recently issued Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \nfor 2000.\n  In early 1998, Pope John Paul II visited Cuba, a remarkable historic \nevent that raised a glimmer of hope that perhaps the Castro regime \nwould relax some of its repressive practices, particularly with regard \nto religious organizations of all types, including the Catholic Church \nto which great numbers of Cubans are faithful. In that same year, the \nUN Human Rights Commission did not renew the mandate of its Special \nRapporteur on Cuba, with the understanding that the Cuban government \nwould improve human rights practices if it were not under formal \nsanction by the United Nations.\n  But, I am sorry to say that, according to the State Department's \nreport, human rights practices in Cuba have actually become worse. \nDespite the Pope's visit, Castro's government continues to clamp down \non religious groups, requiring them to register, but then not \nregistering them, so that they must meet illegally. It refuses to issue \nrequired permits to religious groups to build places of worship, but \nharasses groups that resort to meeting in private homes. It limits \naccess by churches to the media and printing facilities. It withholds \nvisas to priests and nuns. It conducts surveillance, infiltration and \nharassment of religious professionals and lay persons. And when the UN \nHuman Rights Commission passed a new resolution expressing concern over \nthis situation in April 1999, the Cuban government responded by \norganizing a protest march of about 200,000 people in Havana. Such \nmarches are not voluntary; attendance of workers and school children is \ntaken and workers have been threatened with imprisonment for not \nshowing up.\n  As hard as it is to imagine, the Cuban government's repression of \nhuman rights activists is even more severe than that experienced by \nreligious groups. Not a single human rights organization is recognized \nby the government. Under Cuban law, any unauthorized assembly of more \nthan three persons can be punished by imprisonment and, predictably, no \npublic meeting has ever been approved for a human rights organization. \nHuman rights advocates and independent journalists are routinely \narrested, detained and subjected to interrogation, threats, degrading \ntreatment and unsanitary conditions. Even more disturbing is that the \nCuban Constitution, rather than being the foundation for the rule of \nlaw and freedoms, actually provides the justification for this \nrepression. It contains sweeping provisions that allow the denial of \nwhat few civil liberties even exist in Cuba for anyone who actively \n``opposes socialism'' or appears ``dangerous.'' As a result, the police \narrest people at will or subject them to therapy or re-education. The \nConstitution is simply a sham, a license to oppress.\n\n  The penalties for opposition to these intolerable conditions are \nsevere. Criticism is considered ``enemy propaganda'' and can result in \nup to 14 years imprisonment. According to the State Department report, \nthis ``enemy propaganda'' includes the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights, international reports on human rights violations, and foreign \nnewspapers and magazines. In late 1999, Amnesty International reported \nthat approximately 200 persons were arrested around the anniversary of \nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights to prevent them from \ncommemorating that event. Human rights activists described the \nescalation of arbitrary arrests and detention as the worst in a decade. \nThey estimate there are currently between 300 and 400 political \nprisoners in Cuba.\n  This massive oppression sounds archaic, a relic of another time, the \nstuff of a Cold War world that has been relegated to the history books. \nBut it is not history in Cuba. It is the harsh reality of everyday \nlife. Cuba remains a world of informers, block committees that report \non their neighbors and co-workers, infiltrators in groups that the \ngovernment thinks might be subversive. Cuba is a place where teachers \nwrite evaluations of their students' ``ideological character'' and that \nof their parents, evaluations that follow the children throughout their \nschooling and determine their future education and careers. Cuba is a \nnation\n\n[[Page S2779]]\n\nwhere the government monitors phone calls, controls and limits Internet \naccess, and restricts the ability to purchase fax machines and \nphotocopiers. Recently, two Czech citizens, one a member of Parliament \nand the other a student activist, were arrested in Cuba for the \n``crime'' of meeting with dissidents and bringing them pencils and a \ncomputer.\n  The resolution my colleagues and I are introducing today condemns \nthese repressive and indefensible policies of the Castro regime. It \ncalls for the United States to implement a policy supporting the non-\ngovernmental organizations in Cuba that are working toward a more open \nsociety, respect for human rights and greater political, economic and \nreligious freedom for the Cuban people. Our support should be modeled \non the assistance that we gave to the former Communist nations of \neastern Europe, such as Poland in the 1980's, where the U.S. funded \nnon-governmental institutions like the Solidarity trade union movement \nthat were working tirelessly for democracy and a free economy. This \nresolution also calls for active U.S. support for a strong United \nNations resolution on Cuba at the current session of the UN High \nCommission for Human Rights to demonstrate broad international \ncondemnation of Cuba's human rights record. America must stand as a \nlight on this bleak horizon. I urge my colleagues to lend their voices \nin support of this resolution and for the promotion of basic human \nrights and dignity for the Cuban people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Introduction to the State \nDepartment's report on human rights in Cuba to be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Cuba--Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2000\n\n  [Released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. \n                  Department of State, February 2001]\n\n       Cuba is a totalitarian state controlled by President Fidel \n     Castro, who is Chief of State, Head of Government, First \n     Secretary of the Communist Party, and commander-in-chief of \n     the armed forces. President Castro exercises control over all \n     aspects of life through the Communist Party and its \n     affiliated mass organizations, the government bureaucracy, \n     and the state security apparatus. The Communist Party is the \n     only legal political entity, and President Castro personally \n     chooses the membership of the Politburo, the select group \n     that heads the party. There are no contested elections for \n     the 601-member National Assembly of People's Power, ANPP, \n     which meets twice a year for a few days to rubber stamp \n     decisions and policies already decided by the Government. The \n     Party controls all government positions, including judicial \n     offices. The judiciary is completely subordinate to the \n     Government and to the Communist Party.\n       The Ministry of Interior is the principal organ of state \n     security and totalitarian control. Officers of the \n     Revolutionary Armed Forces, FAR, which are led by President \n     Castro's brother, Raul, have been assigned to the majority of \n     key positions in the Ministry of Interior in recent years. In \n     addition to the routine law enforcement functions of \n     regulating migration and controlling the Border Guard and the \n     regular police forces, the Interior Ministry's Department of \n     State Security investigates and actively suppresses \n     opposition and dissent. It maintains a pervasive system of \n     vigilance through undercover agents, informers, the rapid \n     response brigades, and the Committees for the Defense of the \n     Revolution, CDR's. The Government traditionally uses the \n     CDR's to mobilize citizens against dissenters, impose \n     ideological conformity, and root out ``counterrevolutionary'' \n     behavior. During the early 1990's, economic problems reduced \n     the Government's ability to reward participation in the CDR's \n     and hence the willingness of citizens to participate in them, \n     thereby lessening the CDR's effectiveness. Other mass \n     organizations also inject government and Communist Party \n     control into citizens' daily activities at home, work, and \n     school. Members of the security forces committed serious \n     human rights abuses.\n       The Government continued to control all significant means \n     of production and remained the predominant employer, despite \n     permitting some carefully controlled foreign investment in \n     joint ventures with it. Foreign companies are required to \n     contract workers only through Cuban state agencies, which \n     receive hard currency payments for the workers' labor but in \n     turn pay the workers a fraction of this, usually 5 percent in \n     local currency. In 1998 the Government retracted some of the \n     changes that had led to the rise of legal nongovernmental \n     business activity when it further tightened restrictions on \n     the self-employed sector by reducing the number of categories \n     allowed and by imposing relatively high taxes on self-\n     employed persons. In September the Minister of Labor and \n     Social Security publicly stated that more stringent laws \n     should be promulgated to govern self-employment. He suggested \n     that the Ministry of Interior, the National Tax Office, and \n     the Ministry of Finance act in a coordinated fashion in order \n     to reduce ``the illegal activities'' of the many self-\n     employed. According to government officials, the number of \n     self-employed persons as of September was 156,000, a decrease \n     from the 166,000 reported in 1999.\n       According to official figures, the economy grew 5.6 percent \n     during the year. Despite this, overall economic output \n     remains below the levels prior to the drop of at least 35 \n     percent in gross domestic product that occurred in the early \n     1990's due to the inefficiencies of the centrally controlled \n     economic system; the loss of billions of dollars of annual \n     Soviet bloc trade and Soviet subsidies; the ongoing \n     deterioration of plants, equipment, and the transportation \n     system; and the continued poor performance of the important \n     sugar sector. The 1999-2000 sugar harvest, just over 4 \n     million tons, was marginally better than the 1998-99 harvest. \n     The 1997-98 harvest was considered the worst in more than 50 \n     years. For the tenth straight year, the Government continued \n     its austerity measures known as the ``special period in \n     peacetime.'' Agricultural markets, legalized in 1994, provide \n     consumers wider access to meat and produce, although at \n     prices beyond the reach of most citizens living on peso-only \n     incomes or pensions. Given these conditions, the flow of \n     hundreds of millions of dollars in remittances from the exile \n     community significantly helps those who receive dollars to \n     survive. Tourism remained a key source of revenue for the \n     Government. The system of so-called tourist apartheid \n     continued, with foreign visitors who pay in hard currency \n     receiving preference over citizens for food, consumer \n     products, and medical services. Most citizens remain barred \n     from tourist hotels, beaches, and resorts.\n       The Government's human rights record remained poor. It \n     continued to violate systematically the fundamental civil and \n     political rights of its citizens. Citizens do not have the \n     right to change their government peacefully. There were \n     unconfirmed reports of extrajudicial killings by the police, \n     and reports that prisoners died in jail due to lack of \n     medical care. Members of the security forces and prison \n     officials continued to beat and otherwise abuse detainees and \n     prisoners. The Government failed to prosecute or sanction \n     adequately members of the security forces and prison guards \n     who committed abuses. Prison conditions remained harsh. The \n     authorities continued routinely to harass, threaten, \n     arbitrarily arrest, detain, imprison, and defame human rights \n     advocates and members of independent professional \n     associations, including journalists, economists, doctors, and \n     lawyers, often with the goal of coercing them into leaving \n     the country. The Government used internal and external exile \n     against such persons, and it offered political prisoners the \n     choice of exile or continued imprisonment. The Government \n     denied political dissidents and human rights advocates due \n     process and subjected them to unfair trials. The Government \n     infringed on citizens' privacy rights. The Government denied \n     citizens the freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and \n     association. It limited the distribution of foreign \n     publications and news, reserving them for selected party \n     faithful, and maintained strict censorship of news and \n     information to the public. The Government restricts some \n     religious activities but permits others. Before and after the \n     January 1998 visit of Pope John Paul II, the Government \n     permitted some public processions on feast days, and \n     reinstated Christmas as an official holiday; however, it has \n     not responded to the papal appeal that the Church be allowed \n     to play a greater role in society. During the year, the \n     Government allowed two new priests to enter the country, as \n     professors in a seminary, and another two to replace two \n     priests whose visas were not renewed. However, the \n     applications of many priests and religious workers remained \n     pending, and some visas were issued for periods of only 3 to \n     6 months. The Government kept tight restrictions on freedom \n     of movement, including foreign travel. The Government was \n     sharply and publicly antagonistic to all criticism of its \n     human rights practices and discouraged foreign contacts with \n     human rights activists. Violence against women, especially \n     domestic violence, and child prostitution are problems. \n     Racial discrimination occurs. The Government severely \n     restricted worker rights, including the right to form \n     independent unions. The Government prohibits forced and \n     bonded labor by children; however, it requires children to do \n     farm work without compensation during their summer vacation.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Leiberman and other \nMembers of the Senate as an original sponsor of a bipartisan resolution \ncritical of human rights practices in Cuba. The resolution we are \nintroducing today urges the President to develop initiatives to assist \nthe Cuban people and independent organizations in Cuba in their \nstruggle for change, human rights and democracy. Our resolution cites \nU.S. support for Solidarity in Poland in the 1980s as a model to \nemulate. The resolution also urges the United States to take an active \nrole in approving a resolution condemning Cuba at the United Nations \nHuman Rights Commission in Geneva that is underway as we speak.\n\n[[Page S2780]]\n\n  The recent arbitrary arrest of two Czech citizens, a legislator and a \nstudent, by Cuban authorities in Cuba reminds us of the extent to which \nthe government will go to squash expressions of freedom and opposition \nto the regime. The two Czech citizens understand the arbitrary nature \nof their arrest because they have been victims of suppression in their \nown personal struggle for freedom and democracy in their own country a \nfew years ago.\n  As Human Rights Watch noted, Cuba has ``a highly effective machinery \nof repression,'' Journalists, writers, intellectuals, and anyone else \nwho disagrees or dares to challenge the regime risk harassment, \nimprisonment or other harsh treatment. Human rights repression in Cuba \nis one of the most serious impediments to improved relations with the \nUnited States.\n  The goal of our resolution is to encourage a peaceful transition to \ndemocracy through transparent initiatives that will support human \nrights groups in Cuba, make available materials and relevant literature \non human rights, and provide humanitarian assistance to nongovernmental \norganizations on the island.\n  My criticism of human rights practices in Cuba is consistent with my \ncriticism of our unilateral economic sanctions against Cuba. There is \nno inherent incompatibility between these two critiques. A pro-\nengagement policy can be a pro-human rights policy in much the same way \nit was in our policy towards central and eastern European countries \nduring the cold war.\n  I believe that programs, such as those of the National Endowment for \nDemocracy and its core institutes, can help promote democracy and \npolitical freedoms in Cuba and are likely to be more successful in \npromoting change than economic coercion. Contacts and interactions \nthrough trade, travel, tourism, student exchanges, and other forms of \nengagement will, in my view, yield more positive results in changing \nCuba and improving Cuban human rights practices than isolation and \npunitive sanctions. This may not be true in all cases where we have \ndifferences with other countries, but I believe it has merit with \nrespect to Cuba.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join Senator Lieberman and \nthe other sponsors in supporting this resolution and that some day Cuba \nwill join Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and other states around \nthe world in making the transformation from tyranny to freedom and \ndemocracy.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as Americans, we sometimes take for granted \nthe fundamental rights for which our forefathers fought and on which \nthis great nation was founded. We must not forget, however, that there \nare places in the world where people are denied these basic freedoms. \nSadly, even with the collapse of the Soviet Empire and the spread of \nfreedom and democracy in Eastern Europe and the Baltics, there are \ncountries that still do not have freedom of press, assembly, movement, \nreligion or association; where people do not have the right to \npeacefully change their government; and where individuals do not have \nthe right to due process.\n  Cuba is one such country, a nation that, despite our efforts over the \npast 40 years, remains subject to the dictatorial rule of Fidel Castro. \nCastro retains power over the Cuban people through force, fear, and \ndeprivation. A 1999 Human Rights Watch Report, Cuba's Repressive \nMachinery: Human Rights Forty Years After the Revolution, summarized \nthe deplorable situation in that country, stating,\n\n       Over the past forty years, Cuba has developed a highly \n     effective machinery of repression. The denial of basic civil \n     and political rights is written into Cuban law. In the name \n     of legality, armed security forces, aided by state-controlled \n     mass organizations, silence dissent with heavy prison terms, \n     threats of prosecution, harassment, or exile. Cuba uses these \n     tools to restrict severely the exercise of fundamental human \n     rights of expression, association, and assembly. The \n     conditions in Cuba's prisons are inhuman, and political \n     prisoners suffer additional degrading treatment and torture. \n     In recent years, Cuba has added new repressive laws and \n     continued prosecuting nonviolent dissidents while shrugging \n     off international appeals for reform and placating visiting \n     dignitaries with occasional releases of political prisoners.\n\n  Clearly, it is time to explore a different approach to dealing with \nCuba. It is important that, as the era of Fidel Castro's rule comes to \na close, we work to establish a long-term relationship with the Cuban \npeople.\n  During the 1980's President Reagan was a champion for human rights in \nthe Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, standing up for freedom, \ndemocracy, and civil society. He passionately spoke of American values \nand God-given rights, and more importantly, backed his words with \naction. In his 1982 ``Evil Empire'' speech before the British House of \nCommons, President Reagan stated:\n\n       While we must be cautious about forcing the pace of change, \n     we must not hesitate to declare our ultimate objectives and \n     to take concrete actions to move toward them. We must be \n     staunch in our conviction that freedom is not the sole \n     prerogative of a lucky few but the inalienable and universal \n     right of all human beings.\n\n  Poland is but one example of the success of this firm stance. Pope \nJohn Paul II, after he visited Cuba in 1998, said, ``I wish for our \nbrothers and sisters on that beautiful island that the fruits of this \npilgrimage will be similar to the fruits of that pilgrimage in \nPoland.''\n  Senator Lieberman has introduced a resolution calling upon the United \nStates to offer assistance to Cuban people and independent \norganizations, modeled after President Reagan's support for the Polish \nSolidarity Movement. Though our debate on the embargo is sure to \ncontinue during this Congress, Senator Lieberman's resolution outlines \nthe basic problem on which we can all agree. Fidel Castro's human \nrights record is deplorable, and the situation continues to \ndeteriorate. Furthermore, this resolution proposes a solution that \nsupports the strengthening of civil society in Cuba, offering hope to \nthe people there who are struggling to emerge from beneath the shell of \ncommunism. It also calls upon the U.S. delegation to this year's \nmeeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission to actively support the \npassage of a resolution condemning Cuba for its human rights \nviolations.\n  As we continue to enjoy the fruits of liberty, we have an obligation, \nas Americans, to take a stand against Castro's regime and assist the \nCuban people in a peaceful transition to democracy. We have an \nopportunity, beginning with the passage of this resolution, to reach \nout to the Cuban people through the wall of repression that Castro has \nbuilt around his small island, so that they may some day taste the \nfreedom and justice that we have been afforded not by chance, but by \nthe hard work and perseverence of those who believed that life should \nnot be any other way. With our help, the Cuban people can further their \nprogress down the road to democracy.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, democracy and the rule of law are the norm \nin the Western Hemisphere, but the Cuban people remain denied the \nblessings of freedom. And the violations of their rights by Fidel \nCastro's regime are widespread, well-documented, and impact upon every \naspect of their lives.\n  Policymakers in Washington may wrangle over the details of how United \nStates policy in Cuba should be implemented, but we can all agree that \nthe Cuban people need and deserve our support to bring about change in \ntheir country.\n  It is important to underscore that the Cuban people aren't passively \nwaiting for change. They are taking peaceful action every day trying to \nadvance the cause of freedom and democracy. This often costs them their \nphysical freedom, their jobs, their families--even their homeland.\n  Despite these endeavors, Castro remains as intransigent and \nrepressive as ever. Since January, he has stepped up efforts to beat \ndown Cubans who dare to hope for liberation by jailing and harassing \nthose who speak out.\n  Not content to simply control the Cuban people, Castro has also \nintensified his harassment of foreigners who provide moral or material \nsupport to pro-democracy dissidents.\n  Swedes, Czechs, Lithuanians, Mexicans, and Americans have been \ndetained by Castro's police in recent months for meeting with or giving \nmoney, printed material, and other help to Cuban dissidents.\n  Mr. President, foreign governments have been maligned for ``licking \nthe Yankee boot'' because they support passage of a U.N. Commission on \nHuman Rights resolution condemning the human rights record in Castro's \nCuba.\n\n[[Page S2781]]\n\n  Foreign officials have been not-so-cordially invited to cancel visits \nto Cuba because they had dared to suggest that there is room for \nimprovement in Cuba's human rights record.\n  Therefore, Castro is essentially criminalizing contact with the Cuban \npeople and trying bully democratic countries into abandoning their \nprinciples--and thereby abandoning the Cuban people.\n  We won't be bullied--and our allies in Europe and Latin America must \nnot let themselves be bullied either.\n  It is against this back-drop that I am joining Senator Lieberman and \na distinguished, bipartisan group of my colleagues today in introducing \na resolution regarding the human rights situation in Cuba, a resolution \nthat is designed to give momentum to efforts to pass a U.N. Human \nRights Commission resolution on Cuba when it convenes in Geneva this \nmonth.\n  It is also designed to give momentum to a more pro-active and \ncreative U.S. policy of working with the Cuban dissident community \nmodeled on President Reagan's successful efforts to help Poland's \nSolidarity Movement work for change during the cold war.\n  Most importantly, it is a message to remind the Cuban people that the \nUnited States stands solidly with them in their peaceful struggle for \nfreedom. I am confident that other Senators will want to join Senator \nLieberman in supporting this important resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/22/senate-section/article/S2781-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 63--COMMEMORATING AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE DEDICATION \nAND SACRIFICE MADE BY THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES WHILE \n                  SERVING AS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. \nNickles, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Miller, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \nBiden, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Helms, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Bingaman, \nMr. Bond, Mr. Frist, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Allard, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Edwards, \nMr. Byrd, Mr. Reid, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Durbin, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \nThomas, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Boxer, \nMr. Levin, and Mr. Voinovich) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 63\n\n       Whereas the well-being of all citizens of the United States \n     is preserved and enhanced as a direct result of the vigilance \n     and dedication of law enforcement personnel;\n       Whereas more than 700,000 men and women, at great risk to \n     their personal safety, presently serve their fellow citizens \n     as guardians of peace;\n       Whereas peace officers are on the front line in preserving \n     the right of the children of the United States to receive an \n     education in a crime-free environment, a right that is all \n     too often threatened by the insidious fear caused by violence \n     in schools;\n       Whereas 150 peace officers lost their lives in the line of \n     duty in 2000, and a total of nearly 15,000 men and women \n     serving as peace officers have now made that supreme \n     sacrifice;\n       Whereas every year, 1 in 9 peace officers is assaulted, 1 \n     in 25 peace officers is injured, and 1 in 4,400 peace \n     officers is killed in the line of duty; and\n       Whereas, on May 15, 2001, more than 15,000 peace officers \n     are expected to gather in the Nation's Capital to join with \n     the families of their recently fallen comrades to honor those \n     comrades and all others who went before them: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes May 15, 2001, as Peace Officers Memorial \n     Day, in honor of Federal, State, and local officers killed or \n     disabled in the line of duty; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     this day with appropriate ceremonies and respect.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am joined by the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senators Hatch and \nLeahy, along with 34 other Senators in introducing this resolution to \nkeep alive in the memory of all Americans the sacrifice and commitment \nof those law enforcement officers who lost their lives serving their \ncommunities. Specifically, this resolution would designate May 15, \n2001, as National Peace Officers Memorial Day.\n  As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the risks which law \nenforcement officers face everyday on the front lines protecting our \ncommunities. Currently, more than 700,000 men and women who serve this \nnation as our guardians of law and order do so at a great risk. Every \nyear, about 1 in 9 officers is assaulted, 1 in 25 officers is injured, \nand 1 in 4,400 officers is killed in the line of duty. There are few \ncommunities in this country that have not been impacted by the words: \n``officer down.''\n  In 2000, approximately 150 federal, state and local law enforcement \nofficers have given their lives in the line of duty. This represents \nmore than a 10 percent rise in police fatalities over the previous \nyear. And, nearly 15,000 men and women have made the supreme sacrifice.\n  The Chairman of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, \nCraig W. Floyd, reminds us, ``Despite improved equipment and better \ntraining, law enforcement remains the deadliest profession in America. \nOn average, one officer is killed somewhere in America every 57 hours. \nAt the very least, we must ensure that those officers, and their \nfamilies, are never forgotten.''\n  On May 15, 2001, more than 15,000 peace officers are expected to \ngather in our Nation's Capital to join with the families of their \nfallen comrades who by their faithful and loyal devotion to their \nresponsibilities have rendered a dedicated service to their \ncommunities. In doing so, these heroes have established for themselves \nan enviable and enduring reputation for preserving the rights and \nsecurity of all citizens. This resolution is a fitting tribute for this \nspecial and solemn occasion.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting passage of this \nimportant resolution.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am proud to rise today as an \noriginal cosponsor of Senator Campbell's resolution designating May 15, \n2001, as Peace Officers Memorial Day. I commend Senator Campbell for \nhis efforts to honor these brave men and women, and thank all of our \nNation's law enforcement officials and their families for the daily \nsacrifices they make as they work to enforce our Nation's laws and \nensure the safety of all American citizens.\n  According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 107 law enforcement \nofficers lost their lives in the line of duty in 1999. Forty-two of \nthese officers were killed feloniously and 65 died accidentally. An \nadditional 55,026 officers were assaulted in the line of duty.\n  From 1990 to 1999, 28 Arkansas law enforcement officers lost their \nlives in the line of duty. Eleven of these officers were feloniously \nkilled and 16 died accidentally. During the year 2000, Patrol Officer \nLewis D. Jones, Jr. of the Forrest City Police Department and Captain \nThomas Allen Craig of the Arkansas State Police lost their lives, and \nin the current year, Trooper Herbert J. Smith of the Arkansas State \nPolice was killed in a car accident while rushing to assist a sick \nchild.\n  Accordingly, I offer my condolences to the families and friends of \nPatrol Officer Jones, Captain Craig, Trooper Smith, and all of the \nother law enforcement officials who have died in the line of duty. I am \ndeeply appreciative of their sacrifices and am sorry for their loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/22/senate-section/article/S2781-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 137.

Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Nickles (for himself and Mr. Gregg)) \nproposed an amendment to the bill S. 27, to amend the Federal Election \nCampaign Act of 1971 to provide bipartisan campaign reform; as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 35, strike line 8 and all that follows \n     through page 37, line 14.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I do not oppose this amendment, but, as \nseveral of my colleagues have noted, it is for reasons far different \nthan the sponsors of this amendment have put forward.\n  This amendment deletes Section 304 of the campaign finance reform \nbill. That section does two things. First, it affirms the obligation \nthat Beck places on unions to afford non-members who pay fees under a \nunion security clause the opportunity to object to paying for \nactivities unrelated to collective bargaining, contract administration, \nor grievance adjustment. Second it clarifies the so-called ``objection \nprocedures'' required. These are obligations placed on unions under \ncurrent law. Keeping the provisions in the bill or taking them out will \nnot change unions' lawful obligations to non-members.\n  Indeed, my understanding is that provisions such as Section 304 have \nbeen inserted in campaign finance reform measures for quite some time \nlargely because some of my colleagues wanted assurance that unions \nwould obey the law. The fact is that Beck has been the law for almost \n13 years. Since Beck became law every union has created procedures to \nensure the necessary opt-out procedures. This demonstrates to me that \nthe provision is unnecessary--and has been for some time.\n  I do, however, want to take issue with the Senator from Kentucky's \nstatement to the effect that Section 304 as currently drafted \n``eviscerates'' Beck. The Beck Court did not reach the conclusions my \ncolleague suggests. What the Court concluded was that unions were not \npermitted ``over the objections of dues-paying nonmember employees, to \nexpend funds so collected on activities unrelated to collective \nbargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment . . .'' \nHence it created the obligation on the part of the unions to offer \nopportunities to object and objection procedures that, as noted, are \nthe subject of Section 304.\n  In sum, since Beck is the current law, and Section 304 does not \nchange that fact, I have no objections to removing it from the bill.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 140. Mr. SPECTER proposed an amendment to the bill S. 27, to amend \nthe Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to provide bipartisan \ncampaign reform; as follows:\n\n       On page 7, line 24, after ``and'', insert the following: \n     ``which, when read as a whole, in the context of external \n     events, is unmistakable, unambiguous and suggestive of no \n     plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or \n     against a specific candidate.''\n       On page 15, line 20, insert the following:\n       ``(iv) promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or \n     attacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of \n     whether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or \n     against a candidate) and which, when read as a whole, and in \n     the context of external events, is unmistakable, unambiguous \n     and suggestive of no plausible meaning other than an \n     exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.''\n       On page 2, after the matter preceding line 1, insert:\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the twenty-five years since the 1976 Supreme Court \n     decision in Buckley v. Valeo, the number and frequency of \n     advertisements increased dramatically which clearly advocate \n     for or against a specific candidate for Federal office \n     without magic words such as ``vote for'' or ``vote against'' \n     as prescribed in the Buckley decision.\n       (2) The absence of the magic words from the Buckley \n     decision has allowed these advertisements to be viewed as \n     issue advertisements, despite their clear advocacy for or \n     against the election of a specific candidate for Federal \n     office.\n       (3) By avoiding the use of such terms as ``vote for'' and \n     ``vote against,'' special interest groups promote their views \n     and issue positions in reference to particular elected \n     officials without triggering the disclosure and source \n     restrictions of the Federal Election Campaign Act.\n       (4) In 1996, an estimated $135 million was spent on such \n     issue advertisements; the estimate for 1998 ranged from $275-\n     $340 million; and, for the 2000 election the estimate for \n     spending on such advertisements exceeded $340 million.\n       (5) If left unchecked, the explosive growth in the number \n     and frequency of advertisements that are clearly intended to \n     influence the outcome of Federal elections yet are \n     masquerading as issue advocacy has the potential to undermine \n     the integrity of the electoral process.\n       (6) The Supreme Court in Buckley reviewed the legislative \n     history and purpose of the\n\n[[Page S2783]]\n\n     Federal Election Campaign Act and found that the authorized \n     or requested standard of the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     operated to treat all expenditures placed in cooperation with \n     or with the consent of a candidate, an agent of the \n     candidate, or an authorized committee of the candidate as \n     contributions subject to the limitations set forth in the \n     Act.\n       (7) During the 1996 Presidential primary campaign the \n     Clinton Committee and the Dole Committee both spent millions \n     of dollars in excess of the overall Presidential primary \n     spending limit that applied to each of their campaigns, and \n     in doing so, used millions of dollars in soft money \n     contributions that could not legally be used directly to \n     support a Presidential campaign.\n       (8) The Clinton and Dole Committees made these campaign \n     expenditures through their respective national political \n     party committees, using these party committees as conduits to \n     run multi-million dollar television ad campaigns to support \n     their candidacies.\n       (9) These television ad campaigns were in each case \n     prepared, directed, and controlled by the Clinton and Dole \n     campaigns.\n       (10) Former Clinton adviser Dick Morris said in his book \n     about the 1996 elections that president Clinton worked over \n     every script, watched each advertisement, and decided which \n     advertisements would run where and when.\n       (11) Then-President Clinton told supporters at a Democratic \n     National Committee luncheon on December 7, 1995, that, ``We \n     realized that we could run these ads through the Democratic \n     Party, which meant that we could raise money in $20,000 and \n     $50,000 blocks. So we didn't have to do it all in $1,000 and \n     run down what I can spend, which is limited by law so that is \n     what we've done.''\n       (12) Among the advertisements coordinated between the \n     Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, yet \n     paid for by the DNC as an issue ad, was one which contained \n     the following: [Announcer] ``60,000 felons and fugitives \n     tried to buy handguns that couldn't because President Clinton \n     passed the Brady bill--five day waits, background checks. But \n     Dole and Gingrich voted no. 100,000 new police--because \n     President Clinton delivered. Dole and Gingrich? Vote no, want \n     to repeal 'em. Strengthen school anti-drug programs. \n     President Clinton did it. Dole and Gingrich? No again. Their \n     old ways don't work. President Clinton's plan. The new way. \n     Meeting our challenges, protecting our values.''\n       (13) Another advertisement coordinated between the Clinton \n     campaign and the DNC contained the following: [Announcer] \n     ``America's values. Head start. Student loans. Toxic cleanup. \n     Extra police. Protected in the budget agreement; the \n     President stood firm. Dole, Gringrich's latest plan includes \n     tax hikes on working families. Up to 18 million children face \n     health care cuts. Medicare slashed $167 billion. Then Dole \n     resigns, leaving behind gridlock he and Gringrich created. \n     The President's plan: Politics must wait. Balance the budget, \n     reform welfare, protect our values.''\n       (14) Among the advertisements coordinated between the Dole \n     campaign and the Republican National Committee, yet paid for \n     by the RNC as an issue ad, was one which contained the \n     following:\n       [Announcer] ``Bill Clinton, he's really something. He's now \n     trying to avoid a sexual harassment lawsuit claiming he is on \n     active military duty. Active duty? Newspapers report that Mr. \n     Clinton claims as commander-in-chief he is covered under the \n     Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act of 1940, which grants \n     automatic delays in lawsuits against military personnel until \n     their active duty is over. Active duty? Bill Clinton, he's \n     really something.''\n       (15) Another advertisement coordinated between the Dole \n     campaign and the RNC contained the following:\n       [Announcer] ``Three years ago, Bill Clinton gave us the \n     largest tax increase in history, including a 4 cent a gallon \n     increase on gasoline. Bill Clinton said he felt bad about \n     it.''\n       [Clinton] ``People in this room still get mad at me over \n     the budget process because you think I raised your taxes too \n     much. It might surprise you to know I think I raised them too \n     much, too.''\n       [Announcer] ``OK, Mr. President, we are surprised. So now, \n     surprise us again. Support Senator Dole's plan to repeal your \n     gas tax. And learn that actions do speak louder than words.''\n       (16) Clinton and Dole Committee agents raised the money \n     used to pay for these so-called issue ads supporting their \n     respective candidacies.\n       (17) These television advertising campaigns, run in the \n     guise of being DNC and RNC issue ad campaigns, were in fact \n     Clinton and Dole ad campaigns, and accordingly should have \n     been subject to the contribution and spending limits that \n     apply to Presidential campaigns.\n       (18) After reviewing spending in the 1996 Presidential \n     election campaign, auditors for the Federal Election \n     Commission recommended that the 1996 Clinton and Dole \n     campaigns repay $7 million and $17.7 million, respectively, \n     because the national political parties had closely \n     coordinated their soft money issue ads with the respective \n     presidential candidates and accordingly, the expenditures \n     would be counted against the candidates' spending limits. The \n     repayment recommendation for the Dole campaign was \n     subsequently reduced to $6.1 million.\n       (19) On December 10, 1998, in a 6-0 vote, the Federal \n     Election Commission rejected its auditors' recommendation \n     that the Clinton and Dole campaigns repay the money.\n       (20) The pattern of close coordination between candidates' \n     campaign committees and national party committees continued \n     in the 2000 Presidential election.\n       (21) An advertisement financed by the RNC contained the \n     following:\n       [Announcer] ``Whose economic plan is best for you? Under \n     George Bush's plan, a family earnings under $35,000 a year \n     pays no Federal income taxes--a 100 percent tax cut. Earn \n     $35,000 to $50,000? A 55 percent ax cut. Tax relief for \n     everyone. And Al Gore's plan: three times the new spending \n     President Clinton proposed, so much it wipes out the entire \n     surplus and creates a deficit again. Al Gore's deficit \n     spending plan threatens America's prosperity.''\n       (22) Another advertisement financed by the NRC contained \n     the following:\n       [Announcer] ``Under Clinton-Gore, prescription drug prices \n     have skyrocketed, and nothing's been done. George Bush has a \n     plan: add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare.''\n       [George Bush] ``Every senior will have access to \n     prescription drug benefits.''\n       [Announcer] ``And Al Gore? Gore opposed bipartisan reform. \n     He's pushing a big government plan that lets Washington \n     bureaucrats interfere with what your doctors prescribe. The \n     Gore prescription plan: bureaucrats decide. Bush prescription \n     plan: seniors choose.''\n       (23) An advertisement paid for by the DNC contained the \n     following:\n       [Announcer] ``When the national minimum wage was raised to \n     $5.15 an hour, Bush did nothing and kept the Texas minimum \n     wage at $3.35. Six times the legislature tried to raise the \n     minimum wage and Bush's inaction helped kill it. Now Bush \n     says he'd allow states to set a minimum wage lower than the \n     Federal standard. Al Gore's plan: Make sure our current \n     prosperity enriches not just a few, but all families. \n     Increase the minimum wage, invest in education, middle-class \n     tax cuts and a secure retirement.''\n       (24) Another advertisement paid for by the DNC contained \n     the following:\n       [Announcer] ``George W. Bush chose Dick Cheney to help lead \n     the Republican party. What does Cheney's record say about \n     their plans? Cheney was one of only eight members of Congress \n     to oppose the Clean Water Act . . . one of the few to vote \n     against Head Start.\n       He even voted against the School Lunch Program . . . \n     against health insurance for people who lost their jobs. \n     Cheney, an oil company CEO, said it was good for OPEC to cut \n     production so oil and gasoline prices could rise. What are \n     their plans for working families?''\n       (25) On January 21, 2000, the Supreme Court in Nixon v. \n     Shrink Missouri Government PAC noted, ``In speaking of \n     `improper influence' and `opportunities for abuse' in \n     addition to `quid pro quo arrangements,' we recognized a \n     concern to the broader threat from politicians too compliant \n     with the wishes of large contributors.''\n       (26) The details of corruption and the public perception of \n     the appearance of corruption have been documented in a flood \n     of books, including:\n       (A) Backroom Politics: How Your Local Politicians Work, Why \n     Your Government Doesn't, and What You Can Do About It, by \n     Bill and Nancy Boyarsky (1974);\n       (B) The Pressure Boys: The Inside Story of Lobbying in \n     America, by Kenneth Crawford (1974);\n       (C) The American Way of Graft: A Study of Corruption in \n     State and Local Government, How it Happens and What Can Be \n     Done About it, by George Amick (1976);\n       (D) Politics and Money: The New road to Corruption, by \n     Elizabeth Drew (1983);\n       (E) The Threat From Within: Unethical Politics and \n     Politicians, by Michael Kroenwetter (1986);\n       (F) The Best Congress Money Can Buy, by Philip M.

President Bush and Republican Congressional leaders \n     have moved to rescind new Labor Department ergonomics rules \n     aimed at fostering a safer workplace, largely because \n     business considered them too costly. Congress is also \n     revising bankruptcy law in a way long sought by major \n     financial institutions that gave Republicans $26 million in \n     the last election cycle.''\n       (30) A New York Times article, from March 13, 2001, noted \n     that ``A lobbying campaign led by credit card companies and \n     banks that gave millions of dollars in political donations to \n     members of Congress and contributed generously to President \n     Bush's 2000 campaign is close to its long-sought goal of \n     overhauling the nation's bankruptcy system.''\n       (31) According to a Washington Post article from March 11, \n     2001, when congressional GOP leaders took control of the \n     final writing of the bankruptcy bill, they consulted closely \n     with representatives of the American Financial Services \n     Association and the Coalition for Responsible Bankruptcy, \n     which represented dozens of corporations and trade groups. \n     The 442-page bill contained hundreds of provisions written or \n     backed by lobbyists for financial industry giants.\n       (32) It has become common practice to reward big campaign \n     donors with ambassadorships, with an informal policy dating \n     back to the 1960s allocating about 30 percent of the nation's \n     ambassadorships to non-career appointees. According to a \n     Knight Rider article from November 13, 1997, former President \n     Nixon once told his White House Chief of Staff that ``Anybody \n     who wants to be an ambassador must at leave give $250,000.''\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 141.

I ask unanimous consent that the amendments, en bloc, be \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 142 and 143) were agreed to.\n\n\n                         Conventional User Fees\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I engage in a colloquy with the distinguished chairman \nof the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Senator Gramm.\n  Tonight, the Senate will pass S. 143, the Competitive Market \nSupervision Act of 2001. This bill, which has been approved by the \nBanking Committee, reduces the schedule of Securities and Exchange \nCommission fees in a manner that properly conforms the structure of \nthese fees to conventional user fees. If enacted, this bill ensures \nthat these fees will be conventional user fees, not taxes, not generate \ngeneral revenue, and therefore matters within the jurisdiction of the \nBanking Committee.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The distinguished Chairman of the Committee on finance is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I too wish to express my appreciation to \nSenator Gramm and Senator Sarbanes for their willingness to work with \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs to provide a new compensation \nsystem for employees at the Securities and Exchange Commission. I also \nwish to thank Senator Thompson, the chairman of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee for his interest in this matter.\n  The Federal Government has a serious problem in attracting, \nmotivating, and retaining its workforce, and the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs is no stranger to working with the Office of \nPersonnel Management and Federal agencies in this regard. The Gramm/\nThompson amendment will provide the SEC the flexibility it needs in \npersonnel matters but also will ensure that basic employee statutory \nprotections such as leave, health insurance and non-discrimination \nstill apply.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator Gramm, and the Ranking Member, Senator Sarbanes, for \ntheir kind assistance in working with me and the other members of the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs, in crafting a fair and balanced \nsolution to the current workforce needs of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission (SEC). Senators Gramm, Voinovich, Cochran, and I have \ndrafted an amendment which permits the SEC to establish a new \ncompensation system for its employees. This new system is to be \npatterned on the pay and compensation systems established for other \nfederal banking agencies under section 1206 (a) of the Financial \nInstitutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989.\n  Agencies in trouble often come to the Governmental Affairs Committee \nseeking flexibility because they can't get their job done under the \ncurrent civil service system. Like most federal agencies, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission has difficulty finding, hiring, and \nretaining the people with the right skills to do the jobs they need \ndone. In these situations, I often ask, if flexibility is good for one \nagency, why shouldn't we grant such flexibility governmentwide.\n  Clearly, flexibility is right for the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. At a very minimum, however, this legislation requires the \nSEC to plan strategically for the adoption of these flexibilities and \nreport to us on the success of their implementation. We require that \nthe SEC include its plans for these flexibilities in its annual \nperformance plans and reports, required under the Government \nPerformance and Results Act.\n  The Results Act requires agencies to adopt performance management \nprinciples--drafting a strategic plan, setting annual goals, and \nreporting to Congress on the extent to which they are meeting their \ngoals. I applaud the fact that the SEC has embraced performance \nmanagement in the past. I am sure they will agree that this is an \nexcellent mechanism with which the SEC can report on its progress in \naddressing its workforce problems.\n  Guidance set forth by the Office of Management and Budget requires \nthat agencies include their human resource strategies in their annual \nperformance plans. Specifically, this guidance requires that agencies \ninclude in their performance plan the specific workforce they need to \nmeet their goals. This legislation will allow the SEC to take the lead \nin integrating workforce planning with their performance plan and \nreport to Congress on the extent to which the flexibilities they were \ngranted allowed them to better meet their goals.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Gramm and Ranking Member Sarbanes for their \ncooperation and support on this important amendment. We've crafted \nsomething that may prove of enormous benefit to the Government as a \nwhole, especially with respect to the workforce challenges that lie \nahead.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent the committee substitute, as \namended, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read the third time and \npassed; and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table and any \nstatements related to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment, in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 143), as amended, was read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                 S. 143\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 25\n\n       Whereas today's youth are vital to the preservation of our \n     country and will be the future bearers of the bright torch of \n     democracy;\n       Whereas youth need a safe haven from various negative \n     influences such as child abuse, substance abuse and crime, \n     and they need to have resources readily available to assist \n     them when faced with circumstances that compromise their \n     safety;\n       Whereas the United States needs increased numbers of \n     community volunteers acting as positive influences on the \n     Nation's youth;\n       Whereas the Safe Place program is committed to protecting \n     our Nation's most valuable asset, our youth, by offering \n     short term ``safe places'' at neighborhood locations where \n     trained volunteers are available to counsel and advise youth \n     seeking assistance and guidance;\n       Whereas Safe Place combines the efforts of the private \n     sector and non-profit organizations uniting to reach youth in \n     the early stages of crisis;\n       Whereas Safe Place provides a direct means to assist \n     programs in meeting performance standards relative to \n     outreach/community relations, as set forth in the Federal \n     Runaway and Homeless Youth Act guidelines;\n       Whereas the Safe Place placard displayed at businesses \n     within communities stands as a beacon of safety and refuge to \n     at-risk youth;\n       Whereas over 500 communities in 32 States and more than \n     9,000 locations have established Safe Place programs;\n       Whereas over 47,000 young people have gone to Safe Place \n     locations to get help when faced with crisis situations;\n       Whereas through the efforts of Safe Place coordinators \n     across the country each year more than one-half million \n     students learn that Safe Place is a resource if abusive or \n     neglectful situations exist; and\n       Whereas increased awareness of the program's existence will \n     encourage communities to establish Safe Places for the \n     Nation's youth throughout the country: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) proclaims the week of March 18 through March 24, 2001 \n     as ``National Safe Place Week'' and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States and interested \n     groups to promote awareness of and volunteer involvement in \n     the Safe Place programs, and to observe the week with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, children are our most valuable resource. \nYouth are the future of this Nation and a resource that needs to be \nboth valued and protected. Sadly, however, as my colleagues know, this \nprecious resource is being threatened every day.\n  I come to the Senate floor today to talk about a tremendous \ninitiative that has been reaching out to youth since 1983. Project Safe \nPlace is a program that was developed to assist youth and families in \ncrisis. It creates a network of private businesses who are trained to \nrefer youth in need to the local service providers who can help them. \nThose businesses display a Safe Place sign so that young people know \nthis is a place where they can go to receive help.\n  The goal of National Safe Place Week is to recognize those \nindividuals who work to make Project Safe Place a reality. From trained \nvolunteers to seasoned professionals, thousands of dedicated \nindividuals are working together within their local communities and \nacross the nation to serve young people, under a well-known symbol of \nsafety for in-crisis youth.\n  Project Safe Place is a simple program to implement in any local \ncommunity, and it works. Young people are much more likely to ask for \nhelp in a location that is familiar and nonthreatening to them. By \ncreating a network of Safe Places across the nation, all youth would \nhave access, through this nonthreatening resource, to needed help, \ncounseling, or a safe place to stay. However, while the program has \nalready been established in 32 States, there are still too many \ncommunities without this valuable youth resources.\n  If your State does not already have a Safe Place organization, please \nconsider facilitating this worthwhile resource. To create more Project \nSafe Place sites in Idaho, the staff in three of my state offices have \ngone through the training to make them all Safe Place sites, and now \nhave the skills and ability to assist troubled youth.\n  I am delighted that the U.S. Senate has passed Senate Resolution 25, \ndesignating the week of March 18-24, 2001 as National Safe Place Week. \nThis action recognizes the importance of Project Safe Place and the \nwork of the National Project Safe Place organization. Most important, \nin passing this resolution, the Senate is applauding the tireless \nefforts of the thousands of dedicated volunteers across the nation for \ntheir many contributions to the youth of our nation through Project \nSafe Place.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/22/senate-section/article/S2792-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2792-S2793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 2001\n\n  Mr. GRAMM.
