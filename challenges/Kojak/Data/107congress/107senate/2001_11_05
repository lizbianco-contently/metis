Your love is constant \nand never changes. You have called us to belong to You, to trust You, \nand to serve You.\n       With renewed dependence on You we accept our Nation's role \n     as a defender of freedom in the world. We need Your guidance \n     and strength for the present war against terrorism. We have \n     been attacked by a terrorist movement with religious \n     fanaticism. They call us infidels and harbor historic hatred \n     against us. Our deep commitment is to free Afghanistan from \n     the tyranny of the Taliban and the terrorism of al Qaeda. \n     When our enemy claims to have divine approbation for its \n     destructive cause, we reaffirm our historic conviction that \n     our Nation's calling is to seek to be on Your side, rather \n     than glibly presume that You are always on our side. Help us \n     to keep our priorities straight: to seek to serve You first \n     above all and to battle for righteousness, justice, and \n     freedom. Bless our President and all who work with him in \n     sorting out the strategy of this just war. Lead on, O \n     Sovereign Lord; we are one Nation under You, indivisible and \n     invincible only with Your power.

Mr. President, we in the Senate take a number of things for \ngranted that we should not. There have been a number of speeches and \nremarks made on the floor and other public venues regarding how we \ndepend on our Capitol Police. They do such a remarkably good job. Since \nSeptember 11 they have worked endless hours, night and day, literally, \n7 days a week, making not only Members feel secure, but the thousands \nof people who visit this Capitol complex and the thousands of employees \nwe have. We have 26,000 employees working in the 3 Senate office \nbuildings and 3 House office buildings. Again, I underscore and \nemphasize how indebted we are to the Capitol Police.\n  Within the Senate we have a lot of people who render invaluable \nservice to the Senate. One of the most important features of the Senate \nis that we are always in line on parliamentary issues. The Chair rules, \nbut at the present time we have just two Parliamentarians who are \nexperts on the rules of the Senate. They do a remarkably good job. They \nare bipartisan in nature. Their rulings are grounded in precedent and \nhave no regard for party affiliation. We never hear the \nParliamentarians say a word yet their duties are essential to the \noperation of the U.S. Senate. The Chair rules, and always rules \ncorrectly. The reason for that is they have the backup of these two \nfine Parliamentarians, Alan Frumin and Elizabeth MacDonough. I am \nspeaking for the entire Senate when I say what an outstanding job they \ndo day in and day out. Perhaps we take these two people, this fine \nyoung woman Elizabeth MacDonough and this fine man,\n\n[[Page S11420]]\n\nAlan Frumin, for granted. We should not do that. They do outstanding \nwork. If the Senate is in session, Elizabeth and Alan are on duty. \nThese past couple of months have been trying times for many. These two \noutstanding individuals have risen to the occasion. Their tireless \nservice to the Senate deserves our recognition and expressions of \nappreciation. Their job is not easy and often involves making the \ntoughest of the calls. They are fair, balanced and wise and their \ninvaluable contribution to the U.S. Senate merits our praise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/05/senate-section/article/S11420-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11420-S11421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WOMEN IN AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in America, for all the advances that have \nbeen made, women still have a little ways to go. They still earn only \n74 cents for every $1 a man makes doing the exact same work. Women pay \n68 percent more in out-of-pocket costs for health care than men. Almost \nhalf of all large health plans do not cover any form of contraception. \nAlthough women make up over half of our population, Federal funding for \nspecific illnesses that relate to women has not kept pace with health \nneeds. That is an understatement.\n  While I cannot overstate the importance of achieving gender equality \nin the United States, these issues pale in comparison to the gender \napartheid the Afghan women experience under the Taliban. The difference \nbetween the problems of American and Afghan women is the difference in \nheight of Mount Everest and Death Valley. The separation is as large as \nit can be on this Earth, the difference between night and day.\n  Gender apartheid is not unlike racial apartheid in South Africa where \nthe black majority suffered appalling human rights violations. In South \nAfrica, people of color were deprived of legal and economic rights, \nmixed marriages were forbidden by law, residential areas were \nsegregated, and many were forced to live in slums. One of the most far-\nreaching consequences of apartheid in South Africa was its impact on \neducation. Children of color were educated at a very low level, if at \nall. Children were taught things such as dishwashing and weeding flower \nbeds.\n  It is difficult to imagine a system worse than apartheid in South \nAfrica. Sadly, this is the case for Afghan women suffering unthinkable \nviolations of their most basic human rights. While I don't in any way \ndiminish what went on in South Africa, what is going on in Afghanistan \nis every bit as bad as, if not worse than, what went on in South \nAfrica.\n  Why do I say that? By virtue of decrees by the Government in power, \nthe Taliban, every aspect of a woman's right in Afghanistan, from their \nbehavior to their dress, is under edict, under rule. For example, women \ncannot work outside the home. Women are not allowed to receive any \neducation. They cannot even be home schooled; that is a violation of \nlaw. Women in Afghanistan today cannot leave their homes unless they \nare accompanied by a close male relative such as a father, a brother, \nor a husband. When they do leave their homes, women must be covered \nfrom head to toe in a burqa. When I say head to toe, I mean they cannot \nhave a strand of hair showing. Their eyes do not show.\n  Every Senator will get in the next day or so a little package that \nshows this piece of cloth with holes in it. This is what the women wear \nover their eyes so that people cannot see their eyes. Think of how \nunsanitary, how humiliating it is to have every inch of their skin \ncovered. But that is the way it is in Afghanistan. Every woman must \nhave every part of her skin covered.\n  So when they do leave their homes, they are covered from head to toe. \nWomen who disobey this rule will be subject to verbal abuse, beatings, \nwhippings. There was a film put out by the Feminist Majority, and I \nwatched Friday in my home this videotape of the treatment of women. It \nis hard to comprehend in this modern world that women are beaten with \nsticks; they are stoned, stoned to death on occasion, for doing things \nthat are not within the rules.\n  Women cannot deal with male shopkeepers. If they go out, even with \ntheir husband or brother or father, they still cannot buy anything \nunless the transaction is made by somebody who is with them. They \ncannot be treated by male doctors. Women who let their ankles show for \nsome reason--they stumble, they fall, they sit, and an ankle shows--are \nwhipped, and they are not whipped privately; they are whipped in \npublic. Women accused of having sex outside of marriage--accused of \nhaving sex outside of marriage--by their husband or someone else will \nbe stoned. I saw this on the videotape. They are killed by being \nstoned.\n  No cosmetics. This includes deodorant, and certainly nothing on their \nface. Women who have their nails painted have had their fingers cut \noff. Women are banned from talking or shaking hands with men. Women are \nprohibited from laughing. No stranger should hear a woman's voice.\n  I wish I were making this up, but I am not. Women cannot wear high \nheels. But even to carry this to a further extreme, you cannot hear a \nwoman when they walk. A man must not hear a woman's footsteps. They \ncannot ride in a taxi without a close male relative. A woman's presence \nin radio, television, or public outings of any kind is forbidden. Women \ncertainly can't play in sports, enter a sports club. Women are banned \nfrom riding bicycles or motorcycles, even with a close relative. And \nremember, that is the only mode of transportation in some places.\n  Women cannot wear brightly colored clothes, even though the burqa \ncovers every part of their body, because in Taliban terms these are \nconsidered sexually attracting clothes--bright colors. Women are \nprohibited from gathering for festive occasions or for any recreational \npurpose. Women cannot wash clothes in rivers or in public places. Women \nare banned from appearing even on balconies of their apartments or \nhouses. And to carry it even further, in homes where the women live, \nyou have to paint the windows so that people cannot see in, for fear \nyou could see a woman inside the home. Male tailors cannot take women's \nmeasurements or sew women's clothes.\n  One of the few things women could participate in was to take baths. \nThey don't have private baths but they have public baths. No more. \nSince 1995 that is all through. No more public baths. Males and females \ncannot travel on the same bus. Public buses are designated ``males \nonly'' or ``females only.'' Flared or wide-legged pant legs even under \ntheir burqas are not allowed. Women cannot be photographed or filmed. \nWomen's pictures cannot appear in newspapers or books or even be hung \non walls in houses or shops.\n  The only thing worse than these restrictions that the Taliban \nGovernment has placed against women is the punishments of those who \ndare to disobey. Penalties include public beatings, torture, stoning, \nas I have already talked about, and of course executions.\n  Let's be very clear. This is not a question of cultural differences. \nThe Taliban's inhumane treatment of women has nothing to do with \nreligion and everything to do with power. Nowhere does the Islamic \nreligion say women cannot be educated or employed. In fact, the \nPresident of the world's largest Islamic nation, Indonesia, is a woman.\n  The toll the Taliban's rule has taken on Afghan women is profound. \nThe rate of illiteracy among girls now is over 90 percent. Women have \nno access to health care. As a result, an estimated 45 women die every \nday from pregnancy-related causes.\n\n  Afghanistan--there may be other countries--is the only country I know \nwhere the life expectancy for a woman is shorter than for a man. To \nshow what that country has gone through and is going through, the \naverage life expectancy for a man is 48 years. For a woman it is lower.\n  Ninety percent of Afghan women suffer from severe depression, and the \nsuicide rate among the Afghan women is too large to count. Sadly, many \nwomen resort to killing themselves, and what they have found is, they \nuse caustic soda that burns away the throat; it takes 3 torturous days \nfor a woman to die. The only surgeon who can do anything about this in \nAfghanistan is in a hospital that is closed to women.\n  In Kabul there are over 40,000 widows as a result of the war. Because \nthe Taliban forbids women from working, they are forced into begging, \nand under penalty of death some of these women\n\n[[Page S11421]]\n\nresort to prostitution; it is the only way they can support themselves \nand their children. That does not last very long because they normally \nare caught and killed.\n  The tragedy is intensified by the fact that prior to the Taliban \ntakeover of the country, Afghan women were 70 percent of the Nation's \nschoolteachers, 40 percent of the Nation's doctors, 50 percent of the \ncivilian government workers, and 50 percent of the college students in \nKabul were women.\n  Just a few years ago, Afghan women were scientists, professors, \nmembers of Parliament, and university professors. They led corporations \nand nonprofit organizations. Today, these same women cannot show their \nfaces in public or leave their homes alone.\n  In spite of the Taliban's harsh edicts, some Afghan women are risking \ntheir lives and some have lost their lives trying to run home schools \nand health clinics.\n  Let me read a few accounts of Afghan women. This is a woman who \nescaped a Taliban death decree. She said:\n\n       ``The Taliban's take over of Afghanistan affected women \n     more than any other sector of Afghan society. Women suffer in \n     Afghanistan because they are forced to abandon their social \n     lives and live as prisoners in their own homes. Women suffer \n     in Afghanistan because they no longer have their freedom of \n     movement, freedom to work, freedom to be educated and the \n     right to live free from violence. Widows, often times are the \n     sole providers for their families and suffer even more \n     because of the Taliban's edicts that outlaw women's \n     employment. Women watch their children suffer from \n     malnutrition, disease, and even death. Women in Afghanistan \n     suffer from war crimes because they are raped, murdered, \n     trafficked, kidnapped, and forced to marry against their \n     will.\n\n  A lot of them are 10-year-old girls. This is an account of a teenager \nwhen the Taliban took control of her village.\n\n       The Taliban's rule in Afghanistan has been the most \n     terrifying experience in my life. I remember with fear that \n     day in 1995 when the Taliban took over my city, and life for \n     women forever changed. I remember the day that I was forced \n     to wear the burqa, the day schools were closed to women, the \n     day learning and work became forbidden to women; and darkness \n     engulfed the lives of all women living in Afghanistan. I \n     remember that I was beaten by the Taliban for going to the \n     public bath and the day women in my city demonstrated against \n     the closing of public baths and schools. The Taliban \n     retaliated by murdering ten of those women and arresting \n     forty others, who since that day have not been seen nor \n     located.\n\n  This is by an Afghan woman who was beaten by the Taliban.\n\n       ``During the first week of the Taliban's capture of Kabul, \n     friends and neighbors helped my family with shopping because \n     I only had sisters and no brothers and my father was dead. \n     One day I decided to go for shopping alone because my \n     neighbors could no longer help out with shopping. I wore a \n     long dress and covered my face and head with the chadori. I \n     went shopping for food at a market near my home. When I \n     arrived at the market I was approached by a man with a long \n     beard, a black turban, a gun on his shoulder, and a long \n     stick in his hand. This man was Taliban. He asked me why I \n     was out alone and who else was with me. When he saw that \n     there was no man with me, I immediately tried to explain that \n     I had no man in my house and that my family was without food \n     to eat. The Talib would not listen to my explanations. He \n     began to beat me with his stick as he shouted at me to go \n     home and leave here. My entire body ached from the bruises \n     and slashes of the stick.\n       In Afghanistan, women have been stripped of their most \n     basic human rights. The Taliban has prohibited women and \n     girls from working, attending school and leaving their home \n     without a close male relative. Women's punishment for \n     violation of Taliban decrees include brutal beatings, \n     imprisonment and even death.\n\n  As we continue life after the terrible day of September 11 and try to \nbring our life to some degree of normalcy, we cannot forget that the \nwomen of Afghanistan are the first victims of the Taliban. Every day, \nwe are doing things to free that country and to restore its government. \nOur Government has no desire to have any degree of governmental control \nover Afghanistan. Our war is not against the people of Afghanistan, but \nit is against the Taliban. They are cruel and unusual in their dealings \nwith people. But they are worse than that in their dealings with women. \nEvery day that we do something to bring about the restoration of the \nAfghan Government which doesn't involve the Taliban, we are doing \nsociety a favor. The women are the first victims of the Taliban.\n  We must demonstrate our support through humanitarian relief for the \nwomen of Afghanistan and the scores of Afghan refugees in the \nsurrounding regions. As we look toward the future of Afghanistan, we \nhave to recognize that women must play a role in rebuilding of the \npost-Taliban Afghanistan.\n  There are people who were educated, and they are still educated. They \nare not being educated, but they are educated. They are women who were \nteachers, doctors, nurses, and scientists. They should play a part in \nthat new government. And there will be a new government.\n  We simply can't forget that women are being brutalized by the \nTaliban, and we must redouble our efforts to help restore human rights \nto the people of Afghanistan, and especially the women of Afghanistan.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I certainly appreciate the comments of my \nfriend from Nevada. I agree with what he has to say. He certainly \ndescribes one of the reasons that we are involved in seeking to find \nout where those terrorists are, and those countries that harbor them, \nand doing something about terrorism around this world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/05/senate-section/article/S11421-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11421-S11423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE SENATE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to comment on where I think \nwe are today and where I think we need to go.\n  Certainly I am very proud of Americans since September 11. I think it \nhas been amazing how everyone in this country has come together with a \ncommitment. I am proud of their work and their dedication to find where \nwe are with these terrorists and to do something about it and to get \nrid of terrorism around the world.\n  As I go home to Wyoming, I am very pleased that even though Wyoming \nis quite a ways from here, those folks are just as committed, just as \ninvolved, and just as interested as the rest of us. I am very pleased \nabout that.\n  When we are challenged and attacked by terrorists, this country \ndemonstrates its commitment to freedom and its commitment to doing away \nwith the things around the world that cause terrorism.\n  I am very proud of this Congress after September 11. Everyone in both \nparties in the House and the Senate came together to do the things that \nwere necessary, to do the things the President asked of us regardless \nof party lines, to do the things for defense, and to do the things for \nNew York and Virginia in terms of the need because of what happened, \nand then to continue to do that. I am very pleased about that.\n  Obviously, in the Senate and the Congress, everyone has different \nideas about how we should go forward. Once we get past the emergency \nkinds of things, we, of course, go back to not having universal \nagreement on everything that we talked about doing. That is the way it \nis. That is the way it should be. We are here to represent different \nviews as we have different views on things that should be undertaken.\n  I believe we have a number of things that we ought to accomplish \nbefore we leave, and indeed it seems to me that we should. One of the \nreasons we have done the things we have done is so that we can continue \nto live a relatively normal life as well as meet our emergencies. I \nthink one of the things that calls for normalcy is for us to leave and \ngo home after Thanksgiving and during Christmastime. I suspect that \nrather than sine die, we will be leaving at the call of the Chair. I \nwill support that. If it is necessary for us to return, we could do \nthat.\n  But we have a number of things we must do. One of them is certainly \nappropriations, on which the Presiding Officer has given leadership. \nObviously, appropriations are a very important and vital part of what \nwe do in Government. I think we completed 5 of the 13 appropriations \nbills. We are moving forward. We need to continue to do that.\n  We need to have an economic stimulus package. Our economy, of course, \nabout a year ago began to weaken. Then, of course, with the September \n11 tragedy, it took a rather sharp decline. We have to do something \nabout that decline, and we can.\n  I think it is necessary for us to complete the airport safety bill \nthat we\n\n[[Page S11422]]\n\nhave passed in the Senate and now has been passed in the House. We have \nto come together on some differences that exist.\n  So these are the issues I think we need to complete. Quite frankly, \nmost of the other issues we have before us are not necessarily issues \nthat have to be done prior to the beginning of next year's session, in \nmy opinion. Obviously, not everyone agrees with that opinion.\n  Also, at the end of a session--any session; and I think particularly \nthis one where there are things that have to be passed--we are going to \nfind ourselves with items that anyone has ever wanted to be passed \nhoping to be attached to a vehicle for passage. Frankly, that is wrong. \nWe ought not to legislate that way.\n  I hope that in the appropriations process we stay within budget. \nObviously, we are going to have special spending that is outside the \nbudget. We recognize that. We have authorized that. I think we have \nspent $55 billion in one of the first shots, and we will probably spend \nanother $75 billion, or more, in this stimulus package. Those are \nobviously special things that need to be addressed.\n  We have said we will stay within the budget except in times of \nemergency, and this is a time of emergency. But I hope we do not use \nthis as a reason for expanding our normal spending, for building \npermanent programs that might only be needed right now. I believe it is \nquite important to be careful.\n  I believe the economic stimulus package should be defined as to what \nits purpose is, what we want to have accomplished with it, and that is \nbasically to have some sort of immediate impact on the economy.\n  I have to admit--and I am a member of the committee that deals with \nthis--even though we have talked to some of the most knowledgeable \neconomists in the whole country, not everyone is quite sure what has \nthe greatest impact immediately. But we need to do the best we can to \nmake sure the things we do will have an immediate impact.\n  I hope we do not end up with a Christmas tree. There will be lots of \ninterest in tacking on everything that anyone has ever thought of \npassing, whether it be long-term taxes or health care programs that \nwill go on for whatever. I hope we will limit that spending basically \nto the package for which the President has asked. We should do that. It \nis not a time to put in a program that is attractive but will go on \nforever after the economic crisis is over.\n  We are going to have to put some dollars in the package. The tax \nproposals will not do it entirely. We have to put some dollars in there \nto help extend unemployment insurance for those who need it when that \nexpires, although relatively few have had and will have theirs expire \nin the next several months.\n  We certainly have to do something about health insurance for those \nwho are unemployed and have lost their health insurance. But I hope we \ndo not develop a whole new Government health insurance program that \ngoes on forever. We ought to use a technique to help people in this \nfairly short term of what we should do in an emergency.\n  Also, we are dealing, of course, with energy. I do not know whether \nit will happen--there is considerable difference of view about an \nenergy bill--but I happen to think, in this instance, energy is one of \nthe most important issues we have to deal with; it has been for some \ntime. We have needed an energy policy. Now we have gotten involved in \nthe Middle East; knowing that nearly 60 percent of our oil comes from \noverseas, we find ourselves more at risk. So energy has become part of \nthis matter of economic development and security.\n\n  Here again, there seems to be a good deal of resistance over a couple \nof issues, such as ANWR and so on, which are not the biggest issues in \nthe world but they seem to hold up something that might very well move \nright along as part of this package.\n  Interestingly enough, there is a good deal of discussion about \nagriculture and an Agriculture bill. The Agriculture bill that is \npresently in place does not expire until September of next year. \nNevertheless, the House has passed a bill that would last for 10 years, \nas a matter of fact. I am hopeful we can do something that does not \nlast quite that long so we can have another opportunity in 5 years to \nlook at the issue; it has been our history to reevaluate bills to see \nhow they have worked.\n  There are lots of ideas and very little agreement on the Agriculture \nbill. I am hopeful, quite frankly, that we do not do it this year. I \nthink we have to have more time to take a look at it. We have eight or \nnine different titles. We have only dealt with one title in terms of a \nmarkup. It would be a very stressed situation to now try to deal with \nall these different programs.\n  Most of all--and this is not something that is new nor unique to our \nsituation now--I hope, as we look at these issues and we look at the \nproblems, we will try to see if we can get a little forward vision into \nwhat we want to have happen over a period of time.\n  Over the last 6 or 8 months, I have had a series of meetings in \nWyoming we have called Vision 20/20. We began to try to talk to people \nin communities about what they would like to see in terms of their \nfamilies, in terms of their communities, in terms of their State in 10 \nor 20 years. Then, as they begin to get a vision of what they would \nlike to see, where they would like to be, then it makes it much easier \nto make the decisions now and to measure whether those decisions, in \nfact, lead to where they want to go over time.\n  One of the real obvious issues this applies to is agriculture. What \ndo we want agriculture to be? Obviously, all of us who have farmers and \nranchers--and I come from an agricultural background--want to make it \neconomically suitable for them to exist, to be a very important part of \nour economy in Wyoming and other places as well.\n  We hope agriculture is part of a conservation movement where we have \ntrees and fields and where we have planned growth in open spaces. \nAgriculture can contribute to that greatly. These are the things we \nwant to see over time.\n  I think we want to see an economic safety net for agriculture. On the \nother hand, certainly we would like to see agriculture responding to \nthe marketplace. That is where all businesses ought to be. We ought to \nbe building more and more markets as we can overseas. We are going to \nhave to have agriculture that fits with today's trade issues.\n  WTO is meeting right now. It is fairly easy to sit down and say: Hey, \nwe have some real problems; we need to do this right now. But then you \nask yourself, where will that lead.\n  It is the same thing with energy. Where do we want to be with energy? \nObviously, we want to have energy available for us. It should be \navailable, to a large extent, domestically so we are not totally \ndependent on imports. We ought to have energy that is created in an \nenvironmentally sound manner to have the multiple use of public lands, \nfor example, having energy produced there as well as preserving the \nlands.\n  Those are the kinds of things that I think all of us want to see over \ntime. We would like to have conservation so that we find ways to do the \nthings we want to do in our lives with less energy, if we can. And I \nsuspect we will find new ways over time.\n  I remember being in a meeting in Caspar, WY, years ago where somebody \nmade a point which I have always remembered: We have never run out of a \nfuel. Before we run out, we always find something else that moves us \nforward. We started with wood, then coal, then gas. We have nuclear. We \nhave had all these sources of fuel. We will continue to have sources of \nfuel, I am sure, over time.\n  I know it is difficult--and I certainly am not critical--but I do \nthink it is necessary that we address ourselves to those issues that \nshould have a priority for us before we leave this session of Congress \nsomewhere near our normal time. I think it is up to the leadership and \nup to the rest of us to do that, and to get those issues on the floor \nand to come to some agreement--which is not easy, I understand--to deal \nwith them. After that, we can then move on to do other things.\n  Mr. President, thank you for the time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we will begin this week with a vote at 6 \no'clock this evening, and we will turn to other issues. I want to make \nsome comments about the most important issues we face in Congress and \nwhat I think we ought to be doing to address them.\n  I just flew in from Chicago a few moments ago and noticed in the \nChicago papers this morning that yesterday a man got through the \nscreening process at Chicago O'Hare Airport with nine knives and a stun \ngun. He was selected for advance screening at the gate in addition to \ngoing through the metal detectors.\n  When they opened the baggage of this particular person, they found \nnine knives and a stun gun that had been missed at the screening as the \nindividual entered the concourses.\n  That ought to demonstrate, as so many other studies have \ndemonstrated, that the current system for screening passenger baggage \nand passengers is not working. That is quite clear.\n  The largest company that employs workers to screen baggage at \nairports has been found guilty of violating all kinds of FAA rules and \nregulations. They have violated training. They have hired ex-criminals. \nThey have not adequately supervised them. They have falsified records. \nThey were fined by the Federal Government for their behavior and 2 \nyears later, after being put on probation, were discovered to have \nviolated their probation with the same problems. This is the largest \ncompany in this country that hires these workers. In fact, it is a \nforeign company, but it is the largest employer of screeners in \nAmerica.\n  One wonders why this company is still working at airports screening \npassengers when it has already been fined, when it falsified reports \nand then violated the probation that was established for it.\n\n  My point is that we have just had a significant debate in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives on the issue of airport security and baggage \nscreening. We in the Senate passed legislation 100-0--all Republicans \nand all Democrats supported it. Then we had a couple of our friends \nfrom a southern State, Texas, whom I shall not name, who decided that \nthe legislation was not good and needed to be altered. God forbid \nsomebody was going to make Federal workers out of the screeners. So \nthey ramped up a huge effort in the House of Representatives to defeat \nthe proposal we passed 100-0 in the Senate.\n  My hope is that in the next week or so--in the next few days, in \nfact--we will convene a conference and work aggressively and to \nimmediately pass an aviation security bill. It is unforgivable we have \ntaken this long. After September 11, everyone understood we had a new \nrequirement, a new duty, and a new responsibility to pass an aviation \nsecurity bill, and that legislation has not yet passed despite the fact \nwe passed it through this body with every Republican and Democrat \nsupporting it--100-0 only to have it languish week after week in the \nother body.\n  I regret the House did that, but now that they have passed \nlegislation that will get us to conference, it is very important that \nwe take this seriously and find a way to develop the compromise \nnecessary so the American people will feel confident that when they \nwalk through airports about to board an airplane, there is not some \ngoofball someplace carrying nine knives and a stun gun.\n  This person explained he had forgotten. How do you forget you have \nnine knives and a stun gun, for God's sake? How do you forget you have \nthat in your luggage? How do you qualify to fly if you have a mind like \nthat--that you take nine knives and a stun gun to the airport?\n  In any event, having said that, that is just the latest information \nin this morning's paper. Last week, it was the audit that was done at \nDulles Airport and the screeners who missed what they should have \nknown.\n  Why does all this happen? Because people leave screening jobs to fry \nhamburgers so they can make more money. These are low-paying jobs. The \npeople are ill trained by companies that want to put the least cost \nemployees in those positions and make good money doing it.\n  I am not interested in that. I am interested in accountability and \nsecurity for the American traveling public. That is all I am interested \nin. I am not interested in the debate about for whom they work. All I \nam interested in is accountability.\n  We have had a circumstance where these employees have been working \nfor very large firms, one of which I already described that has been \nfined by the Federal Government and is guilty of falsifying records. We \nhave already had that experience. We know that does not work. So \nperhaps we ought to try what the Senate has suggested in the \nlegislation it passed 100-0.\n  That is what is in front of us in the next few days, and I hope, as a \nmember of the committee that generated the bill that passed the Senate \nunanimously, with the help of Senator Hollings and Senator McCain \nleading the effort, we can find a way to solve this very quickly.\n  Let me turn to the next challenge we have in addition to aviation \nsecurity. The other challenge we have is to pass a stimulus package. \nWhat does ``stimulus'' mean? Stimulus means pass legislation that will \nprovide some incentives to help boost this economy of ours.\n\n  Last Friday, we received word that another 415,000 people lost their \njobs in the last month. Mostly, these are people at the lower end of \nthe economic ladder. These are not people making a lot of money, in \nmost instances. These people and their families know about second jobs, \nsecondhand, second mortgages, and second shifts. They are the same \npeople who during tough times find they have lost their jobs. Then they \nfind out, at least with some people in the U.S. Congress, they are also \nsecond choice. There are some people in Congress who do not want to \nhelp them very much because they say that would not provide the \nincentive for those families to look for work again.\n  In my judgment, these people who are laid off during a very difficult \nand soft economy require our help. We have always, during a severe \neconomic downturn, extended our hand and said: We will extend \nunemployment benefits to help those who have lost their jobs and are \ndown and out.\n  That is stimulative. That money is spent immediately by the families \nwho have lost their incomes and are struggling. That is a way to \nstimulate this country's economy. We must do that when we construct a \npackage of incentives to provide lift to this economy.\n  What are the other incentives we could provide that would help this \neconomy? We can do traditional things, such as tax credits that would \nincentivize investment. We can do things that will incentivize \nconsumption. We can do things that will incentivize production. There \nare all kinds of menus with which to do that: Expensing, bonus \ndepreciation, and targeted investment tax credits, for example.\n  In addition to tax credits and other incentives in the Tax Code, we \ncan stimulate economic activity by building roads and bridges, by \nrepairing schools, and by making other public investments that put \npeople back to work so that at the end of the time when we have enacted \na stimulus package and made those investments, we can look back and \nsay: We not only stimulated the economy, we have something to show for \nit.\n  My colleague, Senator Byrd, the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, is working with a number of us in the Senate. He has taken \nthe leadership position on the infrastructure\n\n[[Page S11424]]\n\nneeds and the investment in infrastructure as part of a stimulus \npackage. That is important as well.\n  We have the issues of extending unemployment benefits, health care \nissues for the unemployed, the issue of what kind of tax cuts might be \nemployed to stimulate and lift this economy, and then the issue of what \nkind of infrastructure investment we can make that puts people back to \nwork building, repairing, and making things. All of these should come \ntogether in a package designed to stimulate this economy.\n  This economy is in much more trouble than most people understand. It \nwas a very soft economy prior to September 11, and September 11 cut a \nhole right through the belly of this economy. We are beginning to see \nthe evidence of that now each day with each additional number that \ndescribes the condition of our economy.\n  It is going to have an impact in every part of this country. It will \ntouch virtually every family. So the question is, What can we do and \nhow can we do it? How can we lift this drowning economy?\n  President Bush has said he wants Congress to act and act quickly. He \nis right about that. We should. We must. But just acting, if it is not \nthe right thing, will not be the right approach. If we do not do the \nright thing, taking action is pretty irrelevant. What we need to do is \ntake action now to do the right thing to give help to this country's \neconomy. The House of Representatives passed what they called a \nstimulus package. I describe it as leftovers.\n  My mother used to talk about leftovers when she was talking about the \nsupper table. What is for supper? We called it supper in my hometown. \nWhen she said leftovers, we all understood in our family what leftovers \nmeant.\n  Well, I view the stimulus package that the House passed almost the \nsame way, as leftovers. It is all the things they had left over from \nprevious tax bills that they did not get, but they always wanted to do. \nIt did not have very much at all to do with whether it is going to help \nthis economy, whether it is going to stimulate this economy, whether it \nis going to lift this economy. It was just leftovers.\n  In fact, I will mention one. I will not go into great depth. One of \nthem, at a cost of $21 billion, was stuck in the House-passed stimulus \npackage to incentivize investments overseas. Now, tell me how that \nstimulates the economy in this country. It is a big giveaway to \ncompanies that move and keep needed investment capital overseas and \nearn income overseas and do not want to repatriate the money. Now talk \nabout the nth degree of goofy. At a time when our economy is on its \nknees, we have the U.S. House passing a tax provision that incentivizes \nadditional investments overseas. Our investments ought to be to \nincentivize creating jobs in the United States, not elsewhere.\n  So we have a big job ahead of us to try to pass legislation that \nprovides a real lift to this economy. The President is right, we need \nto do it. It would be unforgivable, in my judgment, if Congress left \ntown sometime between now and Christmas, whenever we finish our work, \nand had not passed a stimulus package to try to provide some lift to \nthis country's economy.\n  I know some will argue we have economic stabilizers that we did not \nused to have in this economy and that recessions are not quite as deep \nas they used to be. We do not know that. We do not know what the \nconsequences of September 11 will be on this economy. We do know that \ngoing into September 11, we were in the business cycle and we were on \nthe contraction side of a business cycle. It is inevitable that there \nis expansion and contraction, and we were on the contraction side of \nthat business cycle.\n  Then September 11 occurred. We shut down the airline industry. The \nentire travel industry in this country is in a huge amount of trouble. \nSome of us have proposed some loan guarantees to try to provide \nassistance in those areas. This economy took a huge body blow, and I \nthink most do not understand how deep this likely recession could be or \nhow long it could last if all of us do not now do the right thing.\n  This is not about Democrats or Republicans. It is about good ideas, \nhaving the capacity to employ opportunities for investment and \nconsumption in this economy to try to rev this economic engine once \nagain.\n  We went through unprecedented growth in our country for a good many \nyears. We were blessed with that. In fact, some looked at those numbers \nand they looked at NASDAQ and the stock market and they thought this \neconomy only goes one way.\n\n  It is true of the President. It was true of the Congress. Everybody \nsaid: You know something, we are going to have surpluses for 10 years \nin a row. The next 10 years we are going to do so great we are going to \nhave surpluses every year. So let us put in a very large tax cut \nanticipating surpluses for the next 10 years.\n  That was just months ago. Those surpluses are very quickly vanishing, \nregrettably, and this economy has changed in a very significant way. I \nhope we can get back to the position where we have economic strength \nand opportunity, hope for American families who have lost their jobs \nand a growing economy that provides new opportunities for others in \nthis country who are going to enter the job market. At this point, this \nCongress has no choice but to be with this President and, between the \ntwo parties, construct a stimulus package that really does give a lift \nand some hope to the American economy. If we do not do that, the \nAmerican people should judge us harshly, in my judgment. Between now \nand when we leave this year, we have a responsibility to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/05/senate-section/article/S11424-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AMERICA'S FARMERS NEED A FARM BILL NOW\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. My colleague from Arizona is coming back to speak, but \nbefore he does I will mention the issue of the farm bill. We have had a \nsubstantial amount of discussion in recent days about the farm bill.\n  I mentioned aviation security, which we need to get done quickly. I \nmentioned the stimulus package, which we have a requirement to enact, \nand now a farm bill. We have the Secretary of Agriculture who has left, \nI believe, for Qatar. It is a country whose name most of us cannot \npronounce. They are having the WTO meeting in Qatar because they cannot \nhave them anywhere else. It is a country with very few hotel rooms, and \nso they will therefore accommodate very few demonstrators. These \ndemonstrators tend to show up wherever they are discussing trade \nanywhere in the world, so they are having this meeting in Qatar. But we \nhad hoped to meet with the Secretary of Agriculture last week.\n  We think it is very important to pass a farm bill in the next 3 or 4 \nweeks. The House of Representatives did so. It is better than current \nlaw. It is not good enough yet for wheat and feed grains and some of \nthe things we need to do to improve it, but we have a responsibility to \npass a farm bill, one that works for family farmers.\n  There are some who are counseling, as the Secretary of Agriculture, \nthe head of the Office of Management and Budget and others have, that, \noh, do not worry, do not do it now, do it next spring; the money will \nstill be there. Nonsense. That money is in the budget this year, and it \nreserves a place this year and in future years, but it will not be \nthere next year. Next year, we face an entirely different economy when \nwe begin constructing a new budget. So we have a responsibility to do a \nfarm bill in the next 2, 3 to 4 weeks as well, and some of us are going \nto fight like the devil to make that happen.\n  I prefer it be a farm bill that comes out of the Agriculture \nCommittee. Senator Harkin is leading the way, and I want to work with \nhim. If it does not come out of the committee, then there is a farm \nbill sitting at the desk we could bring before the Senate and amend. It \ncame from the House of Representatives. One way or another we owe it to \nthe American farmers to write a farm bill that works.\n  I see my colleague from Arizona is in the Chamber, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Leahy).

Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota for \narranging my time to speak. I will talk about two things: First is the \nvictory last night in the bottom of the ninth inning of the Arizona \nDiamondbacks in\n\n[[Page S11425]]\n\nthe baseball World Series. Naturally, we Arizonans are very proud of \nthe Arizona Diamondbacks.\n  I am proud of the New York Yankees, and I am proud of the people of \nthe city of New York. Ever since I was a little kid, I was a New York \nYankees fan because my grandfather used to listen to the games on the \nradio back in the Midwest I became familiar with the statistics of all \nof the great players of the New York Yankees throughout the years, \nmostly through the good but through both the good and the bad.\n  They have been the most successful franchise in baseball history, of \ncourse, and when the events of September 11 occurred in New York City, \nall of America, in a sense, became New York Yankees fans. When they won \nthe American league pennant and went to the World Series for the first \ntime probably in their history, Americans were pulling for the New York \nYankees rather than the other team which, of course, had always before \nbeen the underdog, and mostly Americans pulled for the underdog. But \nthis time, they were pulling for the New York Yankees; everybody \nexcept, that is, the Arizona Diamondbacks fans.\n  Four years ago, Arizona got a baseball team. At that point, I became, \nat least in the National League, an Arizona Diamondbacks fan. My \nfantasy was to have a World Series that involved the American League \nchampion, the New York Yankees, and the National League champion, the \nArizona Diamondbacks, in which both teams would do very well and which \nwould be won by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the bottom of the ninth \ninning of the seventh game.\n  Lo and behold, that is exactly what happened, a dream come true for a \nbaseball fan all of my life and somebody who likes both of these teams \nvery well.\n  Obviously, I rooted for the Diamondbacks. I understand the \ndisappointment of the New Yorkers who lost but, of course, as we all \nknow, New Yorkers have more often than not been on the other side and \nhave tasted the fruits of victory.\n  All Americans appreciate the valiant battle both teams put up and \ncertainly what the New York Yankees were trying to achieve for not only \nthemselves as a team but the people of New York. In a larger sense, all \nAmericans participated in this series fully aware of what it meant to \nthe people of New York and, frankly, it meant that same thing for all \nof the people of America because we could not go to the series with the \nYankees playing without thinking of the events of September 11.\n  Yet in another way, the series having been won by a new, fresh team, \nthe Arizona Diamondbacks, I think also is a great thing for America. As \na Diamondbacks fan, it is especially gratifying that after just 4 short \nyears, the Arizona Diamondbacks won the baseball World Series, the \nshortest period of time ever in the history of baseball.\n  It was not by accident. The Arizona Diamondbacks wanted to play the \nvery best in the World Series. They wanted to play the New York \nYankees; they got that chance. They wanted to beat the very best, and \nin Mariano Rivera, the New York Yankees' relief pitcher, that is who \nthey had to beat in the bottom of the ninth. And they did. It takes \nnothing away from Rivera or the rest of the Yankees who are truly a \nclass act, but what it shows is that there has now begun a new dynasty \nin baseball--the Arizona Diamondbacks. They won 100 games in their \nsecond season, did not win the National League pennant but did very \nwell.\n  Naturally, we were very proud of them. Now to win it all in the World \nSeries really caps it off for Arizona fans.\n  My hat goes off to the general partner of the Arizona Diamondbacks, \nJerry Colangelo. Jerry is known in the sports world as a very \nsuccessful sports entrepreneur, a real fan, and also a participant. He \nhimself played ball in his youth and, coming from Chicago, obviously \nwas involved in the key franchise of the Chicago Bulls, came to \nArizona, and helped create the Phoenix Suns, a very successful \nfranchise in its own right.\n  He was the natural person to whom the leaders of Phoenix came when \nthey wanted to put together a major league baseball team. And he said: \nI really have my hands full with the other things I'm doing, including \nthe Phoenix Suns and in getting a new stadium, a new place for the \nPhoenix Suns to play ball; and he said: We would have to have a brand \nnew ballpark: that would take a lot in terms of public support, and I \nwould rather not be involved in it.\n  But he was the logical choice, and reluctantly he agreed to take the \nleadership in bringing together the Arizona baseball franchise. He did \nthat. He raised the money. He provided the leadership. He got the \nBankOne ballpark built with a beautiful stadium in downtown Phoenix \nwith a retractable roof that goes back and forth in 6 minutes, a \nbeautiful natural turf ballpark in which to play.\n  His philosophy was to create a winner. Jerry Colangelo is about \nwinning. He is not a guy who just wants to field a team and then \nperhaps take 20 years to get to the World Series. He thought the \nArizona fans deserved a winner at the very beginning, and that is what \nhe set about to create. Naturally, it did not come free, and as a \nresult, because a new major league baseball franchise cannot \nparticipate in most of the revenues from the league for I think it is \nabout 5 years, it was very costly to the people who supported the team, \nand financially, obviously, they are not in as good shape as some other \nteams that have been there a lot longer.\n  So this will be a big boon to them not just from a fan support base \nbut financially as well. Therefore, I really appreciate what has \nhappened for Jerry Colangelo. He deserves the very best, as does his \nmanagement team, his son Bryan, and all the others who worked to make \nthat a great family and a great team in the State of Arizona.\n  I note that I talked to Jerry Colangelo this morning. He had received \na congratulatory call from President Bush, himself a great baseball \nfan. And hopefully some of the Diamondbacks will be able to get to \nWashington in the not too distant future to meet with the President. He \nis also on the way to Chicago for the baseball owners meetings, and \nthere are some big decisions the owners have to make about this great \nAmerican pastime.\n\n  I just wanted to share with my colleagues my joy, and I am sure I \nspeak for all the people in Arizona, the way they feel about the \nArizona Diamondbacks this year, the way they have kept together as a \nteam. They have had to play a very tough National League Western \nDivision, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants, who \nwere challenging them every step of the way. San Diego was a tough team \nfor them, as were the Colorado Rockies.\n  All of those teams deserve a lot of credit. But in the end it was the \nArizona Diamondbacks who marched through the other teams and ended up \nbeating Atlanta to take the pennant and I think, in facing the New York \nYankees, faced the best the American League had to offer. It was \nobviously a victory in which all of Arizona can take a great deal of \npride. And I hope fans across the United States who may have been \npulling for the Yankees for other sentimental reasons this year will \ntake a good hard look at the upstart Arizona Diamondbacks who deserve a \nlot of credit, having beaten the best, and will be around for a long \ntime to come as a great baseball team playing our great national \npastime.\n  A final word on this. I was talking to somebody this morning who \nsaid: You know, during this series, which has to go down as one of the \ngreatest series in the history of baseball, the way the games were won \nin Yankee Stadium and in the bottom of the ninth in the seventh game in \nPhoenix, a lot of America was focused on having fun with our national \npastime and not thinking about some of the more serious and difficult \nissues we have had to face. One of the ways we can show the terrorists \nthat they can have absolutely no chance of beating the American spirit \nis to continue to do what we enjoy, and that includes enjoying our \ngreat national pastime, baseball. So my hat is off to the Arizona \nDiamondbacks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/05/senate-section/article/S11425-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11425-S11427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF JOHN WALTERS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the other subject I want to talk about today \nis also, I hope, good news in that it involves what I think the Senate \nwill be able to take up very soon, and that is\n\n[[Page S11426]]\n\nthe nomination of the last of the President's Cabinet officers, who is \nJohn Walters to be the Director of the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy, often known as the drug czar.\n  John Walters has a great history of service in the area of drug \ncontrol policy. He is a superb nomination of President Bush. His \nnomination has been around now for over 5 months. The President \nnominated him on June 5. We are now 5 months later and he has not yet \nbeen confirmed by the Senate.\n  His hearing was held on October 10, a month after it had originally \nbeen scheduled on September 11, and this hearing lasted I think over 3 \nhours. He was asked a lot of questions by a lot of the members. I think \nanything that had been on anybody's mind was adequately covered. I \nthink subsequent to that time he has answered over 60 questions with a \nlot of subparts that have gone into further detail, including questions \nsubmitted by members not even of the Judiciary Committee chaired by the \nPresiding Officer.\n  I am hopeful that at our business meeting this week John Walters will \nbe passed out of the Judiciary Committee so that he can be considered \nby the full Senate and we can have him confirmed and he can be in place \nbefore Thanksgiving. It seems to be not too much to ask of the Senate \nto confirm Cabinet officers before Thanksgiving of the year in which \nthey are nominated, particularly when their nominations have been \npending for so long.\n  Let me say a couple words about John Walters. And I have to say I am \nbiased because I know this fine man.\n  I recently met his family. My daughter and his wife are friends. I \nknow the Walters to be a very fine family. His service to this country \nhas exemplified the values I know he cherishes. They are values that \nmanifest themselves in trying to tell young people in this country why \nthe path of drugs is the wrong path for them, trying to help people who \nhave gotten involved in drugs get back on the right track through \ntreatment and rehabilitation, trying to develop a national strategy \nthat helps us keep drugs out of the country, that interdicts them and \ntries to deal with them in the places of their origin and tracks down \nthe people who perpetrate the trade in drugs and traffic in them, \nselling them to young people, to provide punishment for those drug \ntraffickers.\n  All of the aspects of the war on drugs--and that is an unfortunate \nterm--require focus and attention by the Office of Drug Control Policy. \nWhen John Walters served in that office under President George Bush--\nthe first President George Bush--later acting deputy director for 4 \nyears in the Bush administration of the Office of Drug Policy, he \nbecame intimately familiar with all aspects of our war on drugs.\n  He participated significantly in the issues relating to drug \ntreatment. I know one of the questions was whether he was as strongly \ncommitted to drug treatment as he was to some of the other aspects of \ndrug control policy.\n  I note that there are certain parts of drug policy that are the \nresponsibility of the U.S. Government because as a nation we deal with \ndrug interdiction and as a foreign policy matter we deal with \neradication of drugs in foreign lands and their interdiction before \nthey come into the United States. That is a Federal responsibility; it \nis not performed by, for example, the city of Phoenix.\n  But when we get to drug education, prevention, treatment, and \nrehabilitation, those are shared responsibilities starting with our \nlocal communities that have a great deal to say about how those \nprograms get carried out in each individual community, supported by the \nStates and ultimately also by the U.S. Government.\n  When one examines the role of the Federal Government and the people \nwho have worked on this issue in Washington, it is important to \nseparate those functions which are purely and strictly of the Federal \nGovernment as opposed to those jobs which are shared by other \njurisdictions. Our focus needs to be primarily on the former. We share \na responsibility with all of the other States and local communities \nwith respect to the latter. That doesn't mean we are any less committed \nto antidrug education, treatment, and rehabilitation.\n  I think there was a sense that that was perhaps John Walters' \nphilosophy. Absolutely nothing could be further from the truth. As a \nmatter of fact, he was one of the architects of the new drug strategy \nand the Federal spending plan that targeted drug treatment and \ntreatment research when he was in the Bush administration. He was \ncertainly behind the move to expand the budget and programs for drug \nprevention.\n  I think all of that became clarified during the hearing. There was a \ngreat deal of support in the Judiciary hearing for the President's \ncommitment of additional resources. I believe the number is $1.6 \nbillion for these programs.\n  I specifically asked him whether or not he would be a strong advocate \nfor administering this program as the President had outlined it. He \nsaid absolutely he would. I think there is no doubt about the fact that \nhe is committed to treatment and prevention and will strongly support \nthe President's plan in that regard.\n  His work, by the way, first began in the mid-1980s when he worked on \ndrug policy matters at the U.S. Department of Education and was \nactually responsible in that position for a drug prevention guide. Over \n1 million copies were distributed. That is when I first became aware of \nhis work. But of course his later work was in the Office of Drug \nControl Policy itself, 4 years total serving as chief of staff from \n1989 through 1991, and then deputy director for supply reduction from \n1991 through 1992.\n  I hope somebody with the long experience he has had in this area can \nquickly be confirmed by the Senate to assist the President in this war \non drugs and to fill out the last Cabinet position in the Bush \nadministration.\n  There is one other reason I come to the floor today: To make the \npoint that has to do with our war on terrorism.\n  As we know--and as we can discuss in a lot more detail than we are \npermitted to do here in public--terrorists in several places in the \nworld are significantly supported financially through the drug trade. \nIt is therefore important for us, while we are fighting this war on \nterrorism, to not forget that a key component of terrorism financing in \nmany places in the world is the drug trade. That is the responsibility \nof the Office of Drug Control Policy, primarily coordinating the \ndifferent agencies of the U.S. Government in fighting the war on \nterrorism. It is yet another reason we need a leader at the top of that \norganization. It is true we have a lot of good people fighting that \nbattle around the world today, but the direction that can come only \nfrom the director--a Cabinet officer of the President--I think is \ncritical.\n\n  Therefore, if we are going to do everything we can in fighting the \nwar on terrorism, which all of us like to say around here, one of the \nthings we must do is to quickly confirm John Walters as the drug czar.\n  One of the key components of fighting drugs is also fighting the war \non terror. That is why I conclude by urging my colleagues on the \nJudiciary Committee to confirm John Walters when we vote on him, \npresumably this week, and to quickly get his nomination before the \nSenate so that all 100 Senators can have a vote on the confirmation of \nJohn Walters as drug czar. I would love to have that vote before the \nend of this week. I am sure the President would as well. But we have to \ndo it within the next few days, in any event. If there is any concern \nor objection to John Walters, I hope Members will bring those concerns \nto me so I can do whatever I can to ensure that he can satisfy those \nconcerns.\n  The bottom line is that we need this position filled since he is the \nright man for the job. He has the President's confidence, and it is \nabout time we confirmed him as drug czar. I hope my colleagues will act \non that quickly.\n  Those are two bits of good news: The victory of the Arizona \nDiamondbacks and my hope that we will quickly confirm John Walters and \nconclude the confirmation process of the President's Cabinet.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday our neighbors to the south in \nNicaragua went to the polls to elect a new President. The liberal party \ncandidate, Enrique Bolanos, appears to be the winner. With part of the \nvote counted this afternoon, he has 53 percent of the vote, while \nSandinista leader, Daniel Ortega, trails with 45 percent. Although \nvotes still remain to be counted, Ortega has conceded defeat.\n  But right up to yesterday, when people actually went to the polls in \nNicaragua, the candidates were running neck and neck, we are told, in a \nvery heated and very tight race. It is disconcerting that the race was \neven close at all. The very fact that Ortega, a Marxist Communist \nsympathizer, could come close to regaining power tells us that it is \ntime for the United States to wake up and start paying attention to our \nneighbor to the south. If we do not, we will see Daniel Ortgega or \nanother leftist radical regain power sometime in the future.\n  The fact is that unless we pay attention, unless we take notice, \nhistory may well repeat itself. Sometimes we in the United States have \na tendency to go from crisis to crisis. We try to deal with the crisis \nand then, once the crisis is over, we forget about that region or that \npart of the world or that country. That is what I think we have done in \nCentral America.\n  In the 1980s, when I was a member of the House Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, the world's spotlight, and this Congress' spotlight, the \ncountry's spotlight was on Nicaragua; it was on El Salvador; it was on \nmany of our neighbors in South and Central America.\n\n  The 1980s and the 1990s brought a very significant increase in \ndemocracy in this hemisphere. Many of us have come to the Chamber and \ntalked about that. We have talked about the fact that this hemisphere \nis so much more democratic today than it has ever been in the past. \nToday, all but one of our region's 33 countries have democratically \nelected heads of state. But we have seen a retrenching of that in the \nlast few years.\n  While we justifiably are worried about many other parts of the world, \nwe should not forget about our neighbors to the south. In fact, a \nrecent poll indicates a steep decline in support for democracy among \nLatin American and Central American countries. If we look at Nicaragua, \nthat same poll shows that only 43 percent of Nicaraguans support \ndemocracy. That figure was at 72 percent just 3 years before, nearly a \n30-percent drop.\n  In the same poll, Nicaragua registered the largest increase in \nsupport for authoritarian government, a 16-percent increase over the \nprevious year's figure.\n  Maybe these startling figures should come as no surprise. History \ndoes offer us a sober reminder that oppressive regimes often spring \nfrom misery, despair, and joblessness. Nicaragua has never recovered \nfrom the war of the 1980s, the earthquake of the early 1970s, the \ndroughts, the hurricanes, the political corruption, the economic \ncollapse. If we look at the per capita income today, what we find is \nper capita income in Nicaragua in real terms is still less than 25 \npercent of the level reached in the 1970s--an absolutely unbelievable \nfigure.\n  Nicaragua today is still the second poorest country in the hemisphere \nbehind Haiti.\n  There is something wrong with this picture. Yes, democracy won out in \nNicaragua in the 1980s, but the economic environment and political \nleadership were not stable enough to allow that democracy to fully take \nhold and thrive. In the recent election, the apparent winner was \nclearly handicapped by the fact that he had been Vice President for \nPresident Aleman, who has certainly been a disappointment to his \ncountry and a disappointment to the United States and other people who \ncare about democracy.\n  We should think about this. Just yesterday that nation, Nicaragua, \ncame all too close to sending Daniel Ortega back to the Presidency, the \nvery leader under whose direction inflation rose as high as 33,000 \npercent.\n  Regretfully, the United States has not done as much as we should have \nover the last decade. We have done some things. We have been involved. \nWe tried to help but, candidly, not as much as we should have. We tried \nto implement judicial reforms and change in the rule of law, but \ndemocracy is not a hobby;, it is a lifetime commitment. It is not \nenough to believe in it;, it has to be practiced every day, day in and \nday out.\n  Yesterday's elections represent a close call but also a new \nopportunity for democracy in Nicaragua. I believe the United States \nmust do what we can to help our friends in Nicaragua.\n  With the election of Enrique Bolanos, we have a unique opportunity to \nbring about lasting change for the people of Nicaragua. We need to \nsupport and work closely with USAID in that effort to create economic \nand social conditions that will produce a greater margin of safety for \nthe poor. Hurricane Mitch demonstrated how vulnerable the country is to \nnatural disasters. Overall economic losses were estimated at $1.5 \nbillion.\n\n  While growth rebounded to about 7 percent in 1999, low world coffee \nprices and an internal financial sector crisis caused Nicaragua more \nthan 10-percent drop in GDP in the year 2000. There is an urgent need \nfor Nicaragua to pay systematic and immediate attention to \nenvironmental issues and problems, including watershed management, \nnatural resource management, reforestation, and land use. We also need \nto expand our food-for-work programs, strengthen our education and \ntraining initiatives, and encourage alternative crop development.\n  Furthermore, we need to foster economic growth by strengthening our \nmicroenterprise programs and increasing the number of rural credit \nunions. I know my colleague in the Chair has been a great supporter of \nmicroenterprise programs. They work in Nicaragua as they work around \nthe world. I think we have to do more to promote them.\n  These are efforts that we have supported in the past, and we need to \nsupport in the future. We need to provide individual Nicaraguans the \ntools to permanently free themselves from poverty. We should also \nsupport soon-to-be-President Bolanos in any attempt to scale back some \nof the electoral and judicial reforms brought about in the late 1999 \npact between the Aleman government and the Sandinistas. Specifically, \nwe need to work towards: No. 1, restoring the autonomy of the judicial \nbranch; No. 2, restoring the autonomy of the comptroller; No. 3, \nreducing barriers for third party participation and increased \naccountability of the Supreme Electoral Council; and finally, we need \nto also develop increased accountability of government officials and \nmake aid contingent on a transparent government that proactively works \nto root out corruption.\n  Finally, we should take advantage of opportunities for bilateral and \nmultilateral counterdrug operations with the Nicaraguan military. \nOperations such as these, closely monitored, not only can produce \ntangible results in the form of interdictions and deterrence but also \ncould help increase the skills and professionalism of the indigenous \nforces in Nicaragua.\n  Ultimately, we need to keep a very close watch on the entire \nhemisphere to see what we can do to help the democratic forces. They \nneed our help. It is in the best interests of the United States to see \nthese countries remain democratic.\n  We also need to understand how very closely economic progress for the \npoor is tied to democracy. If we expect democracy to flourish and to \ngrow in our neighbors to the south, it is essential that we do what we \ncan to help their economies grow so everyone in those countries, \nwhether it be Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, or any of our neighbors \nto the south, anyone who lives in these countries will see they do have \nopportunity under democracy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, until recently, the Bush administration \nappeared to be engaged in a headlong rush to unilaterally withdraw from \nthe Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty--the ABM Treaty--and deploy a \nnational missile defense system. That headlong rush had some serious \nnegative implications for the security of the United States and for our \nrelations with other nations.\n  If the United States decided to unilaterally withdraw from the ABM \nTreaty, it could:\n  First, lead Russia to stop dismantling nuclear weapons, and to retain \nor eventually increase its multiple warheads on long-range missiles;\n  Second, lead other nations, such as China, to speed the deployment, \nor increase the number, of their long-range nuclear missiles; and\n  Third, strain our relations with allies and friends in Europe and \nAsia who recognize that the ABM Treaty has allowed nuclear arms \nreductions and has promoted stability for many decades.\n  Those reactions to a unilateral withdrawal from the treaty on our \npart would be serious because they could result in more nuclear \nwarheads on the territory of other nations and could lead to an \nincreased risk of the theft or proliferation of such warheads or their \nmaterials to rogue states or terrorists.\n  In addition, Russia and China could respond to unilateral United \nStates withdrawal from the ABM Treaty by producing, deploying, and \npossibly even selling missile defense countermeasures and decoys to our \npotential adversaries. A spiraling competition of countermeasures and \ncounter-countermeasures could then ensue.\n  I have believed for some time that these serious negative \nconsequences for our national security argued against our unilateral \nwithdrawal from the ABM Treaty, and I have long been concerned by the \nBush administration's unilateralist approach to this question.\n  As recently as August 23 of this year, for instance, President Bush \ndeclared, ``We will withdraw from the ABM Treaty on our timetable, at a \ntime convenient to America.''\n  Then came the horrific attacks of September 11. To its credit, the \nadministration then set out to build and sustain a broad international \ncoalition, which includes Russia, to fight terrorism. Despite its \nunilateralist go-it-alone approach so prevalent before those September \n11 attacks, the administration appears to have recognized that in a \nworld of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, the United States \nis more secure when we work cooperatively with allies and with nations \nwith whom we have common interests than we are if we go it alone.\n  We have already witnessed that welcome new approach to foreign policy \nin areas as diverse as the newfound support for South Korea's effort to \nimprove relations with North Korea, and in the administration's recent \nreversal and decision to join the international effort to improve the \nworldwide Biological Weapons Convention. This new approach has already \ninfluenced the administration's approach to national missile defense, \nthe ABM Treaty, and our relationship with Russia, with whom the \nPresident seeks a ``new strategic framework.''\n  At his October 11 press conference, the President twice avoided \ngiving direct answers to questions about whether he would unilaterally \nwithdraw from the ABM Treaty. The discussions between Presidents Bush \nand Putin in Shanghai gave some hope that the United States and Russia \ncan reach agreement on missile defense and reductions in offensive \nnuclear weapons.\n  Then, on October 25, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced \nthat the administration had ``decided not to go forward'' with missile \ndefense tests in late October and early November that might have \nviolated the ABM Treaty. That is a significant change because the \nadministration had said previously that we would not be constrained by \nthe ABM Treaty but, rather, we would withdraw from it.\n  Last week, we read in the newspapers that the United States and \nRussia are near agreement on an interim arrangement that would achieve \nthree things: No. 1, allow the administration to continue with its \nrobust program of missile defense research, development, and testing; \nNo. 2, preserve the ABM Treaty; and, No. 3, set goals for reducing by \nsome two-thirds the number of each nation's strategic nuclear warheads. \nThe story quoted one unnamed official as saying: ``Testing will go on, \nbut there will be no announcement of a U.S. withdrawal from the ABM \nTreaty.''\n  If the administration has, in fact, now decided not to unilaterally \ndismantle a mutual security structure before a new structure is put in \nplace, it would represent a wise shift in U.S. policy.\n  Presidents Bush and Putin would then have a genuine opportunity at \ntheir summit next week to make real progress towards a new security \narrangement that permits both missile defense testing and significant \nnuclear arms reductions, and that would have strong bipartisan support \nin Congress.\n  As I mentioned, on October 25, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld \nannounced that the Pentagon had decided not to proceed with four \nplanned missile defense test activities because they might conflict \nwith the ABM Treaty. But, in fact, prior to Secretary Rumsfeld's \nannouncement, the Pentagon had already decided to delay three of the \ntest activities for technical reasons wholly unrelated to the ABM \nTreaty. In addition, the fourth test planned for November 14 was not a \nmissile defense test, but a Navy radar tracking of a satellite launch \nvehicle, which is not covered by the ABM Treaty.\n  Confusing this history even further, back on June 13, LTG Ronald \nKadish, the Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, \nbriefed the Armed Services Committee on the Defense Department's \nmissile defense plans and informed the committee that, to the best of \nhis knowledge, there were no ballistic missile defense activities \nplanned for fiscal year 2002 that would be in conflict with the ABM \nTreaty.\n  Then, on July 17, Deputy Secretary of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz, \ntestified before our Armed Services Committee that three missile \ndefense activities could ``bump up'' against the ABM Treaty, in his \nwords, ``in months rather than in years.'' One of the examples was the \nuse of a Navy Aegis SPY-1 radar to track a strategic ballistic missile. \nHowever, his written explanation of that possibility said plainly:\n\n       Plans to use an Aegis SPY-1 radar to track long-range \n     ballistic missiles are currently under development and are \n     only at a preliminary stage.\n\n  So after saying there were no tests planned that would violate the \nABM Treaty, the administration then planned a series of tests that \nmight violate the treaty. Then they changed direction for a second time \non October 25 and said they would not proceed with tests that would \nviolate the ABM Treaty. So why did the administration first strain to \nput these tests on the calendar and then strain to remove them from the \ncalendar?\n  My analysis is shaped by my firm belief that the administration has \ndecided it would be unwise to withdraw from the ABM Treaty anytime \nsoon. In a number of ways, this double reversal in its course may help \nthe President at the upcoming summit, while simultaneously avoiding \ncriticism from those who have forcefully pressed for withdrawal from \nthe ABM Treaty.\n  First, the administration looks more reasonable to the American \npeople, the Russians, and the rest of the world, compared to their \nnumerous declarations that they plan to unilaterally withdraw from the \nABM Treaty. When the Secretary of Defense announced unilateral \nrestraint on October 25--that is, announcing that we would forego \nmissile defense testing in order to avoid violating the ABM Treaty--he \nmade us look more reasonable and that may help pave the way to reach an \nagreement with Russia on missile defense issues.\n  Second, the administration has simultaneously made the case that the \nU.S. missile defense testing program is already now being constrained \nby the ABM Treaty. This could make it easier to justify a decision to \nwithdraw from the treaty at a later time; in effect, to serve as a \nprelude to withdrawal in case there is no agreement with Russia.\n  Third, if, as expected, the administration reaches an agreement with \nRussia at the Crawford Summit that will permit its missile defense \ntesting program to proceed, the Rumsfeld announcement would allow the \nadministration to argue that the Crawford\n\n[[Page S11429]]\n\nagreement removed the ABM obstacle to the administration's missile \ndefense testing plans. That would appear to be a victory, showing the \ncritics of the treaty that the administration succeeded in clearing \naway the testing constraints in the ABM Treaty. That, in turn, would \nmake it easier politically for the administration to agree with Russia \nto maintain a treaty so loathed by those same critics and from which \nthose critics are pressing the President to withdraw.\n  If this tactic of straining to create premature conflict with the ABM \nTreaty and then straining to remove the conflict by deferring the tests \nhelps the administration reach an agreement with Russia and helps \nassure them of political support for the agreement from the critics of \nthe ABM Treaty, more power to them. If that is what it takes to do the \nright thing, so be it.\n  The important point is to work cooperatively with Russia to seek an \nagreement that will enhance our mutual security. It looks as if that is \nthe path we are on. I hope so, and I hope we can stay on it.\n  Also hopefully, any new arrangement that emerges from the upcoming \nsummit will be based on more than just the handshake of a gentleman's \nagreement. I hope the two leaders can agree on a new strategic \nframework that will include the following specific elements.\n  First, any agreement should include a reduction of strategic nuclear \nweapons--as the President has said--``to the lowest possible number \nconsistent with our national security.'' I agree with his assessment \nthat ``the premises of Cold War nuclear targeting should no longer \ndictate the size of our arsenals.''\n  I would also hope that any agreement on nuclear reductions would be \ntransparent, predictable and difficult to reverse. There is no benefit \nin creating a situation where we worry that it would be easy and quick \nfor either nation to increase its nuclear forces significantly. We \nwould be better served with an agreement that gives each side \nconfidence that its terms are being met by the other side, and cannot \neasily be reversed.\n  Congress should permit the President the flexibility to make these \nreductions. Current law prevents any reductions in our nuclear delivery \nsystems below the needlessly high START I level. President Bush and \nPresident Putin are essentially moving toward a START IV, but Congress \nis keeping us at a START I, Cold War level of nuclear forces. Our \nsenior uniformed military and civilian defense leaders have wanted \nCongress to remove these unnecessary restrictions for years. The Senate \nhas already acted in this year's Defense Authorization bill to remove \nthese restrictions, and I hope the House will accept the Senate \nposition in the conference now underway.\n  Second, the framework for a new security arrangement set forth by \nPresident Bush included the issue of reducing the risk of accidental or \nunauthorized launch of nuclear missiles. I would hope the two nations \nwill explore a variety of steps that can move us in a more stable \ndirection. There has already been good United States-Russian \ncooperation on data exchanges on missile launches, and we are improving \nour work on exchanging early warning data to reduce the risk of a false \nalert leading to a military crisis or a missile launch. We need to \nexpand our cooperation and make sure that neither side maintains \nunnecessary and potentially destabilizing nuclear postures or \npractices. For example, both sides could agree to deactivate nuclear \nweapon systems that are awaiting dismantlement. As President Bush \nstated, ``the United States should remove as many weapons as possible \nfrom high alert, hair-trigger status.''\n  Third, there is also a great need for enhanced and expanded \ncooperation on reducing the threats of proliferation. There is perhaps \nno more operationally effective and cost-effective means of reducing \nproliferation threats than assisting Russia in eliminating its nuclear \nand chemical weapons. Earlier this year, a task force led by former \nSenate Majority Leader Howard Baker and former White House Counsel \nLloyd Cutler concluded that ``the most urgent unmet national security \nthreat to the United States today is the danger that weapons of mass \ndestruction or weapons-usable material in Russia could be stolen and \nsold to terrorists or hostile nation states and used against American \ntroops abroad or citizens at home.'' I hope the two nations can \ncontinue to make great progress in this area, since much remains to be \ndone.\n  Finally, given the current anthrax attacks in the United States and \nour concerns about other potential biological terrorist attacks, we \nshould be working much more closely with Russian scientists who have \ngreat expertise in biological warfare defense. They may be able to help \nus develop better defenses and vaccines, and also help us with the \nanalysis of current biological threats. There is a unique and timely \nopportunity for major United States-Russian cooperation in this effort.\n  In short, I hope that President Bush and President Putin will be bold \nin their effort not just to bury the Cold War, but to forge a new \nalliance or a mutual security agreement against the terrorist menace \nthat threatens both our nations and the world.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow).

HICKS, OF NEVADA, TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT \n                    JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEVADA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session and proceed to the consideration of Executive \nCalendar No. 515, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Larry R. Hicks, of \nNevada, to be United States District Judge for the District of Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, time will be evenly \ndivided until 6 o'clock, and controlled between the chairman and \nranking member or their designees.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, my wife was kind enough to remind me that \n27 years ago today I was first elected to this body. I am not quite \nsure I knew at the time I was first elected what I might be doing here \ntoday.\n  I say to the distinguished Presiding Officer, when I took office, the \nSenate was comprised of 99 men, with one seat vacant because of a tied \nrace in New Hampshire. Madam President, I must say, both on my feelings \nas a Vermonter and as a Senator with some seniority, I am delighted to \nsee the changing face of the Senate that the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer, and many others, have brought to it.\n  We should, of course, have a far better balance of both men and women \nin this body, just as we have those who range across the political \nspectrum.\n  Today we will confirm another judicial nominee--actually our 13th \nsince July 20. Since becoming chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nafter the delay in Senate reorganization and assignment of Committee \nmembers, I have taken seriously the responsibility to fill these \nvacancies on the federal courts around the country with consensus \nnominees.\n\n  Larry Hicks is another candidate strongly supported by both of his \nhome State Senators. One of his home State Senators is the deputy \nleader among Democrats, the other a well-respected, strong Republican.\n  We have confirmed as many court of appeals judges as were confirmed \nin the entire first year of the Clinton administration in 1993--\nactually four more than the zero total confirmed by the Senate under \nother control in all of the 1996 session. We are moving forward.\n  I think we have hearings on five more judicial nominees this week. Of \nthese nominees, the ABA peer reviews on several were only completed and \nreceived last week.\n\n[[Page S11430]]\n\n  I remind the White House that we still have at least 10 or so \nnominees who do not have their ABA ratings here, having been nominated \non September 10 or thereafter. The consequences of the unilateral \nchanges that the Administration made in March to the procedures that \nhad governed the judicial confirmation process for more than 50 years \nare still being felt.\n  Others have not finished their paperwork. We are happy to help the \nWhite House with that.\n  In spite of the special circumstances that have arisen this year, we \nremain well ahead of the pace for the confirmation of judges during the \nfirst year of the first Bush administration and the first year of the \nClinton administration.\n  I wanted to take the floor to thank both Senator Reid and Senator \nEnsign for working so closely together to bring us someone with such \nstrong bipartisan support. I also thank Larry Hicks. I think the White \nHouse is well intentioned, but he was given poor advice on his \npaperwork and how to answer the written follow up questions after his \nhearing. After a quick phone call from Senator Reid to him, he \nimmediately faxed a letter to help complete his paperwork--the only \nthing holding up the nomination. I hope that will be an example to \nothers. It took about a 3-minute phone call and a fax, and we are done. \nI applaud both Senators for working this out.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, let me start by thanking the chairman of \nthe committee for moving this nomination forward. I also thank my \nfellow Senator, the distinguished Senator from the State of Nevada, for \nhis support in helping to move this nomination forward. This was my \nfirst chance as a brand new Senator to have input on one of the most \nimportant things we do as Senators, and that is give recommendations to \nthe President on who the Federal judges should be in our home States.\n  It is my pleasure this day to lend my support to a man of the highest \nlegal and personal distinction, Larry Hicks. A virtually lifelong \nnorthern Nevada resident, Mr. Hicks studied business administration at \nthe University of Nevada, Reno. While he left Nevada for a few years to \nreceive his legal education, Nevadans won't hold that against him, as \nwe did not yet have our law school. However, I am proud to say that \ntoday Nevadans no longer have to leave their home State to receive a \ndistinguished legal education, for the University of Nevada Las Vegas \nBoyd School of Law has rapidly become a recognized law school. He has \nused his legal aptitude to serve his community, his State, and the \nNation.\n  Immediately following graduation from law school, Mr. Hicks went to \nwork for one of Nevada's premier legal minds in the Washoe County \nDistrict Attorney's Office. Soon, Mr. Hicks was working full time to \nkeep northern Nevada streets safe in his capacity as the chief criminal \ndeputy DA, a position he filled for 3 years before being elected by a \nsubstantial margin to the office of district attorney. He held this \nposition for 4 years before entering private practice.\n  Mr. Hicks has been a partner in one of Nevada's largest law firms for \nover 20 years and has been chairman of its litigation section for the \npast 15. He is a fellow in the American College of Trial Lawyers, an \norganization which admits members by invitation only and is limited to \nno more than 1 percent of the lawyers in each State.\n  Mr. Hicks was on the Board of Governors for the State Bar of Nevada \nfor the better part of a decade, during which time he served in many \nroles, most notably as president during 1993-94. In the legal \ncommunity, to receive the Presidential nomination to a Federal \njudgeship is one of the highest honors. Mr. Hicks now has the honor of \nreceiving such a nomination twice. President George H.W. Bush nominated \nMr. Hicks to the Federal bench in 1992. Unfortunately, because of \nthings that happened in that political year, his nomination was never \nacted upon. But today, Larry has the historical distinction of being \nnominated by that President's son, President George W. Bush.\n  Mr. Hicks not only takes pride in his work as a fine legal mind but \nalso in his role as a husband and father. His three children have \ncarried on their father's Nevada tradition and received their degrees \nfrom his alma mater, the University of Nevada, Reno. In fact, Larry's \nson Christopher carried on in his father's legal footsteps and attended \nthe University of Nevada's Boyd School of Law.\n  Madam President, I know his wife Marianne and their children are \nproud of Larry, and I know Nevada is proud of Larry. Along with the \nsenior Senator from the State of Nevada, Harry Reid, I believe Larry \nHicks is someone who will make an outstanding judge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield such time to Senator Reid as he may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, first of all, I express my appreciation to \nmy friend from Nevada. Senator Ensign is a doctor, not a lawyer but he \ncould have not have picked anyone better than Larry Hicks. Larry Hicks \nis a fine lawyer. His brother is a lawyer. His brother Bud was my \nlawyer for a number of years when I was chairman of the Nevada Gaming \nCommission. He was an outstanding lawyer. They both have great \npersonalities. He will have a fine demeanor from the bench.\n  Larry Hicks has wanted this job for a long time. He was almost \nconfirmed before, but there was a change in administrations and a \nchange in the makeup of the Senate. Even though he had been cleared by \nthe White House, his name did not come forward. He has waited almost an \nadditional 10 years to be a judge. He will be an outstanding judge. He \nnow works for an outstanding firm. Some of the best lawyers in Nevada \nare part of the firm to which he belongs--McDonald, Carano, Wilson, \nMcCune, Bergin, Frankovich & Hicks. The State of Nevada and the country \nwill be better for having him serve.\n  I also appreciate my friend, Senator Ensign, running these names past \nme. I appreciate that very much. He and I have a relationship on judges \nthat I think works well. He has reached out to me. With somebody such \nas Larry Hicks, it is easy. I could not have chosen anyone better than \nLarry Hicks myself.\n  Again, I applaud and commend Senator Ensign for this choice.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back and the vote \nbegin now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  All time is yielded back. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Larry R. Hicks, of Nevada, to be United \nStates District Judge for the District of Nevada?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus), the \nSenator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nCorzine), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKerry), the Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu), the Senator from \nGeorgia (Mr. Miller), the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Torricelli), the \nSenator from Minnesota (Mr. Wellstone), and the Senator from Oregon \n(Mr. Wyden) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch), the \nSenator from Tennessee (Mr. Frist), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. \nMcCain), the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Smith), the Senator from Ohio \n(Mr. Voinovich), and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Brownback) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from Utah \n(Mr. Hatch), would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida).

Mr. President, I rise as if in morning business to \naddress an issue which has been debated at length on Capitol Hill since \nSeptember 11.\n  Since September 11, Americans have been focused on the issue of \naviation security. There is no question that the system we used to \ncross America to that date was deficient. Whether stronger aviation \nsecurity in our airports and around them might have averted that crisis \nis frankly unknown. But we all know that if we are going to be serious \nabout limiting the opportunities for violence and terrorism on \nAmerica's airlines we have to change the system in our airports.\n  Knowing that, we have taken a close look at the system of screening \nat our airports and the security that is available. Historically, the \nairlines were responsible for security in the airports. They would hire \nthe people who screened the passengers and the baggage. Of course, that \nsystem broke down. It broke down to the point that the General \nAccounting Office did a study and found there was a massive turnover of \nemployees working at screening stations in the airports.\n  The worst case on record was at St. Louis Lambert Airport. In 1 year, \nthere was over a 400-percent turnover in screening employees. We \nlearned that the people who were working in those positions were being \npaid slightly more than a minimum wage. They were looking out of the \ncorner of their eye for an opportunity at the local bakery or \nrestaurant in the airport where help might be wanted so they could move \nup in their career with limited training and limited pay.\n  As a consequence, we didn't have the kind of security in law \nenforcement which we should expect, particularly in light of September \n11.\n  In my hometown of Springfield and at many airports that I have gone \nthrough in Illinois, some of the people working in the current system \ncould not be more conscientious. They really take their jobs seriously. \nI want to give them credit where it is due.\n  But let's be honest. In the major airports and major cities, the \npeople who are attracted to these jobs are not the kind of people you \nwould hire off the street for a law enforcement responsibility. This is \nclearly law enforcement.\n  I was happy when the Senate debated this issue and came forward with \na bill. That was led by Senator Fritz Hollings, chairman of the \nCommerce Committee. It was also supported and cosponsored by his \ncolleague and ranking member, Senator John McCain of Arizona. In a \nbipartisan fashion, it came to the Senate floor and passed by 100-0. \nThat is rather unprecedented in this Chamber.\n  It was a unanimous vote to take this workforce in our airports and to \nsay once and for all that we will hire them and train them as law \nenforcement professionals. They will be under the Federal Government's \njurisdiction just as air traffic controllers are today. They will go \nthrough background checks. They will be subjected to training that is \nmeaningful. They will be closely supervised by law enforcement experts. \nThey will be held to national standards. That is what the Senate bill \ndid, 100-0.\n  More than 3 weeks ago, we sent that bill to the House of \nRepresentatives, asking them to respond in a timely fashion because of \nthe terrible problems in this industry and because of the fact that \nsome business travelers and families didn't want to get back on \nairplanes.\n  Three weeks later, the House finally brought it to a vote at the end \nof last week.\n  In the meantime, the House majority whip, Mr. Delay of Texas, and Mr. \nArmey, the majority leader in the House of Representatives, said they \nwere opposed to the Senate approach.\n  In the words of Mr. Armey: Using the Senate approach will create \n30,000 more union members who will work for the Federal Government.\n  I think that clearly told the story. That vote and that debate wasn't \nabout the merits of the issue. It was, sadly, about politics, and it \nshould not have been.\n  As a result, when it came up for a vote last week, the Senate version \nthat passed unanimously on a bipartisan fashion was rejected by the \nHouse of Representatives by four votes. The alternative that was \nbrought up for passage passed with a substantial margin. Now we are \nheaded to conference.\n  The difference between the two bills is substantial. The Senate would \ntake this workforce in the airports and hold them to Federal standards \nand Federal employment and hold them to supervision and training that \nis uniform across the Nation. The House makes it an option for any \nadministration to decide what they would choose in any given airport.\n  I believe that was a terrible decision by the House of \nRepresentatives. It is one that doesn't reflect the reality of what \nfamilies are thinking when they go to an airport and go to get on an \nairplane.\n  As one clear illustration of why the House approach to aviation \nsecurity is so bad, I want to tell you what happened at O'Hare \nInternational Airport in Chicago on Saturday evening.\n  A gentleman from Nepal came to the airport. His name is Subash \nGurung. He bought a ticket to fly from Chicago to Omaha. He went to \nboard a United Airlines flight and went through the screening station. \nWhen he walked through the metal detector, it went off. They searched \nhim and found that he was carrying two knives on his person. They took \nthe knives away, and he left the screening station--after they found \nhim with two knives. He took his bag and went to the gate.\n\n  At the gate, United Airlines employees, on a random basis, chose him \nto look at his bag. When they opened the bag, let me tell you what they \nfound. At the boarding gate, the man who had two knives on his person \nwhen he went through the screening vision had in his bag seven other \nknives, a stun gun, and a can of mace.\n  This man had gone through security and had been found to be armed \nwith dangerous weapons. His bag had gone through the screening device \nof the Argenbright firm that is in charge of the security at the \nairport. All of this was ignored. All of this slipped through. It was \nonly because of that last search at the gate that they found those \nweapons on this man.\n  There are those who believe that while looking at this situation we \ncan patch up the security system at American airports. I am not one of \nthem. I don't believe law enforcement should go to the low bidder. I \ndon't think the first line of defense against terrorism should be taken \non the cheek. That is\n\n[[Page S11432]]\n\nwhat is happening in the current system.\n  I might add that Argenbright and other firms have changed some of the \nways they are doing business. They used to pay these screeners $6.75 an \nhour at O'Hare. They have now raised that wage to $10 an hour. That is \na substantial increase. But they are still not attracting the people we \nneed to protect us and to protect everyone in America.\n  I am aware of a news story in Chicago that is going to come out with \nadditional information about the breakdown of the private screening \ncompanies in terms of the preparation of their employees since \nSeptember 11. I know of the story because they came to interview me \nlast week. They told me what they found. It is shocking and it is \ndisgraceful.\n  To think Members of the House of Representatives want us to take this \nflawed and failing system and say this is the best we can do in America \nis just plain wrong. The obvious question is, If there are going to be \nFederal employees at the airport, who is going to pay for them?\n  Let me suggest who is going to pay for them. The passengers on the \nairplanes. I don't think it is unreasonable that we would pay an \nadditional $5 as a security fee for a ticket so that we can have \nprofessional law enforcement at an airport not only screening \npassengers but protecting the perimeter around the airport, making \ncertain that once and for all we put a system in place that we can \ntrust.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these articles from the Chicago Tribune, \nthe Chicago Sun-Times and USA Today dated today, November 5, be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1)\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we know that private security contractors \nat airports can hire quickly. But we also know that with the turnover \nrates they have, they will have people who will come and go. That is \nnot in the best interest of law enforcement.\n  In your hometown, you would never delegate the protection of your \nneighborhood or your city to a contract employee. We bring people on \nwho are public servants, people who are dedicated to law enforcement, \nwho take the job seriously and accept the challenge of that job.\n  Since September 11, we have seen stories of heroes and heroines \nacross America, and so many times they have been public employees. \nThose firefighters who walked up the stairs in the World Trade Center, \ntrying to rescue people, giving their lives in the process, were public \nemployees. The men and women in law enforcement on the ground, who lost \ntheir lives as they stood at their post trying to help people evacuate, \nwere public employees. Many of the medical rescue workers were public \nemployees. Sadly, the postal employees who died over the last several \nweeks from the anthrax bioterrorism were public employees.\n  It is a reminder to all of us that so many of the men and women whom \nwe hold up in admiration and respect time and again for their \ndedication and courage since September 11 have been public employees.\n  I think the House approach to this problem is one that will not work. \nIt will not protect America; it will not protect our airports; and it \nwill not return people to our airlines, which we need to do so quickly.\n  I am going to urge Senator Hollings and all the Senate conferees to \nstand firm and stand fast on this issue. This is a critically important \nissue. We need to do this and do it right. To do it in a halfhearted \nfashion, as the House of Representatives has suggested, is not going to \nrestore the confidence of America's flying public.\n  It is important for every Member of the Senate to consider the \nexperience at O'Hare on Saturday night, when the current system, which \nthe House of Representatives wants to continue with some modifications \nand changes here and there, utterly failed and left vulnerable a lot of \nunsuspecting people who were just getting on an airplane for another \nflight from Chicago to Omaha. It is an important lesson to be learned.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, Nov. 5, 2001]\n\n       Airport Security: 7 O'Hare Screeners Suspended Over Lapse\n\n                   (By Tom McCann and Sean D. Hamill)\n\n       Seven O'Hare International Airport security workers were \n     suspended Sunday and are likely to be fired after they let a \n     Chicago man pass through a security checkpoint with seven \n     knives, a stun gun and a can of mace in his carry-on luggage, \n     according to city aviation officials.\n       The man was eventually stopped and the weapons were found \n     before he was able to board a plane Saturday. But the \n     incident, coming two days after the House rejected a plan \n     adopted by the Senate to federalize airport security workers, \n     in certain to stoke the debate over how to safeguard the \n     nation's airports.\n       Subash Gurung, 27, a native of Nepal, was arrested about \n     7:30 p.m. Saturday while waiting to board a United Airlines \n     flight to Omaha, said Chicago Department of Aviation \n     spokeswoman Monique Bond. Airport police said Gurung bought a \n     one-way ticket.\n       Airline employees discovered the weapons during a final bag \n     check at the gate, Bond said, part of new procedures that \n     several airlines have adopted since the Sept. 11 attacks.\n       But that was after two folding knives were discovered in \n     Gurung's pocket when he walked through a security checkpoint \n     metal detector, police said. Bond said the knives were \n     confiscated and police were summoned, but Gurung was allowed \n     to continue to his gate.\n       Meanwhile, his bag went through an X-ray machine, but the \n     security staff did not notice the knives or other weapons, \n     Bond said. A search of the bag wasn't conducted even after \n     the two knives were found, she said.\n       Bond would not say what led to the later search of Gurung's \n     bag.\n       ``Something obviously went seriously wrong here, and we're \n     trying to find out if it's the employees' fault or the \n     security company's fault,'' Bond said. ``If weapons were \n     confiscated, he should never have been let through \n     security.''\n       The Federal Aviation Administration and Chicago Department \n     of Aviation have both launched investigations into the \n     incident and will consider whether the employees should be \n     fired and whether United should pay a fine.\n       The suspended workers were all employees of Atlanta-based \n     Argenbright Security Inc., the company that runs United's \n     screening operations at O'Hare. Three veteran employees were \n     working the checkpoint alongside three trainees, said FAA \n     spokeswoman Elizabeth Isham Cory. The employees' supervisor \n     was also suspended.\n       ``We commend all our employees who acted to apprehend this \n     man,'' said United spokesman Joe Hopkins. ``They did an \n     excellent job.''\n       Despite heightened airport security in the aftermath of the \n     attacks, the lapse on Saturday wasn't the first. Last month, \n     a passenger on a Southwest Airlines flight accidentally \n     brought a gun aboard a plane in his briefcase.\n       Lawmakers agree steps are still needed to improve baggage \n     and passenger screening, but the House and Senate remain \n     divided about how best to achieve that goal.\n       The Senate has approved a measure that would make security \n     screeners federal employees. The House version adopted \n     Thursday increased federal oversight of the 28,000 screeners, \n     but stopped short of federalizing them.\n       ``If the system can't detect a knife and a stun gun in \n     luggage, then you have to ask yourself whether the people are \n     doing their job right,'' said U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), \n     who supports the Senate bill that gives the Justice \n     Department responsibility for airport security.\n       ``I think the technology works, but you can't pay someone \n     minimum wage and ask them to act as a law enforcement officer \n     on the front line fighting terrorism,'' said Durbin at a news \n     conference Sunday, in which he also proposed legislation to \n     allow federal agencies to share classified information with \n     local police.\n       Gurung was charged with three misdemeanor counts of \n     unlawful use of a weapon, attempting to board an aircraft \n     with dangerous weapons and carrying dangerous weapons. A \n     spokeswoman for the Cook County state's attorney's office \n     said the case was still being evaluated and more serious \n     charges could be brought.\n       Gurung was released early Sunday on $1,000 bail and is \n     scheduled to appear in court Dec. 19. He was questioned by \n     the FBI, who turned him over to Chicago police.\n       Gurung could not be reached for comment Sunday. In comments \n     to WLS-Ch. 7, he said ``It just happened out of accident, in \n     a hurry.''\n       He said he has worked in a warehouse but was presently \n     unemployed.\n       Gurung recently moved back to Chicago with his brother, \n     Sushil, from Minnesota, said Adam Colfax, superintendent for \n     the apartment building in the 5700 block of North Kenmore \n     Avenue where the Gurung brothers lived until a year ago.\n       Colfax said Gurung previously lived in an apartment at 1025 \n     W. Hollywood Ave., where Ayub Ali Khan once lived. Khan has \n     been detained by authorities as a material witness in the \n     Sept. 11 attacks but it is unclear whether he knew Gurung.\n\n[[Page S11433]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                     [From USA Today, Nov. 5, 2001]\n\n                  Why Rely on Low-Bid Airport Safety?\n\n                           (By Paul C. Light)\n\n       Now that the House has passed its own airport-security \n     bill, the stage is set for a showdown with the Senate over \n     who gets the 28,000 jobs. The Senate wants federal employees \n     at the baggage machines, while the House wants private \n     contractors.\n       President Bush also favors private contractors. Only days \n     after he expressed his appreciation to federal employees for \n     ``your dedication and integrity, your commitment to \n     excellence and your love of our country,'' Bush was lobbying \n     hard to prevent passage of a measure that would have set up a \n     new federal workforce of airport screeners.\n       The Bush administration, facing a civil-service system that \n     is slow on the hiring, weak on the firing, poor on the \n     training and sluggish on the disciplining, believes there is \n     no other choice. As Bush has explained, the House bill \n     provides the ``quickest, most effective way to increase \n     aviation security,'' particularly by ensuring ``that security \n     managers can move aggressively to discipline or fire \n     employees who fail to live up to the rigorous new \n     standards.''\n       Bush's support for a contract workforce crystallizes the \n     problems facing the federal civil service. On the one hand, \n     federal employees would almost certainly do a better job at \n     airport security. According to recent surveys of federal and \n     private employees by the Brookings Institution's Center for \n     Public Service, a federal security service would be motivated \n     more by the job's challenge and the public good, and less by \n     pay. Federal employees would be more satisfied with benefits \n     and job security, and therefore less like to leave.\n       On the other hand, federal workers would be less likely \n     than private employees to get the tools, training and \n     technologies to do their jobs well. They would be hampered by \n     a disciplinary process that their peers believe does little \n     to address poor performance, and would join a workforce that \n     is under-resourced, over-reformed and generally demoralized \n     by a half-century of pay and hiring freezes.\n       New employees would be joining a federal workforce that is \n     under duress. Three out of five federal workers told the \n     Brookings center that their organizations only sometimes or \n     rarely have the staff needed to perform well. Many believe \n     the past few years of reinventing government made their jobs \n     harder. And the vast majority say the federal hiring system \n     is slow and confusing; a quarter refuse to call it fair.\n       The question is not whether federal employees often succeed \n     against the odds; they do. Rather, the question is whether \n     the federal government can find a private workforce that can \n     outperform federal employees on anything other than fast \n     hiring and firing.\n       The answer is mixed at best.\n       Private airport-security contractors can hire quickly, but \n     they're poor at retaining. From 1998 to 1999, turnover among \n     private contractors at the 19 largest U.S. airports averaged \n     126%, topped 200% at five and hit 416% at Lambert-St. Louis \n     International.\n       Private contractors also have trouble complying with \n     existing regulations. Just last year, one of the largest \n     contractors, Argenbright Security, was fined more than $1 \n     million for assigning new employees to its screening check-\n     points in Philadelphia without background checks or an audit \n     system to detect what the U.S. attorney's office called ``the \n     astonishing and widespread criminal activities that occurred \n     in this case.''\n       In the best of all worlds, private contractors would hire \n     and supervise federal employees, avoiding an awful civil-\n     service hiring and firing system that hasn't been reformed in \n     decades. But given a choice between the two workforces, \n     federal employees should get the job. No matter how stringent \n     the oversight, airport security is too important to consign \n     to the lowest bidder. That is how the security function fell \n     into disrepair in the first place.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Nov. 5, 2001]\n\n                        Coping With New Tensions\n\n\n                     O'Hare arrest tied to terror?\n\n                            (By Susan Dodge)\n\n       A Nepalese man arrested at O'Hare Airport over the weekend \n     with several knives, a stun gun and a can of Mace gave police \n     the same home address that belonged to a suspect questioned \n     in the Sept. 11 terrorist hijacking investigation.\n       But authorities were vague on whether there was any \n     connection between Subash Gurung, who was arrested Saturday \n     night at O'Hare, and Ayub Ali Khan, who is being held as a \n     material witness to the attacks. Khan was one of two men with \n     box cutters taken into federal custody Sept. 12 on a San \n     Antonio-bound Amtrak train.\n       ABC-7 reported Sunday night that Gurung was being \n     questioned for a second time by FBI officials.\n       He listed 1025 W. Hollywood, a Chicago apartment building, \n     as his home address. Khan is believed to have lived at the \n     same address for a time, authorities said. Khan, 34, is being \n     held in a federal detention center in New York City.\n       Seven O'Hare Airport security workers--including a \n     supervisor--who allegedly let Gurung pass through their \n     checkpoint were fired Sunday, Chicago Aviation Department \n     spokeswoman Monique Bond said.\n       Gurung was within minutes of boarding a United flight to \n     Omaha, Neb., Saturday night when the stunning security breach \n     was detected by airline employees who searched his carry-on \n     bag, where the weapons were located, officials said.\n       Security officials confiscated two knives at a security \n     check-point, but Gurung made it to the boarding gate with \n     seven other knives, a stun gun and Mace in his carry-on, said \n     Bond.\n       Police Supt. Terry Hillard and Thomas J. Kneir, head of the \n     local FBI office, spoke about Gurung's arrest but decided \n     they could not charge him with a federal crime ``because he \n     didn't board an airplane,'' said Chicago police spokesman \n     David Bayless.\n       Gurung was arrested Saturday and charged with three \n     misdemeanors: unlawful use of a weapon, attempting to board \n     an aircraft with a weapon and carrying a dangerous weapon, \n     said Chicago Police Officer Matthew Jackson, a department \n     spokesman.\n       Exactly how did the 27-year-old Edgewater resident make it \n     through the terminal checkpoint, which supposedly is more \n     secure since the terrorist attacks?\n       ``That's the million-dollar question,'' Bond said Sunday.\n       Equally uncertain was why Gurung was allegedly carrying the \n     items.\n       The Federal Aviation Administration, the city's aviation \n     department and United Airlines all were investigating the \n     security breach.\n       United gate employees checked Gurung's carry-on bag as a \n     random bag search, part of the airline's enhanced security \n     measures, said United spokesman Joe Hopkins.\n       Gurung was questioned by the FBI and then released on bond \n     early Sunday, police said. The FBI declined to comment \n     Sunday, referring all questions to police.\n       Gurung 27, told police that he's unemployed and originally \n     from Nepal. He is scheduled to appear in court Dec. 19.\n       The breach was the latest by Argenbright Security Inc., \n     which operates the checkpoint for United and has been roundly \n     criticized for lax security and hiring workers with criminal \n     backgrounds.\n       It came as Congress debated how to tighten airport \n     security. The security lapse bolsters the case for making \n     airport security workers federal employees, who would be \n     higher paid and better trained, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin \n     said, adding, ``You can't do it on the cheap.''\n       But House Republican leaders argue that federalizing the \n     security would expand bureaucracy and make it tougher to fire \n     bad workers. House and Senate officials are expected to come \n     up with compromise legislation on airport security.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for S. 1267, the Visa Entry Reform Act of 2001. I am pleased to \nbe an original cosponsor and to have contributed to the drafting of \nthis important immigration control measure.\n  This bill will help America get back control of our borders. Illegal \nimmigration has long been a serious problem in our country. Census data \nindicates that there are now about 7 or 8 million illegal aliens in the \nUnited States, and the problem is getting worse. This is at least \ndouble the number of illegals that were here in 1990.\n  The terrorist attacks of September 11 have demonstrated how dangerous \nit can be for us to fail to know who is coming into our country. Of the \n19 men who apparently hijacked the commercial airliners on September \n11, the Director of Immigration and Naturalization Service last month \ntestified that his agency had no record of how some of them came to the \nUnited States.\n  The legislation would create one centralized database of all \nnoncitizens. It would be updated as aliens entered and left the United \nStates through a modern system of quickly swiping a card at border \ncrossings.\n  Also, the database would be integrated with law enforcement and \nintelligence information so that all relevant agencies could share and \nhave access to critical data. Morever, all airlines, cruise ships, and \ncross-border bus lines would have to submit passenger manifests prior \nto departure so that foreigners could be pre-screened on the database \nbefore their arrival.\n  This bill would help address the rampart problem of document fraud, \nespecially for immigration documents. It would require that all Federal \nidentification and immigration papers, including visas and social \nsecurity cards,\n\n[[Page S11434]]\n\nbe fraud and tamper-resistant. Using modern technology, immigration \ndocuments would have to contain biometric data, such as photographs and \nfingerprints.\n  Further, the legislation would impose greater controls on foreigners \nwho are here on student visas. It is noteworthy that, according to \nmedia reports, one of the hijackers from September 11 came into this \ncountry on a student visa but did not attend classes. This bill would \nhelp prevent this problem by requiring schools to report quarterly to \nthe INS on the student's classes and whether he or she had problems \nwith law enforcement during that period. If a foreign student dropped \nout, or failed to register or attend classes, the school would be \nrequired to notify the INS immediately. Further, background checks \nwould have to be conducted prior to visas being issued, and additional \nbackground checks could be done when visas were renewed. The increased \ngovernment costs for the student reforms would be paid in part through \nincreased application fees for foreign students.\n  Anther important provision would prohibit any visas from being issued \nfor students from terrorist countries. While this is a significant \nfirst step, I believe we need to go further in the future and prohibit \nany visas from being issued to terrorist nations, except for limited \nrefugee and humanitarian reasons.\n  One provision of the bill that was included at my request requires a \nGeneral Accounting Office study on returning to annual registration of \naliens. Annual registration is needed to determine whether temporary \naliens are actually here for the reasons they were authorized to enter, \nsuch as attend school. This was a World War II-era program that was \nessentially abandoned about twenty years ago, although the Attorney \nGeneral maintains the authority to require any classes or groups to \nregister. I believe this reform could be very beneficial to our \nsecurity. The terrorism threat we face today is no less serious than \nthe more conventional wars we fought in the past.\n  I would also like to note a related problem. Increasing penalties for \nillegal immigration has little meaning if the laws are not followed. In \na hearing which I chaired in the last Congress in the Criminal Justice \nOversight Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, we showed \nthat many criminals, especially illegal aliens at the Southwest Border, \nare routinely being sentenced far below what the law requires. To \ncontrol the huge number of cases on the dockets in many border states, \nmany defendants are being sentenced far below the ranges established in \nthe Sentencing Guidelines in exchange for guilty pleas. Often, guilty \npleas are for charges much less serious than the government could \nprovide in court.\n  To address this problem, we need to increase judicial and related \nresources in these areas. We should increase the number of authorized \njudgeships at the Southwest Border, which has already been proposed, \nand the Senate should quickly consider judicial nominations from the \nPresident for existing vacancies in these areas. Also, these areas have \ninconsistent policies, and the Justice Department needs to work with \nthese districts to create consistency. It is critical that we strictly \nenforce the immigration laws that are already on the books.\n  We need to do more this year to address the growing threat of illegal \nimmigration. This bill is an important part of that effort, and I \nencourage my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/05/senate-section/article/S11434-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11434-S11435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. FRED SAALFELD\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the professional \ndedication, vision and public service of Dr. Fred Saalfeld who is \nretiring from the Senior Executive Service, SES, where he serves as \nExecutive Director and Technical Director of the U.S. Navy Office of \nNaval Research, ONR. It is a privilege for me to recognize the many \noutstanding achievements he has provided the Office of Naval Research, \nthe Navy, and our great Nation.\n  In times of adversity and challenge, America has always been blessed \nwith men and women who have stepped forward to fight our battles and \nserve our country. Dr. Fred Saalfeld is such a man, much like those \nFounding Fathers who were patriot scientists and dedicated public \nservants. I wish we had more like him.\n  The foundation of his professional career was laid at Southeast \nMissouri State University where he earned a B.S. degree cum laude with \nmajors in Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics in 1957 and was a standout \nintercollegiate basketball player as well. Fred Saalfeld matriculated \nto Iowa State University, where he earned his M.S. in 1959 and Ph.D. in \n1961, majoring in Physical Chemistry, with minors in Inorganic \nChemistry and Mathematics.\n  Dr. Saalfeld joined the Naval Research Laboratory, NRL, in 1962, \nwhere he conducted and directed research in physical chemistry. From \n1963 to 1976, he headed the Mass Spectrometry Section and later, the \nPhysical Chemistry Branch. His research led to innovations in \natmospheric monitoring and life support now widely used in nuclear \nsubmarines, firefighting gear, spacecraft and other equipment using \nrecirculated air. In 1976, he was selected as Superintendent of the NRL \nChemistry Division, where he directed programs involving approximately \n250 chemists and a $16 million budget. Dr. Saalfeld was selected as \nChief Scientist and Scientific Director at the ONR Branch Office in \nLondon for the period 1979 to 1980. He returned to NRL from this \nspecial assignment. By 1982, he was Associate Director of Research for \nMaterial Sciences and Component Technology, involving over 600 \nscientists and a $90 million budget.\n  Dr. Saalfeld was appointed Director of ONR's Research Department in \n1982 and Associate Director of ONR in 1985. He was responsible for the \nNavy's $220 million contract research program mostly aimed at basic \nresearch in American universities. From 1987 until 1993, Dr. Saalfeld \nwas Director of ONR, responsible for the Navy's basic research and NRL. \nIn 1993, he was appointed Technical Director of ONR and Deputy Chief of \nNaval Research. The title changed to Executive Director and Technical \nDirector in 1998. As such, Dr. Saalfeld became responsible for the Navy \nand Marine Corps science and technology program. In effect, Dr. \nSaalfeld was the Chief Operating Officer of the Office of Naval \nResearch, a ``Department of Navy Corporation,'' including a budget of \nnearly $2 billion and oversight of three international offices and the \nrenowned national laboratory, the Naval Research Laboratory.\n  Dr. Saalfeld became a charter member of the Senior Executive Service, \nSES, under President Carter. President Reagan named him to the \nPresidential Meritorious Executive Rank in 1986, named to the \nPresidential Distinguished Executive Rank by President Bush in 1989, \nand Presidential Distinguished Executive Rank for a second time by \nPresident Clinton in 1996.\n  Dr. Saalfeld has been awarded Department of the Navy Meritorious, \nSuperior and Distinguished Civilian Service Awards, and the Department \nof Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Award. In addition, Dr. \nSaalfeld has been recognized with the Captain Robert Dexter Conrad \nAward, the Navy's highest award for scientific achievement. He has won \nthe Southeast Missouri State University Alumni Merit Award in 1988, \nbeen recognized by Washington Technology as one of the area's top \ntechnologists in 1989, and selected by the Federal Executive Institute \nas Federal Executive of the Year in 1991.\n  During his long and exemplary career, Dr. Saalfeld authored and co-\nauthored more than 500 research papers, reports and presentations. He \nis active in scientific societies, including the Society for Applied \nSpectroscopy, the American Society for Mass Spectrometry, and the \nAmerican Chemical Society. He is a fellow of the American Association \nfor the Advancement of Science, served as Secretary of the American \nSociety for Mass Spectrometry, and served as President of the Chemical \nSociety of Washington.\n  I could go on and on about the contributions made by Dr. Saalfeld \nthroughout his long and distinguished career. There are almost too many \nto recount. I have in mind not only his professional, technical and \nscientific attainments and achievements, but also the courage with \nwhich he faces personal challenges, and the easy grace with which he \nwins friends. For Dr. Fred Saalfeld considers the entire community of \nmilitary personnel, civilian employees and contractors who serve\n\n[[Page S11435]]\n\nat ONR headquarters, at the NRL, and ONR offices and facilities \nthroughout the world to be his family. He supported their research, \nprovided opportunities to exercise initiative in diverse scientific \nfields, and championed their achievements. But most importantly, he has \nbeen friend, counselor, and mentor to many hundreds of people in the \nNavy and scientific communities.\n  Dr. Saalfeld's most lasting legacy may not be his own discoveries, \nand may not even those that took place under his direction and \nsupervision, although that record would be a great legacy for any \nperson. His most lasting legacy may be achievements in science and \ntechnology that take place in the future, realized by scientists \nencouraged to serve the Navy and their country by following the example \nof Dr. Fred Saalfeld. Dr. Saalfeld has spent four decades ensuring our \nnation and its naval forces have been equipped with technological \nsupremacy to ensure victory over America's enemies. As America enters \nthe 21st Century and faces new and unsettling changes, the scientific \ndiscoveries and technological achievements Dr. Saalfeld has nurtured \nwill continue to ensure our strength and freedom.\n  There are many impressive scientists and leaders in technological \ninnovation in America. It is a feature that keeps America a global \nleader and a prosperous, secure society. There are few who have \ndedicated their lives to ensuring that we make necessary investments to \nguarantee future leadership. Fred Saalfeld is one who has exhibited \nthis dedication. In the university and federal research community, Dr. \nSaalfeld is a living legend and the ``soul of federal research \ninvestment.''\n  We in the Senate wish Dr. Saalfeld all the best in his future \nendeavors, with fair winds and following seas as he sets off to address \nnew challenges and makes even more contributions to this land of \nliberty. May God continue to bless Fred Saalfeld, his loving wife Liz, \nand the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/05/senate-section/article/S11435-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to thank the managers of this bill \nfor including $1.25 million for the Congressional Cemetery in the \nfiscal year 2002 legislative branch appropriations bill. I particularly \nwant to recognize the good work of Chairman Durbin and Carrie Apostolou \nof his staff for their efforts to include funding for repairs and \nupgrades to the Congressional Cemetery. I also appreciate the \nassistance I have received from the Architect of the Capitol and the \nCongressional Cemetery Association as I have worked with my colleagues \nto secure this funding.\n  Earlier this year, I spoke on the floor of the Senate about the need \nfor some funding to make some repairs to the Congressional Cemetery \neast of Capitol Hill. The cemetery has fallen into some disrepair over \nthe years and it is in some ways a rather forlorn place. When I spoke \non this issue last April, I asked my colleagues to find the resources \nto restore dignity to our Congressional Cemetery. I am very pleased \nthat this bill contributes to this effort.\n  My interest in this funding began after seeing a Library of Congress \nexhibit on the Congressional Cemetery. In particular, I became \ninterested in learning more about the Native Americans who are buried \nin that cemetery and through research, I came across the name of \nScarlet Crow. Scarlet Crow, a member of the Wahpeton-Sisseton Sioux \nTribe, died in Washington, DC, under mysterious circumstances in 1867, \nand was buried in the Congressional Cemetery.\n  So I visited the cemetery last spring to locate his tombstone. This \nvisit prompted me to ask my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee for this funding, and I am very pleased with their response.\n  It is my hope that this funding will honor the memory of Scarlet Crow \nby restoring dignity to his final resting place. This funding is a \ntribute to this dedicated Native American, Scarlet Crow, whose life \ncame to such a tragic and untimely end in our Nation's Capital.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/05/senate-section/article/S11435-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HOLD TO H.R. 3211\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to inform my colleagues \nthat I have lodged an objection to the Senate proceeding to H.R. 3211 \nor any other legislation dealing with financial netting contracts \ninside and outside of bankruptcy.

Mr. President, I come before you today speaking \nnot simply for myself, but on behalf of the countless thousands of \npeople who have frequented Sholl's Cafeteria in the seventy years since \nit opened. It is easy enough to use the word ``served'' when speaking \nof what almost any restaurant does; when speaking about Sholl's, \nthough, the word takes on a very special and unique meaning.\n  The history of Sholl's here in Washington is one of community, great \nfood, and a deep caring for all patrons. Aside from established prices \nthat afford nearly everyone an opportunity to enjoy a hot meal, Sholl's \nalso has a policy of never turning away a hungry person. As Sholl's \nfights against modern economics in hopes of staying alive, it is \nessential that we rally to help this great institution.\n  At this time I ask to have printed in the Record a letter from Jim \nMcGrath to the Washington Post which I believe helps shed more light on \nwhat this establishment means to Washington and its citizens.\n  The letter follows.\n\n       As the nation mobilizes to combat the insidious foe of \n     terrorism, another drama of a far different kind and scope is \n     playing itself out in downtown Washington--the struggle for \n     survival of Sholl's Cafeteria. Despite heroic sacrifice and \n     Herculean labors by many--most notably its beloved \n     proprietors, George and Van Fleishell--absent a substantial \n     financial remedy, Sholl's will be forced to close its door as \n     soon as Oct. 31.\n       The Sholl's story could easily get lost amid the tumult of \n     our national preoccupation and suffering in the wake of \n     September 11, but that would be a profound shame, because the \n     cafeteria's story has been one of special triumphs: of old-\n     fashioned, all-American food, wonderfully prepared and \n     wonderfully served; of human pricing, so that nearly anyone \n     can afford to eat there; of multiculturalism, with terrific \n     employees, many there for generations, reflecting every \n     spectrum of the human family; of kindness, with an atmosphere \n     that welcomes everyone. It is a story of the triumph of \n     charity, Sholl's has given away enough free food to feed an \n     army 100 times over. During the past several years, however, \n     Sholl's has suffered from the decline in downtown dining. Its \n     tour-bus trade has eroded because of the weak economy. It has \n     endured bus-unfriendly parking restrictions. It has had to \n     deal with prolonged building renovation and reconstruction \n     while paying a huge rent. It has been put through the \n     economic wringer.\n       Now another mobilization is needed to save this beloved \n     institution. I am not alone in expressing those sentiments. \n     They have been voiced by many, from the high and the mighty \n     to the mighty humble. They have come from legions of senior \n     citizens, bus loads of squealing kids and homeless people.\n       On August 10, 1999, for example, the World Bank wrote to \n     the cafeteria's owners: ``You are correct to characterize \n     Sholl's as a charitable landmark. It would be a significant \n     loss to our neighborhood if you were to close your doors, \n     particularly for the large number of senior citizens, young \n     kids, disabled and homeless people whom you serve.''\n       On July 8, 1998, U.S. Sen. Max Cleland of Georgia read into \n     the Congressional Record, ``Patrons of Sholl's have described \n     members of the Sholl family, who have owned and operated \n     Sholl's over the last 70 years, as having the biggest hearts \n     in Washington.''\n       On March 7, 1999, Mike Kirwan, the late, great apostle to \n     the homeless, said, ``The stories I've heard from people on \n     the streets, their quiet moments of dignity, respect, warmth \n     and a full and nourishing meal at the hands of this wonderful \n     cafeteria could fill a book of essays.''\n       Possibly, the one who said it best, though, was a child \n     who, on arrival from Pennsylvania on a school bus, told a \n     WTOP reporter, ``If it weren't for Sholl's Cafeteria, we \n     couldn't afford to come to Washington.''\n       The hour is late, and the odds are long. Although some say \n     the time for Sholl's has\n\n[[Page S11436]]\n\n     past, I profoundly disagree, and I hope others do too. Long \n     live Sholl's Cafeteria.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/05/senate-section/article/S11436-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMENDING THE SERVICE OF NORTHEAST-MIDWEST INSTITUTE BOARD MEMBER \n                              STEVE ADAMS\n\n Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred June 18, 1993 \nin Auburn, AL. A gay man allegedly was taunted and beaten at a \nrestaurant. The assailant, Wayne Johnson, was convicted of harassment, \nfined $100 plus court costs and given a 30-day suspended sentence.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/05/senate-section/article/S11436-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/05/senate-section/article/S11436-4", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/05/senate-section/article/S11436-5", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2001, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on November 2, 2001, during the recess of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 2311.

A bill to provide farmers with better prices and higher \nprofits through the marketplace; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Farm Income \nRecovery Act. Its objective is to produce better prices and higher \nprofits through the marketplace. It thus addresses the principal \nfailures of the current farm law, the so-called Freedom to Farm bill \nwhich was passed by the Congress in 1996.\n  Freedom to Farm has, unfortunately, contributed to disastrously low \nmarket prices for agricultural commodities. Congress has thus been \nforced to appropriate disastrously high taxpayer subsidies in order to \nsave American farmers from bankruptcy.\n  Mr. President, Freedom to Farm was conceived with a laudable goal--to \nget the Federal Government out of agriculture. Farmers were free to \nplant whatever crops they chose, and commodities supports were then to \nbe phased out during the life of the legislation. Unfortunately, U.S. \ndomestic farm prices collapsed in the aftermath of Freedom to Farm.\n  In October 1996, just before the Freedom to Farm legislation began, \nthe price of a bushel of soybeans in Minnesota, my home State, was \n$6.84. In October of 2001, just last month, the price of that same \nbushel of soybeans was $4.05. In October of 1996, a bushel of corn \nbrought Minnesota farmers $2.68. In October of 2001, it was only $1.60. \nThe price of a bushel of wheat fell during those same 5 years from \n$4.27 to $3.\n  In order to prop up farm income, Federal payments have soared during \nthese 5 years. Last year, total Federal payments for all of agriculture \ntotaled nearly $30 billion--by far, a record high--which almost equaled \ntotal net farm income. In other words, without Federal subsidies, there \nwould be no net profit in American agriculture. Clearly, we must find \nanother strategy, and that is the enormous task confronting the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, on which I am proud to serve.\n  Our distinguished chairman, Senator Harkin, and the previous \nchairman, now our ranking member, Senator Lugar, have held many \nworthwhile hearings throughout this year. Just about every farm \norganization has testified. My colleague from Minnesota, Senator Paul \nWellstone, also a member of the Agriculture Committee, and I have held \nfield hearings throughout Minnesota. Additionally, both of us have held \nmany meetings with groups of farmers, producers, and processors \nthroughout our State.\n\n  The product of all of the hearings, meetings, and discussions with \nMinnesota farmers is, for me, this Farm Income Recovery Act. As I said \nbefore, its objective is to help produce higher prices in the U.S. \ndomestic commodity markets so that farmers can earn real profits, thus \nreducing or eliminating the need for Government subsidies. That is the \nbest way to reduce the costs of farm programs--to reduce the need for \nthem. And until we restore market prices to profitable levels, our \nchoice will continue to be between either more subsidies or more \nbankruptcies.\n  My Farm Income Recovery Act has four major components. The first is \nhigher loan rates: $3.88 for wheat, $2.40 for corn, $5.36 for a bushel \nof soybeans, $2.40 for sorghum, $2.40 for barley, $60.65 a \nhundredweight for cotton, and $8.61 a hundredweight for rice.\n  Secondly, it targets these higher loan rates, limiting them to \ncertain amounts of production. It does not prevent farmers from \nproducing more and more, but it says that we are going to limit these \nnonrecourse market loans to certain levels of production, which are set \nforth in the legislation. If a farmer wants to get bigger, wants to \nproduce more and more of these commodities, he or she is certainly \nentitled to do so, but then they are on their own. The amount of \nproduction above these levels is subject to recourse loans, which have \nto be repaid with interest to the Federal Government. This means if the \nproducers who want to get larger and larger decide to do so, they are \nnot then going to be dependent upon the taxpayers of America; they are \ngoing to be standing on their own.\n  Third, it establishes commodity reserves in order to help control the \nsupply and, thus, help farmers decide at what prices they want to sell \ntheir commodities. It re-establishes a farmer-owned reserve program, \nwhich was one of the best features of previous farm legislation and \nwhich was one of the unfortunate casualties of the 1996 farm bill.\n  It establishes a humanitarian food reserve fund through the Federal \nGovernment, through which the Federal Government can hold food \ncommodities in reserve for the kinds of humanitarian efforts we see \nunderway today in Afghanistan.\n  It sets up a renewable energy reserve--which ties in nicely with \nanother important feature of the farm bill which Senator Harkin has \nchampioned over the years and in our discussions of the last few \nmonths, alternative and renewable fuels in our country--to really boost \nthe Federal incentives and support for ethanol, soy diesel, another \npromising biofuel which I have introduced other legislation to promote.\n  As we encourage the use of these alternative and renewable fuels in \nour country, we are going to need to hold food commodities in reserve \nso we can assure consumers that there are going to be sufficient \nresources. We may reach the day in this country where we have such \ndemand for ethanol and for soy diesel, that we need to go into this \nGovernment-held energy reserve in order to generate the additional \nsupplies necessary to meet that demand. Not only would that be good for \nour oil independence, it would be a great contribution to a cleaner \nenvironment. It would boost domestic prices for corn, soybeans, and for \nother commodities that can be used for either ethanol or soy diesel \nproduction in ways that would, again, stimulate our domestic markets \nand reduce the need for taxpayer subsidies.\n  Finally, the Farm Income Recovery Act establishes a voluntary program \nthat, in periods of increased supply, will allow the Secretary of \nAgriculture to raise these loan rates for farmers who voluntarily set \naside a certain percentage of their acreage for conservation; thus, in \ncombination with our existing conservation programs, it will encourage \nbetter conservation practices by farmers, again, through positive \nmarketplace incentives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of my \nlegislation, as well as the actual legislation, be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1629\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 101.

The production management program may be \n     announced when the Secretary determines that the estimated \n     total supply of loan commodities for the next crop year, in \n     the absence of such a program, will be excessive taking into \n     account the need for an adequate carryover to maintain \n     reasonable and stable supplies and prices and to meet a \n     national emergency.\n       ``(c) Acreage Defined.--Inventory management acreage must \n     be acreage that either--\n       ``(1) has previously been under a production flexibility \n     contract, or\n       ``(2) was previously planted an eligible loan commodities \n     for at least three of the last five years.\n       ``(d) Conservation Uses.--Inventory management acreage \n     shall be devoted to approved conservation and wildlife uses, \n     as defined by the Secretary. Adequate safeguards from weeds, \n     and wind, soil, and water erosion must be provided.\n       ``(e) Acreage Options.--If announced, the inventory \n     management program shall offer the producer a range of \n     acreage participation options. Under such a program, the \n     Secretary shall offer producers the option to set-aside 5 \n     percent, 10 percent, 15 percent, or 20 percent of total \n     commodity acreage. Total program acreage shall include \n     applicable inventory management acres from the previous \n     crop year.\n       ``(f) Incentive Defined..--\n       ``(1) The incentive offered by the Secretary for agreement \n     to forgo production on a specified percentage of loan \n     commodity production acres shall be an increase in the \n     marketing loan rates for eligible commodities for the \n     individual producer in an amount that is equal to one half of \n     the percentage of the percentage inventory management or \n     acreage option selected under subsection (e).\n       ``(2) The increase in the marketing loan rate for an \n     individual producer, shall be as follows--if the inventory \n     management acreage is--\n       ``(A) 5 percent, then the marketing loan rate shall be \n     increased by 2.5 percent.\n       ``(B) 10 percent, then the marketing loan rate shall be \n     increased by 5 percent.\n       ``(C) 15 percent, then the marketing loan rate shall be \n     increased by 7.5 percent, and\n       ``(D) 20 percent, then the marketing loan rate shall be \n     increased by 10 percent.\n       ``(g) Commodity Credit Corporation.--The Secretary shall \n     carry out the program authorized by this section through the \n     Commodity Credit Corporation.\n\n[[Page S11442]]\n\n       ``(h) Regulations.--The Secretary shall issue such \n     regulations as may be necessary to carry out this section.\n       Cross Compliance and Offsetting Compliance.--The Secretary \n     shall require that compliance on a farm with the terms and \n     conditions of any other commodity, conservation, or any other \n     program is required as a condition of eligibility for \n     inventory management incentives provided under authority of \n     this section.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      The Farm Income Recovery Act\n\n\n        Better Prices and Higher Profits Through the Marketplace\n\n       Since the commodity market collapse in the late 1990's, \n     farmers in Minnesota and the rest of the country have learned \n     a hard lesson: the 1996 ``Freedom to Farm'' Act lacks an \n     adequate safety net for farmers struggling with severe price \n     fluctuations. As a result, year after year, the Federal \n     Government has been forced to pass billions of dollars in \n     emergency funding, barely enough to allow many of these \n     farmers to survive.\n       We cannot continue this pattern--it is hurting our farmers, \n     and its is fiscally irresponsible, costing taxpayers close to \n     $33 billion in emergency assistance over the past five years.\n       The goal of the Farm Income Recovery Act is to raise market \n     prices for farmers, with the added benefit of reducing the \n     cost of the taxpayer. It provides farmers with a secure \n     safety net that can offset severe price fluctuations and can \n     help manage uncertainties in the marketplace by boosting \n     marketing assistance loan rates. It creates a sound reserve \n     program, allowing producers to store their commodities when \n     they are in abundant supply, so market prices do not continue \n     to spiral downward. And it is counter cyclical, so it kicks \n     in to help farmers when prices are low, but phases out when \n     prices increase.\n\n\n                Boosting Marketing Assistance Loan Rates\n\n       The Farm Income Recovery Act boosts marketing loan rates, \n     establishing an equitable, counter cyclical assistance \n     program based on costs of production.\n       Instead of basing loan rate calculations on an arbitrary \n     snapshot of community prices in a given year, the bill \n     directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish marketing \n     loan rates at not less than 80 percent of the economic cost \n     of production, allowing loans rate to adjust annually to \n     changes in both producer input costs and productivity.\n       The loan rates in the Farm Income Recovery Act are far more \n     equitable than current rates, as well as the rates proposed \n     in the Farm Bill passed by the House of Representatives and \n     even those being suggested by the Senate Agriculture \n     Committee:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                               Farm\n                                                                  Current     Income      House       Senate Ag\n                         Crop and unit                           loan rate   Recovery     passed      committee\n                                                                               Act                       \\1\\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWheat (bushel).................................................      $2.58      $3.88   $2.24-2.58         2.94\nCorn (bushel)..................................................       1.89       2.40    1.64-1.89         2.05\nSorghum (bushel)...............................................       1.71       2.40    1.44-1.89         1.98\nBarley (bushel)................................................       1.65       2.40    1.40-1.65         1.98\nSoybeans (bushel)..............................................       5.26       5.36    4.06-4.92         5.20\nUpland Cotton (Cwt)............................................      51.92      60.65        51.92        54.50\nRice (Cwt).....................................................       6.50       8.61         6.50         6.90\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ As of 10/31/01.\n\n       To discourage overproduction, the Farm Income Recovery Act \n     directs the Secretary to establish limits on the crop amounts \n     for which individual producers can receive nonrecourse \n     marketing loans. This limit is calculated by multiplying a \n     producer's 1996-2001 crop years average acreage base by the \n     1996-2001 crop years average yield base.\n\n\n                  TARGETING HELP TOWARD FAMILY FARMERS\n\n       The Farm Income Recovery Act is designed to target its \n     benefits to family farmers by limiting the amount of a crop \n     for which farmers can receive nonrecourse loans. Production \n     that exceeds limits would be eligible for recourse loans, \n     which must be paid back, with interest, to the Federal \n     Government: Wheat, 125,000 bushels; Corn, 225,000 bushels; \n     Sorghum, 225,000 bushels; Barley, 225,000 bushels; Oats, \n     250,000 bushels; Soybeans, 100,000 bushels; Rice, 75,000 \n     hundredweight; Upland Cotton, 10,500 hundredweight; Extra \n     Long Staple Cotton, 12,500 hundredweight; and Minor Oilseeds, \n     60,000 hundredweight.\n       The targeting provision also prohibits program \n     participation by anyone whose annual gross income exceeds $2 \n     million of which agricultural production accounts for less \n     than 75 percent.\n\n\n         Using Commodity Reserves to Achieve Policy Objectives\n\n       In the past, commodity reserves languished in Government \n     stockpiles unless high prices triggered their release into \n     the market--which would often result in depressed prices.\n       Under the Farm Income Recovery Act, commodity reserves \n     would not enter the free market, where they could have a \n     depressive effect on prices; instead, they would be used \n     exclusively to achieve other policy objectives as follows:\n       The Farmer-Owned Production Loss Reserve allows producers \n     to store a specified amount (up to 20 percent of their annual \n     production) of program commodities when they are in abundant \n     supply, and supplements the Federal Crop Insurance Program by \n     providing additional risk protection to producers who suffer \n     production losses.\n       The Humanitarian Food Assistance Reserve allows the Federal \n     Government to purchase, store, and utilize commodities to \n     ensure the capacity of the United States to fulfill current \n     and future humanitarian nutrition assistance commitments and \n     stimulate economic development in the neediest parts of the \n     world. The quantity that may be purchased by the government \n     for the reserve is limited to approximately one-year's \n     estimated commitments. Some examples of humanitarian programs \n     that may benefit from this reserve are the Food for Peace \n     Program, United Nation's World Food Programs, and the \n     proposed McGovern/Dole Food for Education Program.\n       The Renewable Energy Reserve allows the Federal Government \n     to purchase, store, and utilize commodities such as corn and \n     soybeans that are used to create renewable fuels like ethanol \n     and biodiesel when production is at risk of decline due to \n     reduced feedstock supplies or significant commodity price \n     increases. The quantity that may be purchased by the \n     government for the reserve is limited to approximately one-\n     year's estimated utilization for renewable energy purposes.\n\n\n                 Cost containment Through Conservation\n\n       In times of overproduction, the Farm Income Recovery Act \n     authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a \n     voluntary program that would further increase loan rates for \n     producers who voluntarily set aside a percentage of their \n     acreage for conservation as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Percent\n                                                               increase\n                      Acreage set aside                         of loan\n                                                                 rate\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n5 percent...................................................         2.5\n10 percent..................................................         5\n15 percent..................................................         7.5\n20 percent..................................................        10\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                             Cost Estimate\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office is currently calculating a \n     cost estimate for the Farm Income Recover Act. However, the \n     Agricultural Policy Analysis Center at the University of \n     Tennessee has estimated the 10-year cost of a very similar \n     program at about $50 billion over current expenditure levels \n     for the next 10-year budget cycle. By comparison, the House \n     Farm Bill's Commodity Title, which covers comparable issues, \n     has been scored at $48.8 billion.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. In summary, this legislation, which was developed in \nclose consultation with the National Farmers Union and the Minnesota \nFarmers Union, really bears the imprint of the farmers in Minnesota, \nwith whom I have consulted over the last several months--really over \nthe last 20 years. It accomplishes what farmer after farmer in \nMinnesota has told me that he or she is searching for, and that is a \nfarm program that encourages market prices to levels where farmers can \nmake a profit in the marketplace.\n  I come from a business family, and I know you don't stay in business \nif you cannot earn a profit for what you produce and sell. \nUnfortunately, the ability and the opportunity to earn a profit is what \nhas been taken away from farmers in Minnesota and across this country.\n  I am humbled by the fact that for 60 years Members of this body, from \nboth sides of the aisle, have endeavored to create a Federal \nagricultural policy that would best serve the interests of Minnesota \nand other American farmers. Sometimes they have succeeded in doing so; \nsometimes their efforts have fallen short.\n  I do not know if this legislation provides the right answer for all \nthe farmers across this country, but I do know it is a step in a better \ndirection from what we have today. It is a step toward higher prices in \nthe marketplace; it is a step toward lower taxpayer subsidies; it is a \nstep toward putting agriculture in this country back on its own \neconomic feet so it is not dependent on Government programs and not \ndependent on every decision we make in Washington to dictate what the \nnext course of action will be.\n  I look forward to working with colleagues on this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 1633. A bill to amend the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of \n1978 to establish a program to provide assistance to States and \nnonprofit organizations to preserve suburban open space and contain \nsuburban sprawl, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the people of Maine have always been \nfaithful stewards of the forest because we understand its tremendous \nvalue to our economy and to our way of life. From the vast tracts of \nland in the north to the small woodlots of the south, forest land helps \nshape the character of our entire State. While our commitment to \nstewardship has preserved the forest for generations, there is a new \nthreat to Maine's forest that requires a new approach.\n\n[[Page S11443]]\n\n  The threat is suburban sprawl, which has already consumed tens-of-\nthousands of acres of forest land in southern Maine. Sprawl occurs \nbecause the economic value of forest or farm land cannot compete with \nthe value of developed land. The problem is particularly acute here in \nsouthern Maine where a 108 percent increase in urbanized land over the \npast two decades has resulted in the labeling of greater Portland as \nthe ``sprawl capital of the Northeast.''\n  I am alarmed by the amount of working forest land and open space that \nhas given way to strip malls and cul-de-sacs. Our State is trying to \nrespond to this challenge. The people of Maine have approved a $50-\nmillion bond to preserve land through the Land for Maine's Future \nBoard, and continue to use scarce local funds and contribute their time \nand money to preserve important lands and to support our State's 88 \nland trusts.\n  The people of Maine are forging a new approach to preserving our \nworking forest and protecting our communities from sprawl. It is time \nfor the Federal Government to support these efforts.\n  Today I am introducing the Suburban and Community Forestry and Open \nSpace Initiative Act. The legislation, which was drafted with the \nadvice of land owners, conservation groups, and community planners, \nestablishes a $50-million grant program within the U.S. Forest Service \nto support locally-driven projects that preserve working forests. State \nand local governments, as well as nonprofit organizations, would \ncompete for funds to purchase land or conservation easements to keep \nforest lands, threatened by development, in their traditional use.\n  Projects funded under this initiative must be targeted at lands \nlocated in parts of the country that are threatened by sprawl. The \nlegislation requires that Federal grant funds be matched dollar-for-\ndollar with State, local, or private resources. The grant program will \nhelp promote sustainable forestry and public access to forest lands. My \nlegislation protects the rights of property owners with the inclusion \nof a ``willing-seller'' provision and it allows non-profits, States, \nand municipalities--but not the Federal Government--to hold title to \nland or easements purchased under the program.\n  The $50 million that would be authorized by my bill would help \nachieve a number of stewardship objectives. First, my legislation would \nhelp prevent forest fragmentation and preserve working forests, helping \nto maintain the supply of timber that fuels Maine's most important \nindustry. Second, the resources made available as part of my \nlegislation would be a valuable tool in communities that are struggling \nto manage growth and prevent sprawl. Currently, if the town of Gorham, \nME or another community trying to cope with the effects of sprawl \nturned to the Federal Government for assistance, none would be found. \nMy bill will change that by making the Federal Government an active \npartner in preserving forest land and managing sprawl, while leaving \ndecision-making at the State and local level.\n  We can all be proud of the work being done in Maine to protect our \nworking forests for the next generation, and I am grateful that many of \nthe people and organizations that are leading this effort are \nsupporting my legislation. By enacting the Suburban and Community \nForestry and Open Space Initiative Act Congress can provide a real \nboost to conservation initiatives, help preserve sprawl, and help \nsustain the vitality of natural resource-based industries.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. Collins:\n  S. 1634. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nimprove the safety of perishable products whose import is regulated by \nthe Commissioner of Food and Drugs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Imported \nFood Safety Act of 2001. Food safety has been a serious public health \nconcern in America for some time, but our awareness of the \nvulnerability of our food supply has been heightened since September \n11.\n  I have long been concerned about the adequacy of our Nation's \nimported food supply system. In 1998, in my capacity as chairman of the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I began an in-depth 16 month \ninvestigation into the safety of food imports. This investigation \nrevealed much about the government's flawed food safety net. \nRegrettably, in the intervening three years, little has changed, and \nnow we must acknowledge that those systemic shortcomings can also be \nused by those who wish to perpetrate acts of bioterrorism.\n  As part of the investigation, I requested the GAO to evaluate the \nfederal government's efforts to ensure the safety of imported foods. In \nits April 1998 report, the GAO concluded that ``federal efforts to \nensure the safety of imported foods are inconsistent and unreliable.'' \nJust last month, the GAO reiterated that conclusion in testimony before \nthe Senate's Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management.\n  During five days of Subcommittee hearings, we heard testimony from 29 \nwitnesses, including scientists, industry and consumer representatives, \ngovernment officials, the General Accounting Office, and two persons \nwith first-hand knowledge of the seamier side of the imported food \nindustry, a convicted Customs broker and a convicted former FDA \ninspector.\n  Let me briefly recount some of the Subcommittee's findings which make \nit clear why this legislation is so urgently needed: weaknesses in FDA \nimport controls, specifically the ability of importers to control food \nshipments from the port to the point of distribution, make the system \nvulnerable to fraud and deception and clearly to a terrorist attack; \nthe bonds required to be posted by importers who violate food safety \nlaws are so low that they are considered by some unscrupulous importers \nas the cost of doing business; maintaining the food safety net for \nimported food is an increasingly complex task, made more complicated by \npreviously unknown foodborne pathogens, like Cyclospora, that are \ndifficult to detect; our recent experience with anthrax has taught us \nthat there is much more public health officials need to know to ensure \nthe safety of our food; because some imported food can be contaminated \nby substances that cannot be detected by visual inspection, grant \nprograms need to be established that will encourage the rapid \ndevelopment of food safety monitoring sensors that are capable of \ndetecting chemical and biological contaminants; since contamination of \nimported food can occur at many different places from the farm to the \ntable, the ability to trace outbreaks of foodborne illnesses back to \nthe source of contamination requires more coordinated effort among \nFederal, State, and local agencies responsible for ensuring food \nsafety, as well as improved education for health care providers so that \nthey can better recognize and treat foodborne illnesses. Again, our \nrecent experience with anthrax underscores the need for better \ncoordination and education.\n  Since the terrorist attacks that occurred just weeks ago, we have \nbeen living in a changed world. We are battling enemies who show no \nregard for the value of human life, and whose twisted minds seek to \ndestroy those who embody democracy and freedom. It has never been as \nimportant as it is now to ensure that our food supplies are adequately \nprotected against contamination, both inadvertent and intentional.\n\n  President Bush and his Administration are acting swiftly and \ndecisively on all fronts. Among the responsibilities of the Office of \nHomeland Security is the protection of our livestock and agricultural \nsystems from terrorist attack. And the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, Tommy Thompson, has been working tirelessly to obtain the \nadditional tools necessary to combat bioterrorism.\n  On October 17, 2001, Secretary Thompson appeared before the Senate's \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, and testified about the Federal \nGovernment's efforts to ensure that the country is adequately prepared \nto respond to bioterrorist threats. He identified food safety and, in \nparticular, imported foods, as vulnerable areas that require further \nstrengthening. Similarly, at a recent hearing before the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, public health experts were\n\n[[Page S11444]]\n\nunanimous in expressing concern about the vulnerability of our food.\n  Weak import controls make our system all too easy to circumvent. \nAfter all, FDA only inspects fewer than one percent of all imported \nfood shipments that arrive in our country. Those shipments are sent \nfrom countries around the world, most of whom wish us no harm. Yet, \nbecause of the hard lessons we have had to learn since September 11, we \nmust be more vigilant about protecting ourselves. It is vital that we \ntake the necessary steps to close the loopholes that unscrupulous \nshippers have used in the past and that bioterrorists could exploit \nnow.\n  I first became concerned about the safety of the U.S. food supply in \n1998 when I learned that fruit from Mexico and Guatemala was associated \nwith three multi-state outbreaks of foodborne illnesses that sickened \nthousands of Americans. Regrettably, those type of outbreaks are far \ntoo common. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, \nestimate that 76 million cases of foodborne illnesses occur each year. \nFortunately, the majority of these incidents are mild and cause \nsymptoms for only a day or two. Less fortunately, the CDC also \nestimates that over 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths result \nfrom those 76 million cases. And as astonishingly high as those numbers \nare, they are estimates, and the truth may be even more deadly.\n  It was because of my concern that I began the Subcommittee's \ninvestigation of the adequacy of our country's imported food safety \nsystem. During the Subcommittee's hearings, the testimony I heard was \ntroubling. The United States Customs Service told us of one \nparticularly egregious situation. It involves contaminated fish and \nillustrates the challenges facing federal regulators who are charged \nwith ensuring the safety of our Nation's food supply.\n  In 1996, Federal inspectors along our border with Mexico opened a \nshipment of seafood destined for sales to restaurants in Los Angeles. \nThe shipment was dangerously tainted with life-threatening \ncontaminants, including botulism, Salmonella, and just plain filth. \nMuch to the surprise of the inspectors, this shipment of frozen fish \nhad been inspected before by Federal authorities. Alarmingly, in fact, \nit had arrived at our border two years before, and had been rejected by \nthe FDA as unfit for consumption. Its importers then held this rotten \nshipment for two years before attempting to bring it into the country \nagain, by a different route.\n  The inspectors only narrowly prevented this poisoned fish from \nreaching American plates. And what happened to the importer who tried \nto sell this deadly food to American consumers? In effect, nothing. He \nwas placed on probation and asked to perform 50 hours of community \nservice.\n  I suppose we should be thankful that the perpetrators were caught in \nthis case. After all, the unsafe food might have escaped detection and \nreached our tables. But it worries me that the importer essentially \nreceived a slap on the wrist. I believe that forfeiting the small \namount of money currently required for the Custom's bond, which some \nimporters now consider no more than a ``cost of doing business,'' does \nlittle to deter unscrupulous importers from trying to slip tainted fish \nthat is two years old past overworked Customs agents.\n  It is imperative that Congress provide our Federal agencies with the \ndirection, resources, and authority necessary to protect our food \nsupply from acts of bioterrorism and to keep unsafe, unsanitary food \nout of the United States.\n  I have worked with the FDA, the Customs Service, and the CDC to \nensure that my legislation corrects many of the vulnerabilities that \nhave been identified in our imported food safety system. Let me \ndescribe what this bill is designed to accomplish.\n  My legislation will fill the existing gaps in the food import system \nand provide the FDA with stronger authority to protect American \nconsumers against tainted food imports. First and foremost, this bill \ngives the FDA the authority to stop such food from entering our \ncountry. My bill would authorize FDA to deny the entry of imported food \nthat has caused repeated outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, presents a \nreasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences, \nand is likely without systemic changes to cause disease again.\n  Second, this legislation would enable the FDA to require secure \nstorage of shipments offered by repeat offenders prior to their release \ninto commerce. Unscrupulous shippers who have demonstrated a \nwillingness to knowingly send tainted food to our country cannot be \noverlooked as potential sources of bioterrorist acts. My bill would \nalso prohibit the practice of ``port-shopping,'' and would require that \nboxes containing violative foods that have been refused entry into our \ncountry be clearly marked. This latter authority is currently used with \nsuccess by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. My bill also would \nrequire the destruction of certain imported foods that cannot be \nadequately reconditioned to ensure safety.\n  Third, the legislation would direct the FDA to develop criteria for \nuse by private laboratories to collect and analyze samples of food \noffered for import. This will ensure the integrity of the testing \nprocess.\n  Fourth, the bill would give ``teeth'' to the current food import \nsystem by establishing two strong deterrents, the threats of higher \nbonds and of debarment, for unscrupulous importers who repeatedly \nviolate U.S. law. No longer will the industry's ``bad actors'' be able \nto profit from endangering the health of American consumers.\n  Finally, my bill would authorize the CDC to award grants to state and \nlocal public health agencies to strengthen the public health \ninfrastructure by updating essential items such as laboratory and \nelectronic-reporting equipment. Grants would also be available for \nuniversities, non-profit corporations, and industrial partners to \ndevelop new and improved sensors and tests to detect pathogens and for \nprofessional schools and professional societies to develop programs to \nincrease the awareness of foodborne illness among healthcare providers \nand the public.\n  We are truly fortunate that the American food supply is one of the \nsafest in the world. But our system for safeguarding our people from \nimported food that has been tainted, either intentionally or \ninadvertently, is flawed.\n  Finally, I am very pleased to also be working with my colleagues on \nbipartisan bioterrorism legislation that targets problems posed by \nbioterrorist threats to our Nation's food supply and public health. I \nbelieve that the measures provided for in my Imported Food Safety Act \nof 2001, and the bipartisan bioterrorism bill, will significantly \nreduce the threat to our country. I hope that we will pass both pieces \nof legislation this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/05/senate-section/article/S11444-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2088.

Madam President, tomorrow, at 2:30 p.m., the Senate will \nvote on the Daschle-Kennedy amendment which deals with collective \nbargaining for municipal employees. I say ``municipal employees,'' \nmeaning public safety employees in the States.\n  I used to be a State legislator. I was in the State senate for 2 \nyears. We dealt with collective bargaining in my State. Almost every \nState has dealt with that issue. Some States prohibit collective \nbargaining for police, firefighters, sheriffs, and emergency personnel. \nMost States allow it.\n  But I am looking at the legislation that Senator Kennedy and Senator \nDaschle are trying to put on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, and \nthey go a lot further than most of the States.\n  Then I think, wait a minute; one, we are not supposed to legislate on \nappropriations bills. We passed a rule, Senate rule XVI, saying we are \nnot going to legislate on appropriations bills. This is clearly \nlegislation on an appropriations bill. It is brand new legislation \ncreating a new title. It says this title may be cited as the ``Public \nSafety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act of 2001.'' It is brandnew \nlegislation. It is dealing with collective bargaining on public safety \nemployees. It does not belong on this bill. It has been reported out of \nthe Labor Committee.\n  Senator Daschle is the majority leader. He can call it up at any \ntime. It should not be on an appropriations bill. I checked the \nparliamentary procedures, and I was told the Parliamentarian would say \nthere is underlying language in the House bill, so maybe it would be \ngermane, and therefore we would have a vote on germaneness. In other \nwords, it is OK to legislate on this appropriations bill. I do not \nagree with the result, but, anyway, the net result is, we are talking \nabout legislating on dealing with collective bargaining that almost all \nthe States do. Why are we doing it on the Federal level?\n  I read the Constitution and the 10th amendment to the constitution \nsays:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  Why is the Federal Government getting ready to do something that it \nhas never done? We are going to take over what the States and what the \ncities have done. We are going to dictate collective bargaining rights; \nthere is a whole series of rights. I do not disagree with any of them \nparticularly; I just think it should be done by the State, not by the \nFederal Government.\n  I have no problem if firefighters or police or sheriffs or emergency \npersonnel want to organize within the States' laws. Great. Most of them \ndo. Most States have some collective bargaining rights. Fine. But it \nshould not be a Federal statute. It should not be a Federal cause of \naction. There should not be things in this legislation that most States \ndo not have.\n  There is language in this bill that most States are not aware of and \nmost individual Senators, who may have said they would support this \namendment, are not aware of. There is requiring an interest impasse \nresolution mechanism, such as fact-finding, mediation, arbitration, or \ncomparable procedures.\n\n  I will tell you, as State legislators, we fought for a long time on \nwhether\n\n[[Page S11446]]\n\nwe would have binding arbitration. This amendment is basically saying \nyou have to have something like binding arbitration. Wow. I wonder if \npeople are aware of that.\n  My point is, this amendment that we are going to be voting on, the \nKennedy-Daschle amendment, dealing with public safety, employer-\nemployee relations, is not a Federal issue. It has never been a Federal \nissue. Yet some people are trying to make it that. And they didn't do a \nvery good job legislating.\n  I mention that they dictate a lot of things that a lot of States do \nnot have. They affect a lot of individuals who have never been in \ncollective bargaining.\n  They go to very small cities. Somebody says: We exempt those small \ncities. Yes, a population of less than 5,000. That is way too small. \nOh, yes, we will exempt employee groups if they have 25 people or less.\n  Wait a minute. The Federal Government is going to now get involved in \nemployer-employee negotiations on units in small towns with a \npopulation that is greater than 5,000 people? Or if they have 26 or \nmore employees, we are going to dictate: Here are your collective \nbargaining procedures? And, yes, there is a new Federal agency that is \ngoing to dictate the rules for negotiating contracts for elections. We \nare going to make that a Federal issue?\n  There is no reason to do it. There are lots of reasons not to do it.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at these letters. I will ask to have \nthem printed in the Record.\n  I will read part of the letter from The United States Conference of \nMayors:\n\n       However, the federal government should not impose \n     collective bargaining procedures and practices on those local \n     governments that have chosen over time to develop alternative \n     methods for the management of the human resource and \n     personnel administration needs.\n\n  The National Volunteer Fire Council:\n\n       The National Volunteer Fire Council is a non-profit \n     membership association representing the more than 800,000 of \n     America's volunteer fire, EMS, and rescue services.\n\n  They are not exempt in this bill. As a matter of fact, the unions \nthat this bill purportedly is trying to help do not really care for \nvolunteers. As a matter of fact, people who join their union cannot be \na volunteer. Lots of small communities have volunteer firefighters, \nvolunteer police organizations, sheriff volunteers. The volunteers--I \nwill just read from the letter--are very opposed to this amendment. \nPart of the letter says:\n\n       As you know, firefighters, 75% of which are volunteers, are \n     our nation's first responders to all types of emergencies. . \n     . .\n       Currently, the International Association of Fire Fighters \n     Constitution includes a provision prohibiting its members \n     from becoming volunteer firefighters or advocating that other \n     members become volunteer firefighters. We have found that in \n     some collective bargaining negotiations in the past, local \n     unions have incorporated similar provisions in their \n     agreements with their local governments. As such, a union may \n     prevent its firefighters from serving as volunteers and a \n     union may negotiate for a provision in a collective \n     bargaining agreement preventing all firefighters working for \n     the employer from serving as volunteer firefighters.\n\n  The National Volunteer Fire Council believes these provisions are a \nviolation of first amendment rights: ``Once again, we urge you to \noppose the Daschle amendment unless language is inserted to'' exempt \nvolunteers.\n  For my colleagues' information, if cloture is invoked, we are going \nto have a lot of amendments to fix this language. It should not be in \nhere. I have already stated that this is legislation on an \nappropriations bill. This is the right jurisdiction for the States, not \nthe Federal Government. If we are going to legislate, we are going to \ndo it right. So we are going to have a lot of amendments. I am aware of \nthe fact that Senator Specter kept offering amendments that were going \nto be hotly debated and contested and take a long time.\n  If cloture is invoked tomorrow, then we are going to have a lot of \namendments. I think having an exemption that says 25 or fewer is way \ntoo small. I am going to have an amendment to increase that. I think \nthe exemption for communities being as small as 5,000 is way too low. \nSo I am going to have an amendment to increase that. I am going to have \nan amendment, along with Senator Gramm, making sure people are not \ncoerced into joining the union. Nobody should be compelled to do that. \nSome might say: Wait a minute; why is that a Federal issue? It should \nnot be, but this bill tries to turn it into a Federal issue.\n  We are also going to have an amendment to make sure people are not \ncompelled to pay dues. If they want to, that is great; I have no \nobjection to that. We want to have an amendment making sure volunteers \nare exempt. We should not discourage volunteers, but that is the net \nimpact of this legislation. This legislation doesn't belong on this \nbill. The States have legislative bodies. Let them decide. They have \ndone it. Already two States have said, no, they don't believe in \ncollective bargaining for public service employees. Those States are \nNorth Carolina and Virginia. The volunteers, the firefighters, and \nsafety employees of Virginia did an outstanding job. So whether they \nare union or nonunion, they did a great job. I compliment all of the \nrelief workers. We had relief workers from Oklahoma in New York, and \nthey were union and nonunion.\n  This amendment should not be on this bill. We should allow the \nStates, as the Constitution provides in the 10th amendment, to dictate \nthis policy. It should not be resolved on the Federal side. But if it \nis, we are going to have to have several amendments on the Kennedy-\nDaschle amendment to improve it substantially, to exempt volunteers and \nsmaller communities, and a greater number of people and allow people \nthe freedom to join unions and/or the freedom not to pay dues.\n\n  I urge my colleagues, let's not preempt States, tell the States we \nknow better with one quickly drawn amendment that does not belong here, \nand that we are going to superimpose our will on the States. Many of \nthem have wrestled with collective bargaining for their cities and \ncounties. I would venture to say most sheriffs departments are not \nunionized in most States. Under this bill, they would be encouraged to \ndo so. I don't think that is our job. Let the States decide that. And \nthe same goes for emergency workers, ambulance workers, and so on. If \nthey want to unionize, let the States wrestle with that issue. We \nshould not be making those decisions. Allow the States to decide what \ngroups should have collective bargaining rights, how far the rights \nshould go, and whether they should have binding arbitration or other \nremedies as provided for in this bill.\n  I don't think this bill is right. I think it should be preserved to \nthe States. I encourage people, if you want to unionize, do it under \nState laws. Almost all States allow collective bargaining but not in \nthe same manner as dictated in the amendment proposed by Senators \nDaschle and Kennedy.\n  Finally, this side has shown some restraint on nongermane amendments \nto the underlying bill. I urge our majority leader, Senator Kennedy, \nand others to show restraint as well and hopefully withdraw this \namendment. If not, I urge my colleagues to vote no on cloture tomorrow \nat 2:30.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letters I have referred to \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      The United States Conference\n\n\n                                                    of Mayors,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 5, 2001.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Assistant Republican Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: The United States Conference of \n     Mayors opposes Amendment 2044 to the Labor-Health and Human \n     Services-Education Appropriations bill.\n       It is our position that this measure, if passed, would be a \n     preemption of local authority and would impose an unfunded \n     mandate on a large number of our nation's cities. While the \n     costs may not be evident at first glance, they would be \n     significant in that time-tested working personnel systems \n     would have to be significantly modified.\n       No one can dispute the valuable contribution our public \n     safety forces make daily, especially after their outstanding \n     work in the wake of the September 11 attacks on our Nation \n     where their contributions received deservedly high level \n     attention. However, the federal government should not impose \n     collective bargaining procedures and practices on those local \n     governments that have chosen over time to develop alternative \n     methods for the management of the human resource and \n     personnel administration needs.\n       On behalf of The U.S. Conference of Mayors, I thank you for \n     your assistance on this important matter. If you have any \n     questions,\n\n[[Page S11447]]\n\n     please contact Ed Somers or Roger Dahl with the Conference \n     staff at (202) 297-7330.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                J. Thomas Cochran,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              National Volunteer Fire Council,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 31, 2001.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: The National Volunteer Fire Council \n     (NVFC) is a non-profit membership association representing \n     the more than 800,000 members of America's volunteer fire, \n     EMS, and rescue services. Organized in 1976, the NVFC serves \n     as the voice of America's volunteer fire personnel in over \n     28,000 departments across the country. On behalf of our \n     membership, I urge you to oppose the Daschle Amendment as \n     currently written that would insert the language of Public \n     Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act (S. 952/H.R. 1475) \n     to the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Bill (H.R. 3061).\n       As you know, firefighters, 75% of which are volunteers, are \n     our nation's first responders to all types of emergencies. \n     Most volunteer departments serve small, rural communities and \n     are quite often the only line of defense in those \n     communities. The brave men and women of these departments, \n     who risk their lives in the name of public service, save \n     local taxpayers an estimated $36 billion per year.\n       Currently, the International Association of Fire Fighters \n     (IAFF) Constitution includes a provision prohibiting its \n     members from becoming volunteer firefighters or advocating \n     that other members become volunteer firefighters. We have \n     found that in some collective bargaining negotiations in the \n     past, local unions have incorporated similar provisions in \n     their agreements with their local governments. As such, a \n     union may prevent its firefighters from serving as volunteers \n     and a union may negotiate for a provision in a collective \n     bargaining agreement preventing all firefighters working for \n     the employer from serving as volunteer firefighters. The NVFC \n     feels that these types of provisions are a violation of First \n     Amendment rights.\n       One of the largest problems faced by America's volunteer \n     fire service is recruitment and retention. Even though fire \n     department call volumes continue to increase, the number of \n     volunteer firefighters has declined over 10% since 1983. \n     Major factors contributing to the decline include increased \n     fundraising and time demands, more rigorous training \n     standards, and the proliferation of two-income families whose \n     members don't have the time to volunteer. Therefore, any \n     legislation that may lead to the prohibition of volunteerism \n     is contrary to the interests of the volunteer fire service \n     and must be opposed by the NVFC and its membership.\n       Once again, we urge you to oppose the Daschle amendment \n     unless language is inserted to explicitly protect a person's \n     right to serve as a public safety volunteer. If you have any \n     questions, please contact Craig Sharman, NVFC's Government \n     Affairs Representative, at (202) 887-5700. We appreciate your \n     continued support of America's volunteer fire service.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Philip C. Stittleburg,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Right to Work Committee,\n\n                                Springfield, VA, November 1, 2001.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 2.2 million members of the \n     National Right to Work Committee, I am writing you today to \n     request your full-fledged opposition to the deceptively \n     titled ``Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act'' \n     (S. 952, now masquerading as Amendment 2044, to the Labor/HHS \n     Appropriations bill H.R. 3061, pending on the Senate floor).\n       Senator, if enacted, this language would represent the most \n     far-reaching expansion of union officials' power to corral \n     workers into unions in decades.\n       S. 952/Admt. 2044 is a dangerous, freedom-crushing bill \n     that must be stopped.\n       It is designed to install union officials as the \n     ``exclusive'' bargaining agents of police, firefighters, \n     county paramedics and other public-safety officers in all 50 \n     states.\n       It would by federal fiat force public-safety officers, \n     including many who have chosen not to be union members, to \n     accept union officials as their ``exclusive'' negotiators in \n     employment contract talks.\n       Effectively, Organized Labor thus obtains a monopoly over \n     employees' participation in the bargaining process.\n       Twenty-seven states have so far either refused completely \n     to grant union officials monopoly power over public-safety \n     employment, or have acquiesced to a more limited form of \n     ``exclusive'' bargaining than is mandated by S. 952/Admt. \n     2044.\n       If this bill is enacted, hundreds of thousands of police, \n     firemen and paramedics will be stripped of their freedom to \n     negotiate on their own behalf.\n       And the personal safety of millions will be jeopardized as \n     a result of these employees' loss of freedom.\n       One predictable result of enactment of S. 952/Admt. 2044 \n     would be the decimation of volunteer firefighter departments \n     currently protecting countless communities that cannot afford \n     to hire enough professional firefighters to meet their needs.\n       The constitution of the International Association of \n     Firefighters union (IAFF/AFL-CIO) bars its 245,000 members \n     from becoming volunteer firemen.\n       IAFF officials who are already empowered by state law to \n     act as ``exclusive'' bargaining agents for taxpayer-funded \n     firemen regularly demand and obtain contract provisions \n     barring these firemen from volunteering on their own time.\n       The fact is, 75% of all firemen are volunteers.\n       And more than half of these volunteers are professional \n     firemen who offer their spare time to help their communities, \n     saving local taxpayers an estimated $37 billion annually.\n       Such unselfish professional firemen, who are already \n     trained and experienced, are the backbone of volunteer units.\n       Enactment of S. 952/Admt. 2044 would ultimately force \n     volunteer departments across the country to disband or to \n     operate while severely understaffed.\n       This bill merits no consideration by Congress, especially \n     at a time when communities of all sizes must face the \n     possibility of having to rescue victims of terrorist attacks.\n       And the grave harm S. 952/Admt. 2044 would inflict on \n     volunteer fire departments is only the tip of the iceberg.\n       State and local taxpayers could expect to be hit up for \n     hundreds of millions of dollars just to pay for the direct \n     costs of the ``exclusive'' bargaining process.\n       And the bill would predictably inspire a spate of illegal, \n     dangerous police and firefighter strikes.\n       States adopting laws mandating public-sector ``exclusive'' \n     bargaining endure, on average, four times as many strikes \n     against vital public services once the law takes effect, \n     according to the Public Service Research Council of Vienna, \n     VA.\n       Legal provisions allegedly intended to ban strikes have \n     proven useless.\n       Union officials simply refuse to call off illegal strikes \n     against vital services until they win amnesty for having \n     broken the law.\n       If S. 952/Admt. 2044 is adopted, its so-called ``no-\n     strike'' provisions are sure to prove equally useless.\n       Senator, by promptly taking a clear public stand against \n     this Amendment language, you can strongly discourage union \n     lobbyists from delaying congressional action on truly \n     important national issues in order to get it to your desk.\n       I'm sure you agree with me that Congress's focus over the \n     next year should be on protecting Americans' lives and \n     liberty, and not on expanding forced unionism.\n       That's why I hope you will oppose the Daschle Amendment, \n     Admt. 2044 to the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill.\n       If you have any questions abut this measure, please call me \n     or Mark Mix, the Right to Work Committee's Senior Vice \n     President for Legislation, at 703-321-9820.\n           Sincerely,\n     Reed Larson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    National League of Cities,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 31, 2001.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: The National League of Cities is \n     writing in opposition to Amendment No. 2044 to H.R. 3061, the \n     Labor-Health and Human Services-Education Appropriations \n     bill. We believe that this measure should not be included as \n     an authorizing provision in the spending bill. Furthermore, \n     several state municipal leagues strongly believe that this \n     amendment would preempt state and local authority, where many \n     state laws sufficiently cover collective bargaining rights, \n     without the need for federal intervention.\n       The National League of Cities applauds the heroism of \n     firefighters and all public safety personnel, especially in \n     the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks on America. \n     However, NLC's National Municipal Policy does not support \n     this approach through Amendment No. 2044.\n       NLC believes that the federal government should not \n     undermine municipal autonomy with respect to making \n     fundamental employment decisions by mandating specific \n     working conditions. The federal government should not mandate \n     collective bargaining rights, legalize strikes, or require \n     compulsory binding arbitration. In view of the labor \n     protections provided by state laws, labor agreements, city \n     government civil service systems and municipal personnel \n     procedures, NLC opposes Amendment No. 2044.\n       Thank you for your consideration of the National League of \n     Cities' position on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Don Borut,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Conference of\n\n\n                                           State Legislatures,\n\n                                     Denver, CO, November 5, 2001.\n     Reference: Amendment No. 2044 to the Labor/HHS Appropriations \n         bill (H.R. 3061).\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Byrd and Stevens: The National Conference of \n     State Legislatures is writing in opposition to Amendment No. \n     2044 to H.R. 3061, the Labor-Health and Human Services and \n     Education Appropriations bill. The amendment would federalize \n     a critical area of labor law best left to state and local \n     governments. We believe that this measure should not be \n     included as an authorizing provision to the spending bill. \n     This amendment\n\n[[Page S11448]]\n\n     would preempt state and local authority, where many state \n     laws sufficiently cover collective bargaining rights.\n       The National Conference of State Legislatures applauds the \n     heroism of firefighters and all public safety personnel, \n     especially in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks \n     on America. However, NCSL reminds Congress that absent a \n     compelling reason for preemption, abandoning a commitment to \n     balance in the state-federal partnership is uncalled for and \n     shortsighted.\n       NCSL believes that the federal government should not \n     undermine state and municipal autonomy with respect to making \n     fundamental employment decisions by mandating specific \n     working conditions. The federal government should not mandate \n     collective bargaining rights, legalize strikes, or require \n     compulsory binding arbitration. In view of the labor \n     protections provided by state laws, labor agreements, city \n     government civil service systems and municipal personnel \n     procedures, NCSL opposes Amendment No. 2044.\n       Thank you for your consideration of the National Conference \n     of State Legislatures' position on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William T. Pound,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTennessee is recognized for 12 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, the Daschle amendment is simply \nanother amendment in the long tradition of amendment after amendment \nbasically federalizing things that have been under the purview of State \nand local government for many years. Usually, we choose a politically \nopportune moment to do this; we give lipservice all the time to the \nconcept of federalism. We have tort reform debates, where it comes up \nmany times in many different ways, and many proponents of the Daschle \namendment and I have joined together in pointing out that we should be \nslow to federalize things that have been under the purview of State law \nfor 200 years.\n  We give lipservice to the fact that State and local governments are \ncloser to the people and the Federal Government doesn't have the \nsolution to all problems. All the time, while we are giving lipservice, \nwe are slowly, bit by bit, amendment by amendment, passing things that \ngo against the entire concept of federalism.\n  Those who are promoting this amendment a short time ago, during the \nPatients' Bill of Rights debate, were taking the position that State \nliability law should apply; that State courts should be the ones to \ndetermine State liability. Federalism was a good thing back then. \nFederalism was a good thing when we considered issues on tort reform. \nBut now we have an amendment that basically federalizes and preempts \nState and local laws regarding the unionization of public safety \nofficers.\n  It seems that some of us want to be Jeffersonians on Mondays, \nWednesdays, and Fridays and Hamiltonians on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and \nSundays. So we have this amendment before us, and it is an amendment \nthat is a significant intrusion on the rights of States to set their \nown rules. As we know, the National Labor Relations Act applies to \nunionism in the private sector employment. No Federal statute regarding \nunionism applies to State and local Government employees. It has always \nbeen within the purview of States and local communities to create laws \ngoverning the employment of police officers and firefighters.\n  The Daschle amendment would be an unprecedented expansion of Federal \nauthority at the expense of State and local communities. It basically \ngives Federal labor relations the authority and the power to determine \nwhether or not a State's laws are up to par. If they determine that the \nState's laws are not up to par or in compliance with Federal standards, \nthe Federal Labor Relations Authority will establish collective \nbargaining standards that will apply to the States.\n\n  Madam President, this amendment would require changes to the laws of \nover half the States in the Nation--the laws that they have been \nadministering all this time. Two States have passed laws that \nexplicitly prohibit public safety unions. We are all familiar with the \ndebates we have concerning whether or not it is a good idea for people \nin certain public professions to unionize, whether or not we are more \nlikely to be faced with strikes and things of that nature which go \nagainst the public welfare. Different States have reached different \nconclusions as to whether or not this is a good idea, whether or not it \nis a good idea to allow them to unionize. Of course, that is what \nStates do. They do different things, depending on what the people in \nthe States want.\n  Many other States, including my home State, are silent on the issue \nof union rights of public officials, which allows counties, cities, and \nother local communities to determine whether or not they will allow \nunions to collectively bargain with them or not.\n  In my view, this is exactly where these decisions should be made. \nSurely, questions about hiring decisions and the qualifications of the \npeople who provide services that safeguard the community should be made \nby the people who live in those communities.\n  I have received letters from a dozen communities in Tennessee from \nFayetteville to Johnson City, Smyrna, Germantown, and many others. Many \nof those letters were sent by police departments expressing their \nconcern over the adverse impact of this legislation on their \ncommunities.\n  No one can doubt the tremendous service that is provided by our \nfirefighters and police officers. They put their lives on the line \nevery day to ensure our safety. But this amendment is not a fitting \nresponse to that service. It is not a fitting response to subvert the \nbasic relationship between the States and the Federal Government or the \nlocal communities and the Federal Government. It is not a fitting \nresponse to fundamentally alter a system that has been established and \nhas served us well for 200 years.\n  This amendment essentially writes State laws for States and requires \nthe States to pass them or have the Federal Government apply their own \nstandard. It is not the place of the Federal Government to make \ndecisions that are closely tied to the needs of traditional \nresponsibilities of States and local communities.\n  This amendment is an unwarranted intrusion on self-government. I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/05/senate-section/article/S11448-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 2:15 P.M.
