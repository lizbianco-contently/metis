For the Lord gives wisdom; from His mouth \ncome understanding and knowledge.''\n  Let us pray:\n  Immortal, invisible, God only wise, in light inaccessible hid from \nour eyes, we confess our lack of wisdom to solve the problems of our \nNation and world. The best of our education, experience, and erudition \nis not enough. We turn to You and ask for the gift of wisdom. You never \ntire of offering it; we desire it; and our times require it. We are \nstunned by the qualifications of receiving wisdom. Proverbs reminds us \nthat the secret is creative fear of You. What does it mean to fear You? \nYou have taught us that it is awe, wonder, and humble adoration. Our \nprofound concern is that we might be satisfied with our surface \nanalysis and be unresponsive to Your offer of wisdom. Lord, grant the \nSenators knowledge and understanding of Your wisdom so that they may \nspeak Your words on their lips. When nothing less will do, You give \nwisdom to those who humbly ask for it. Thank You, God. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10105-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Jack Reed led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10105-4", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is going to be a hearing on the 16th on Tom \nSansoneppi to be Assistant Attorney General for Natural Resources. Then \nthere is going to be an additional hearing on the 18th of this month on \na circuit court judge and five district court judges.\n  So Senator Leahy is to be commended for the work he is doing in \nconjunction with Senator Hatch and moving these nominations along. \nSenator Leahy has a tremendous load.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in \nopposition to the pending bill regarding normal trade relations with \nVietnam.\n  It is significant for us to look at what is occurring on the Senate \nfloor as compared to what happened on the House side. There are two \nissues involved. One is the numerous human rights violations committed \nby the country of Vietnam, and the second is the other issue--which is \nthe issue binding--of whether or not we should have so-called normal, \nif you will, trade relations with the country of Vietnam.\n  I want to point out a few facts. Before I do that, I again point out \nthat before the House passed normalization of trade with Vietnam, it \npassed H.R. 2833, dealing with human rights violations in Vietnam.

Mr. President, this is a vote of 410-1, \nwhich noted the human rights violations Vietnam has committed.\n  I ask my colleagues for the Record why we cannot have a similar vote \nin the Senate. If those who want to normalize relations with Vietnam \nchoose to ignore the numerous human rights violations of that country, \nis that right? Where we had something that passed the House 410-1 and \nwas sent over here, why can't we have a vote on that either before or \nafter the vote on normalization of trade relations? I will tell you \nwhy. Because one Senator objects.\n  I want to point out to the majority side that at the appropriate time \nwhen someone from the majority is here on the floor, I am going to ask \nunanimous consent that we move to that legislation. I believe that is \nthe appropriate thing to do.\n  Let me proceed by saying I don't think it is a secret that I have \nbeen a long-time critic of the regime in Hanoi. I have visited there \nfour or five times, if not more, as a Senator and as a Congressman. I \nthink I know pretty well the situation there. A lot of the criticism \nthat I brought up has focused pretty much on the POW-MIA issue in the \nsense that in spite of all the statements to the contrary by many, they \nhave not provided full disclosure on our missing. I will get back to \nthat.\n  First, I want to comment on the passage in the House of H.R. 2833, \nthe Vietnam Human Rights Act, before they took up normal trade \nrelations. The House is saying: We know what you are doing; we are \nputting you on notice. We can't do that here in the Senate today \nbecause one Senator is blocking, as far as I know, it coming to the \nSenate floor--410-1, and we can't even get a vote on it in the Senate.\n  I commend the House for its action. They did the right thing. I don't \nagree with their passing normal trade relations, but they at least \npassed the human rights violation notification so that we now know and \nthe world now knows about these violations. We should expect Vietnam to \nimprove its record on human rights if we are trying to trade with them.\n  Why is that so unreasonable? We make these demands on other nations. \nBut when it comes to Vietnam, we have to ignore their horrible record \nof open human rights violations. It is abysmal. Our own State \nDepartment explains it in its ``Country Report on Human Rights \nPractices.'' We can't ignore these things.\n  My question is, Why doesn't the Senate do what the House did and pass \nthe Vietnam Human Rights Act? It is here at the desk. We could pass it.\n  I have a letter from the U.S. Commission on International Religious \nFreedom requesting that the Senate pass\n\n[[Page S10107]]\n\nH.R. 2833, the Vietnam Human Rights Act. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe letter from the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       United States Commission On\n\n\n                              International Religious Freedom,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 12, 2001.\n\n Congress Should Demand Religious-Freedom Improvements As It Considers \n                        Vietnam Trade Agreement\n\n       The Senate will soon consider the Bilateral Trade Agreement \n     (BTA) with Vietnam, approved by the House of Representatives \n     last week. The agreement will extend Normal Trade Relations \n     status to Vietnam, although this will remain subject to \n     annual review. Given the very serious violations of religious \n     freedom in that country, the Commission in May made a series \n     of recommendations to the Bush Administration and Congress. \n     Primary among these was that U.S. lawmakers should ratify the \n     BTA only after Hanoi undertakes to improve protection of \n     religious freedom or after Congress passes a resolution \n     calling for the Vietnamese government to make such \n     improvements.\n       The Vietnam Human Rights Act (H.R. 2833) passed by the \n     House last week implements this and other Commission \n     recommendations. Besides expressing U.S. concern about \n     Vietnam's religious-freedom and human rights abuses, the Act \n     authorizes assistance to organizations promoting human rights \n     in Vietnam and declares support for Radio Free Asia \n     broadcasting. The Commission urges the Senate to act \n     likewise.\n       The Commission believes that approval of the BTA without \n     any U.S. action with regard to religious freedom risks \n     worsening the religious-freedom situation in Vietnam because \n     it may be interpreted by the government of Vietnam as a \n     signal of American indifference. The Commission notes that \n     religious freedom in the People's Republic of China declined \n     markedly after last year's approval of Permanent Normal Trade \n     Relations status, unaccompanied by any substantial U.S. \n     action with regard to religious freedom in that country.\n       Despite a marked increase in religious practice among the \n     Vietnamese people in the last 10 years, the Vietnamese \n     government continues to suppress organized religious \n     activities forcefully and to monitor and control religious \n     communities. This repression is mirrored by the recent \n     crackdown on important political dissidents. The government \n     prohibits religious activity by those not affiliated with one \n     of the six officially recognized religious organizations. \n     Individuals have been detained, fined, imprisoned, and kept \n     under close surveillance by security forces for engaging in \n     ``illegal'' religious activities. In addition, the government \n     uses the recognition process to monitor and control \n     officially sanctioned religious groups: restricting the \n     procurement and distribution of religious literature, \n     controlling religious training, and interfering with the \n     selection of religious leaders.\n       The Vietnamese government in March placed Fr. Thaddeus \n     Nguyen Van Ly under administrative detention (i.e. house \n     arrest) for ``publicly slandering'' the Vietnamese Communist \n     Party and ``distorting'' the government's policy on religion. \n     This occurred after Fr. Ly submitted written testimony on \n     religious persecution in Vietnam for the Commission's \n     February 2001 hearing on that country.\n       In order to demonstrate significant improvement in \n     religious freedom, the Vietnamese government should:\n       Release from imprisonment, detention, house arrest, or \n     intimidating surveillance persons who are so restricted due \n     to their religious identities or activities.\n       Permit unhindered access to religious leaders by U.S. \n     diplomatic personnel and government officials, the U.S. \n     Commission on International Religious Freedom, and respected \n     international human rights organizations, including, if \n     requested, a return visit by the UN Special Rapporteur on \n     Religious Intolerance.\n       Establish the freedom to engage in religious activities \n     (including the freedom for religious groups to govern \n     themselves and select their leaders, worship publicly, \n     express and advocate religious beliefs, and distribute \n     religious literature) outside state-controlled religious \n     organizations and eliminate controls on the activities of \n     officially registered organizations. Allow indigenous \n     religious communities to conduct educational, charitable, and \n     humanitarian activities.\n       Permit religious groups to gather for annual observances of \n     primary religious holidays.\n       Return confiscated religious properties.\n       Permit domestic Vietnamese religious organizations and \n     individuals to interact with foreign organizations and \n     individuals.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I quote from this letter.\n\n       Congress Should Demand Religious-freedom Improvements As It \n     Considers Vietnam Trade Agreement.\n       The Senate will soon consider the Bilateral Trade Agreement \n     with Vietnam approved by the House of Representatives last \n     week.\n       Given the very serious violations of religious freedom in \n     that country, the Commission in May made a series of \n     recommendations to the Bush administration and Congress. \n     Primary among these was that U.S. lawmakers should ratify the \n     BTA only after Hanoi undertakes to improve protection of \n     religious freedom or after the Congress passes a resolution \n     calling for the Vietnamese government to make such \n     improvements.\n\n  You have the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom \nasking us to do this. The House did it, and we are not doing it.\n  The Vietnam Human Rights Act which passed the House last week \nimplements this and other Commission recommendations. The Commission \nurges the Senate to do likewise. However, we cannot do that because of \nthe fact that someone is holding it up. That, to me, is unfortunate.\n  I am going to propose a unanimous consent request. At that time, I \nknow the majority will object, but I want to propose it. I want to also \nsay that I may ask for this a number of times.\n  I believe the individual Senator or Senators who oppose having a vote \non human rights should come down and defend themselves. I would like to \nhear why it is we can't pass something that passed the House 410-1.\n  I know my colleague from Montana has a hearing to go to. I am more \nthan happy to yield to the Senator from Montana in just a second so \nthat he can go off to his hearing, providing I can reclaim the floor \nafter the Senator from Montana speaks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the vote on H.J. Res. 51, \nextension of nondiscrimination with respect to products of the \nSocialist Republic of Vietnam, the Senate immediately proceed to a vote \non final passage of H.R. 2833, the Vietnam Human Rights Act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I yield to Senator Baucus and that I can regain the floor after \nSenator Baucus completes his remarks.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator a question? I \ntemporarily object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator from New Hampshire \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Certainly.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I think it is only proper that the Senator from New \nHampshire regain the floor. I would just like his counsel, if he again \nasks unanimous consent whether he will refrain from doing so until \nsomebody is on the floor to object.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Absolutely.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my friend from New Hampshire. I deeply value his \nfriendship. We have worked very closely together in lots of matters, \nparticularly on the Environment and Public Works Committee. He is a man \nof tremendous integrity and is a very good Senator. I deeply appreciate \nhis efforts in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the House Joint Resolution 51, \nwhich would approve the trade agreement between the United States and \nVietnam. This agreement was signed last year, and it would extend \nnormal trade relations status to Vietnam.\n  It is identical to Senate Joint Resolution 16. That was approved \nunanimously by the Finance Committee in July of this year.\n  Our trade agreement with Vietnam represents an important step in a \nhealing process, a step that has been a long time in coming.\n  Let me just review the history a bit.\n  After two decades of relative isolation from one another, our two \ncountries began the process of normalizing ties and of healing in the \nmid-1990s.\n  In 1994, we lifted our embargo with Vietnam.\n  Then, in 1995, we normalized diplomatic relations, sending Pete \nPeterson to be our first Ambassador to Vietnam since the war. A true \nhero, Pete Peterson did a tremendous job, working with the Vietnamese \nto help locate missing American personnel, and to help facilitate the \norderly departure from Vietnam of refugees and other immigrants.\n\n[[Page S10108]]\n\n  In 1998, President Clinton waived the Jackson-Vanik prohibitions. \nThis enabled Vietnam to obtain access to financial credit and guarantee \nprograms sponsored by the U.S. Government.\n\n  Meanwhile, the Vietnamese Government has done its part. By all \naccounts, the Government has cooperated in efforts to fully account for \nmissing American personnel. As former Ambassador Peterson reported in \nJune 2000--I am quoting his report now--\n\n       Since 1993, [39] joint field activities have been conducted \n     in Vietnam, 288 possible American remains have been \n     repatriated, and the remains of 135 formerly unaccounted-for \n     American servicemen have been identified, including 26 since \n     January 1999.\n\n  Continuing to quote Ambassador Peterson:\n\n       This would not have been possible without bilateral \n     cooperation between the U.S. and Vietnam. Of the 196 \n     Americans that were on the Last Known Alive list, fate has \n     been determined for all but 41. . . .\n\n  Moreover, with respect to freedom of emigration--the underlying \npurpose of the Jackson-Vanik provisions--the President recently \nreported:\n\n       Overall, Vietnam's emigration policy has liberalized \n     considerably in the last decade and a half. Vietnam has a \n     solid record of cooperation with the United States to permit \n     Vietnamese emigration.\n       Over 500,000 Vietnamese have emigrated as refugees or \n     immigrants to the United States . . . and only a small number \n     of refugee applicants remain to be processed.\n\n  In light of this substantial progress in our relationship with \nVietnam, the next logical step is to begin normalizing our commercial \nties. The trade agreement concluded last year will do that.\n  That said, I and most of my colleagues have serious concerns about \nVietnam's human rights record. It is not good. The State Department's \nmost recent report describes the record as ``poor.'' It notes that \n``although there was some measurable improvement in a few areas, \nserious problems remain.'' These include: arbitrary arrests and \ndetentions, denials of fair and speedy trials to criminal defendants, \nsignificant restrictions on freedom of speech and the press, severe \nlimitations on freedom of religion, denial of worker rights, and \ndiscrimination against ethnic minorities.\n  Making improvements in these and other areas ought to be a top \npriority of the United States in our relationship with Vietnam. But \nestablishing a normal commercial relationship with Vietnam does not \nhinder that goal. Indeed, it complements our human rights efforts.\n  As our experience in countries such as China demonstrates, engagement \nworks. Engagement without illusions works. By interacting with \ncountries commercially, we bring them into closer contact with our \ndemocratic values. We generate demand for those values.\n  This does not mean that we can simply let trade begin to flow with \nVietnam and then sit back and watch; rather, we have to engage Vietnam \nand work actively with them to improve human rights in that country. \nThis process has already begun; and it needs to continue.\n  Our efforts include an annual high-level dialog with Vietnam on human \nrights. That exercise has had some success. While much work remains to \nbe done, former Ambassador Peterson reported toward the end of his 6-\nyear tenure that the Vietnamese Government has grown increasingly \ntolerant of public dissent.\n  The Government has also released key religious and political \nprisoners and loosened restrictions on religious practices.\n  Additionally, Vietnam recently allowed the International Labor \nOrganization to open an office in Hanoi. Supported by the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor, the ILO is providing technical assistance in areas \nranging from social safety nets, to workplace safety, to collective \nbargaining.\n  Further, it is likely that in the near future we will negotiate a \ntextiles agreement with Vietnam, as we did 2 years ago with Cambodia.\n  Such an agreement would set quotas on imports of Vietnamese textile \nand apparel products into the United States. As we did with Cambodia, \nwe should tie quota increases under such an agreement to improvements \nin worker rights.\n  Much work remains to be done to improve human rights in Vietnam, but \nengagement has gotten us off to a good start. And that is important. It \nis important to get off to a good start, get things moving in the right \ndirection.\n  Moreover, it is important to remember that by approving the trade \nagreement with Vietnam, we are not giving it so-called PNTR; that is, \npermanent normal trade relations. We are not doing that. We are not \ndoing for Vietnam what we did for China last year, in preparation for \nChina's accession into the World Trade Organization.\n  The step we are taking with Vietnam is much more modest. Vietnam \ncurrently has a disfavored trade status, one in which exports to the \nUnited States are subject to prohibitive tariffs. This agreement moves \nVietnam to a normal but probationary trade status.\n  Under the Jackson-Vanik provisions of the Trade Act, the President \nand Congress will still conduct annual reviews of Vietnam's trade \nstatus. These reviews will be an additional source of leverage in \nseeking improvement of human rights in Vietnam.\n  I would like to turn now to the substance of the agreement and the \nbenefits that we will gain from it.\n  At its core, the agreement will enable us to decrease tariffs on \nVietnamese imports to tariff levels applied to imports from most other \ncountries. Vietnam, in return, will apply to U.S. goods the same tariff \nrates it applies to other countries.\n  But this agreement goes well beyond a reciprocal lowering of tariffs. \nIt requires Vietnam, among other things, to lower tariffs on over 250 \ncategories of goods; to phase in import, export, and distribution \nrights for U.S.-owned companies; to adhere to intellectual property \nrights standards which, in some cases, exceed WTO standards; and to \nliberalize opportunities for U.S. companies to operate in key service \nsectors, including banking, insurance, and telecommunications.\n  This agreement should provide a sound foundation for a mutually \nbeneficial commercial relationship. It will build upon the increasingly \nstronger ties between the United States and Vietnam.\n\n  Indeed, I hope the efforts Vietnam makes to implement the agreement \nwill put it well along the way to eventual membership in the WTO.\n  Make no mistake, there still will be a lot of work to be done, even \nafter the agreement is approved. We will have to work with Vietnam to \nensure that its obligations on paper translate into actual practice. We \nwill also have to monitor operation of the agreement very carefully. \nBut I am confident that this agreement does get us off to a very good \nstart. That is critical.\n  I am pleased to support the resolution extending normal trade \nrelations status to Vietnam.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, my colleague from Montana \nmentioned human rights violations. Yet in spite of the fact that the \nHouse voted 410-1 to cite those violations, we cannot have a similar \nvote in the Senate today, either before or after voting on normal trade \nrelations with Vietnam. That is my issue and my concern, and it is why \nI did request unanimous consent to proceed to that bill.\n  For the life of me, I don't know why we choose to ignore these \nviolations. Everyone knows where the votes are on normal trade \nrelations. I know my view does not carry in this Chamber. But I don't \nunderstand why we can't at least vote on the human rights violations.\n  We should not approve the U.S.-Vietnam trade agreement without at \nleast addressing these human rights violations in Vietnam. I don't \nunderstand why we can't address them. What is the fear? That somehow we \nare going to antagonize the Vietnamese? I am going to be giving you \nsome information very shortly that makes one wonder why we would not \nwant to antagonize the Vietnamese. We will talk about that.\n  Let me first ask, what does this human rights act do that we are not \nallowed to pass it in the Senate because somebody is holding it up with \na secret hold? Well, it prevents the United States from providing \nnonhumanitarian assistance to the Government of Vietnam above 2001 \nlevels unless the President certifies that the Government of Vietnam \nhas made substantial\n\n[[Page S10109]]\n\nprogress toward releasing political and religious prisoners it holds; \nsecondly, that the Government of Vietnam has made substantial progress \ntoward respecting the right to freedom of religion, which it does not; \nthirdly, that the Government of Vietnam has made substantial progress \ntoward respecting human rights, which it does not do; and the \nGovernment of Vietnam is not involved in trafficking persons. They do \nthat, too.\n  We are going to ignore all that. We are going to ignore that, and we \ncan't possibly have a vote today to cite the Vietnamese for those human \nrights violations because somehow we are going to offend them.\n  We don't take that position against other nations that have human \nrights violations. The President has the ultimate waiver authority \nunder this legislation. If the continuation of assistance is deemed in \nthe national interest, if he thinks it is in the national interest, he \ncan waive these issues. He can waive the certification process, if he \nbelieves it is necessary. It is no big deal. There is no harm done if \nthe Senate would pass this resolution.\n  This resolution authorizes appropriations of up to $2 million to \nNGOs, nongovernment organizations, that promote human rights and \nnonviolent democratic change. It states: It is the policy of the U.S. \nGovernment to overcome the jamming of Radio Free Asia by the \nVietnamese. It authorizes $10 million over 2 years for that effort. It \nhelps Vietnamese refugees settle in the United States, especially those \nwho were prevented from doing so by actions of the Vietnamese, such as \nbribes and government interference. Yes, that goes on, too. We are \ngoing to ignore it, but it does go on.\n  It requires an annual report to Congress on the above-mentioned \nissues. As you can see, this is a very reasonable piece of legislation. \nIt doesn't tie the hands of the President. It only involves \nnonhumanitarian aid. It only concerns increases in nonhumanitarian aid \nabove the 2001 levels.\n\n  My personal belief is we should not approve normal trade relations \nwith Vietnam. I know where the votes are. I know this legislation will \npass.\n  I am particularly disgusted by a press report which contained an \nexcerpt from the Vietnamese People's Army Daily commenting on the \nrecent terrorist attacks. I want my colleagues to hear what the \nofficial organ of the Vietnamese Army thinks. And remember, they will \nprofit handsomely from this trade agreement with the United States.\n  As I display the quote, I want to put everything in perspective. We \nhad a terrorist attack, the worst ever in the history of America. This \nis what the Vietnamese official People's Army Daily said about it. In \nspite of that, we are not even allowed in the Senate to pass a \nresolution criticizing them for their human rights violations before we \ngive them normal trade status.\n  I heard the President of the United States very clearly state and \narticulate over and over again, you are either with us or you are \nagainst us. It is not gray. It is either black or white. You are on our \nside in the fight against terrorism or you are not. Let's read what \nthey said:\n\n       . . . it's obvious that through this incident, Americans \n     should take another look at themselves. If Americans had not \n     pursued isolationism and chauvinism, and if they had not \n     insisted on imposing their values on others in their own \n     subjective manner, then perhaps the twin towers would still \n     be standing together in the singing waves and breeze of the \n     Atlantic.\n\n  That is what they said. But we are going to ignore all that. This is \nVietnam. We now have to normalize trade relations with them, but we \ncan't even criticize them on their human rights violations. I will \nwithdraw any recorded vote on normal trade relations if we will just \nbring up by unanimous consent and vote on the human rights violations \nthat the House passed 410-1.\n  Of what are we afraid? Why are we afraid of offending? Do my \ncolleagues like that comment? How do they like that? How do they think \nthe 6,000 families feel about that comment? That is what they said.\n  If we think that is bad, while it is up there, let me give a few more \ncomments. This was 2 days after the incident:\n\n       A visit to the city's institutes of higher learning on \n     Thursday revealed an alarming level of excitement and \n     happiness over the recent devastating terrorist attacks in \n     the United States.\n\n  This was in the international news section of the Deutsche Presse. \nHere is what one person said on the streets of Hanoi:\n\n       ``Many people here consider this act of terrorism an act of \n     heroism, because they dared confront the almighty United \n     States,'' said one post-graduate student at Hanoi \n     Construction University. Another student, 22-year-old class \n     monitor Dang Quang Bao, said terrorism as a means is not \n     ideal.\n       ``But this helped the U.S. open its eyes, because it has \n     blindly imposed its power on the world through embargoes and \n     intervening in the internal affairs of other nations.\n       ``When people heard about the attack in America,'' he \n     added, ``many said it was legitimate.''\n       Privately, thousands if not millions of Vietnamese admire \n     the U.S. for its economic power, military supremacy. . . .\n       But Communist-ruled Vietnam, like many Third World nations, \n     maintains a testy relationship with the United States.\n       ``If Bush had died, I would be happier, because he's so \n     warlike,'' said Tran Huy Hanh, a student at the Construction \n     University who heads his class's chapter of the youth union.\n       ``America deserves this, because of all the suffering it \n     has caused humankind,'' said one freshman at National \n     Economics University.\n       ``But they should have attacked the headquarters of the \n     CIA, because the CIA serves America's political plots,'' he \n     said.\n\n  This Senate won't even give us a chance to vote to condemn their \nhuman rights violations. We are not even asking you to condemn this. \nAll we are asking you to do is condemn the human rights violations they \nare committing. What are we doing? What are we saying to the American \npeople?\n  It is unbelievable. I am stunned.\n  In the cafes and barber shops--not to mention the classrooms in \nHanoi--people expressed broad consensus that the U.S. reaped what it \nhas sown. Listen to this one: ``I feel sorry for the terrorists who \nwere very brave because they risked their lives,'' said a motorbike \nguard, who did not wish to be named, in Hanoi. ``I am happy,'' gloated \na 70-year-old Hanoian who said he was an army officer in wars against \nthe French and Americans. ``You see, America always boasts about its \npower, but what has happened proves America is not invincible.''\n  ``The United States is king of the jungle,'' said 25-year-old Phan \nHuy Son. ``When the king is attacked, the other animals are happy.''\n  This is what we got from Hanoi. Somebody will come down here and they \nwill read the official little cable that came in. That is what it said \n``officially.'' But this is what the People's Army Daily said on \nSeptember 13. It is outrageous in and of itself that they said it. But \nlet me tell you something. We are further compounding the outrage by \nstanding on the Senate floor and voting to normalize trade relations \nwith them. That is bad enough. But even worse, we don't have the guts \nto bring up on the Senate floor and pass something that was supported \n410-1. Don't tell me one Senator has a hold. I know one Senator has a \nhold on it. Let's go to that Senator and say take the hold off and let \nus vote on it, whatever the vote is.\n  ``The towers would still be standing together in the singing waves \nand breeze of the Atlantic'' were it not for us imposing values on \nothers. Does that sound like somebody who is for us? It sounds like \nsomebody who is against us to me. It is an insult, an outrage. I didn't \neven hear Saddam Hussein say that. It is an outrage that that was said. \nIt is a further outrage that we are compounding by refusing to even \nconsider the human rights violations. I understand a resolution \napproving normal trade relations is going to pass. I know it will pass. \nBut why can't we have a vote? Why can't we have a vote right now after \nthis debate on the human rights act?\n  Mr. President, after showing this material and talking about it, I am \ngoing to again, since there is representation of the majority side on \nthe floor, ask unanimous consent that following the vote on H.J. Res. \n51, the extension of nondiscriminatory treatment with respect to the \nproducts of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the Senate immediately \nproceed to and vote on final passage of H.R. 2833, the Vietnam Human \nRights Act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question \nbefore I object?\n\n[[Page S10110]]\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Certainly.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Has this resolution been referred to the Foreign \nRelations Committee?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The resolution passed the House 410-1. I \ndon't know if it has been referred to the committee. I assume so.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It has not. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. If it needs to be referred to the Foreign \nRelations Committee, it should be, and the Foreign Relations Committee \nshould act post haste and get it up to the Senate floor before we \nconsider the action we are now taking.\n  That is my point. We should not give free trade to a Communist regime \nthat ignores basic human rights and insults us--``insult'' isn't even \nstrong enough--by saying something like that, having those comments \nmade on the streets of Hanoi and proudly printing it in their \npropaganda rags. We stand here on the Senate floor and refuse to even \ntalk about it. That is outrageous.\n  It is my understanding that the bill has been held at the desk after \nthe House sent it over, to get it straight on the record.\n  I know my colleague from Iowa wishes to make some remarks, and I will \nbe happy to yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nGrassley, is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his kind \nyielding of the floor because I have to go to a hearing at 11 o'clock \nbefore the Senate Finance Committee when we are going to talk about a \nstimulus package. So I thank the Senator.\n  I support the joint resolution approving the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral \nTrade Agreement. I commend Chairman Baucus for his leadership in \nhelping to bring this historic agreement before the Senate today. I \nalso think we ought to take time to thank Senators McCain and Kerry for \ntheir strong support of the agreement. These two Senators just named \nare people who have been, for a long time, active in trying to work out \ntrade relations between the United States and Vietnam. Many times \nbefore now, I have opposed them in those efforts. Many times in the \npast, I have supported the Senator from New Hampshire in some of his \nefforts. I served with him for a long period of time on the Select \nCommittee on POW/MIAs during the beginning of the last decade to work \nthings out.\n  The reason I am for this trade agreement, as opposed to positions I \nhave taken in the past, is because I think that trade--for business men \nand women--between the United States and another country can probably \ndo more to promote human rights, market economic principles, and \npolitical freedom and political democracy, much more than we can as \npolitical leaders or diplomats working between two countries. I see a \nvery beneficial impact over the long haul--not maybe the short haul--to \nchanging a lot of things in Vietnam. The Senator from New Hampshire has \nraised issues about it, and legitimately so.\n  It is a fact that our Nation's healing process over Vietnam is not \nyet complete, nor may it ever be. But passage of this historic \nagreement, I believe, will aid us in the healing process. Approving the \nagreement will have other profound consequences for both nations and \nbenefit to our Nation as well because I look at international trade as \nnot benefiting the country that we are having the agreement with but \nbenefiting the United States. If it doesn't benefit us, there is no \npoint in our doing it.\n  When you look at the purpose of our trade arrangements, they are \nobviously to help our consumers; but more importantly, they are to \nenhance entrepreneurship within our country, expand our economy, and in \nthe process, create jobs. If we don't create jobs, there is no point in \nour having the sort of trade arrangements that we have. We do create \njobs when we have enhanced international trade. A lot of statistics \nshow thousands and thousands of jobs are created with trade, and not \nonly are jobs created, but jobs that pay 15 percent above the national \naverage.\n  First, as far as this agreement is concerned, having consequences \nthat are good, approval of the resolution will further strengthen our \nrelations with Vietnam, a process that began under President George \nBush in the early 1990s. President Clinton, putting our national \ninterests first, diligently pursued the same policy started by the \nelder Bush.\n  President George W. Bush took another historic step on the road to \nbetter and more prosperous relations by sending this Vietnam bilateral \ntrade agreement to Congress for approval on July 8 of this year.\n  Second, approval of this resolution will enable workers and farmers \nto take advantage of a sweeping bilateral trade agreement with Vietnam.\n  This agreement covers virtually every aspect of trade with Vietnam, \nfrom trade in services to intellectual property rights and investment.\n  The agreement includes specific commitments by Vietnam to reduce \ntariffs on approximately 250 products, about four-fifths of which are \nagricultural goods, and U.S. investors, in addition, will have specific \nlegal protections unavailable to those same investors today.\n  Government procurement will become more open and transparent. Vietnam \nwill be required to adhere to a number of multilateral disciplines on \ncustoms procedures, import licensing and sanitary and phytosanitary \nmeasures, which are so important to making sure that we do not have \nnontariff trade barriers in agricultural products.\n  There is no doubt that implementation of the United States-Vietnam \nbilateral trade agreement will open new markets for U.S. manufactured \ngoods, services, and our farm products.\n  It is a win for American workers, but it is also going to benefit the \nVietnamese people.\n  Continued engagement through open trade will help the country \nprosper. Adherence to the rule of law, or rule-based trading systems, \nwill also further establish the rule of law in Vietnam. It is truly a \nwin-win for both nations.\n\n  Finally, it is my sincere hope that passage of this joint resolution \nwill help pave the way for even greater trade accomplishments yet this \nyear. One of the most important things we can do for our Nation before \nwe adjourn is to pass what is now called trade promotion authority \nwhich gives the President of the United States authority to negotiate \nin the manner that we have negotiated down trade barriers and tariffs \nsince 1947, originally under the General Agreements on Tariffs and \nTrades and now under the World Trade Organization regime.\n  Our President must have all the tools we can offer, particularly at \nthis time of economic uncertainty which happened as a result of the \nterrorist attacks on September 11. In my mind, there would be no more \nimportant tool at this time of economic uncertainty than trade \npromotion authority.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told the Finance Committee \nthe other day that terror causes people to pull back; in other words, \nto lose confidence, to not do normal economic activity, the normal \nspending and investment. That is what September 11 was all about. We \nsee it in our economy today.\n  According to Chairman Greenspan, trade promotion authority is a vital \ntool encountering the tendency of people and nations to pull back and \nthen lower their confidence in their own economy which affects the \nworld economy collectively.\n  Most important, Alan Greenspan told us that Congress giving the \nPresident trade promotion authority will say to terrorists: You will \nnot stop the global economic cooperation that has brought so much good \nand prosperity to the world just because of terrorist attacks that we \nhave had in this country.\n  I think Chairman Greenspan has it absolutely right. Passing trade \npromotion authority will enable the President to help jump-start the \nworld economy through trade. Passing trade promotion authority and \nlaunching a new round of WTO trade negotiations this November at the \nministerial meeting in Qatar is a vital step toward economic recovery \nand restoring the long-term economic growth that benefits workers and \nfarmers everywhere.\n  As I conclude this comment on the Vietnam bilateral trade agreement, \nlet me say, as important as it is, and that is an important step toward \nfinishing our trade agenda, so is the trade promotion authority for the \nPresident.\n\n[[Page S10111]]\n\n  The Vietnam agreement then is just one step. Our trade agenda is not \ndone. Let's do the right thing for the President and for the American \npeople and follow Chairman Greenspan's advice. Let's work together to \nfinish our trade agenda and pass trade promotion authority this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nresolution before us. First I commend the Senator from Iowa for his \nleadership on trade issues, his leadership on economic issues, and I \ncertainly associate myself with his remarks regarding trade promotion \nauthority and the need for the President to have that authority.\n  I also commend the Senator from New Hampshire for his remarks \nregarding the human rights situation in Vietnam. I agree. We should \nhave the opportunity to vote on a resolution condemning the human \nrights record in Vietnam. It would only be appropriate to follow the \nprecedent of the House in, while passing normal trade relations with \nVietnam, also passing by an overwhelming margin a resolution condemning \nthe human rights record.\n  The Senator from Iowa mentioned that trade benefits us. It should \nbenefit us, and that should be the standard by which we engage these \nkinds of agreements. I ask the question: Will this agreement really do \nthat?\n  He also mentions the fact that it should create jobs. Certainly \ntrade, if it is fair and free trade, will create jobs.\n  The American consumer today is being purposefully confused, and our \ndomestic farm-raised catfish industries are on the brink of bankruptcy \nin this country primarily due in large part to the massive exports from \nVietnam of a product called basa fish. If this were any other product--\nif it were steel, for instance--it would be called dumping.\n  We have seen an incredible increase in the exports of basa fish to \nthe United States and having it labeled within our country as being \ncatfish. That blatant mislabeling is causing confusion among the \nAmerican people and is absolutely destroying our domestic catfish \nindustry.\n\n  The States of Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana produce \n95 percent of the Nation's catfish. These catfish are grain-fed and \nfarm-raised catfish produced under strict health and environmental \nregulations. Today, with the passage of this resolution, we are helping \nVietnam while we are doing absolutely nothing to help United States \naquaculture, United States catfish farmers who are on the brink of \nbankruptcy.\n  Arkansas ranks second in the amount of catfish produced nationally, \nbut it is an industry that has grown and thrived in one of the poorest \nareas of our country, the Mississippi Delta, an area that has sometimes \nbeen referred to as the Appalachia of the nineties. It is an area that \nfaces incredible economic challenges. Despite the strong work ethic, \ndespite the strong spirit of the delta region, economic opportunities \nhave been few and far between.\n  I ask my colleagues who are thinking about improving the economy of \nVietnam, let's first think about what, with our current trade practice, \nwe are doing to the aquaculture industry in the United States which has \nbeen one of the few shining success stories in this deprived, poor \nregion of our Nation.\n  At a time when fears of unemployment and the realities of an economic \ndownturn in the wake of the September 11 attacks are weighing heavily \non the minds of the American people, it is not acceptable--it should \nnot be acceptable--to sit back and watch an important industry that \nemploys thousands of Americans, thousands of my constituents in the \nState of Arkansas, and see their industry crushed by inferior imports \nbecause of a glitch in our regulatory system.\n  Vietnamese basa is being confused by the American public as catfish \ndue to labeling that allows them to be called basa catfish. These \nVietnamese basa are being imported at record levels. Let me explain.\n  In June of this year, 648,000 pounds were imported into the United \nStates. For the past 7 months, imports have averaged 382,000 pounds per \nmonth. To put that in perspective, in all of 1997, there were only \n500,000 pounds of Vietnamese basa imported. We are almost doing that \nevery month now. It is predicted that nearly 20 million pounds could be \nimported this year. That is an incredible 4,000-percent increase in 4 \nyears.\n  I want my colleagues to think about an industry in their State that \ncould survive--could it survive?--imports that had increased at the \nlevel of 4,000 percent in a 4-year period of time under mislabeling, \nconfusing regulations.\n  The Vietnamese penetration into this market in the last year alone \nhas more than tripled. Market penetration has risen from 7 percent to \n23 percent of the total market. Four years ago, the Vietnamese basa, \nwrongly labeled ``catfish,'' comprised less than 10 percent--to be \nexact, 7 percent--of the catfish market in the United States. Today it \nis almost one-quarter of the catfish market in the United States.\n  They have been able to achieve such remarkable market penetration by \nusing the label of ``catfish'' on the packaging while selling this \ndifferent species of fish for $1.25 a pound cheaper. It is a different \nspecies and is $1.25 a pound cheaper. It is being sold as what is \nproduced in the United States, true channel catfish.\n  For those who argue this is the result of a competitive market, I \noffer a few facts. When the fish were labeled and marketed as \nVietnamese basa or just plain basa, sales in this country were almost \nnonexistent. Some importers even tried to label basa as white grouper, \nbelieving that was going to lead to greater sales. Still no success.\n  However, by adding the name ``catfish'' to the label, these fish have \nseen sales skyrocket. Although the Food and Drug Administration issued \nan order on September 19 stating the correct labeling of Vietnamese \nbasa be a high priority, the FDA is allowing these fish to retain the \nlabel of ``catfish'' in the title. I do not know whether it is by \nbudget constraints or whether it is a lack of personnel at the FDA, but \nit is obvious that inspections have been lacking in the past and the \ninclusion of the term of ``catfish'' in the title serves to promote \nthat confusion.\n  This illustration shows how Vietnamese companies and rogue U.S. \nimporters are trying to confuse the American people. Names such as \n``cajun delight,'' ``delta fresh,'' and ``farm select'' lead consumers \nto believe the product is something that it is not.\n  In fact, the brand ``delta fresh'' is one of the most misleading \nbecause it implies in the very title ``delta fresh catfish'' that it is \nbeing grown in the delta of the Mississippi, in Arkansas and \nMississippi.\n  The reality is, it is fish from the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, which \nhas unhealthy, environmentally unsafe conditions, being sold to the \nAmerican consumer as channel-grown, farm-grown catfish.\n  The total impact of the catfish industry on the U.S. economy is \nestimated to exceed $4 billion annually. Approximately 12,000 people \nare employed by this industry. I have been told by the catfish \nassociation that as many as 25 percent of the catfish farmers in \nArkansas will be forced out of business if this problem is not \ncorrected soon.\n  Now let me remind my colleagues, this is the poorest region of the \nUnited States. It is poorer than what the Appalachian region was when \nwe went in with massive national support. Yet this region, which has \nhad very few bright spots in its economy in the last decade, has seen \naquaculture as perhaps being the salvation of the economy in the delta \nof Arkansas. Twenty-five percent of these catfish farmers could be gone \nin the next year if we do not correct this problem.\n  Catfish farmers in this country have invested millions of dollars \neducating the American public about the nutritional attributes of \ncatfish. Through their efforts, American consumers have an expectation \nof what a catfish is and how it is raised. They have an expectation \nthat what they purchase is indeed a catfish and that it has been raised \nand farmed in a clean and environmentally safe environment.\n  All of the investment that the American catfish industry has made in \norder to educate the American people is being kidnapped by Vietnamese \nbasa growers and rogue importers who are bringing this product in and \npretending that it is that same product, and it is not.\n\n[[Page S10112]]\n\n  This next poster shows an official list of both scientific names and \nmarket common names from the Food and Drug Administration. Almost all \nof these fish can contain the word ``catfish'' in their names under \ncurrent FDA rules. We can see all of the very scientific names, and yet \nall of these various scientific names are allowed to use ``catfish'' in \ntheir market or common names creating incredible confusion among the \nconsuming public, understandably.\n  Most people look, they see the word ``catfish,'' and they do not pay \nany attention to the rest of that package labeling. When the average \nArkansan hears the word ``catfish,'' the idea of a typical channel \ncatfish is what comes to mind. When they sit down at a restaurant and \norder a plate of fried catfish, that same channel catfish is what they \nexpect to be eating.\n\n  The channel catfish, as we can see, there is a whole list of other \nvarieties that are now being allowed to usurp that name.\n  One cannot blame the restaurateur who is offered ``catfish for a \ndollar less a pound'' for buying it. It is basa. It is not catfish. \nHowever, in many cases they do not realize that what they are really \nbuying is not American-grown channel catfish but Vietnamese basa, that \nit is not subject to health and safety standards, not grown in clean \nponds, not fed as American catfish are fed.\n  The third poster shows the relationship between these fish, and you \nwill notice they are in different families and--only in the same order \nbut totally separate families. The FDA claims since the fish are the \nsame order, they can have the word ``catfish'' in their market or \ncommon name, even though they are not in the same family, they are not \nin the same genus, and they are not in the same species. By this \nstandard, cats and cattle could be labeled the same.\n  In addition, it is important to note the conditions in which these \nfish are raised. U.S. catfish producers raise catfish in pristine ponds \nthat are closely monitored. These ponds are carefully aerated and the \nfish are fed granulated pellets consisting of grains composed of \nsoybean, corn, and cotton seed, all in strict compliance with Federal, \nState, and local health and safety laws.\n  What we are asking those catfish growers to compete with is \nVietnamese basa which now composes almost a quarter of the domestic \nmarket. These other species, basa, are raised in cages in the Mekong \nDelta, one of the most polluted watersheds in the world. It has been \nreported that these fish are exposed to many unhealthy elements, \nincluding raw sewage.\n  I say to my colleagues, they would not allow the United States Food \nand Drug Administration to permit medicine to come in from such \nunhealthy, environmentally unsafe conditions. Yet we are allowing the \nAmerican consuming public to eat basa labeled as catfish, grown in \nunhealthy environments, and not know the reality of what they are \ngetting.\n  It is obvious the use of the label ``catfish'' is being used to \nmislead consumers and is unfairly harming our domestic industry. I \nthink it is odd we continue to look for new and more open trade \npolicies to provide other nations access to our markets when we \ncontinually fail to enforce meaningful fairness provisions.\n  As we sit on the brink of allowing another trade bill to pass this \nCongress, I want to reiterate a phrase that I have heard over and over: \nFree trade only works if it is fair trade.\n  This is not fair. Our regulatory agencies must recognize their \nresponsibilities and act on them.\n  I realize this trade bill is not the answer to this problem. I \nunderstand this is a labeling issue, a regulatory issue, but I could \nnot allow us to pass a trade bill that is going to benefit Vietnam at a \ntime that we are so lax in our regulatory environment we are allowing a \ndomestic industry to be gutted while we approve trade relations with a \ncountry that is destroying this domestic industry.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support me and the congressional \ndelegations of Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama as we move \nforward in trying to resolve this pressing issue, be it through \nregulatory changes or be it through legislative mandate. I thank my \ncolleagues for their willingness to allow me to make my case on this \nimportant issue.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the time until 2 p.m. today be \nequally divided as provided under the statute governing consideration \nof H.J. Res. 51, and that at 2 p.m. today, the joint resolution be read \na third time and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the joint \nresolution, with rule 12, paragraph 4 being waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. It is the intention of the majority leader, after the \nvote--this is not in the form of a unanimous consent request but, in a \nsense, an advisory one--as it was announced early today it is the \nmajority leader's intention to go to the airport security legislation \nimmediately after that vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to support the resolution, but I \nwant to urge the Senate to take up the issue of airport security. \nSenator Hollings, Senator McCain, and I have introduced legislation, \ntogether with other colleagues, that we believe is absolutely critical \nto the restoration of the confidence of the American people with \nrespect to flying.\n  I have been on any number of flights, as have my colleagues. We have \nbeen flying since September 11 many times, many of us, but obviously \nthe American people remain uncertain and they want the highest level of \nsafety, not simply be told it is safe. The highest level of safety is \ngoing to come when we have the highest standards that are enforceable, \nfully enforceable, with the kind of professional training and \naccountability that will do that. I hope this afternoon our colleagues \nwill recognize the importance of this.\n\n  I met this morning with a person from a travel agency who does most \nof the reservations for the airlines. They went from selling 20,000 \ntickets a day to 2 in one day. Now they are back up around 10,000 or \nso, but 50 percent in a business with a margin of 1 percent is not \nsufficient. We clearly need to do everything possible in order to \nrestore the confidence, and not just the confidence, but provide a \nlevel of security that Americans have a right to expect--not just \ntomorrow, not just for a few months, not as a matter of confidence-\nbuilding in the aftermath of what happened, but for all of time out in \nthe future. We can do that, and we need to do it rapidly.\n  I listened carefully to the Senator from Arkansas, and indeed he \nnegated his entire argument at the end by saying: I recognize this is \nregulatory. In point of fact, what he is complaining about has nothing \nto do with the resolution we are passing today because all you have to \ndo is label the fish differently. You can put ``Arkansas grown,'' you \ncan put ``American grown,'' you can label any other kind of fish any \nway you want. If people are concerned about it, then, by gosh, they \nought to turn to the FDA.\n  This trade agreement with Vietnam benefits both countries. Vietnam \ngets lower tariffs on its goods entering the United States, but \nVietnamese tariffs on American goods will also be reduced. That will be \na boon to the American exporter.\n  This agreement is another major step in the process of normalizing \nrelations with Vietnam--a long, painstaking process which began with \nPresident Reagan, moved to President Bush, was continued by President \nClinton, and now this administration supports it. This is an agreement \nthe administration supports and with which they believe we should move \nforward.\n  None of us diminishes the importance of human rights, the importance \nof change in a country that remains authoritarian in its government. We \nobject to that. I have said that many times. My hope in the long haul \nwill be that we will celebrate one day the full measure of democracy in \nVietnam through the rest of Asia. The question is, How do you get \nthere? What is the best way to promote change? What is the best way to \ntry to succeed in moving down a road of measured cooperation that \nallows people to accomplish a whole series of goals that are important \nto us as a country?\n\n[[Page S10113]]\n\n  I know Senator McCain and Senator Hagel join me. As former combat \nservicemen in Vietnam, both very strongly believe that this particular \napproach of engaging Vietnam is the way in which we will best continue \nthe process of change that we have witnessed already significantly in \nthe country of Vietnam. We believe this trade agreement is another \nmajor step in the process of normalizing those relations and in moving \nforward in a way that benefits the United States as we do it.\n  This is the most sweeping and detailed agreement the United States \nhas ever negotiated with a so-called Jackson-Vanik country. It focuses \non four core areas: Trade in goods, intellectual property rights, trade \nin services, and investment. But it also includes important chapters on \nbusiness facilitation and transparency. It is a win-win for the United \nStates and for Vietnam in the way in which it will engage Vietnam and \nbring it further along the road to transparency, accountability, the \nadoption of business practices that are globally accepted and \nultimately the changes that come through the natural process of that \nkind of engagement, to a recognition of a different kind of value \nsystem and practice.\n\n  The Government of Vietnam has agreed to undertake a wide range of \nsteps to open its markets to foreign trade and investment, including \ndecreasing tariffs on key American goods; eliminating non-tariff and \ntariff barriers on the import of agricultural and industrial goods; \nreducing barriers and opening its markets to United States services, \nparticularly in the key sectors of banking and distribution, insurance \nand telecommunications; protecting intellectual property rights \npursuant to international standards; increasing market access for \nAmerican investments and eliminating investment-distorting policies; \nand adopting measures to promote commercial transparency.\n  These commitments, some of which are phased in over a reasonable \nschedule of time in the next few years, will improve the climate for \nAmerican investors and, most importantly, give American farmers, \nmanufacturers, producers of software, music, and movies, and American \nservice providers access to Vietnam's growing market.\n  Vietnam is a marketplace of 80 million people. Only 5 percent of the \npopulation of Vietnam is over the age of 65; 40 percent, maybe more, of \nthe population of Vietnam is under the age of 30. If 40 percent of the \ncountry is under the age of 30, that means they were born at the end of \nthe war and since the war, and their knowledge is of a very different \nworld. It is important to remember that and to continue to bring \nVietnam into the world community and into a different set of practices.\n  For Vietnam, this agreement provides access to the largest market in \nthe world on normal trade relations status (NTR) at a time when \neconomic growth in this country has slowed. Equally important, it \nsignals that the United States is committed to expanded economic ties \nand further normalization of the bilateral relationship.\n  This agreement was signed over 1 year ago. The Bush Administration \nsent it to Congress June 8. The House of Representatives approved it by \na voice vote on September 6--an indication of the strong bipartisan \nsupport that exists for it. We can now complete a major step in moving \nforward by approving it in the Senate.\n  In closing, on the subject of human rights, I believe we are making \nprogress. Many of the American nongovernmental organizations working in \nVietnam and even some of our veterans groups--Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica and the VFW--support the notion that we should continue to move \ndown the road in the way we have been with respect to the relationship \nand our related efforts to promote human rights. We need to maintain \naccountability. We should never turn our backs on American values. But \nthere are different tools. Sometimes the tools can be overly blunt and \ncounterproductive, and sometimes the tools achieve their goals in ways \nthat advance the interests of all parties concerned.\n  In my judgment, passing this trade agreement separately on its own, \nis the way to continue to advance the interests of the United States \nboth in terms of human rights, as well as our larger economic interests \nsimultaneously. I urge my colleagues to adopt this resolution of \napproval.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business when the Senator from Massachusetts concludes his \nremarks.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder \nof our time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wyden are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns with \nthe United States-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement and the problems \nthat have been associated with Vietnamese fish that are displacing the \nAmerican catfish industry.\n  Just two days after the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Socialist \nRepublic of Vietnam's official, state-run media ran a story that \nstated,\n\n       It's obvious that through this incident, Americans should \n     take another look at themselves. If Americans had not pursued \n     isolationism and chauvinism, and if they had not insisted on \n     imposing their values on others in their own subjective \n     manner, then perhaps the twin towers would still be standing \n     together in the singing waves and breeze of the Atlantic.\n\n  I think that is indicative of the fact that the Vietnamese Government \ndoes not have a friendly view of the United States. We aren't imposing \nour views on people around the world. They are trying to impose their \nviews on us. We have been attacked for it. I am offended by that. I \nthink the American people ought to know that. The President said these \nnations ought to choose whether they are for us or against us with \nregard to eliminating terrorism. I wasn't pleased with that comment \nfrom Vietnam.\n  I want to make the note that they are apparently attempting to move \nin some direction toward a market economy, which I celebrate. Although \nwe had a long and bitter and difficult war with them, I certainly \nbelieve that we can move beyond that conflict and that we can work \ntogether in the future. But comments such as the one I just read are \nnot a way to build bridges between our nations. A nation that considers \nitself responsible should not make a statement like that at the very \nsame time they are asking for trade benefits with this country.\n  We know what this will amount to. It will amount to the fact that \nthey will sell a lot more in the United States than they will buy from \nus.\n  That is the way it works on these trade agreements. I am sure we have \nthat today with China. We find that for every one dollar China buys \nfrom us, the United States buys four dollars from them. But I want to \ntalk about this specific issue. It is frustrating to me.\n  Since 1997, the import volume of frozen fish filets from Vietnam that \nare imported and sold as ``catfish'' has increased at incredibly high \nrates. The volume has risen from less than 500,000 pounds to over 7 \nmillion pounds per year in the previous three years. The trend has \ncontinued this year-the-Vietnamese penetration into the U.S. catfish \nfilet market alone has tripled in the last year from about 7 percent of \nthe market to 23 percent.\n  The Vietnamese are selling their product in the U.S. for $1.25 less \nthan U.S. processors. Because of this, the prices that U.S. processors \npay U.S. catfish farmers has dropped, causing significant losses and \nthreatening farmers, processors, supplying feed mills, employees and \ncommunities dependent on the industry.\n  U.S. catfish farm production, which occurs mainly in Alabama, \nMississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana, accounts for 68 percent of the \npounds of fish sold and 50 percent of the total value of all U.S. \naquaculture, or fish farming, production.\n  That is a remarkable figure. Sixty-eight percent of the poundage of \nfish produced by aquaculture are catfish produced mainly in my State \nand others in the region.\n  The area where most of our catfish production comes from is an area \nof\n\n[[Page S10114]]\n\nthe State in which I was raised. That is, indeed, the poorest area of \nAlabama. We have very few cash-producing sources of income in that area \nof the State. Much of it has been lost. But there has been a bright \nspot in catfish--both in production of ponds, the scientific research, \nthe feed mills and the processing of it. It produces quite a little \nspurt of positive economic growth in this very poor industry.\n  Seventy-five percent of the employees--I have been told--at these \nprocessing plants are single mothers. That is where many of them get \ntheir first job.\n  Catfish farming is a significant industry for many areas of our \ncountry. The problem is this: The fish that the Vietnamese are \nimporting which are displacing U.S.-raised catfish are not catfish at \nall. They are basa fish, which are not even of the same family, genus, \nor species of North American channel catfish. They do not even look \nlike North American channel catfish. These basa fish are being shipped \ninto the United States and labeled as catfish. These labels claim that \nthe frozen fish filets are Cajun catfish, implying they are from the \nMississippi Delta or from Louisiana. In fact, they are from the Mekong \nDelta in South Vietnam. As a result, American consumers believe they \nare purchasing and eating United States farm-raised catfish when they \nare, in fact, eating Vietnamese basa.\n  Indeed, for some American people, who are not used to catfish, there \nhas been an odd reluctance--I guess I can understand it--to eating \ncatfish. The name of it makes them a bit uneasy. They wonder about \neating catfish. But the American catfish industry has gradually, over a \nperiod of years, been able to wear down that image and show that \ncatfish is one of the absolutely finest fish you can eat. It is a \ndelight. And more and more people are eating it.\n  The American catfish industry has invested a long time in creating a \nmarket for which no market ever existed before. And now we have the \nVietnamese shipping in a substantial amount--and it is continuing to \ngrow at record levels--of what is not even catfish, and marketing it \nunder the name of American catfish, a product that has been improved \nand has gained support throughout our country. So it really is a \nfraudulent deal.\n  Also, the Vietnamese basa fish are raised in conditions that are \nsubstantially different from the way that United States catfish are \nraised and processed.\n  I remember, as a young person, the Ezell Catfish House on the \nTombigbee River. The fish were caught out of the river and sold there. \nReally the Ezell family was key to the beginning of catfish popularity. \nBut people felt better about pond-raised catfish because the water is \ncleaner and there is less likelihood there would be the pollutants that \nwould be in the river. So when you buy American catfish in a \nrestaurant, overwhelmingly, 99 percent is pond-raised catfish. It is \nclean and well managed, according to high American standards.\n\n  That is not true of Vietnamese basa fish. These fish come out of the \nMekong River. Most of these fish in Vietnam are grown in floating \ncages, under the fishermen's homes, along the Mekong River. They are \nable to produce fish at a low cost because of cheap labor, loose \nenvironmental regulations, and other regulations. I understand that the \nworkers in Vietnamese processing plants are paid one dollar a day. And \nunlike other imported fish, such as tilapia or orange roughy, these \nfish are imported as an intended substitute for American farm-raised \ncatfish.\n  A group of Alabama catfish farmers visited Vietnam last November and \ntoured a number of the basa farms and processing plants. They witnessed \nthe use of chemicals that have been banned in the United States for \nover 20 years, the use of human and animal waste as feed, and \ntemperatures in processing plants too warm to ensure the freshness of \nthe fish being processed there. These fish, of questionable quality, \nare being sent in record numbers to the United States and are \nfraudulently labeled as catfish.\n  If the Vietnamese were raising North American channel catfish of good \nquality and importing them into the United States, I could understand \nthat. That would be fair trade. But fair trade is not importing basa \nfish, labeling them as catfish, and passing them off to American \nconsumers as a quality pond-raised and processed catfish.\n  But there are some things our Federal Government can do to enforce \nand clarify our existing laws. So I am pleased today to join with \nSenator Hutchinson and Senator Lincoln, and others, to introduce \nlegislation that will eliminate the use of the word ``catfish'' with \nany species that are not North American catfish. This small step will \nhelp clarify FDA regulations and lessen consumer confusion.\n  In addition, the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal agency \ncharged with protecting the safety of the American food supply, can \nbegin inspecting more packages as they come into the United States to \nensure that they are labeled in a legal manner. The FDA, the Customs \nService, and the Justice Department need to vigorously pursue criminal \nviolations in this regard, if appropriate.\n  Currently, the FDA allows at least five violations before they will \ntake any enforcement action beyond a letter of reprimand to the company \nimporting the mislabeled fish. That does not make good sense to me. The \nFDA allows an astounding number of violations before they do anything. \nSo I encourage the FDA, the Customs Service, and the Justice Department \nto take every step they can in these matters.\n  I am disappointed there are no provisions in this trade agreement to \naddress the problems of the catfish industry. While this trade \nagreement is not amendable--and I understand that--I want to take the \nopportunity while the Senate is considering this agreement to express \nmy concerns for the way the Vietnamese fish industry is confusing \nAmerican consumers and causing economic hardship in my State and \nothers.\n  For these reasons, I expect, Mr. President, to vote against this \nagreement.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague, I certainly \nhave respect for and appreciate his concern about a local industry, but \nI think, as I said to Senator Hutchinson, this is a matter of labeling, \nit is a matter of regulatory process. It is not a question of whether \nor not you improve the overall agreement. I also say to my colleague--\nhe may not be aware of it--obviously, the People's Army Daily, the \nArmy, are the hardliners. And there is a struggle going on in Vietnam \nbetween the reformers and the hardliners, as there are in many \ncountries that are trying to deal with this kind of process of change. \nThat statement by the Army colonel is not representative of the \nGovernment.\n  I would like to share with all my colleagues that the President of \nVietnam, the very next day after the terrorist attack, sent this \nmessage to the United States:\n\n       The government and people of Vietnam were shocked by the \n     tragedy that happened on the morning of 11 September 2001. We \n     would like to convey to the government and people of the \n     United States, especially the victims' families, our profound \n     condolences. Consistently, Vietnam protests against terrorist \n     acts that bring deaths and sufferings to civilians.\n\n  This is the comment I received from the Foreign Minister:\n\n       Your Excellency Mr. Senator,\n       I was extremely shocked and deeply moved by the tragedy \n     happening in the United States on the 11 September 2001 \n     morning. I would like to extend to you, and through you, to \n     the families of the victims, my deepest condolences. I am \n     confident that the U.S. Government and people will soon \n     overcome this difficult moment. We strongly condemn the \n     terrorist attack and are willing to work closely with the \n     United States and other countries in the fight against \n     terrorist acts.\n\n  This is a media report from the German press, Deutsche Presse. This \nis from Hanoi:\n\n       American businesspeople, aid workers, and embassy officials \n     said Wednesday they have been overwhelmed with the amount of \n     support and sympathy offered by Vietnamese over last week's \n     devastating terrorist attacks in the United States.\n       While Vietnam's normally reserved state media has confined \n     its expressions of sorrow to an announcement by President Duc \n     Luong, personal reactions by Vietnamese have been deep and \n     heartfelt.\n       ``There has been a real outpouring of sympathy,'' said a \n     spokesman at the U.S. Consulate in Ho Chi Minh city, the \n     former Saigon. Bouquets of flowers were left at the\n\n[[Page S10115]]\n\n     building's entrance, while locals and expatriates lined up \n     last week to sign a condolence book.\n       Similar acts were played out at the embassy in Hanoi where \n     senior Vietnamese officials and contacts paid their respects.\n       There have been reports of some U.S. firms receiving \n     donations from Vietnamese for families of the victims in the \n     United States.\n\n  So I really think we have to recognize that the transition for the \nmilitary is obviously slower and far more complicated, as it is with \nthe People's Liberation Army in China, versus what the leadership is \ntrying to do as they bring their own country along. I really think we \nneed to take recognition of these facts.\n  The fact is, there is participation in religious activities in \nVietnam that continues to grow. Churches are full. I have been to \nchurch in Vietnam. They are full on days of worship and days of \nremembrance. Is it more controlled than we would like it? Yes. Has it \nchanged. Yes? Is it continuing to change? Yes.\n  I think we should also recognize that last year some 500 cases were \nadjudicated by labor courts. And there were 72 strikes last year, and \nmore than 450 strikes in Vietnam since 1993. So even within the labor \nmovement there has been an increasing empowerment of workers, and there \nhas been change.\n  Are things in Vietnam as we would want them to be tomorrow? The \nanswer is no. But have they made progress well beyond other countries \nwith whom we trade? You bet they have. Is their human rights record \neven better than the Chinese? Yes, it is. We need to take cognizance of \nthese things.\n  Let me correct one statement of the Senator from New Hampshire. I am \nnot alone in objecting to this particular attempt to try to bring the \nhuman rights bill to the floor in conjunction with action on the trade \nagreement. I am for having a human rights statement at the appropriate \ntime. This is not the appropriate time. There are Senators on both \nsides of the aisle and a broad-based group of Senators who believe this \nis not the moment and the place for this particular separate piece of \nlegislation. At some point in the future, we would be happy to consider \nit under the normal legislative process.\n  I respect the comments of the Senator, but I hope we will take notice \nof the official recognition that has come from Vietnam with respect to \nthe terrorist attacks on the United States.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will yield for a question. I need to move off the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the hard work of the Senator. Having \nserved his country with great distinction in Vietnam, he certainly has \nthe honor and the authority to lead us in a new relationship with that \ncountry. I hope it will succeed. I tend to believe that is one of the \ngreat characteristics of America, that we can move past conflicts. It \nis with some reluctance that I believe, because of this trade issue, \nthat I ought to vote against it.\n  Mr. KERRY. I understand and respect that very much from the Senator, \nand I thank him for his generous comments. I also remind colleagues \nthat we are not relinquishing our right to continue to monitor, as we \nshould, human rights in Vietnam or in any country. This is not \npermanent trade relations status. This is annual trade relations. What \nwe are granting is normal trade relations status that must be reviewed \nannually as required by the Jackson-Vanik amendment. This annual review \nwill allow us to continue to monitor Vietnam's human rights \nperformance.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, we are now debating the trade agreement \nwith Vietnam which not only provides normal trade relations status with \nthat country but also includes with it a bilateral trade agreement that \nwe have negotiated with Vietnam.\n  Normal trade relations, which used to be called most-favored-nation \nstatus but has since been changed, are relations we have with almost \nevery country in the world. I believe there are only five countries \nwith which we do not have normal trade relations. This bill bestows \nnormal trade relations with respect to Vietnam but does it on a yearly \nbasis so the Congress will review it year by year.\n  Vietnam is a Communist country; it has a Communist government. It has \nan economic system that is moving towards a market-based economy. I, \nalong with several of my colleagues, Senator Daschle, Senator Leahy, \nJohn Glenn, and a couple others, visited Vietnam a few years ago. It \nwas a fascinating visit to see the embryo of a marketed-based system.\n  I don't think a market-based economy is at all in concert with a \nCommunist government. But nonetheless, just as is the case in China, \nVietnam is attempting to create a market-based economy under the aegis \nof a Communist government.\n  A market-based economy means having private property, being able to \nestablish a storefront and sell goods. It was fascinating, after being \nbehind the curtain for so long, to see these folks in Vietnam being \nable to open a shop or find a piece of space on a sidewalk someplace \nand sell something. It was their piece of private enterprise. It was \ntheir approach to making a living in the private sector. So what we \nhave is a country that has a Communist government but the emergence of \na market economy.\n  It is interesting to watch. I have no idea how it will end up. But \nrecognizing that things have changed in Vietnam in many ways, this \ncountry has proposed a trade agreement and normal trade relations with \nthe country of Vietnam.\n  I am going to be supportive of that today. But I must say, once \nagain, as I did about the free trade agreement with the country of \nJordan, I don't think this is a particularly good way to do trade \nagreements. This comes to us under an expedited set of procedures. It \ncomes to us in a manner that prevents amendments.\n  Amendments are prohibited because of Jackson-Vanik provisions in the \ntrade act of 1974. These provisions would apply to a trade agreement we \nhad negotiated with a country having similar economic characteristics \nto Vietnam.\n  What I want to say about this subject is something I have said \nbefore, but it bears repeating. And frankly, even if I didn't, I would \nsay it because I believe I need to say it when we talk about \ninternational trade.\n  I am going to support this trade agreement. I hope it helps our \ncountry. I hope it helps the country of Vietnam. I hope it helps our \ncountry in providing some stimulus to our economy. Vietnam is a very \nsmall country with whom we have a very small amount of international \ntrade. But I hope the net effect of this is beneficial to this country.\n  Trade agreements ought to be mutually beneficial. I hope it helps \nVietnam because I hope that Vietnam eventually can escape the yoke of \nCommunism. Certainly one way to do that is to encourage the market \nsystem they are now beginning to see in their country.\n  I hope this trade agreement is mutually beneficial. I do not, \nhowever, believe that trade agreements, by and large, should be brought \nto the floor of the Senate under expedited procedures.\n  I will vote for this agreement, but I want there to be no dispute \nabout the question of so-called fast track procedures. Fast-track is a \nprocess by which trade agreements are negotiated and then brought to \nthe floor of the Senate and the Senate is told: You may not offer \namendments. No amendments will be in order to these trade agreements.\n  The reason I come to say this is because of recent statements made by \nour trade ambassador since the September 11 acts of terrorism in this \ncountry. He has indicated that, because of those events, it is all the \nmore reason to provide trade promotion authority, or so-called fast \ntrack, to the President in order to negotiate new trade agreements. I \ndidn't support giving that authority to President Clinton. I do not \nsupport giving that authority to this President. I will explain why.\n  First of all, the Constitution is quite clear about international \ntrade. Article I, section 8 says:\n\n\n[[Page S10116]]\n\n\n       The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce \n     with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with \n     the Indian Tribes.\n\n  That is not equivocal. It doesn't say the President shall have the \npower, or the trade ambassador shall have the power, or some unnamed \ntrade negotiator shall have the power, but that Congress shall have the \npower. Only Congress shall have the power under the U.S. Constitution.\n  We have had experience with so-called fast track and international \ntrade. Fast track has meant that succeeding administrations, Republican \nand Democrat, have gone off to foreign lands and negotiated trade \nagreements--agreements like the Free Trade Agreement with Canada, the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, and the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The list is fairly long. After \nnegotiating trade agreements using fast track, the administrations \nwould bring a product back to the Senate and say, here is a trade \nagreement we have negotiated with Canada, Mexico, and with other \ncountries. We want you to consider it, Senators, under this \nrestriction: You have no right under any condition or any set of \ncircumstances to change it. So the Senate, with that set of handcuffs, \nconsiders a trade agreement with no ability to amend it, and then votes \nup or down, yes or no. It has approved these trade agreements. I have \nnot supported them. I thought all of them were bad agreements. I will \nexplain why in a moment. Nonetheless, they represent the agreements \nthat have been approved by the Senate.\n  Let's take a look at how good these agreements have been. This chart \nrepresents the ballooning trade deficit in our country. It is growing \nat an alarming rate. Last year, the merchandise trade deficit in \nAmerica was $452 billion. That means that every single day, 7 days a \nweek, almost $1.5 billion more is brought into this country in the form \nof U.S. imports than is sold outside this country in the form of U.S. \nexports.\n  Does that mean we owe somebody some money? We sure do. These deficits \nmean that we are in hock. We owe money to those from whom we are buying \nimports in excess of what we are exporting. That means we are incurring \nvery substantial debt.\n  You can look at the trade agreements we have negotiated with Canada, \nMexico, and GATT and evaluate what happened as a result. Mexico: We had \na small trade surplus with Mexico. Good for us. Then we negotiate a \ntrade agreement with them and we turned a small surplus into a huge and \ngrowing deficit. Was that a good agreement? Not where I come from.\n  Canada: We had a modest trade deficit with Canada and we quickly \ndoubled it after the trade agreement with Canada.\n  How about China? We now have a bilateral agreement with China. Let me \njust describe one of the insidious things that represents that \nbilateral agreement--automobiles. Our country negotiated an agreement \nwith China that said if we have trade in automobiles between the U.S. \nand China, here is the way we will agree to allow it to occur: On \nAmerican cars, U.S. cars being sold in China, after a long phase-in, we \nwill agree that China can impose a 25-percent tariff on American cars \nbeing sold in China. On Chinese cars being sold in the United States, \nwe will agree that we will impose only a 2.5-percent tariff. In other \nwords, our negotiators negotiated an agreement that said, with respect \nto auto trade between the United States and China, we will allow you to \nimpose a tariff 10 times higher than the tariff in the United States.\n\n  I don't know for whom these folks were negotiating, or for whom they \nthought they were working, and I don't know where they left their \nthinking caps when they negotiated these agreements, but they sure are \nnot representing the interests of this country when they say to a \ncountry such as China, we will allow you to impose a tariff that is 10 \ntimes higher on U.S. automobiles going to China than on Chinese \nautomobiles sold in the United States. That makes no sense.\n  My point is, our trade deficit with China has grown to well over $80 \nbillion a year at this point--the merchandise trade deficit. We have \nthe same thing with Japan. Every year for as far as you can see we have \nhad a huge and growing trade deficit with the country of Japan. It \ndoesn't make sense to continue doing that.\n  I can give you a lot of examples with respect to Japan. Beef is one \ngood example. We send T-bone steaks to Tokyo. They need more beef. Beef \ncosts a lot of money in Tokyo, so we send T-bone steaks. Twelve years \nafter our beef agreement with Japan, every pound of American beef going \nto Japan has a 38.5-percent tariff on it. So we send T-bone steaks to \nTokyo--not enough of them. Why? Because we have agreed with Japan that \nthey can allow a 38.5-percent tariff still 12 years after a beef \nagreement that our trade negotiators had a big feast about because they \nthought they had won.\n  Another example of absurdities in trade is motor vehicles and Korea. \nLast year, we had 570,000 Korean vehicles come into the United States \nof America. Our consumers buy them. Korea ships their cars to the \nUnited States to be sold in our marketplace. Do you know how many \nvehicles we sold in Korea? We shipped about 1,700. So there were \n570,000 coming this way, and 1,700 going that way. Why? Try to buy a \nFord in Korea. You would be surprised by its cost due to tariffs and \ntaxes. Korea doesn't want our cars in their country. They say: We are \nsorry, you are not welcome to send your cars to our marketplace.\n  If you don't like to talk about cars in international trade, talk \nabout potato flakes. This product is found in many snack foods. Try to \nsend potato flakes to Korea. You will find a 300-percent tariff. Does \nthat anger the potato farmers? Of course it does. Do they think it is \nfair? Of course not. We have huge deficits with China, Japan, Korea, \nMexico, and nobody seems to give a rip. Nobody cares. This trade \ndeficit is growing, and it represents a deficit that is a burden on \nthis economy. Someday, unlike the budget deficits we have had in the \npast, trade deficits must be and will be repaid with a lower standard \nof living in this country. That is inevitable. So we had better worry \nabout these issues.\n  We have this growing trade deficit our friends in Canada--they are \nour friends, and we share a long common border. But we still have trade \nproblems like stuffed molasses. You see, Brazilian sugar comes into \nCanada. They load it on liquid molasses, and it becomes stuffed \nmolasses. Then it is sent into Michigan, and they unload it every day. \nSo we have molasses loaded with sugar as a way to abridge our trade \nagreement. It is called stuffed molasses. Most people would not be \nfamiliar with that. It is not a candy. It is cheating on international \ntrade.\n  I can spend an hour talking about these issues with respect to China, \nJapan, Europe, Canada, and Mexico. I won't do that, although I am \ntempted, I must say. My only point in coming to the floor when we talk \nabout a trade agreement is to say this: There are those of us in the \nSenate that have had it right up to our chins with trade negotiators \nwho seem to lose the minute they begin negotiating.\n  Will Rogers once said, ``The U.S. has never lost a war and never won \na conference.'' He surely must have been talking about our trade \nnegotiators. I and a number of colleagues in this body will do \neverything we can to prevent the passage of fast-track trade authority. \nI felt that way about the previous administration, who asked for it; \nand I feel that way about this administration. We cannot any longer \nallow trade negotiators to go out and negotiate bad agreements that \nundercut this country's economic strength and vitality.\n  My message is I am going to vote for this trade agreement which \nestablishes normal trade relations with the country of Vietnam. It is a \nsmall country with which we have a relatively small amount of bilateral \ntrade.\n  I wish Vietnam well. I hope this trade agreement represents our \nmutual self-interest. I hope it is mutually beneficial to Vietnam and \nthe United States, but I want there to be no dispute and no \nmisunderstanding about what this means in the context of the larger \ndebate we will have later on the issue of fast-track trade authority.\n  Fast-track trade authority has undermined this country's economic \nstrength, and I and a group of others in the Senate will do everything \nwe can--everything we can--to stop those who want to run a fast-track \nauthority bill\n\n[[Page S10117]]\n\nthrough the Congress. Ambassador Zoellick said in light of the \ntragedies that occurred in this country, it is very important for the \nadministration to have this fast-track authority. I disagree.\n  What we need is to provide a lift to the American economy. How do we \ndo that? Lift is all about confidence. It is all about the American \npeople having confidence in the future. It is very hard to have \nconfidence in the future of this economy when the American people \nunderstand that we have a trade deficit that is ballooning. It is a \nlodestone on the American economy that must be addressed, and the \nsooner the better.\n  I have a lot to say on trade. I will not burden the Senate with it \nfurther today, only to say this: Those who wish to talk about this \neconomy and the events of September 11 in the context of granting fast-\ntrack trade authority to this administration will find a very \naggressive and willing opponent, at least at this desk in the Senate. \nHaving visited with a number of my colleagues, I will not be standing \nalone. We intend in every way to prevent fast-track trade authority.\n  Incidentally, one can negotiate all kinds of trade agreements without \nfast-track authority. One does not need fast-track trade authority to \nnegotiate a trade agreement. The previous administration negotiated and \ncompleted several hundred trade agreements without fast-track \nauthority.\n  Giving fast-track authority to trade negotiators is essentially \nputting handcuffs on every Senator. With fast-track, it is not our \nbusiness with respect to details in negotiated trade agreements, it is \nonly our business to vote yes or no. We have no right to suggest \nchanges. Had we had that right with the U.S.-Canada agreement and the \nNAFTA agreement, I guarantee the grain trade and other trade problems \nwe have had with both countries would be a whole lot different.\n  I have gone on longer than I intended.\n  Again, because we are talking about Vietnam, I wish Vietnam well, and \nI wish our country well. I want this to be a mutually beneficial trade \nagreement. With respect to future trade agreements and fast track, I \nwill not be in the Chamber of the Senate approving those who would \nhandcuff the Senate in giving their opinion and offering their advice \non trade, only because the U.S. Constitution is not equivocal. The U.S. \nConstitution says in article I, section 8: The Congress shall have the \npower to regulate commerce with foreign nations.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I yield time to the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I appreciate very much the time of my friend and \ncolleague from Arkansas. I rise this afternoon to speak in support of \nthe Vietnam bilateral trade agreement, and I support this agreement \nwith much enthusiasm.\n  It was 2 years ago in August that my brother Tom and I returned to \nVietnam after 31 years. I left Vietnam in December of 1968 as a U.S. \nArmy infantryman. My brother Tom left 1 month after I did in January \n1969. We went to Hanoi, Saigon, which is now Ho Chi Minh City. We went \nto the Mekong Delta. We went to areas where we had served together as \ninfantry squad leaders with the 9th Infantry Division.\n  What we observed during that time 2 years ago was something rather \nremarkable. Each of us had no preconditions put upon our return trip as \nto what we might see or hear. We were there at the invitation of \nAmbassador Peterson to cut the ribbon to open our new consulate in Ho \nChi Minh City.\n  What we saw was a thriving, industrious nation. We saw a nation of \nover 70 million people, the great majority of those people born after \n1975. That is when the United States quite unceremoniously left \nVietnam.\n  The reason that is important is because that is a generation that was \nborn after the war that harbors no ill will toward the United States. \nThat is a developing generation of leadership that is completely \ndifferent from the Communist totalitarian leadership that has presided \nin Vietnam.\n  I believe I am clear eyed in this business of foreign relations and \nwho represents America's friends and allies and who does not. This \nbusiness is imperfect, this business is imprecise--this business being \nforeign relations. Trade is very much a part of foreign relations.\n  Why is that? Because it is part of our relations with another nation. \nIt is part of our role in a region of the world that strategically, \ngeopolitically, and economically is important to us. Trade is part of \nforeign relations because it is a dynamic that represents stability and \nsecurity, and when nations are stable, when there is security, when \nthere is an organized effort to improve economies, open up a society, \ndevelop into a democracy. That is not always easy.\n  It was not easy for this country. I remind us all that 80 years ago \nthe Presiding Officer of the Senate today could not vote in this \ncountry. We should be a bit careful as we lecture and moralize across \nthe globe as to standards for America 2001 or standards for America \n1900, the point being that trade is a very integral part of our \nrelationships with other nations.\n  I suspect that if there ever was a time in the history of this young \nnation called America when our relationships with other nations are \nrather critical, it is right now.\n  Should we pass a trade agreement with a country based on what \nhappened in this Nation on September 11? No.\n  Should we overstate the trade dynamic as the President continues to \nwork with the Congress to develop an international coalition to take on \nand defeat global terrorism? No.\n  Should we be clear eyed in our trade relationships, evaluate them, \npass them, and implement them on the basis of what is good for our \ncountry? Yes.\n  If a trade agreement is good for our country, should it be good for \nthe other country? Yes.\n  Will this trade agreement be good for Vietnam? Yes.\n  Why is that good for us? It is good for us, first of all, because it \nbreaks down trade barriers and allows our goods and our services an \nopportunity to compete in this new market called Vietnam. Will it be \nenlightening, dynamic, and change overnight, and I will therefore see \nmuch Nebraska beef and wheat move right into Vietnam within 12 months? \nNo, of course not. That is not how the world works.\n  Every trade agreement into which this country has entered, as flawed, \nimperfect, and imprecise as they are--and they all are--what is the \nalternative? Whom do we isolate when we do not trade? How do we further \nstability in a region of the world? How do we further our own \ninterests, the interests of peace and stability and prosperity in the \nworld? Let us not forget that the breeding ground for terrorism is \nalways in the nations with no hope, always in the nations that have \nbeen bogged down in the dark abyss of poverty and hunger. That \ndiscontent, that conflict, is where the evil begins.\n  I say these things because I think they are important as we debate \nthis Vietnam trade agreement because they are connected to the bigger \nissues we are facing in the country.\n  I do not stand in this Chamber and say it because of this great \nchallenge we face today and we will face tomorrow and we will face \nyears into the horizon, but I say it because it is good for this \ncountry. That part of the world, Southeast Asia, where China is on the \nnorth of Vietnam and at the tip of Southeast Asia, is in great conflict \ntoday.\n  Indonesia needs the kind of stability and trade relationships that we \ncan help build. It is in the interest of our country, our future, and \nthe world.\n  Just as this body did last week when we passed the Jordanian \nbilateral trade agreement, so should this body pass the Vietnam \nbilateral trade agreement.\n  I hope after we have completed that act today, we will soon move to \nthe next level of trade, which is the largest, most comprehensive, and \nprobably most important, and that is to once again give the President \nof the United States trade promotion authority. It has been known as \nfast-track authority.\n  Every President in this country, in the history of our country since \n1974, has been granted that authority. Why is that? In 1974, a \nRepublican President was granted that fast-track authority to negotiate \ntrade agreements and\n\n[[Page S10118]]\n\nbring them back before the Congress, by a Democratic Congress, which \nwas clearly in the best interest of this country, and it still is.\n  Unfortunately, since 1994 the President of the United States, \nincluding the last President, President Clinton, and this new \nPresident, President Bush, has been without trade promotion authority. \nWhat has that meant to our country? It has meant something very simple \nand clear. That is, the President does not have the authority to \nnegotiate trade agreements and bring them back to the Congress for an \nup-or-down vote.\n  What does that mean in real terms as far as jobs are concerned and \nfor the people in New York, Arkansas, and Nebraska, all the States \nrepresented in this great Chamber? It means less opportunity, fewer \ngood jobs, better paying jobs, more opportunities to sell goods and \nservices.\n  So I hope as we continue to build momentum along the trade route and \non the trade agenda, somewhat magnified by the events of September 11, \nwe will get to a trade agenda soon in this body that once again allows \nthis body to debate trade promotion authority for the President of the \nUnited States and will grant the President that authority we have \ngranted Presidents on a bipartisan basis since 1974.\n  That is the other perspective, it seems to me, that we need to \nreflect on as we look at this debate today.\n  In these historic, critical times, I close by saying I hope my \ncolleagues take a very clear, close look at this issue and attach all \nthe different dynamics that are attached to this particular trade bill, \nand therefore urge my colleagues to vote for the Vietnam bilateral \ntrade agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam President, I associate myself with some of the words from our \nSenator from Nebraska, very well founded in his conclusion that \nterrorism is bred in countries with no hope, and absolutely that is \nsomething that is very pertinent today as we talk about the engagement \nof our Nation in a trade agreement with Vietnam.\n  The grasp of the evil we saw in New York, the evil acts, the hatred \nwe saw that was exhibited there, truly came from those who had no hope, \nfrom a country that produced those individuals who had no hope. Without \na doubt, we are here today to talk about engaging nations in a way \nwhere we can help in working with them, building a friendship and a \nworking relationship which in turn gives us the ability to share some \nof the hopes we have in our great Nation with other nations which then \ncan grow those hopes in a way where we can be good neighbors and we can \nshare with one another.\n  As a young woman growing up in a very small rural community in east \nArkansas, I learned many great lessons from my father as the daughter \nof a farmer. But there was no greater lesson really to have learned \nthan that my father impressed upon me how important it was to reach \nbeyond the fenceposts of Phillips County, AR, to be engaged with other \ncommunities across the great river of the Mississippi, to work with \nindividuals in Tennessee and Mississippi, but also to reach across even \ngreater barriers into other countries, recognizing that the importance \nof what we did as farmers in east Arkansas and the growth of the \neconomy were inherently dependent on the bridges we built with other \nnations across the globe.\n  That is what we are talking about today, looking at options for not \nonly free trade but, more importantly, fair trade, to establish those \nrelationships and those working agreements with nations where we not \nonly can build hope but we can also build a greater opportunity for \neconomic development in our own home as well as in those countries.\n  I also rise today to add some of my concerns about a very important \nissue a few of my colleagues have already addressed in this Chamber. \nThe issue I am talking about is catfish. Aquaculture in our Nation has \nbeen a growing industry. This country is being deluged by imports of \nVietnamese fish known as a basa fish which are brought into this \ncountry and misleadingly sold as catfish to our consumers who think \nthey are buying farm-raised catfish.\n  Let us remember this important point: When consumers think of \ncatfish, when we all think of catfish, we have in mind a very specific \nfish we have all known. But that is not what the Vietnamese are \nselling. They are selling an entirely different fish and calling it a \ncatfish. This Vietnamese fish is not even a part of the same taxonomic \nfamily as a North American channel catfish. This Vietnamese fish that \nis coming into our country is no closer to a catfish than a yak is to a \ncow. My Midwesterners will understand that.\n\n  Why are they doing it? Because the catfish market in America is \ngrowing. Americans like catfish. It is wholesome. It is healthy. It is \nsafe. It is the best protein source you can find from grain to a meat. \nAmerican-raised catfish is farm raised and grain fed, grown in \nspecially built ponds that pass environmental inspection, cared for in \nclosely regulated and closely scrutinized environments to ensure the \nsafest supply of the cleanest fish that a consumer could purchase or \nwant to get at a restaurant.\n  The people importing these Vietnamese fish see a growing market of \nwhich they can take advantage. It is irrelevant to them that what they \nare selling isn't really catfish or that their fish are raised in one \nof the worst environmental rivers on the globe. The hard-working \ncatfish farmers of my State of Arkansas, as well as Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama, are being robbed of a hard-won market that \nthey developed out of nothing. As we all know, rural America has been \nin serious decline for years. The ability of family farmers throughout \nthe country to scrape out a living has been disappearing in front of \nour very eyes.\n  Unfortunately, our rural communities in the Mississippi Delta where \nmuch of the catfish industry is now located have shared in this \ndevastating decline. Of course, the decline of the rural economy has \nmany causes, but a powerful force behind this decline has been the \ndisconnect between production agriculture in the United States and the \nterribly distorted and terribly unfair overseas markets these farmers \nface. They must compete with heavily subsidized imports that come into \nthis country and undermine their own market. When they are able to \ncrack open a tightly closed foreign market, U.S. farmers must compete \nagain with heavily subsidized foreign competition.\n  In short, the unfair trading practices of our foreign competitors \nhave played a very significant role in the serious damage wrought on \nAmerica's farmers and has been a primary cause in the decline of rural \nAmerica.\n  Over the past several years, rather than accept defeat to the \nadvancing forces, farmers in our part of the country decided to fight \nback. They fought back by building a new market in aquaculture, \nrecognizing the enormous percentage of aquaculture fish and shell fish \nthat we still import into this country today. There is one thing that \nwe can do well in the delta region; it is grow catfish. So many of \nthese communities, these farmers, their families and related \nindustries, invested millions and millions of dollars into building a \ncatfish industry and a catfish market. And they have diversified. It \nhas taken years, but they have done it and done it well. They are still \ndoing it.\n  Now, just as they are seeing the fruit of their years of labor and \ninvestment, just as they are finding a light at the end of the rural \neconomic tunnel, they find themselves facing a new and more serious \nform of unfair trading practices. They saw their financial return on \nthese other traditional crops fall alongside the general decline in our \nrural economy by shipments of fish that is no more closely related to \ncatfish than you and I--than a yak is to a cow. It is an unfair irony \nthat our catfish farmers find themselves once again in the headlights \nof an onslaught of unfair trade from another country. But my colleagues \nfrom catfish-producing States and I are not going to stand for it.\n\n  My distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, \nobserved earlier this is a problem that can be addressed by attacking \nthe Vietnamese practice itself where it occurs, and that is at the \nlabeling stages. That is exactly what I am here to do today.\n\n[[Page S10119]]\n\n  Today my colleagues and I, my colleagues from the other catfish-\nproducing States, are introducing a bill that will stop this misleading \nlabeling at the source. Our bill will prohibit the labeling of any \nfish--as catfish that is; in fact, not an actual member of the catfish \nfamily. We are not trying to stop other countries from growing catfish \nand selling it to our country. We simply want to make sure that if they \nsay they are selling catfish, they are doing exactly that.\n  This is about truth in fairness. That is what our bill seeks to \naccomplish. On behalf of the catfish farmers in Arkansas and the rest \nof our producing States, I am proud to introduce this bill. We will \npursue this bill with every ounce of fight we have. Our farmers and our \nrural communities deserve it. This is one way we from the Congress can \naddress the issues we see and still maintain the good trading \nrelationships, the good engagement with other nations to help grow that \nhope, to help build those friendships and relationships that we need in \nthis ever smaller global world in which we are finding ourselves.\n  As we work to make those trade agreements and certainly the trade \ninitiatives that are out there more fair, we want to continue to \nencourage all of the engagement of opening up freer trade with many of \nthe nations of the world in the hope of finding that hope about which \nthe Senator from Nebraska spoke so eloquently.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventy-three and a half minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  Madam President, I will try to put back into perspective the issue \nbefore the Senate subsequent to some of the remarks made since I last \nspoke.\n  The issue is whether or not we want to continue to provide normal \ntrade relations with the Vietnamese. That is the matter on which the \nSenate will be voting. The point I have been trying to make in my \ndiscussion is whether or not the Senate would be willing to do what the \nHouse did by a vote of 410-1 and approve the Vietnam Human Rights Act, \nH.R. 2833. I would like to see a favorable vote on H.R. 2833, but I am \nnot asking for everybody to vote for it. I am simply asking for the \nopportunity to vote on it.\n  I don't understand, given all of the circumstances of the human \nrights violations that the Vietnamese have committed, why it is, if we \nare going to provide normal trade relations with them, that we cannot \ngo on record as the House--and properly so--stating we object to those \nhuman rights violations. We do it to other countries all of the time. \nThere is only one conclusion that can be drawn; let's be honest. We \ndon't want to embarrass the Vietnamese. Those Members of the Senate \nholding up the opportunity to vote on H.R. 2833 are doing it strictly \nbecause they are afraid somehow this will embarrass the Vietnamese or \nsomehow make it awkward for them.\n  As I said earlier, this is a quote from People's Army Daily which \nspeaks for the Vietnamese Government on numerous occasions when they \ntalked about the terrorist attack on the United States of America:\n\n       . . . It's obvious that through this incident, Americans \n     should take another look at themselves. If Americans had not \n     pursued isolationism and chauvinism, and if they had not \n     insisted on imposing their values on others in their own \n     subjective manner, then perhaps the twin towers would still \n     be standing together in the singing waves and breeze of the \n     Atlantic.\n\n  I don't know about you, but I am offended by that remark. I am \noffended by that, to put it mildly. That is not what President Bush was \ntalking about when he said: You are with us or against us in this fight \nagainst terrorism.\n  I know there was read on the floor an official statement by the \nVietnamese Government which contradicted that, which expressed some \nconcern about the outrage of the terrorist attack. It is also important \nto understand that in the paper where that was printed, there was also \nprinted right next to it an article decrying the ``brazen'' \ninterference by Washington in Vietnam's human rights matters.\n  So you are getting a double message here. The point is, we do not \nwant a double message from the Vietnamese Government on what happened \nin New York and Washington 3 weeks ago. We want one very clear message, \nwhich is what President Bush asked for: You are with us or you are not.\n  I don't know how you feel, but as I read that statement, that doesn't \nstrike me as somebody who is with us and supporting us in our acts \nagainst terrorism.\n  But however you feel about that remark--that offends me; I think it \noffends most Americans--that is not the issue before us today. I wish \nto repeat what I am asking for, which is a vote on the human rights \nbill--that is all--in addition to a vote on this bill.\n  Unfortunately, because of holds on the human rights bill--I repeat, \nit passed 410-1 in the House of Representatives--we can't have that \nvote. All it is going to do is cite and recite--and I will have some of \nthese in the Record now--some of the human rights violations of which \nthe Vietnamese Government is guilty.\n  I do not want to normalize trade relations with them for a number of \nreasons--first and foremost, because they have never fully accounted \nfor POWs and MIAs, and I don't care how many people come on the floor \nand say they did. They have not. It is an issue I have worked on for 17 \nyears, and I can tell you right now they have not fully cooperated in \naccounting for POWs. If anyone wants to sit down with me and go through \nit on a case-by-case basis, I will be happy to do it.\n  It is false. Paul Wolfowitz said it was. The archives have not been \nopened. Have they been cooperative to some extent? Yes. Have they been \nfully cooperative? No. There are lots of families out there who have \nnot gotten information on their loved ones that the Vietnamese could \nprovide. They have not done it. So I don't want to hear this stuff that \nthey are fully cooperative. They are not fully cooperative. There is a \nbig difference between being cooperative and being fully cooperative. \nThey are not cooperative fully. You can ask anyone who works on this \nissue in the Intelligence Committee--and certainly Paul Wolfowitz knows \nwhat he is talking about. He says they are not fully cooperative. So \nlet's not stand on the floor of the Senate and say let's normalize \ntrade with Vietnam because they have been fully cooperative when every \none of us knows differently. End of story; they are not.\n  If you want to go beyond that, that is not the only issue. All I am \nasking is that the Senate, in addition to voting on this normalizing \ntrade, would also give the Senate the opportunity to be heard on what \nthe House did on the human rights violations. That is it.\n  Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International recently criticized the \nVietnamese Government's use of closed trials to impose harsh prison \nterms on 14 ethnic minority Montagnards from the central highlands of \nVietnam--closed trials, kangaroo courts. The Montagnards were the ones \nwho helped us tremendously during the Vietnam war. That is a nice \nthank-you for what they did. Many of them gave their lives and lots of \nfreedoms to stand up with us--stand with us during the vietnam war. Now \nwe are having kangaroo courts, defendants charged. This is one of the \ncharges: destabilizing security.\n  Why do we have to tolerate it? I understand we cannot necessarily go \nback into the Government of Vietnam and change their way of life. That \nhas been said. I wish it would change. But we do not have to condone it \nby simply ignoring it while we give them normal trade relations. Give \nthem the normal trade relations, if you want--I will vote no--but at \nthe same time give us the opportunity to expose this and say on the \nfloor of the Senate, as the House did 410-1, this is wrong. That is all \nI am asking.\n\n  The only reason I can't do it is because people have secret holds. I \nhave said, and I will say it again publicly, I hate secret holds. I do \nnot use them. When I put a hold on something, I tell people. If anybody \nasks me do I have a hold, I say, yes, I do, and here is the reason. If \nI can't take it off, I will tell you. If I can, I can work with you. I \nwish we did not have secret holds. I think it is wrong. I think those \nwho have the holds should come down and say they have the holds and \nwhy. Why is it we cannot vote on the human rights accord as the House \ndid?\n\n[[Page S10120]]\n\n  I mentioned the Montagnards. I will repeat a few. But it is \nunbelievable, some of the things that are going on and we choose to \nignore them because we do not want to offend them for fear we might not \nbe able to sell them something.\n  To be candid about it, there are things more important than making a \nprofit in America. There are about 6,500 people in New York who would \nlove to have the opportunity to make a profit. They cannot because they \nhave lost their freedom permanently because of what happened.\n  This is the insensitive, terrible comment that was made by these \npeople in Vietnam. And there were more. I read more into the Record. I \nwill not repeat them. Students on the street saying it is too bad it \nwasn't Bush and it is too bad it wasn't the CIA, on and on, comments \ncoming out of the Vietnamese Government, and students and populace, and \nput in their papers, on the public record.\n  They can stop anything they want from being printed. They do not have \na free press in Vietnam. If they don't want this stuff printed, they \ncould say: We won't print it. But they did print it because it is a \ndouble slap. Here is the official message: We are sorry about what \nhappened. But here is the other message. That is what bothers me.\n  Again, all I am asking for is the right to vote on this human rights \naccord and we cannot do it because we cannot get it to the floor.\n  The Government of Vietnam consistently pursues the policy of \nharassment, discrimination, intimidation, imprisonment, sometimes other \nforms of detention, and torture. Sometimes trading in human beings \nthemselves--having people try to buy their freedom to get out of that \nplace and after they pay the money they retain them anyway and will not \nlet them out.\n  The recent victims of such mistreatment--it goes on and on. We could \ngive all kinds of personal testimony to that--priests, religious \nleaders, Protestants, Jews, Catholics--anybody. They have all been \nvictims of this terrible, terrible policy of this Government of \nVietnam. Yet we ignore it. We refuse to even vote on it.\n  Everybody has to work with their own conscience. Again, however you \nfeel about it, whether you agree or disagree with the violations, or \nwhether you agree or disagree with normalizing trade with Vietnam, that \nis the issue. The issue is: Why can't we be heard? Why can't the Senate \nvote as the House did to point out what these terrible human rights \nviolations are?\n  These are the Senate rules. I respect the Senate rules. Every Senator \nhas a right to do that. I do not criticize the rule nor anyone's \nmotives, other than to say I wish those who oppose voting on human \nrights would have the courage to come down and say why not. Why can't \nwe say, at the same time we are giving you trade, that we are also \nwilling to tell you it is wrong, what you are doing to people in \nVietnam: torturing, slave trading, forcing people to buy their freedom \nand then not allowing them to get free after they pay the money, on and \non--persecution of religious leaders. These things are wrong. We \ncriticize governments all over the world for doing it, all the time. We \ntake actions against them, sanctions and other things.\n\n  Then, on top of that, the insensitivity of this remark, and others--\nthat is reason enough to say OK, we are not going to interfere with the \ntrade, we will give you the trade, but we also want to point out to you \nthat what you are doing is wrong. What you said here is wrong. What you \nare doing to citizens in Vietnam is wrong, and we are going to say that \nin this resolution, as the House did. That is all I am asking. I know \nit is not going to happen. That is regrettable. I think, frankly, it is \nnot the Senate's finest hour that we ignore that remark, ignore the \nhuman rights violations and give them trade.\n  Sometimes you just have to let your heart take priority in some of \nthese matters. You know what your heart says. You know in your heart \nthat is wrong. You know it is. I don't care how much profit we make \nbuying or selling--whatever, grain. It doesn't matter to me what it is. \nProfit should not take precedence over principle. Believe me, we are \nletting that happen today at 2 o'clock when we vote. I am telling you \nwe are. It is not the Senate's finest hour.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Before I suggest the absence of a quorum, I might \nrecommend to my colleague from New Hampshire, he might be interested in \nrequesting a unanimous consent to send that bill back to committee. If \nit went through the process, it might have a better chance of coming up \nto the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, if the Senator will \nagree that we postpone this vote until we have this bill go back to the \ncommittee where it can be heard and brought to the floor, I would be \nfine with that. Apparently that is not going to be the case. I think it \nis only fair if the Committee on Foreign Relations is going to discuss \nhuman rights violations, we should hold off the vote on this and do \nboth at the same time. That is not going to happen.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. It is just a suggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I have risen many times in this body \nover the course of the last decade to affirm my support for moving \nforward our relationship with Vietnam. We began carefully, over a \ndecade ago, with cooperation in the search for our missing service \npersonnel. That cooperation, along with Vietnam's withdrawal from \nCambodia and the end of the cold war, fostered a new spirit in \nSoutheast Asia that allowed us to lift the U.S. trade embargo against \nVietnam in 1994 and normalize diplomatic relations in 1995. My friend \nPete Peterson was nominated by the President to serve as our ambassador \nin Hanoi in 1996 and was confirmed by the Senate in 1997. We lifted \nJackson-Vanik restrictions on Vietnam in 1998 and have sustained the \nJackson-Vanik waiver for that country in subsequent years. In 2000, we \nsigned a bilateral trade agreement with Vietnam--one of the most \ncomprehensive bilateral trade agreements our country has ever \nnegotiated. We stand ready today to approve this agreement and, in \ndoing so, complete the final step in the full normalization of our \nrelations with Vietnam.\n\n  It need not have come this far, and would not have come this far, \nwere it not for the support of Americans who once served in Vietnam in \nanother time, and for another purpose--to defend freedom. The wounds of \nwar, of lost friends and battles gone wrong, took decades to heal. It \ntook some time for me, as it did for Pete Peterson, John Kerry, Chuck \nHagel, and many other veterans, just as it took some time for America, \nto understand that while some losses in war are never recovered, the \nenmity and despair that we felt over those losses need not be our \npermanent condition.\n  I have memories of a place so far removed from the comforts of this \nblessed country that I have forgotten some of the anguish it once \nbrought me. But that is not to say that my happiness with these last, \nnearly thirty years, has let me forget the friends who did not come \nhome with me. The memory of them, of what they bore for honor and \ncountry, still causes me to look in every prospective conflict for the \nshadow of Vietnam. But we must not let that shadow hold us in fear from \nour duty, as we have been given light to see that duty.\n  The people we serve expect us to act in the best interests of this \nnation. And the nation's best interests are poorly served by \nperpetuating a conflict that claimed a sad chapter of our history, but \nought not hold a permanent claim on our future.\n  I supported normalizing our relations with Vietnam for a number of \nreasons, not the least of which was that I could no longer see the \nbenefit of fighting about it. America has a long, accomplished, and \nhonorable history. We did not need to let this one mistake, terrible \nthough it was, color our perceptions forever of our national \ninstitutions and our nation's purpose in the world.\n  We were a good country before Vietnam, and we are a good country \nafter Vietnam. In all the annals of history, you cannot find a better \none. Vietnam did not destroy us or our historical reputation. All these \nyears later, I think the world has come to understanding that as well.\n\n[[Page S10121]]\n\n  It was important to learn the lessons of our mistakes in Vietnam so \nthat we can avoid repeating them. But having learned them, we had to \nbury our dead and move on.\n  But then Vietnam was not a memory shared by veterans or politicians \nalone. The legacy of our experiences in Vietnam influenced America \nprofoundly. Our losses there, the loss of so many fine young Americans \nand the temporary loss of our national sense of purpose--stung all of \nus so sharply that the memory of our pain long outlasted the security \nand political consequences of our defeat. And for too many, for too \nlong, Vietnam was a war that would not end.\n  But it is over now, a fact I believe the other body's overwhelming \nvote on this bilateral trade agreement, and the surprising lack of \ncontroversy it engenders, indicates. America has moved on, as has \nVietnam. Our duty and our interests demand that we not allow lingering \nbitterness to dictate the terms of our relationships with other \nnations. We have found in the new, post-cold-war era, a place of \nfriendship for an adversary from an earlier time. I am very proud of \nAmerica, and of the good men and women who serve her, for that \naccomplishment.\n  We looked back in anger at Vietnam long enough. And we cannot allow \nany lingering resentments we incurred during our time in Vietnam to \nprevent us from doing what is so clearly in our duty: to help build \nfrom the losses and hopes of our tragic war in Vietnam a better peace \nfor both the American and Vietnamese people.\n  This trade agreement between our nations cements the relationship \nwith Vietnam we have been building all these years, since we decided to \nput the war behind us. In approving this agreement, Vietnam's leaders \nhave gambled their nation's future on a strong relationship with us, \nand on freeing their people from the shackles of international \nisolation and the command economy they once knew.\n  History shows that nations exposed to our values and infused with the \nday-to-day freedoms of an open economy become more susceptible to the \ninfluence of our values, and increasingly expect to enjoy them \nthemselves. In choosing to deepen their nation's relationship with the \nUnited States, Vietnam's leaders have made a wise choice that will \nbenefit their people. In choosing to deepen America's relationship with \nVietnam, we have thrown our support to the Vietnamese people, and cast \nour bet that freedom is contagious.\n  We do not reward Hanoi by voting for this trade agreement today. In \ndoing so, we advance our interests in Vietnam even as we expose its \npeople to the forces that will continue to change Vietnam for the \nbetter. The change its people have witnessed over the past decade has \nbeen dramatic. This trade agreement will accelerate positive change. \nThis is a welcome development for all Vietnamese, and for all \nAmericans.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nhis wisdom and the thoughtfulness that he brings to this body. I \nappreciate it very much.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of the \nresolution that is before us.\n  The first time I saw Vietnam was from a P-3 naval aircraft about 31 \nyears ago this year. Twenty-one years would actually pass from that \ntime before I set foot on Vietnamese soil. Many times in the early \n1970s my aircrew and I flew over Vietnam, around Vietnam, and landed in \nbases in that region. I never set foot on Vietnamese soil until 1991.\n  At that time, I was a Member of the House of Representatives and led \na congressional delegation that included five other United States \nRepresentatives, all of whom served in Southeast Asia during the \nVietnam war. We went at a time when many believed that U.S. soldiers, \nsailors, and airmen were being held--after the end of the war--in \nprison camps. We went there to find out the truth as best we could.\n  What we encountered, to our surprise, was a welcoming nation. We \nvisited not only Vietnam but Cambodia and Laos. In Vietnam, we found, \nto our surprise, a welcoming nation. Most of the people who live in \nVietnam are people who were born since 1975, since the Government of \nSouth Vietnam fell to the North.\n  For the most part--not everyone--but for the most part, they like \nAmericans, admire Americans, and want to have normal relations with our \ncountry.\n  Our delegation also included U.S. Congressman Pete Peterson from \nFlorida. Our delegation took with us, to those three nations, a \nroadmap, a roadmap that could lead to normalized relations between the \nUnited States and, particularly, Vietnam.\n  Our offer was that if the Vietnamese would take certain steps, \nparticularly with respect to providing information in allowing us \naccess to information about our missing in action, we would reciprocate \nand take other steps as well.\n  We laid out the roadmap. We assured the Vietnamese that if they were \nto do certain things, we would not move the goalposts but we would \nreciprocate. They did those certain things, and we reciprocated. In \n1994, former President Clinton lifted the trade embargo between our two \ncountries.\n  Think back. It has been 50 years, this year, since the United States \nhas had normal trade relations with Vietnam--50 years. In 1994, the \nembargo, which had been in place for a number of years, was lifted.\n  I had the opportunity to go back to Vietnam a few years ago as \nGovernor of Delaware. I led a trade delegation to that country. What I \nsaw in 1999 surprised me just as much as being surprised when we were \nwelcomed in 1991.\n  I will never forget driving from the airport to downtown Hanoi and \nbeing struck by the number of small businesses that had cropped up on \neither side of the highway that we traversed. It was a fairly long \ndrive, and everywhere we looked small businesses had popped up to \nprovide a variety of services and goods to the people.\n  The Government leaders with whom we met talked about free enterprise. \nThey talked about how the marketplace, and finding ways to use the \nmarketplace, might allow them to better meet the needs of their \ncitizens, how it would enable them to become a more important trading \npartner in that part of the world, and for them to be a nation with \nless poverty and with greater opportunities for their own citizens.\n  Vietnam today is either the 12th or 13th most populous nation in the \nworld. Some 80 million people live there. There are a number of reasons \nwhy I believe this resolution is in our interest, and I will get into \nthose reasons in a moment, but I want to take a moment and read the \nactual text of this resolution. It is not very long. It says:\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       That the Congress approves the extension of \n     nondiscriminatory treatment with respect to the products of \n     the Socialist Republic of Vietnam transmitted by the \n     President to the Congress on June 8, 2001.\n\n  Negotiations on the bilateral trade agreement before us began in 1996 \nor 1997. We have been at this for almost 5 years. It was negotiated by \nPete Peterson who became our Ambassador and was part of our \ncongressional delegation 10 years ago. Pete did a wonderful job as \nAmbassador, and I give him a lot of credit for having hammered out the \nprovisions of this bilateral trade agreement.\n  The agreement was concluded a year ago in an earlier administration \nand has been sent to us by President Bush for our consideration. There \nare a number of reasons that former President Clinton and his \nadministration thought this was a good idea for America. There are a \nnumber of similar reasons that President Bush and his administration \nbelieve this agreement is a good one for America.\n  First, it acknowledges that Vietnam is a big country, a populous \ncountry, and one that is going to play an ever\n\n[[Page S10122]]\n\nmore important role in that part of the world and in the world. It has \n80 million people, mostly under the age of 30, for the most part people \nwho like us, admire us, who want to have a good relationship with the \nUnited States despite our very troubled relations over the last half \ncentury.\n  Those markets that now exist in Vietnam have not been especially open \nto us. Sure, we have had the ability to sell over the years more and \nmore goods and services, including a fair amount of high-technology \nequipment and goods. They now sell a number of items to us. We buy \nthose. But they have in place barriers to our exports, and we have \nbarriers to their exports. We will create jobs in this country, and \nthey will create jobs in their country, if we will lift the import \nrestrictions here and there, reduce the quotas dramatically and the \ntariffs. This provision does that, not just for them but for us. To the \nextent that we can sell more goods and services there, we benefit as a \nnation, and we will.\n  A number of countries in that part of the world do not respect \nintellectual property rights. Vietnam is not among the worst offenders \nin that regard. But there are problems in this respect. This agreement \nwill take us a lot closer to where we need to be in protecting \nintellectual property rights, not just of Americans but of others \naround the world.\n  On my last visit to Vietnam, in the meetings we had with their \nbusiness and government leaders, we talked a lot about transparency and \nhow difficult it was for those who would like to invest in Vietnam, do \nbusiness in Vietnam, to go through their bureaucracy. Their bureaucrats \nmake ours look like pikers. They are world class in terms of throwing \nup roadblocks and making things difficult for investment to occur. This \nagreement won't totally end that, but it will sure go a long way toward \npermitting the kind of investments American companies want to make and \nought to be able to make in Vietnam and, similarly, to reciprocate and \nprovide their business people, their companies, the opportunity to \ninvest in the United States.\n  There is something to be said for regional stability as well. Vietnam \ncan contribute to regional stability if their economy strengthens and \nthey move toward a more free market system. Or they can be a \ncontributor to destabilization. This agreement will better ensure they \nare a more stable country and able to promote stability within the \nregion.\n  Others have raised concerns today about alleged continuing abuses in \nhuman rights and the denial of freedom of religion, insufficient \nprogress toward democratization. There is more than a grain of truth to \nsome of that. Religious leaders are not given the kinds of freedoms \nthat our leaders have. The Vatican declared last year that as far as \nthey are concerned, freedom to worship is no longer a problem in \nVietnam. They open kindergartens now and they teach the catechisms as \nmuch as they are taught here in Catholic-sponsored kindergartens. When \nI was there in 1991, they still had reeducation camps. They no longer \nhave those. They have been replaced for the most part by drug \nrehabilitation facilities.\n\n  Much has been made today of the reaction of the Vietnamese to the \nhorrors here 22 days ago, September 11. The truth is, the Vietnamese \npress has been overwhelmingly sympathetic to the American people and to \nthose who lost loved ones on September 11. Their government leaders \nprovided, literally within days, a letter of deep condolences to our \nPresident to express their abhorrence for what happened in our Nation.\n  With respect to terrorism, if anything, Ambassador Peterson shares \nwith me that they have been helpful to us in working on terrorist \nactivities and providing not only information that is valuable to us \nbut giving us the opportunity to reciprocate. He suggests they may have \nactually been a better partner at this transfer of information than we \nhave.\n  Finally, the freedom to emigrate. I recall 10 years ago there were \ndifficulties people encountered trying to emigrate to this country or \nother countries from Vietnam. Today, for the most part, passports are \neasily obtained. If a person wants to go to to Australia, to the \nPhilippines, to the United States, if they don't have criminal records \nor other such problems in their portfolio, they are able to get those \npassports and travel.\n  Let me conclude with this thought: I think in my lifetime, the \ndefining issue for my generation, certainly one of the defining issues, \nhas been our animosity toward Vietnam, the war we fought with Vietnam, \na war which tore our country apart. That war officially ended 26 years \nago. A long healing process has been underway since then in Vietnam and \nalso in this country.\n  We have come a long way in that relationship over the last 26 years. \nSo have the Vietnamese. We have the potential today to take that last \nstep in normalizing relations, and that is a step we ought to take.\n  Vietnam today is no true democracy. They still have their share of \nproblems. So do we, and so does the rest of the world. But I am \nconvinced that if we adopt this resolution and agree to this bilateral \ntrade agreement, it will move Vietnam a lot further and a lot faster \ndown the road to a true free enterprise system. With those economic \nfreedoms will come, more surely and more quickly, the kind of political \nfreedoms we value and would want for their people just as much we \ncherish for our people.\n  With those thoughts in mind, I conclude by saying to our old \ncolleague--the Presiding Officer also served with Congressman \nPeterson--later the first United States Ambassador to Vietnam: I will \nnever forget when I visited him a year or two ago on our trade mission, \nhe and his wife Vi were good enough to host a dinner for our delegation \nat the residence of the Ambassador. And as we drove to the Embassy the \nnext day, we drove by the old Hanoi Hotel. The idea that an American \nflier who had spent 6 and a half years as a prisoner of war in the \nHanoi Hotel would return 25, 30 years later to be America's first \nAmbassador to that country in half a century, the idea that that kind \nof transformation could occur was moving to me then, and it is today.\n  There is another kind of transformation that has occurred in our \nrelationship with Vietnam and within Vietnam as well, a good \ntransformation, a positive transformation, one that we can reaffirm and \nstrengthen by a positive vote today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for up to 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bingaman are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H.J. \nRes. 51, the Vietnam Trade Act, which would extend normal trade \nrelations to the nation of Vietnam. I know there is limited time \navailable on this issue today, so I will keep my comments short and to \nthe point.\n  Let me begin by clarifying what this agreement actually does. Simply \nput, the purpose of this trade agreement is to normalize trade \nrelations between the United States and Vietnam. At present, Vietnam is \none of only a handful of countries in the world that do not receive \nwhat is called normal trade relations status from the United States. \nUnder this agreement, the United States will obtain a range of \nsignificant advantages in the Vietnamese market it does not have at \nthis time, examples being; access to key sectors, including goods, \nservices and agriculture; protection for investment and intellectual \nproperty, transparency in laws and regulations, and a lowering of \ntariffs on products. For the United States, this agreement translates \ninto a unique opportunity for American companies to enter a country \nwith significant development needs. It means sales across the board in \nthe consumer market, sales in infrastructure development, and sales in \ngovernment procurement. Importantly, it means that we will now be able \nto compete on equal footing with other foreign countries, all of which \ntrade with Vietnam on ``normal'' terms and many of which already have a \nsignificant presence in that country.\n  For Vietnam, this agreement translates into a substantial decrease in \ntariffs on products it can send to the United States and a tangible \nopportunity for export-led economic growth\n\n[[Page S10123]]\n\nnow and in the future. It gives Vietnam and its people, more than half \nof which are under the age of 25, a very real chance to obtain the \nlevel of prosperity, security, and stability that it has desired for \nnearly a half a century. It means an increased standard of living, an \nincreased exchange of ideas with the world, and an increased \nintegration of Vietnam's institutions with the international system. \nMost of all, it means positive and peaceful political economic change \nin a country that has suffered tremendously for far too long.\n  Let us not lose sight of this last point, because much like the U.S.-\nJordan free trade agreement, the U.S.-Vietnam bilateral trade agreement \nhas a larger geo-political context. In 1995, after years of lingering \nanimosity between our two countries, the United States and Vietnam made \na conscious and, I think, an extremely wise decision to take a \ndifferent and far more constructive path in our relations. For many, \nthis decision was also difficult and even controversial as there was a \nnumber of critical issues that they felt remained unresolved.\n  These issues--the POW/MIAs, religious freedom, human rights, labor \nrights, and so on--are not going away quickly. I have thought about \nthem carefully and at length as I decided whether or not I would \nsupport this legislation. I do not want to underestimate or, even \nworse, ignore the fact that Vietnam has a very long way to go when it \ncomes to the rights and liberties that we in our country consider \nfundamental.\n  But I also feel that this comes down to the question of how change is \ngoing to occur. Does it occur through engagement or isolation?\n  Based on the evidence I have seen, both in the case of Vietnam and \nwith other countries, I am convinced it is far more productive to \nintegrate Vietnam into our system of norms, values, and rules--pull it \ninto the common tent where we can talk to government officials and \nprivate citizens on a regular basis on the issues that matter to us all \nthan leave it out. I have come to the conclusion that it is far better \nto create cooperative mechanisms to discuss issues like forced child \nlabor, or environmental degradation, or trafficking in women, or \ninternational trade than to ostracize Vietnam and wonder why change is \nnot occurring. I think it is essential that the United States interact \nregularly and intensively with Vietnam. Our goal should be to integrate \nVietnam fully into the collective institutions of East Asia and the \ninternational community. Only through this effort will we see \nincremental but steady reform and progress occur.\n  Let me say in conclusion that Vietnam is changing in dramatic, \nimportant, and, I believe, irreversible ways. I believe this trade \nagreement will not only accelerate and expand that change, but it will \nalso create a strong, mutually beneficial relationship between the \nUnited States and Vietnam. I want to thank all my colleagues who have \nplayed an integral role in drafting this legislation. I am convinced it \nwill have a profound and lasting effect on Vietnam, on the region of \nEast Asia as a whole, and on U.S.-Vietnam relations. Our countries have \ncome a long way, and I am extremely encouraged to see that we have put \nold and counterproductive animosities aside to take a very positive \nstep forward into the future.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the United States-\nVietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement. I believe this agreement will help \ntransform Vietnam's economy into one that is more open and transparent, \nexpand economic freedom and opportunities for Vietnam's people and \nfoster a more open society.\n  At the same time, I commend my colleague, Senator Bob Smith, for his \nefforts to press for consideration of the Vietnam Human Rights Act. \nSenator Smith is correct: These two measures should have been \nconsidered in tandem.\n  A constituent, and friend, of mine is Dr. Quan Nguyen. He is a \nrespected leader of the Vietnamese community in Virginia. His brother, \nDr. Nguyen Dan Que, is in Vietnam and he is not free. He is the head of \nthe Non-Violent Movement for Human Rights in Vietnam. He spent 20 years \nin Vietnamese prisons because he dared to believe in the concept of \nfreedom, liberty and democracy. He has been under house arrest since \n1999. He lives with two armed guards stationed outside his residence. \nHis telephone and Internet accounts have been cut off and his mail is \nintercepted. Dr. Que has been labeled a common criminal because his \n``anti-socialist'' ideas are a crime in Vietnam.\n  The struggle for freedom of conscience, economic self-sufficiency and \nhuman rights is one that has not ended with the conclusion of the Cold \nWar. Regimes throughout the world continue in power while denying basic \nhuman rights to their citizens and unjustly imprisoning those who \npeacefully disagree with the government. One such place is the \nSocialist Republic of Vietnam.\n  I support increased trade with Vietnam and will vote for this \nmeasure. At the same time, I urge the government of Vietnam to choose \nthe path of enlightened nations, the path of true freedom, and true \nrespect for all its citizens and their human rights. Vietnam waits on \nthe cusp of history, and the choices before it are important choices \nbetween freedom and respect for human rights, or stagnation and \ntotalitarianism.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, The bilateral trade agreement that the \nUnited States signed with Vietnam in July 2000 represents a milestone \nin U.S. relations with Vietnam. Building a foundation for a strong \ncommercial relationship with Vietnam is not only in our economic \ninterest, but it is in our security interest and our diplomatic \ninterest. Vietnam has made comprehensive commitments, which will help \nopen up Vietnam's market for products produced by U.S. workers, \nbusinesses and farmers. These commitments will not only help pave the \nway for changes in the Vietnamese economy, but in Vietnamese society as \na whole.\n  While the U.S.-Vietnam bilateral trade agreement is an important step \nforward in our diplomatic and commercial relationship, I am \ndisappointed that the agreement does not address Vietnam's poor record \nof enforcing internationally-recognized core labor standards. The \nGovernment of Vietnam continues to deny its citizens the right of \nassociation, allows forced labor, and inadequately enforces its child \nlabor and worker safety laws. Vietnam's poor labor conditions led \nPresident Clinton to sign a Memorandum of Understanding, MOU, with \nVietnam in December 2000. This MOU, pledging U.S. technical assistance \nfor Vietnam to improve its labor market conditions, is a start, but it \ndoes not require Vietnam to take specific steps to improve enforcement \nof existing laws and regulations. More is needed.\n  I join my colleagues who have been urging the Administration to \ncommit to enter into a textiles and apparel agreement with Vietnam that \nwould include positive incentives for Vietnam to improve its labor \nconditions, similar to the agreement the U.S. has in place with \nCambodia. Such an agreement is important to maintain a consistent U.S. \ntrade policy that recognizes the competitive impact of labor market \nconditions. Additionally, if the United States fails to enter into a \ntextile and apparel agreement with Vietnam similar to the agreement \nwith Cambodia, the agreement with Cambodia may be undermined if \nbusinesses move production to Vietnam at the expense of Cambodia.\n  The vote today inaugurates an annual review of whether the United \nStates should extend normal trade relations, NTR, to Vietnam. As \nCongress undertakes these annual NTR reviews for Vietnam, we will \nclosely monitor progress in reaching a textiles and apparel agreement, \nand Vietnam's respect for core labor rights.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.J. Res 51, \napproving the bilateral trade agreement between the United States and \nVietnam. Our relationship with Vietnam has come far in 25 years. Today, \nVietnam is gradually integrating into the world economy, is a member of \nAPEC, the ASEAN Free Trade Area and has economic and trade relations \nwith 165 Countries.\n  Vietnam has granted normal trade relations to the United States since \n1999. At the same time, our cooperative relations with Vietnam on other \nmatters, including POW issues, has progressed admirably. Establishing \nnormal trade relations for Vietnam is a logical step in our trade AND \nforeign relations.\n\n[[Page S10124]]\n\n  Negotiated over a four-year period, this trade agreement represents \nan important series of commitments by Vietnam to reform its economy. It \nprovides important market access for American companies and is a \ncrucial step in the process of normalizing relations between the United \nStates and Vietnam.\n  There are those in this body who do not believe, as I do, that the \nUnited States and Vietnam are ready to end thirty-five years of \nviolence and mistrust between our two countries. There are Senators who \nbelieve the great battle between capitalism and communism has yet to be \nfully won. There are Senators who believe that our goal should be to \ndestroy the last vestiges of communism. I am one of those Senators.\n  I believe that communism belongs, to paraphrase the President in his \nremarkable joint address of Congress on September 20, ``in history's \nunmarked grave of discarded lies.''\n  There are those who believe that the best way to make sure the lie of \nVietnamese communism dies is to shun Vietnam, to condition interaction \non a fundamental political shift in Vietnam. In other words, you change \nyour ways, and then we will engage you. I am not one of those Senators.\n  I believe that trade is the best vehicle to force political change. \nThe Vietnamese, like China before it, has gone far down a path of \neconomic reform. They practice Capitalism and preach Communism.\n  I believe that capitalism is infectious. I do not believe that \nCapitalism and communism can co exist. I believe that the road on which \nVietnam is traveling will inevitably lead to democratic change, and \nthat its experiment with Communism will die an unlamented death.\n  Further delay in passing the BTA will harm will delay Vietnam on this \nroad. The BTA is the right vehicle at the right time for our economic \nAND foreign policy priorities.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass H.J. Res. 51.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the catfish industry in the United States \nis being victimized by a fish product from Vietnam that is labeled as \nfarm-raised catfish. Since 1997, the volume of Vietnamese frozen fish \nfilets has increased from 500,000 pounds to over 7 million pounds per \nyear.\n  U.S. catfish farm production, which is located primarily in \nMississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, and Louisiana, accounts for 50 percent \nof the total value of all U.S. aquaculture production. Catfish farmers \nin the Mississippi Delta region have spent $50 million to establish a \nmarket for North American catfish.\n  The Vietnamese fish industry is penetrating the United States fish \nmarket by falsely labeling fish products to create the impression they \nare farm-raised catfish. The Vietnamese ``basa'' fish that are being \nimported from Vietnam are grown in cages along the Mekong River Delta. \nUnlike other imported fish, basa fish are imported as an intended \nsubstitute for U.S. farm-raised catfish, and in some instances, their \nproduct packaging imitates U.S. brands and logos. This false labeling \nof Vietnamese basa fish is misleading American consumers at \nsupermarkets and restaurants.\n  According to a taxonomy analysis from the National Warmwater \nAquaculture Center, the Vietnamese basa fish is not even of the same \nfamily or species as the North American channel catfish.\n  The trade agreement with Vietnam, unfortunately, will allow the \nVietnamese fish industry to enhance its ability to ship more mislabeled \nfish products into this country, and under the procedure for \nconsideration of this agreement it is not subject to amendment.\n  However, I hope the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and \nDrug Administration will review its previous decisions on this issue \nand take steps to ensure the trade practices of the Vietnamese fish \nindustry are fair and do not mislead American consumers.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe resolution to approve the bilateral trade agreement signed by the \nUnited States and Vietnam on July 13, 2000. I believe this agreement is \nin the best interests of the United States and Vietnam and will do much \nto foster the political and economic ties between the two countries.\n  Under the terms of the agreement, the United States agrees to extend \nmost-favored nation status to Vietnam, which would significantly reduce \nU.S. tariffs on most imports from Vietnam. In return, Vietnam will \nundertake a wide range of market-liberalization measures, including \nextending MFN treatment to U.S. exports, reducing tariffs, easing \nbarriers to U.S. services, such as banking and telecommunications, \ncommitting to protect certain intellectual property rights, and \nproviding additional inducements and protections for inward foreign \ndirect investment.\n  These steps will significantly benefit U.S. companies and workers by \nopening a new and expanding market for increased exports and \ninvestment. Just as important for the United States, this agreement \nwill promote economic and political freedom in Vietnam by bringing \nVietnam into the global market economy, tying it to the rule of law, \nand increasing the wealth and prosperity of all Vietnamese.\n  I share the concerns many have expressed about the human rights \nsituation in Vietnam. No doubt, there is a great deal of room for \nimprovement. Nevertheless, I am a firm believer in the idea that as you \nincrease trade, as you increase communication, as you increase exposure \nto western and democratic ideals, you increase political pluralism and \nrespect for human rights. The more you isolate, the greater the chance \nfor human rights abuses.\n  I believe the United States will continue to address this issue and \nuse the closer ties that will come from an expanded economic and \npolitical relationship to press for significant improvement of \nVietnam's human rights record. We owe the people of Vietnam no less. In \naddition, as I have stated above, I believe that this agreement will \npromote economic opportunity and the rule of law in Vietnam which will \nhave a positive effect on that country's respect for human rights.\n  Mr. President, this agreement is another step in the normalization of \nrelations between the United States and Vietnam that began with the \nlifting of the economic embargo in 1994 and the establishment of \ndiplomatic relations the following year. Let us not take a step \nbackwards. We have the opportunity today to ensure that this process \ncontinues and the political and economic ties will grow to the benefit \nof all Americans and all Vietnamese. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe resolution to approve the United States-Vietnam trade agreement.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \nthe bilateral trade agreement with Vietnam, this trade agreement will \nextend normal trade relations status to Vietnam. This important \nlegislation enjoys strong bipartisan support, it passed the House of \nRepresentatives by voice vote and implements the comprehensive trade \nagreement signed last year.\n  The United States has extended the Jackson-Vanik waiver to Vietnam \nfor the past 3 years. This waiver is a prerequisite for Normal Trade \nRelations trade status and has allowed American businesses operating in \nVietnam to make use of programs supporting exports and investments to \nVietnam. The passage of this trade agreement completes the \nnormalization process with Vietnam that has spanned four Presidential \nAdministrations, and I believe it is a milestone in the strengthening \nof our bilateral relations.\n  I would like to commend our former Ambassador to Vietnam, Pete \nPeterson. Ambassador Peterson's tenure as Ambassador was a seminal \nperiod in United States-Vietnamese relations, and he did, by any \nstandard, an outstanding job in representing the United States.\n  I believe that this trade agreement will result in significant market \nopenings for America's companies. In particular, Oregon companies will \nbenefit from this expansion of trade with Vietnam by having greater \naccess to Vietnam's market of almost 80 million people, as well as \nlower tariffs on Oregon goods. This agreement also gives the United \nStates greater influence over the pace of economic, political and \nsocial reforms by opening Vietnam to the West. Our goods and our \ndemocratic values will have a strong and lasting impression in that \ncountry. I believe that this agreement will help transform Vietnam into \na more open and\n\n[[Page S10125]]\n\ntransparent society, expanding economic freedom and opportunities for \nthe Vietnamese people.\n  Portland, OR is home to a strong Vietnamese-American community, most \nof whom left their homeland as refugees decades ago. Oregon welcomed \nthese people with open arms and their tight-knit community have become \nhighly sought after workers and valued American citizens. I hope that \nthis step towards better relations will bring about true economic and \nsocial reforms to their homeland, as well as faith in their new \ncountry's ability to share western values abroad.\n  I applaud the Administration for its work on this trade effort and \nfor its work in rebuilding relations between the United States and \nVietnam. In particular, the work of the Department of Defense in \nsolving unresolved MIA cases in Vietnam has been outstanding. The \ndevotion to the goal of repatriating MIAs to the United States has \nprovided a sense of closure to many American families who experienced a \nloss decades ago.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee \nfor the timely disposition of this trade agreement, and I look forward \nto working with the Vietnamese people to bring further economic and \npolitical reforms to their country.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today, the Senate takes a significant \nstep toward opening Vietnamese markets to America's farmers and \nworkers, normalizing our relations with Vietnam, and reaffirming our \ncommitment to engage, and not retreat from, the rest of the world.\n  H.J. Res. 51, the Vietnam Trade Act, is the result of nearly five \nyears of negotiations. It will put into action the landmark trade \nagreement that was signed last summer by the United States and Vietnam.\n  A number of years ago, I had the opportunity to visit Vietnam. I \nremember the warmth with which we were greeted by nearly everyone we \nmet. I especially remember a girl I met one morning on a street in \nHanoi. She couldn't have been more than 12 or 13 years old, and she was \nselling old postcards of different places all over the world.\n  I offered to buy the one postcard she had from America.\n  She shook her head and said, ``No, won't sell . . . America.'' To \nher, that postcard was priceless. It represented a place of freedom and \nopportunity.\n  This trade agreement will allow US goods and services to enter \nVietnam. Just as important, it will allow American ideals to flow more \nfreely into that nation. It will help that young woman, and the 60 \npercent of all Vietnamese who were born after the war, create a freer \nand more prosperous Vietnam.\n  Instead of holding onto that old, tattered postcard, she will be able \nto grasp real freedom and opportunity. That will help both of our \nNations.\n  I want to thank the many people who made this agreement possible: \nAmbassador Pete Peterson and the trade negotiators in the Clinton \nAdministration; President Bush, who has pressed for this act's \ncompletion; Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley, who have worked \ntogether to bring this bill to the floor; and, four senators whose war \nstories are well known, and whose service to this country is \nunparalleled. This trade agreement would not have been possible without \nthe courageous leadership of John Kerry, John McCain, Chuck Hagel, and \nMax Cleland.\n  This is the most comprehensive bilateral trade agreement ever \nnegotiated by the U.S. with a Jackson-Vanik country.\n  It demands that Vietnam provide greater access to their markets, \nprovide greater protection for intellectual property rights, and \nmodernize business practices.\n  The result will be new markets, and new opportunities, for our \ncompanies, farmers and workers.\n  This trade deal is far more than just a commercial pact. It is \nanother step in the long road toward normalizing relations between our \ntwo countries.\n  We all know where our countries were, and how far we have come.\n  For people like John McCain and John Kerry, for all of us who served \nduring the Vietnam War era, we came of age knowing Vietnam as an \nadversary.\n  In the years since, we've been able to open lines of communication. \nWe've worked to provide a full accounting of American prisoners of war \nand those missing in action, and we are cooperating on research into \nthe health and environmental effects of Agent Orange.\n  Today, we take another step toward making Vietnam a partner.\n  In exchange for serious economic reform and increased transparency, \nthis agreement normalizes the economic relationship between our \ncountries.\n  Those reforms, in turn, will give Vietnam the opportunity to \nintegrate into regional and global institutions. And they will give the \nVietnamese people a chance to know greater freedoms and a more open \nsociety.\n  We are clear-eyed about Vietnam's problems. The State Department \nfound again this year that the Vietnamese government's human rights \nrecord is poor. Religious persecution and civil rights abuses are still \nrampant throughout the country.\n  In pressing forward today, we are not condoning this behavior. To the \ncontrary, we are calling on the Vietnam government to fulfill its \ncommitments for greater freedom.\n  And we are pledging to hold them to that commitment.\n  Finally, the Vietnam Trade Act is also a reaffirmation of America's \ncontinued international leadership.\n  Last spring, when this resolution was introduced in the Senate, I \nsaid that its passage would send a signal to the world that the United \nStates is committed to engaging with countries around the globe by \nusing our mutual interests as a foundation for working through our \ndifferences.\n  In the wake of September 11, this engagement is more important than \never, and since that time we have: overwhelmingly approved the Jordan \nFree Trade Act, the first ever U.S. free trade agreement with an Arab \ncountry; taken another step to make right our dues at the United \nNations; and, begun building an unprecedented international coalition \nagainst terrorism.\n  Final passage of this agreement will send an additional message to \nthe global community that the United States cannot, and will not, be \nscared into its borders.\n  We will not close up shop.\n  And to that young girl in Hanoi, and all who share her hopes, we say \nthat we will not be content to defend our freedoms solely within our \nborders. We will continue to be a light to all who look to us for hope.\n  We will not retreat from the world. We will lead it.\n  This is a good resolution. And it allows us to begin implementing a \ngood agreement. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nVietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement. This agreement paves the way for \nimproved relations between the United States and Vietnam, and will \nimprove overall economic and political conditions in both countries. I \nwould like to say a few words about a man who was an integral part of \nnegotiating this agreement, Ambassador Douglas ``Pete'' Peterson. Many \npeople in Florida are familiar with the heroic deeds and leadership of \nPete Peterson. It is fitting and proper that we, in this body, \nrecognize his exemplary service to our country.\n  Pete Peterson was a young Air Force pilot when he was shot down, \ncaptured, and held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam where he remained \nfor 6\\1/2\\ years. He was regularly interrogated, isolated, and \ntortured. Very few POWs were held longer. His example of perseverance \nunder the most horrible conditions and circumstances is one that cannot \nbe easily comprehended, but is one that we must regard with immense \ngratitude.\n  Pete Peterson was not deterred by his horrific experience in Hanoi \nand continued his service in the Air Force. He went on to complete 26 \nyears of service, retiring as a colonel. He distinguished himself as a \nleader in Florida, and was elected to represent the second \ncongressional district of Florida in 1990.\n  After serving three terms in the U.S. Congress, Pete became the U.S. \nfirst post-war Ambassador to Vietnam. I have known Pete for many years, \nand he made a comment about his tour as Ambassador to Vietnam, which I \nbelieve, is indicative of his commitment to service, ``How often does \none have the chance to return to a place where\n\n[[Page S10126]]\n\nyou suffered and try to make things right?''\n  Pete Peterson made things right. One step toward doing so was the \nVietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement. This was Pete's top trade priority, \nbut it was much more. It was an important part of normalizing relations \nwith Vietnam, including political and economic reform, as well as \nworking to improve human rights. Only someone of Pete Peterson's \ncaliber could have successfully represented the United States during \nthe challenging period of normalizing relations and healing between our \nnations. Only someone of his patriotism, honor, and integrity could \nhave played such a prominent role in achieving this trade agreement. \nThis agreement will increase market access for American products and \nimprove economic conditions in Vietnam as well as the climate for \ninvestors in Vietnam\n  Now we still have some work to do. I know the Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom has been critical of Vietnam, and I was \ndisappointed to see some of the comments that came out of Hanoi in the \nwake of the terrorist attacks on September 11. However, only through \nengagement and cooperative efforts can we most effectively press \nVietnam to continue to respect human rights and continue political and \neconomic reform. That is why Pete Peterson should be recognized and \nthanked here today. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, what is the parliamentary position?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. H.J. Res. 51 is pending.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, is there an agreement when a vote will \noccur?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A vote will occur at 2 p.m.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Seeing a vote is about to occur, I will be with you very \nbriefly.\n\n\n                         fast track legislation\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am encouraged by the beginnings of bipartisan action \nfrom the House on fast-track legislation, otherwise known as trade \npromotion authority. We have a little ways to go, but I am very \nencouraged by the beginnings of a bipartisan agreement in the other \nbody. It is my hope there can be more bipartisan agreement than there \nhas been thus far.\n  We want a bill to pass the House with as many votes as possible. \nObviously, granting fast-track authority, granting trade promotion to \nthe President by the Congress, if it passes by an extraordinarily large \nmargin, will be helpful in negotiating the SALT trade agreement with \nother countries.\n  If the House does pass this bill, the Senate Finance Committee will \ntake up the bill and hopefully bring the bill to the floor and get it \npassed. The key is in the spirit of the bipartisanship and cooperation, \nwhich has been tremendous, that has occurred since September 11. There \nis an opportunity for continued bipartisan agreement in the trade bill.\n  I am very pleased to say there has been such cooperation in \nWashington, DC--both Houses, both political parties, both ends of \nPennsylvania Avenue. There is an opportunity here for that same spirit \nof cooperation to continue on the trade bill. If it does, we will get \nit passed earlier rather than later.\n\n  I see 2 o'clock has arrived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been in consultation with the \ndistinguished Republican leader. I appreciate the advice we have been \ngiven on all sides with regard to how to proceed on the airport \nsecurity bill. I don't know that we have reached a consensus, but I do \nthink it is important for us to procedurally move forward with an \nexpectation that at some point we are going to reach a consensus.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to \nconsideration of S. 1447, the aviation security bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, first let me say to our \ncolleagues, Senator Daschle and I have been talking about this issue, \nalong with antiterrorism, off and on for the last week or 10 days. We \nare committed to dealing with those two important issues as soon as is \nhumanly possible because we believe, I believe, strongly that aviation \nsecurity needs to be addressed. The administration has a lot of things \nit can do and is doing. Secretary Mineta has outlined things he is \nproposing to do in terms of sky marshals and strengthening the cockpits \nand a number of areas where they can move forward without additional \nlegislative authority. Some of the things that need to be done will \nrequire additional legislative action.\n  This is one of the two highest priority matters we need to address \nthat would be positive for the American public to feel more secure in \nflying, get flying back up to where it should be. Along with \nantiterrorism, which will allow us to have additional authority for our \nlaw enforcement people and intelligence to address this threat, it is \nthe highest possible priority.\n\n  I agree with Senator Daschle that we should find a way to consider \naviation security, but there are two or three problems. I am going to \nbe constrained to have to object because there are two or three \nobjections on this side that come from a variety of standpoints at this \ntime.\n  There is some concern that it did not go through the Commerce \nCommittee for the traditional markup so that other good ideas could be \noffered, but they could, of course, be offered when the bill is \nconsidered. And there are some concerns about the federalization of the \nscreening, the bifurcated arrangement between urban hubs and nonurban \nhubs. Those that are nonurban hubs want to make sure they will not be \ngiven second-class service in that area.\n  There is also a concern about what may be added to this bill from any \nnumber of very brilliant Senators, very good ideas that are not \nrelevant at all to this issue.\n\n[[Page S10127]]\n\n  Some of them could relate to energy, about which I feel very \nstrongly. Some of them could relate to Amtrak, about which I also feel \nvery strongly. But this is about aviation security. We should have an \nunderstanding about how we deal with the displaced workers issue, how \ndo we deal with the Amtrak security issue, and other issues. If we do \nthat, this very important issue will begin to sink of its own weight.\n  We have, over the past 3 weeks, done good work in a nonpartisan, \nbipartisan way. But we addressed the issues that needed to be \naddressed, maybe not perfectly but we took action. I believe the \nAmerican people have appreciated that.\n  We should continue to find a way to make that happen. We are not \nready for consent right now, partially because Secretary Mineta will be \nhere in 20 minutes to meet with Senator Hollings, Senator McCain, \nSenator Hutchison, Senator Rockefeller, and others, to talk about some \nspecific recommendations the administration would like to make. I also \nunderstand that there will be a specific recommendation as to how to \nproceed on the dislocated workers or the employees issue that perhaps \nwill be discussed with Senator Daschle and me and others within a short \nperiod of time.\n  So I think all of these are very important. But for now, unless we \ncould get an agreement that we would limit this to relevant amendments, \nwhich would knock out a number of these side issues that are floating \naround, then we would have to object at this time.\n  I understand that Senator Daschle will then be inclined to file a \nmotion to proceed, and that would require a vote on the motion to \nproceed--we will have to talk through exactly what is required--either \non Friday or next Tuesday. In the interim, I hope we will work, as we \nhave in the past, to find a way to get a focus and to get aviation \nsecurity addressed.\n  I know Senator Hollings wants to do that. He doesn't want nonrelevant \namendments. He is willing to work with Senators on both sides to make \nthat happen. I know Senator McCain is very intent on getting a focused \naviation security bill. I believe we can make it happen, but we need a \nlittle bit more time to pursue understandings of how that would happen.\n  Let me inquire of Senator Daschle. I presume at this time that the \nSenator would not be prepared to agree to limit this to only relevant \namendments. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I may respond to the Republican \nleader, first, I agree with virtually all he has said. There is an \nurgency to the airport security bill that dictates that we come to the \nfloor this afternoon. I know Senator Hollings, Senator McCain, and \nothers have spent a good deal of time working in concert with experts \nand with others to reach the point that they have in bringing this bill \nto the floor right now. Earlier today, I made the announcement that we \nwere going to take up airport security first and counterterrorism \nsecond, and that my hope was that we could take up counterterrorism as \nearly as Tuesday. That may not now be the case.\n  I don't know that there are two more urgent pieces of legislation \nthan these two bills that are virtually ready to go. Obviously, that \ndoesn't mean because these two bills are urgent, that there is no other \nurgent matter related to the tragedy that has to be addressed. The \nquestion is, How many vehicles do you have, given the very serious \nlimitation on time? Senator Lott and I have spent a lot of hours, \nworking late into the night trying to pre-conference some of this. But \na lot of our colleagues, understandably, say, ``What about us? We want \nto participate. We have amendments that are good ideas that we would \nlike to offer.''\n  So acknowledging that some of these matters cannot be pre-\nconferenced, our only option is to come to the floor. Then our only \noption is to hear out other ideas, as Senator Lott suggested. Some are \ndirectly relevant to airport security, and some have to do with the \ntragedies that millions of Americans are facing in that they no longer \nhave a job, they no longer have health insurance, they no longer have \nthe ability to cope any more than the airlines had an ability to cope a \nweek ago. So there is an urgency to addressing their crises as well.\n  One Senator on the floor just now noted that we are probably a \nstone's throw away from a railroad tunnel that could be every bit as \nmuch in jeopardy and in danger as any airport today. There is an \nurgency to railroad security that we have to address. The question is, \nDo we have to take up each one of these bills separately and address \nthem individually or can we do what the Senate has always done as we \nlook at issues, which is address them in the most collective way, \nasking for people to be disciplined, cooperative, and to understand the \nurgency and to understand that this is a different day? We are in a \ncrisis situation. I am as much for ensuring that everybody has an \nopportunity to be heard as is possible. But we need to recognize that \nthe whole country is watching, the whole country is expecting us to \nrespond, as we have so far.\n\n  So I am disappointed, frankly, that we are not able to get agreement \nto go to this bill and debate issues that are of import to the country, \nnot just to any particular Republican or Democrat. So we will file \ncloture and recognize that there will be another time when these bills \nand amendments are going to be considered. I hope that in working as \nSenator Lott and I have, together with all of the cooperation we have \nbeen given these last 3 weeks, we can work through these difficult \nquestions. I am still confident that we can, even though we may have \nhit a temporary snag.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I might respond, and then I will yield \nbecause I know the chairman and ranking member want to comment, too, I \nthink what Senator Daschle is saying is that he would not be able to \nagree to limit it only to relevant amendments now. But there is another \noption here, and that is for us as Senators to focus on aviation \nsecurity and not put all of our very best ideas on this particular \nbill. If we could do that, we could complete this legislation tomorrow. \nWe would have aviation security done tomorrow. Senator Hollings and \nSenator McCain would be happy. I would like to have a different \napproach to screening, but I am prepared to debate and vote on that.\n  If it goes beyond that, the option for ideas--good ideas--and \nalternatives and unrelated and nonrelevant amendments, it could go on \nand on. I think maybe we can get this worked out this afternoon. If we \ndo not, it guarantees that instead of being on the counterterrorism \nlegislation on Tuesday, we will be on this, and counterterrorism will \nbe shoved off another day or 2 or 3. That is not disastrous because we \nwant to make sure we do them both right, but for the sake of getting \nthis done, I plead to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's \nfind a way to agree to do aviation security and to do these other \nissues that are also important.\n  Regarding Amtrak, everybody in this Chamber probably knows--and \nSenator McCain knows it and doesn't like it--I have been a big \nsupporter of Amtrak. I am interested in making sure that it is safe and \nsecure and that we have a viable Amtrak system, but we should not do it \non this bill.\n  So I have to object at this time to the unanimous consent request. I \nunderstand Senator Daschle will be prepared to offer a motion to \nproceed and file cloture on that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, before I file the cloture motion, let me \nyield to the distinguished Senator from South Carolina first, and to \nthe Senator from Arizona second.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the leader. The leaders, in all candor, have \nworked around the clock to get the disparate interests on this issue \ntogether so that we can decide on what we can agree upon rather than \nwhat we disagree upon. In that light, let me thank the majority and the \nminority leaders for their perseverance in helping us get this bill up.\n  It is fair to say I am as interested in this issue as the previous \nspeakers. We have been working very hard on this issue. We just had a \nCommerce subcommittee hearing on rail and maritime security all day \nlong yesterday. We are ready to go with the airline security bill. But \nthere are some differences of views; similarly, with respect to the \neconomic stimulus, and also with respect to the unemployment benefits \nbill. In fact, you can bring this bill up and, unless it is relevant, \nyou\n\n[[Page S10128]]\n\ncan add Lawrence Welk's home to this measure, and so forth. We know \nwhat the rules of the Senate are. But it is going to be embarrassing if \nwe leave for the weekend having agreed on money, but not on security. \nWe should have put airline security ahead of money to bailout the \nairlines. But the K Street lawyers overwhelmed us. They were down here \nand we got billions to keep the airlines afloat. But, by gosh, we can't \nagree on taking up this airline security measure so that we can keep \nthem in business. So we intentionally put them out of business by \ndelaying implementation of a meaningful security measure.\n\n  We are not having votes on Friday; we are not having votes on Monday. \nUnless we can get this thing up this afternoon it is not likely to pass \nbefore the weekend. Someone commented that when we considered this \nmatter in the Commerce Committee, we started at 9 o'clock and we got \nthrough at quarter to 7 that evening with only a half hour out. We had \na full day's hearing and unanimously voted this bill out of committee. \nThe bill is flexible. It was mentioned that the Secretary of \nTransportation is coming over with views from the White House. We are \nwilling to go along with any reasonable compromise from the \nadministration. What we are trying to do is get security. We are not \ntrying to pass your bill in spite of our bill, or whatever.\n  We are going to meet at 3 o'clock. I hope the two Senate leaders will \ntry to get together and work out this dispute. Senator McCain has been \na leader on this. We have agreed on the details. There are a few little \ndifferences. But let's get together with the leadership and get this \nmeasure up so that we can go home this weekend at least having taken \ncare of security, and then we can move to counterterrorism and \nunemployment benefits later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I still retain the floor for purposes of making a \nmotion, but I yield to the Senator from Arizona first.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Lott and Senator Daschle \nfor the efforts they are making to try to bring this measure forward. I \nespecially thank Senator Hollings. He has agreed, along with me, that \nwe would oppose any nonrelevant amendments to this legislation. That is \nan important commitment on the part of Senator Hollings. I know how he \nfeels about Amtrak and about seaport security and a number of other \nissues. I thank Senator Hollings for that.\n  Briefly, if we now wait, as Senator Hollings said, until cloture is \nvoted on Friday, and we surely can't act until Monday, and we are not \ngoing to be in on Monday, we are well into next week. Last week, we \npassed legislation to keep the airlines afloat financially. Millions of \nAmericans still will not fly on airliners because they don't believe \nthey are safe. That is a fact.\n  When Americans know that the Congress of the United States has acted \nin a bipartisan fashion, with the support of the President of the \nUnited States, to take measures to ensure their security, that will be \nthe major step in restoring the financial viability not only of the \nairlines but of America because we are dependent on the air \ntransportation system in order to have an economy that is viable.\n  I am happy to say that the airlines are totally supportive of this \nlegislation. They want it enacted right away. They believe it is vital \nfor their future viability.\n  Finally, the fact that it didn't go through the Commerce Committee, \nthe chairman and I are not too concerned about that. I think we are \nfairly well known to be conscious of that. As far as the screening \nissue is concerned, that is why we have debate and amendments. We will \nlet the majority rule. That is relevant to the bill. Again, about \nprovisions being added, I don't think any Member of this body is going \nto try to add an amendment that would be perceived as blocking airline \nsecurity, including the Senator from Massachusetts, who is very \nconcerned about the issue of Amtrak.\n  I hope the two leaders will continue working together. We will meet \nwith Secretary Mineta and hear for the first time the views of the \nadministration on this issue. I hope that by the time that meeting is \nover, we will have an agreement so we can move forward.\n  Lots of Members are involved in this issue. Lots of Members want to \ntalk about it. Lots of Members are involved in it, so we are going to \nhave to have a lot of discussion on this issue. The sooner we move \nforward, the sooner we are going to get it done. As Senator Hollings \nsaid, we can get this bill passed by tomorrow afternoon if we all work \nat it, but if we wait over the weekend, I do not think it is the right \nsignal to send. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield briefly to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I believe as strongly about railroad \nsecurity and airport security as I do airline security, but we need to \nmove on this particular bill. To put it in personal terms, every one of \nthose jets that were hijacked were headed to my State with light loads \nand heavy fuel, and those passengers were sacrificed.\n  We need to move forward. We need the air marshals. We need the funds \nto pay for them. We need the screeners and everybody else. Even though \nthe bill did not officially go through the committee, I praise Chairman \nHollings and ranking member McCain because, in fact, they led that \ncommittee through some amazing hearings. I think this bill is a \nterrific first step. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me go right to the heart of airport \nsecurity. I had the most unique experience earlier today with El Al \nofficials who came to the Committee on Commerce and reviewed in detail \ntheir security provisions for Israel's airline. They have not had a \nhijacking in the last 20 to 25 years.\n  I do not want to necessarily single them out other than to say that \nthe officials present included, the regional director for the North \nAmerica and Central America Israeli Security Agency and the head of the \nIsraeli Security Agency of the Aviation Department. We also had the \nchief of security for El Al Airlines, and the top captain of El Al \nAirlines visit with us.\n  The four gentlemen went through in detail the Israeli airport \nsecurity program. It was an eye opener for me. I have been working on \nthis issue since the eighties when Pan Am Flight 103 went down over \nLockerbie, Scotland. I was insisting then that we have federalization \nof security at our airports and on our airplanes. I was in the \nminority.\n  With respect to TWA Flight 800, in 1996 it was the same, and we had \nbill upon bill and measure upon measure and study upon study, more \ntraining, more this, more that, a particular officer in charge, the \nVice President Gore study. None of this made a difference. Of course, \nthe hijackers still flew the planes into buildings in America and \nkilled 6,000 people.\n  I borrowed this diagram from the Israeli delegation. This particular \ndiagram is entitled ``Onion Rings Security Structure.'' The security in \nIsrael and El Al Airlines brings into sharp focus that security is not \na partial operation. Security is not part private contract and part \ngovernmental. As has been said for years, the primary function of the \nState government--and a former\n\n[[Page S10129]]\n\ndistinguished Governor is occupying the Chair--is public education, and \nthe primary function of the National Government is national defense. We \nhave gone now from, in a sense, international defense to national \ndefense, homeland security. That is our primary function.\n\n  There is no difference in safety and security. We would not think for \na second of privatizing the air traffic controllers. I agreed with \nPresident Reagan. He said: You are not striking; you are staying on the \njob. We are going to have, in a sense, security and safe flights.\n  This diagram starts with the outer rim of intelligence. The second \nrim is in the airport. The third rim is the check-in area. The fourth \nrim is the departure gate. The fifth ring is cargo, and the next two \nrings are the airport area and the aircraft itself.\n  They Israeli officials were asked: How about somebody who vacuum \ncleans the aircraft aisles and in between the seats? They have 100-\npercent security checks. Point: There is no such thing as a low-skilled \njob in security. As a matter of fact, they periodically rotate security \nofficers to different postings. They found out, like we found out with \nthe Capitol Police that rotations make a difference in the \neffectiveness of our security personnel. We do not have the Capitol \nPolice sit in the same spot from early morning until their 8 hours are \nup just looking at the screen as the tourists come into the Nation's \nCapitol. The officer does that for about 4 hours, and then they swap \nhim off to another post.\n  The Israeli security officials keep their airport personnel alert, \nthey keep them well paid, they keep them well trained, and they keep \nthem well tested.\n  The El Al folks were telling me that they make 150 annual security \nchecks at Israel's airports. They try to sneak vicious items through \nsecurity like a knife or a metallic object resembling a bomb. Of \ncourse, it is not a real bomb. The airports are not given a check in \nJanuary and then they wait until the next January to check again. They \nhave intermittent checks throughout the entire year.\n  By way of emphasis, in that check-in area they confer with \nintelligence. Intelligence confers with them. Intelligence will tell \nthem, for example, if you have ever been down to Tijuana, they have \ncertain entities down in Mexico that can really plagiarize, copy, an \nimmigration pass. They know when they come from certain areas what \npasses to look at. In fact, they have them on a board there because I \nhave been down there and checked with the Immigration Service, in a \nsimilar fashion.\n  Intelligence can say: Wait a minute, if they come from this area, we \nfound out now they have counterfeit measures over there and they are \nalmost perfect and here is what we have to look for, and everything \nelse of that kind. So that is why they take them into a side room, give \nthem a separate check, fingerprint and everything else they have, take \na picture.\n  You have absolute security and therefore absolute trust in the \nflights on El Al.\n  You cannot have anything other than that for the U.S. travelers. \nSpecifically, we cannot have the Capitol policemen, who give us \nsecurity, be private contractors, nor can the Secret Service that gives \nthe President security be private contractors. To put it another way, I \nam not going to agree to any kind of contract or partial contract or \npartial supervision over airline security and airport security until \nthey privatize the Secret Service or the Capitol Police, or excuse me, \nthe 33,000 that we have in Immigration and Border Patrol. They are all \ncivil servants. Nobody says privatize the civilian workers, 666,000 \ncivilian civil service workers in the Department of Defense.\n  I am told that the OMB called over there earlier this year and said \nwe want to start contracting. There is a fetish about contracting out \nand privatizing and downsizing. That helps us get elected. I am going \nto get elected. I am going to Washington. I am going to downsize the \nGovernment. Just like private industry has proven its profitability in \ndownsizing, so I am for downsizing. Those political ideologies have to \nbe dispensed with. As the President has to get a coalition of foreign \ncountries, he has to get a coalition of political interests in-country, \nget us on the right road for the war against terrorism.\n  They wanted to privatize over at the Defense Department and they \nsaid: You are not privatizing anything over here. We are engaged in \nsecurity.\n  They cannot be made contract employees. They come in, they are \nincidental to all the information and goings on, and everything else \nlike that. We have to have total security checks, audit them from time \nto time and everything else. That is the same thing with the airports.\n  We have made a provision for the smaller airports. They are going to \nhave to have the same kind of security, but they can be hired. There is \nflexibility given in this particular bill. With that flexibility, we \nknow we can work this out right across the hall when we meet \nmomentarily with the Department of Transportation.\n  Incidentally, the Deputy Secretary of Transportation in charge of \nsecurity will not only have this particular security for airlines and \nairports but for rail transportation, the tunnels, the stations, and \nfor the seaports. That is the way it is in Israel. The Israeli Security \nAgency intermittently changes around and does different tasks, and \neverything else like that. So they keep them alert. They keep them well \npaid, and there is none of this 400-percent turnover like we have down \nat Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta, the busiest airport in the world. \nThere is a 400-percent turnover in security personnel down there. It is \nbetween $5.50 and $7.25, the minimum wage. So that has to stop.\n\n  We have to have, as has been provided in this particular bill, the \nmarshals. We expand the marshals group, I can say that. I have talked \nabout the airport and the interims, and everything else of that kind.\n  There was one question I asked when I first met with El Al security. \nI said: Do any of you all contract? They were just amazed.\n  They asked: What does he mean by contract?\n  I said: Private employment or whatever it is.\n  You would not let controllers quit on you. You cannot let the \nsecurity people strike on you. They are like the FBI. Do you think we \ncan have the FBI strike or the Senators go on strike?\n  I have 4 more years. Should I sit down and strike? You cannot have a \nstrike of your public employees. That has been cleared in Israel, and \neverything else of that kind.\n  The second question I asked, I said it seemed to me once you secured \nthe cockpit, separated it from the cabin and the passengers, once you \nsecured that cockpit and they are never permitted to open that door in \nflight, then what you really have is the end of hijacking because you \nget a better opportunity of killing a greater number of people or \ntaking them off or something or beating on them and everything else of \nthat kind, you cannot take the plane.\n  The rule of the game was otherwise. Heretofore, until September 11, \nthe rule of the game was for the pilots to say: You want to go to \nHavana, Cuba? I wanted to go there, too. Let us all fly to Havana. And \nyou ask the other hijacker: You want to go to Rio? As soon as we land \nin Cuba and get some fuel, we will go to Rio. They will go anywhere \nthey want to accommodate the hijacker and get the plane on the ground \nat whatever place he wants to go and let law enforcement take over.\n  It is totally changed. We have the marshals. That door is never \nopened. The El Al executive told me--actually, it was the pilot I was \ntalking to--he said, if my wife was being assaulted in that cabin in \nthe passenger's section, I do not open the door. I land it and let the \nsecurity take over, the FBI or the local security or wherever it is.\n  So that is the end of the opportunity to take over and take a plane \nwherever you want it to go. We have not just relied on that, of course. \nWe have the marshals.\n  I said about these hijackers, suppose they grab the stewardess and \nsay: Identify who the marshal is. They said the marshal is trained as \nsoon as he sees that happening, he takes the hijacker out. He does not \nwait around. He is watching. He is trained. He is skilled and they do \nnot dilly around, and everything else of that kind.\n  Instead, even in a disaster of that kind, they still cannot get into \nthe\n\n[[Page S10130]]\n\ncabin and hijack the plane. Of course, they know immediately. They have \ncommunications and signals. They know immediately in the cockpit that \nis what is going on and they land the plane.\n  I could go on and on. I think what everyone should know is this \noverwhelming bipartisan majority is ready to pass this bill no later \nthan tomorrow night sometime. We are not having votes on Friday so we \ncannot get votes on cloture Friday. We are not having votes on Monday, \nso you cannot get cloture. You have to wait until Tuesday morning. It \nwill be a public embarrassment that we worked patiently with the \nleadership, and I have commended them both. They have worked around the \nclock to try to get us together on what we could get together on rather \nthan bringing in all of these amendments. We do not want to send over a \nbill with all kinds of amendments and then go into a long conference if \nwe can clear, generally speaking, a barebones bill for security so that \nwe can get the flying public back on the planes.\n  If we can do that by late tomorrow night, working with the White \nHouse and the House leadership who is also in this particular meeting, \nthen more power to us. Otherwise, shame on us if we cannot do that. We \nare behind schedule.\n  I tried my best to get this particular security measure up before the \nmoney bill came up. Everybody was saying we could not put any \namendments, we could not even consider security along with the money. \nWe had to wait, although we had a unanimous consent. We did not have \nthat particular consideration.\n  I thank the distinguished Chair. I thank the leadership for their \ndiligence in trying to work this out so we can proceed to it. There is \nno question that we can get cloture.\n  If we could forgo the cloture motion and agree that nongermane \namendments are not allowed, just germane amendments on the bill, we \ncould consider them, vote them, we would be here late this evening and \nlate tomorrow might and get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I compliment the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Commerce Committee for work on airline safety. I know my \nfriend from South Carolina feels strongly about port safety and rail \nsafety as well.\n  However, I say to my colleague, who happens to be presiding today and \nwas a former board member of Amtrak, I am, as the saying goes, tired of \ngetting stiffed around here. I have been a Senator for 28\\1/2\\ years. I \nhave tried over that 28\\1/2\\ years to put Amtrak in a position where it \ncan run safely, securely, and efficiently. I have gotten promise after \npromise after promise of support and cooperation, and always \nprocedurally I end up being in a position where Amtrak gets left out.\n  Let's talk about security for a moment. The Senator from Delaware and \nI don't have a major airport; we have a large airport but no major \ncommercial airport in our State. We fly commercially in and out of \nPhiladelphia or Baltimore, sometimes. We know how important air safety \nis. We know how important to our economy it is. I note, by the way, \nwith all the difficulty, understandably, of the airlines--there is \napprehension on behalf of the American people to get on an airplane, \nwith the necessary cancellations of flights because they don't have \nenough people flying--there has been standing room only on Amtrak \ntrains, we are putting more and more trains in the northeast corridor, \nand there is standing room only on most of them.\n  I ask my friends, parenthetically, what would have happened to our \neconomic system if, in fact, we had had no rail passenger service since \nSeptember 11? You think you have a problem now? You ``ain't'' seen \nnothing yet.\n  I, along with my colleague from Delaware, and others, went to Amtrak \nand asked: Have you reviewed your safety needs? They said: Yes, we \nhave. I said: Put together a package for us that lays out in some \ndetail the concerns you have relative to safety, security, and \nterrorism.\n  I note parenthetically, I served on the Intelligence Committee for 10 \nyears. I have been chairman of the Judiciary Committee for the better \npart of a decade. I have been on a terrorism committee or subcommittee \nsince I arrived in the Senate in the 1970s. I will say something \npresumptuous: No one here knows more about terrorism than I do. I don't \nknow it all, but I have worked my entire career trying to understand \nthe dilemma. I now chair the Foreign Relations Committee. I made a \nspeech literally the day before this happened at the National Press \nClub, saying our greatest priority was dealing with terrorism, and laid \nout in detail what might happen. I am not the only one.\n  I will make an outrageous statement: My bona fides in knowing as much \nabout what terrorists are doing, are likely to do, and being informed \nare equal to anyone's on this floor, or who has ever served in the \nSenate, or who is now serving. I may not know more, but I don't know \nanybody who knows more than I do. I am saying what will happen next is \nnot going to be another airliner into a building. It will be an Amtrak \ntrain. It will be in the Baltimore Tunnel which was built before the \nCivil War.\n  Do you realize--my colleague knows this--if you have a Metroliner and \nan ``Am fleet'' in that tunnel at one time, you have more people in \nthere than in five packed 747s? Guess what. There is no ventilation in \nthere. None. There is no lighting. There are no fire hoses. I can go on \nand on and on. In New York City, the Amtrak Penn Station, do you know \nhow many people go through those tunnels, which also have no \nventilation, that are underground, and have little or no security? \nThree hundred and fifty thousand people a day--three hundred and fifty \nthousand people a day.\n  As one of my colleagues said in an earlier meeting I had downstairs \nwith those concerned about Amtrak, not the least of whom is my \ncolleague presiding--he said what we are doing on airport security and \nairline security is acting after the horse is out of the barn. We are. \nAnd we have to. And we should. And I will. But God forbid the horse \ngets out of another barn.\n  We have a chance now--now, not after there is some catastrophe on our \npassenger rail system--to do something. I remind my colleagues, the \nFirst Street tunnel in D.C. runs under the Supreme Court of the United \nStates and runs under the Rayburn Building. It was built in 1910. There \nis only one way out: Walk out. No ventilation. Not sufficient lighting, \nsignals, security.\n  I said in that Press Club speech the day before the airline crashed \ninto the trade towers and brought them down, it is much more likely \nsomeone will walk into a subway with a vial of sarin gas than someone \nsending an ICBM our way. I will repeat that: It is much more likely. Do \nyou think these guys are stupid? Obviously, they are not stupid. They \nfigured out if they added enough jet fuel to two of the most \nmagnificent buildings man ever created, they could create enough heat \nto melt the beams and crush the building. Do you think these same folks \nhave not sat down and figured out our vulnerabilities?\n  Everybody is worried about our water system, a legitimate thing to \nworry about. We can monitor the water system before it gets to your \ntap. What do you monitor in tunnels, 6 of them, that have 350,000 \npeople a day going through them, in little cars, with no way to get \nout, underground?\n  My heart bleeds for my friends who tell me to be concerned about \ntheir airports. I am concerned about them. When are people going to be \nconcerned? We have 500 people, as my colleagues knows, on an Am-fleet \ntrain. I think that is about two 757s. I don't know that for a fact. \nThat is one train.\n  A lot of our colleagues rode up to New York City on Amtrak, because \nthey couldn't fly, to observe the devastation. I hope they observed, \nwhile sitting in the tunnel, that in one case, over 141 years old, \nthere was more than one train in that tunnel. Two of these tunnels run \nunder the Baltimore harbor.\n  So last night our staffs got together. By the way, all those \nconcerned about Amtrak safety are equally concerned about airline \nsafety, and, I might add, port safety. Do you know how many cargo \ncontainers come into the port of Philadelphia or even the little port \nof Wilmington? Probably the only man who knows that is my colleague \npresiding, the former Governor.\n\n[[Page S10131]]\n\n  My Lord. So we sat down last night. We thought we had a reasonable \ndiscussion, all those parties interested. We got a commitment. OK, we \nwill bring up port safety and Amtrak safety measures and we will \nguarantee, to use the Senate jargon, a vehicle. In other words, we will \nvote for it on something we know is not going to get killed, like they \nkill everything else that has to do with Amtrak.\n\n  So I said OK, I will not introduce this amendment on the airline \nbill. I will not do it.\n  By the way, I want to make it clear I got full support from the \nchairman of the committee. He supports our effort.\n  So I came in this morning, about to go out, take my committee down to \nmeet with the Secretary of State for a 2-hour lunch to go over these \nterrorist issues--not about Amtrak but about Afghanistan and the \nsurrounding area--and as I am leaving I find out through my staff \nmember who handles this issue: Guess what. We really have no deal.\n  So I call the leadership. The leadership says: Joe, we can't \nguarantee you can get this up.\n  Now I gather up the Members of the Senate who have a great concern \nabout the safety issues relating to Amtrak and some say: Joe, will you \ndare hold up the airline bill? Would you dare do that?\n  My response is: Would they dare not to take on our amendment? Would \nthey dare not take on our amendment, after being told--which I will be \ntelling my colleagues about for the next several hours, although I am \nnot going to speak that long now, I say to my friend from Missouri, so \nhe can speak--would they dare take the chance of not helping us? Will \nthey dare? Will my colleagues dare to take the chance that they are \ngoing to let another horse out of the barn this time? Will they dare?\n  This is serious business. This is business as serious as I have ever \nbeen engaged in as a U.S. Senator. If I act as if I am angry, it is \nbecause I am. Not only angry, I am really disappointed. I would have \nthought in this moment when we are embracing each other in the sense \nthat we are helping each of our regions deal with their serious \nproblems--I was so, so, so overjoyed; having been here for the bailout \nof New York City in the 1970s, I was so gratified to see my friends \nfrom the South and the Midwest and the Northwest come to New York's aid \ninstantaneously. I said, my God, this is really a change. It is really \na change in attitude because America has been struck.\n  We come to the floor with an amendment that does two things: One, \nprovides for more police, more lighting, more fencing, more cameras, et \ncetera, and provides for us to take equipment out of storage and \nrefurbish it so we can handle all those passengers who are not flying, \nand what is the response? Either ``No'' or ``Another day, Senator.'' I \nhave had it up to here with another day.\n  As I said, and I will have a lot more to say about this in the next \ncouple of days, there are six tunnels in New York, 350,000 people per \nday locked inside a steel case called a car, going through those \ntunnels. Those tunnels have insufficient lighting. They were built \ndecades ago. They do not have the proper signaling for emergencies. \nThey do not have the proper ventilation. They do not have the proper \nsafety in terms of guards.\n  You are talking about air marshals on an airplane with as few as 50 \npeople on it. I am for that. And you are telling me you are not going \nto give me the equivalent of an air marshal at either end of a tunnel \nthat has 350,000 people a day go through it? Where is your shame?\n  The Baltimore tunnel was built in 1870, just after--I said ``before'' \nand I misspoke--just after the Civil War. By the way, you would not be \nable to build these tunnels today. I want to make sure that is clear to \neverybody. Under EPA construction standards, you could not build these \ntunnels. They would not allow it to be done just for normal safety \nreasons.\n\n  I have been crying about this for the last 15 years, about just \nnormal safety problems--not terrorists, just a fire in the tunnel as \nyou had in Baltimore.\n  All of you who live, love, and work in Washington, there is a tunnel \nthat Amtrak trains, MARC trains and other trains come through in DC. It \nis called the First Street tunnel in DC. It was built in 1910. All you \nneed is one Amfleet train in there and one Metroliner in there--and \nthere are more than two at a time--and you have over 800 people locked \nin a steel canister in a tunnel that was built in 1910, that sits \ndirectly underneath the Supreme Court of the United States of America \nand the Rayburn Building.\n  I am not suggesting I know his position, but I suspect his reaction \nif I told my friend from Missouri, St. Louis: Guess what. I am not \ngoing to spend Delaware money making sure there are guards or added \nsecurity at the St. Louis Airport. I am not going to do it. You are on \nyour own, Sucker. I am not going to do that. I am not going to beef up \nsecurity.\n  We can get on an Amtrak train with a bomb. No one checks. There are \nno detectors to go through to get on a train. There are no security \nmeasures. We do not even have enough Amtrak police for the cars.\n  If I said to my friends in St. Louis and Philadelphia and Seattle and \nAtlanta and Miami--we use the same standard for the airlines. Under \nordinary circumstances, you might be able to say to me: Joe, it is too \nexpensive. You just have to take your chances.\n  We have the Attorney General saying to people that there is more to \ncome. How many of my colleagues out here have said: ``It is not only if \nbut when the next biological or chemical attack takes place''?\n  If you are going to have a biological or chemical attack, in case you \nhaven't figured it out, the more confined the space, the more \ndevastating the damage.\n  Like I said, I will come back to speak to this. What we are asking \nfor is lighting, fencing, access controls for tunnels, bridges and \nother facilities, satellite communications on trains, remote engine \nturnoff, and hiring of police and security officers. That adds up to \n$515 million, and it doesn't even do it all. Tunnel safety, \nrehabilitating existing tunnels in Baltimore and Washington and \ncompleting the entire life safety system of New York tunnels, that is \n$998 million.\n  The total security all by itself is $1.513 billion. That does not \ndeal with the capacity on bridges and tracks to account for the 20 \npercent increase in ridership because the airlines aren't moving, or \nthe equipment capacity to be able to carry these people safely--just \nthe safety of the cars themselves.\n  I tell you what. We all stood up here and we bailed out the airlines \nand their executives the other day to the tune of--I forget the \nnumber--$15 billion, and we did it in a heartbeat or, as they say, in a \nNew York minute. And we cannot even now come along and deal in this \nbill with the workers of the airlines. But that is another fight.\n  Here we are with this simple, straightforward request. This isn't a \n1-year undertaking. This is a permanent investment.\n  Unless all of you are so sure that there is no more terrorist \nactivity underway, unless all of you are so sure that in case it is--by \nthe way, we carry in the Northeast more passengers than every single \nplane that lands on the east coast in a day. Have you got that? This is \nnot fair. This is not smart. It is not right to block our ability to \nhave a guarantee that the Nation and the Congress speak on this issue.\n  As I said, it is a little like preaching to the choir. I know my \ncolleague from Delaware, as the old saying goes, has forgotten more \nabout the details of Amtrak, having been a board member, than even I \nknow, having used it for 28 years. But I sincerely hope there is a \nchange of heart. I don't want to slow up the passing of the airplane \nsafety bill. I just want the people of my State to know that the people \nof my region are going to be treated as fairly as everybody else. Give \nthem a basic shot at security--just a basic shot at security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank you very much. I appreciate the \nkindness of my colleague from Delaware for yielding the floor.\n  This subject is at the top of everyone's mind--the impact of \nterrorism and the threat of future terrorism. We are going to be \ntalking about security and security in all forms of transportation.\n  I want to mention the economic recovery that is absolutely essential \nbecause we know that terrorists cannot\n\n[[Page S10132]]\n\nwin. Even though they committed a dastardly act and killed over 6,000 \npeople and destroyed major economic and military landmarks, they cannot \nwin if they do not destroy our economy and cripple us psychologically.\n  Today I introduced a measure to help in the economic recovery for the \nsmall businesses in the United States, a bill called the Small Business \nLeads to Economic Recovery Act of 2001. It is a comprehensive economic \nstimulus package for the Nation's small businesses and self-employed \nentrepreneurs.\n  The Small Business Administration tells us that some 14,000 small \nbusinesses are in the disaster area in New York alone. They have been \ndirectly affected by this tragedy. But the economic impact doesn't stop \nwith those businesses. For months, small enterprises and self-employed \nindividuals have been struggling with the slowing economy. The \ndastardly terrorist attacks make their situation even more dire.\n  As ranking member on the Small Business Committee, on a daily basis I \nhear pleas for help from small businesses in my State of Missouri and \nacross the Nation. Small restaurants have lost much of their business \nbecause of a fall-off in business travel. Local flight schools have \nbeen grounded as a result of the response to the terrorist attacks. \nMain street retailers are struggling to survive.\n  I think we should act and act soon. That is why I introduced this \nbill to increase access to capital, to provide tax relief and \ninvestment incentives, and to assure that when the Federal Government \ngoes shopping for badly needed services, they will shop with small \nbusiness in America.\n\n  The SBA existing Disaster Loan Program was not designed to meet the \nextraordinary obstacles facing small businesses following the September \n11 attacks. It could be a year or more before they can reopen. Small \nbusinesses throughout the United States have shut down as a result of \nsecurity concerns. General aviation aircraft remain grounded, closing \nflight schools and other small businesses depending on aircraft.\n  My bill would allow these small businesses to defer for 2 years the \nrepayment of principal and interest on these SBA disaster relief loans, \nand accrued interest will be forgiven. Many small businesses are \nexperiencing serious economic problems because their businesses have \nbeen in a sharp decline since September 11. We need to help these \nbusinesses with cashflow or working capital so their businesses can \nreturn to normal.\n  We would establish a special loan program for allowing small \nbusinesses to cope by lowering the interest to prime plus 1, with no \nupfront guarantee fee. The SBA will guarantee 95 percent of the loan.\n  Banks would be able to defer principal payments up to 1 year.\n  For general economic recovery, small businesses would benefit from an \nenhancement of the existing 7(a) Guaranteed Business Loan Program to \nmake those loans more affordable.\n  No guaranteed fees would be paid by small business. The SBA \nguarantees would be increased from 80 percent to 90 percent for loans \nup to $150,000 and from 75 percent to 85 percent for loans greater than \n$150,000.\n  I will be cosponsoring with Senator Kerry, the chairman of the \ncommittee, a measure that will help deal with these key ingredients for \nassuring access to capital for small business.\n  In addition, under the Debenture Small Business Investment Company \nProgram, pension funds cannot invest in small business investment \ncompanies without incurring unrelated business taxable income.\n  Most pension funds can't invest--eliminating 60 percent of private \ncapital potential. My bill corrects this problem by excluding \nGovernment-guaranteed capital borrowed by debenture SBICs from debt for \nthe Unrelated Business Tax Income rules.\n  On small business tax relief, we would increase the amount of new \nequipment that small business could expense to $100,000 per year, \nallowing small businesses that do not qualify for expensing to \ndepreciate computer equipment and software over 2 years.\n  These will be significant enhancements to cashflow.\n  We increase the depreciation limitation on business vehicles to ease \ncashflow problems for small businesses and help stimulate automotive \nindustry recovery.\n  We raise the deduction for business meals back up to 100 percent to \nget people to take lunches at restaurants which are struggling. The \nrestaurant industry lost 60,000 jobs in September. We need to get \nrestaurants back on their feet.\n  We would repeal the alternative minimum tax on individuals and expand \nthe AMT exemption for small corporations to leave more earnings in the \npockets of small businesses to reinvest for long-term growth and job \ncreation.\n  These items will give a significant boost to small business, which \nhas been and is the driving force in our economy.\n  Finally, when the Federal Government goes out shopping, we want to \nmake sure it shops with the small businesses in America. Currently the \nBrooks Act prohibits small business set-asides for architectural and \nengineering contracts above $85,000, a figure set in 1982. My bill \nwould raise that ceiling to $300,000.\n  The policy of the Federal Government that contracts valued at less \nthan $100,000 be reserved for small businesses would be adopted for the \nGeneral Services Administration. For contracts not on the Federal \nSupply Schedule, they would be reserved for and limited to small \nbusinesses registered with the SBA.\n  My bill would remove the ceiling on sole-sourcing contracting under \nthe HUBZone and 8(a) Programs to permit larger contracts to be awarded \nquickly to small businesses capable of providing postdisaster goods and \nservices.\n  These changes I think would help get small businesses' engines--the \nengine that drives our economy that will help lead us out of the \neconomic stagnation we face as a result of these dastardly terrorist \nattacks.\n  I invite my colleagues to join with me to contact my small business \nstaff and let me know if they have questions. I urge them to join with \nme in sponsoring this badly needed stimulus package for small business.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is a bit disappointing that this \nafternoon we had to file a cloture motion in order for the Senate to \nconsider a piece of legislation dealing with airport and airline \nsecurity in this country.\n  All Americans understand that on September 11, when hijackers \nhijacked four commercial airlines and used fully loaded 767s to run \ninto buildings and kill thousands of Americans using those commercial \nairliners as guided missiles--bombs, with substantial amounts of fuel \nto kill thousands of innocent Americans--everyone understands that from \nthat moment forward, when the airlines were shut down--all of them were \ngrounded, and then, following that grounding, the airlines began to \nramp back up and provide some additional passenger service once again--\nthat the American people are concerned, and have been concerned about \nsafety.\n  So the Congress began working on this question of, How do we prevent \nthis from ever happening again? How do we promote and develop the \nsafety and security that the American public wants with respect to air \ntravel? How do we give the American people the confidence that getting \non an airplane and using that commercial airliner for travel around the \ncountry is safe and secure for them?\n  We do that in the following ways: The Congress writes a piece of \nlegislation, as we have done in the Senate in\n\n[[Page S10133]]\n\nthe Commerce Committee--and that piece of legislation deals with the \nrange of security issues that the American people are concerned about--\nand then you bring it to the floor of the Senate, you debate it, and \nhave a vote on it. Regrettably, today we are not able to do that \nbecause we have people objecting to its consideration.\n  But let me go through the elements of this legislation and explain \nhow important it is. First of all, from the broader standpoint, it is \ncritically important that a country such as ours, with an economy such \nas ours, have a system of commercial air travel that is vibrant and \navailable to the American people, to move people and commerce around \nthis country. A strong economy cannot exist in this country without a \nnetwork of commercial air services that are available around the \ncountry. So we have to take steps very quickly to repair this and deal \nwith the damage caused by the September 11 tragedies.\n  Going into September 11, we had a very soft economy in this country. \nThe leading economic indicators in America--our airlines, for example: \nWhen things begin to go soft, the first thing people cut back--both \nfamilies and businesses--would be air travel. You do not take the trip \nyou were going to take because the economy is softer. You do not know \nwhat the future is going to hold. Airlines are the first to be hurt in \na soft economy. So going into September 11, we had all of our major \ncarriers in this country hemorrhaging in red ink, showing very \nsubstantial losses.\n  September 11 was a tragedy unlike any this country has ever seen. \nThat tragedy occurred with the hijacking of commercial airliners. And, \nof course, all airlines were grounded in America immediately on that \nday. Each day thereafter, when those airlines were grounded, of course, \nthe airlines continued to lose a massive quantity of money. No one, at \nall, criticized the grounding. That had to be done. But that industry \nsuffered massive losses at a time when post-September 11 no airplanes \nwere flying anywhere.\n  When the airlines began flying again, with the permission of the FAA \nand the Department of Transportation, it appeared very quickly that \npeople were not quickly coming back, or easily coming back, to use \ncommercial air services. They were concerned. They were nervous. They \nwondered whether it was safe and secure.\n  This Congress then believed it had a responsibility--and it does--to \ndo the things necessary to say to the American people, we are taking \nsteps to prevent this from happening again. What are those steps?\n  My colleague, Senator Hollings, the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, along with Senator McCain and Senator Kerry, Senator Boxer, \nmyself, and many others, have proposed a piece of legislation that but \nfor the objections would be on the floor of the Senate at this moment \nfor debate, a piece of legislation that takes the steps necessary to \ngive the American people confidence that this system of air travel is \nsafe and secure.\n  Here is what we do: We change the screening at airports, the baggage \nscreening process at airports, change it in a very significant way. \nFederal standards: In the largest airports, Federal workers; in the \nsmaller airports, law enforcement, repaid by the Federal Government; \nbut Federal standards with respect to all baggage screening; law \nenforcement capabilities with Federal standards with respect to \nguarding the perimeter of airports; sky marshals that will be used \nextensively on airplane flights all across this country; the hardening \nof cockpits so potential skyjackers cannot get through the cockpit \ndoors.\n\n  All of these issues--screening, sky marshals, perimeter security, \nbaggage screening security--all of these, and more, including an \nAssistant Secretary of Transportation, whose sole responsibility will \nbe to make sure that we take the measures necessary to assure safety on \nAmerica's commercial airline services, all of these are designed to say \nto the American people: You can have confidence in America's air \nservice. What happened on September 11 is not going to happen again. \nThese security measures are designed to prevent hijackings because they \nare designed to prevent hijackers from ever boarding an airplane again \nin this country.\n  Those things are necessary to give the American people confidence \nabout the safety and security of air travel. And it is necessary to do \nthem not later, not 2 weeks from now, or a month from now, or next \nyear--it is necessary to take this action now.\n  This Senate ought to take action now on this issue of airport \nsecurity. We ought not have to file cloture on a bill like this, not a \nbill that is so important to this country. A piece of legislation this \nimportant ought not have to have a cloture motion filed on it. This \nought to be where the good will of both sides comes together to say: \nLet's do this. We know it needs to be done. We know it is important for \nAmerica. Let's do it.\n  It doesn't mean there aren't better ideas that can come to bear on \nthis legislation. But we ought to have it on the floor and debate it, \nhave people offer amendments, if they choose--if they can improve it \nwith amendments, good for them--but it is very disappointing to me that \ncloture had to be filed on something this important and this timely.\n  Let me say, on a couple of the issues people are concerned about--I \nunderstand some, perhaps, would object because they object to linking \nsome sort of extended unemployment compensation to this legislation or \nthey object to doing unemployment compensation or extended benefits for \nunemployed people, especially those who have been laid off by the \nairlines, and other related industries--they object to doing that at \nsome time certain.\n  Well, look, I supported the piece of legislation about 2 weeks ago \nthat addressed the critical financial needs of the airlines themselves. \nBut we cannot ignore those who have been laid off. It is only \nreasonable, in my judgment, that if we are going to help the companies, \nthat we also ought to be responsible enough to help the people. The \npeople make up those companies.\n  When 120,000 of those people find their jobs are lost, we ought to be \nwilling to say: We are willing to help you as well. Unemployment \ncompensation and extended benefits is not radical, it is the right \nthing for this Congress to do.\n  With respect to the other issue--that is Amtrak--I would say to those \nwho support Amtrak, you do not support it more than I do. I really \nbelieve Amtrak is important to this country. Passenger rail service is \nsomething this country needs, and it has been ignored far too long.\n  I do not agree with those in the Senate who say: It is awful that we \nhave subsidized passenger rail service. Of course we have subsidized \nit, but we have subsidized every other form of commercial \ntransportation service in this country as well. In fact, we have \nsubsidized them more than we have subsidized Amtrak.\n\n  I happen to think this country ought to be proud of commercial rail \npassenger service. We ought to invest in it. We ought to provide a \nsecurity bill for it because there are real security issues, as \nevidenced by the comments just addressed to the Senate by my colleague \nfrom Delaware--real security issues. But even more than that, more than \nthe security issues--or at least as important as the security issues--\nwe need to make the investment in Amtrak so that all across this \ncountry, and especially in the Eastern corridor, we have first-class \nrail service up and down that corridor that will allow us to take a \nsubstantial quantity--up to 30 or 40 percent--of those commuter flights \noff the Eastern corridor out of the air, and move those people by rail. \nIt makes much more sense to do that. Yet we have people in this Chamber \nwho somehow do not want to continue rail passenger service in our \ncountry.\n  Rail passenger service is important. I do not believe, however, those \nwho support it, which includes myself--I do not believe we ought to \nhold up the airport security bill because of our concern about Amtrak. \nI say, do this bill--do it now--and next week let's come back and do \nthat Amtrak security bill. I believe we can do that.\n  I believe there will be 60 votes in support of the motion to proceed. \nIf we have to break a filibuster, I believe we will have 60 votes to do \nthat with respect to Amtrak. And, as I said, I do not take a back seat \nto anyone in my support of rail passenger service in this country. I \nthink it is important, critically important, and we ought to manifest \nthat importance in what we do in the Senate. We ought not be afraid of \na\n\n[[Page S10134]]\n\nvote. Let's fight that issue, but let's not do it by holding up an \nairport security bill. That is not the right thing to do and it is not \nthe fair thing for the American people.\n\n  There is one other thing we have to do. We ought to do airport \nsecurity now. Yes, let's provide extended unemployment compensation for \nthose people who have lost their jobs as a result of direct Federal \nintervention in their industry. That list is an extended list. But \nthere is nothing wrong with this country saying: During tough times, we \nare here to help.\n  Incidentally, when we have an economy that has been as soft as ours \nhas been and has taken the kind of hit our economy took, we better be \nprepared to take some bold action to help companies and people, to help \nthem up and say: We want to give you some lift.\n  With respect to that last point, we also not only need to do the \nissue of airport security, extended unemployment, and Amtrak, we also \nneed to do an economic stimulus package. I want to talk about that for \na moment.\n  If we are going to make a mistake in this country with respect to \nthis economy, I want us to make a mistake of doing something rather \nthan doing nothing. I don't want us to sit around with our hands in our \nsuspenders and talk about what would have or should have been. I want \nus to take aggressive action to say: We understand this economy is in \nperil. We have watched the Asian economies. We have seen the Japanese \neconomy stall for 10 years.\n  This country had a vibrant, growing economy. And going into September \n11, it had fallen off a shelf of some type early, about a year ago, \nmaybe 9 months ago. We were in very serious difficulty.\n  The Federal Reserve Board was cutting interest rates furiously to try \nto recover and provide lift to this economy. That has not provided the \nlift--at least not the lift they certainly would have wanted. The \nSeptember 11 event cuts a huge hole in this economy. What to do next?\n  First of all, let's all admit we don't understand this economy. It is \na new, different, and global economy. It is a fact that we have \neconomic stabilizers that we have not previously had. In the last 20 \nand 30 years we have put in economic stabilizers that provide more \nstability with respect to movements up and down.\n  It is also true that the stabilizers have not and could not repeal \nthe business cycle, the cycle of inevitable contraction and expansion \nin the economy. We were on the contraction side of that cycle going \ninto September 11. And then we saw a huge hole torn into this country's \neconomy by the tragic events committed by terrorists.\n  What to do now? First, let's try to understand what the consequences \nof this might be. Almost all of us understand the consequences are dire \nfor our economy. We must restore confidence in the American people \nabout their economic future.\n  How do we do that? The only remedy that we understand and know is a \nremedy in which we try to stimulate the economy with fiscal policy to \ncomplement what the Fed is doing in monetary policy.\n  Senator Daschle and I, in my role as chairman of Democratic Policy \nCommittee, wrote to 11 of the leading economic thinkers in America--\nsome in the private sector, some in the public sector--Nobel laureates, \namong others. We asked them the following questions last Wednesday: Do \nyou believe there should be an economic stimulus package? If not, why \nnot? And if you do, what should that stimulus package be?\n  These leading economists were good enough to turn around a paper, in \nmost cases two pages of their analysis, within a matter of 4 or 5 days. \nI have compiled and given to every Member of the Senate a special \nreport from the Democratic Policy Committee regarding eleven leading \neconomic thinkers on whether Congress should pass a stimulus package. I \nhope all of my colleagues will read this.\n\n  Every single one, with one exception, of the leading economists in \nthis country have written an analysis for us telling us they believe we \nmust pass some kind of economic stimulus package. Most of them say it \nought to be temporary. Most of them say we should be somewhat cautious \nthat we not do the wrong thing here. But they have recommendations on \nhow they believe we should enact a stimulus package that tries to \nprovide lift and opportunity to the American economy.\n  The easiest thing in the world for the Congress to do at this point \nwould be just to sit around and ruminate, which we do really well, and \nmuse and debate and talk and end up not doing anything. Why? Because we \nhave all kinds of fiscal issues. We have an economy that has slowed \ndown. We don't have the revenue coming in. We have huge bills piling \nup.\n  What is the solution to that? Just swallow your tobacco and sit \naround and do nothing? It was Will Rogers who once said this about \ntobacco: When there is no place left to spit, you either have to \nswallow your tobacco juice or change with the times. Well, we don't \nhave anyplace left at this moment. We have to decide that we are going \nto take action and we are going to have to change with the times.\n  The times changed for this country on September 11. This country took \na huge hit to its economy. In addition to that, of course, the tragedy \nis immeasurable in terms of the cost of human life. But as we now try \nto pick up the pieces, one of the wonderful things about the American \nspirit is, we are doers. We are a country of action.\n  If you look at a couple hundred years of economic history in \nAmerica--I have studied some, and I have taught some economics--you see \na country that is intent on creating an economy that is in its own \nimage, in its own desire, by taking action rather than waiting for \nthings to happen. It is not a market system that needs no nurturing. It \nis a market system that from time to time needs some help to move \nalong.\n  If ever this economy needs some help from this Congress and from the \nFederal Reserve Board, it is now. Let us not make the mistake of \nomission. Let us not make the mistake of doing nothing. If we do the \nwrong thing, if we make a mistake, let's make that mistake by having \ntaken action. I would much sooner do that than to decide to sit around \nat this time and in this place and not be bold.\n  I am hoping my colleagues will take a look at this special report \nthat has some of the best analysis in it that we can find. It is very \nunusual to be able to write Nobel laureates and top economists in this \ncountry, from Goldman Sachs and Brookings and Princeton, Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology and Yale, people who we know and have studied \nfor years, the great thinkers in this country about our economy. It is \nan opportunity that is extraordinary to be able to come here and to \noffer this analysis to the Senators who are interested in fiscal \npolicy.\n  That is where we are. We find ourselves at the moment unable to move \non airport security. That is a profound disappointment. Apparently, we \nhave filed a cloture petition. I hope we will rethink that today.\n  We must, in addition to getting airport security as quick as we can, \nthen also do something with respect to extended unemployment benefits. \nI believe next week we also ought to go to the Amtrak issue. I am fully \nsupportive of that. We ought to decide very quickly to join with the \nPresident and Members of Congress and enact a stimulus package that \nwill provide lift and some assistance to the American economy.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I second the remarks of the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota. I thank him for his insight into the economy \nand for his desire to get this legislative body moving.\n  I will quote from a distinguished author, Charles Dickens, who said:\n\n       It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. It was \n     the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness. It was the \n     epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity. It was the \n     season of light, it was the season of darkness. It was the \n     spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.\n\n  That introduction to ``A Tale of Two Cities'' written by Dickens is \napropos of the time we have at hand. Dickens' words speak to us today \nas we try to\n\n[[Page S10135]]\n\nmake sense of the events of September 11 because, though the darkness \nand despair were all too readily apparent, I believe we can actually \nsee wisdom and light and hope as this great Nation moves forward in \nunity and resolve.\n  It is a sad but nonetheless true fact that our country is no more \nvulnerable to terrorist assault now than it was on September 10. It \njust feels that way. With the heightened attention to this threat, I \nwould contend that the vulnerability is less now than it was actually \nbefore, but that is certainly no guarantee against future attacks.\n  While the September 11 acts of terror demonstrate all too vividly the \ndepth of inhumanity that some human beings are capable of, the response \nin the United States and around the world has conclusively proved that \nfor most people, it is, in Lincoln's words, ``the better angels of our \nnature'' which ultimately prevail.\n  When in our lifetimes have we seen the selfless men and women who \nserve as police and firefighters extolled above athletes and rock \nstars? When have we seen cynicism and apathy largely vanish from our \npublic airwaves? When have we seen such sustained bipartisanship at \nhome and unity of purpose in the international community? Not in my \nlifetime, Mr. President.\n  The current challenge facing our country and the entire civilized \nworld is indeed a crisis, but I contend that it is a crisis in the way \nthe Chinese understand the word--one word, one phrase, one character, \nmeaning danger; but the other character meaning opportunity. The \nChinese write the word ``crisis'' in two characters, Mr. President, not \none: danger and opportunity. We have before us both.\n  For some time, I have been planning to come to the Senate floor to \nmark the first anniversary of the completion of an effort I undertook \nlast year with my distinguished friend and colleague, the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas, Pat Roberts. Over the course of last year--\ncompleted on October 3--Senator Roberts and I conducted a series of \nbipartisan dialogs on the global role of the United States in the post-\ncold-war era. That sounds somewhat esoteric in light of the attacks on \nour country on September 11, but our purpose then was to draw attention \nto this important topic and to help begin the process of building a \nbipartisan consensus on national security, which both of us felt was \nneeded and indispensable to protecting our national interests.\n  Over the course of our discussions last year, we came to mutual \nagreement on a set of general principles which we felt should undergird \nAmerica's security policy in the 21st century. These included that we, \nas a nation, need to engage in a national dialog to define our national \ninterests, differentiate the level of interest involved, and spell out \nwhat we should be prepared to do in defense of those interests and \nbuild a bipartisan consensus in support of the resulting interests and \npolicies.\n  The President and the Congress need to, among other things, find more \nand better ways to increase communications with the American people on \nthe realities of our international interests and the costs of securing \nthem. We need to find more and better ways to increase the exchange of \nexperiences and ideas between the Government and the military to avoid \nthe broadening lack of military experience among the political elite \nand find more and better ways of ensuring that both the executive and \nlegislative branches fulfill their constitutional responsibilities in \nnational security policy, especially concerning military operations \nother than declared wars.\n  We are in such a situation now. We have a war on terrorism. It is \nactually undeclared legally, but it has been declared publicly. The \nPresident and the Congress need to urgently address the mismatch \nbetween our foreign policy ends and means, and between commitments and \nour forces, by determining the most appropriate instrument--diplomatic, \nmilitary, et cetera--for securing policy objectives; reviewing \ncarefully current American commitments--especially those involving \ntroop deployment to ensure clarity of objectives, and the presence of \nan exit strategy. That is something we ought to keep in mind in this \nwar, too. Increasing the relatively small amount of resources devoted \nto the key instruments for securing national interests, including our \nArmed Forces, which need to be reformed to meet the requirements of the \n21st century, diplomatic forces, foreign assistance, United Nations \npeacekeeping operations, which also need to be reformed to become much \nmore effective, and key regional organizations.\n\n  We are the only global superpower, and in order to avoid stimulating \nthe creation of a hostile coalition of other nations against us, the \nUnited States should and can afford to forego unilateralist actions, \nexcept where our vital interests are involved. One of the things I am \nencouraged about now, is our unilateralist tendencies have been swept \nup in an agreement among civilized nations to support us in our war on \nterrorism. That is a very comforting thought.\n  One of the things that helps us along these lines is that the United \nStates should pay its international debts, and we agreed to do so. We \nalso must continue to respect and honor our international commitments \nand not abdicate our global leadership role. Finally, the United States \nmust avoid unilateral economic and trade sanctions. I think in the wake \nof the attack on our country, we have lifted some of these sanctions, \nespecially against India and Pakistan.\n  With respect to multilateral organizations, the United States should \nmore carefully consider NATO's new Strategic Concept and the future \ndirection of this, our most important international commitment. We need \nto press for reform of the peacekeeping operations and decisionmaking \nprocesses of the U.N. and Security Council. We need to fully strengthen \nthe capabilities of regional organizations, such as the European Union, \nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the OAS, the \nOrganization for African Unity, and the Organization of Southeast Asian \nNations, and so on, to deal with threats to regional security. We need \nto promote a thorough debate at the U.N. and elsewhere on proposed \nstandards for interventions within sovereign states.\n  In the post-cold-war world, the United States should adopt a policy \nof realistic restraint with respect to the use of U.S. military forces \nin situations other than those involving the defense of vital national \ninterests.\n  We crossed that threshold on September 11. Responding to the \nterrorist attack is in our vital national interests, and we ought to \nuse military force to do that. As a matter of fact, this Congress \nauthorized the President to use all necessary force to go after those \nwho came after us on September 11.\n  In all other situations, we must insist on well-defined political \nobjectives. As a matter of fact, it is not a bad idea in this \nparticular war either. We must determine whether nonmilitary means will \nbe effective and, if so, try them prior to any recourse to military \nforce. I think we are doing that in so many ways in tightening the \nnoose around the terrorists' necks. We should ascertain whether \nmilitary means can achieve the political objectives. Sometimes military \nmeans cannot attain a political objective. We ought to be aware of \nthat. We need to determine whether the benefits outweigh the costs--in \nother words, whether the cost of military engagement is worth the cost. \nWe need to determine the ``last step'' we are prepared to take before \nwe get involved militarily. That was the advice of Clausewitz, the \ngreat German theoretician, on war two centuries ago. We must insist \nthat we have a clear, concise exit strategy when we involve ourselves \nin military affairs around the world, and we must insist on \ncongressional approval of all deployments other than those involving \nresponses to emergency situations.\n  The United States can and must continue to exercise international \nleadership, while following a policy of realistic restraint in the use \nof military force. We must pursue policies that promote a strong and \ngrowing economy, which is actually, as we now see, the essential \nunderpinning of any nation's strength.\n  We must maintain superior, ready, and mobile Armed Forces capable of \nrapidly responding to threats to our national interest. My goodness, do \nwe ever see the need for that since September 11. We must strengthen \nthe nonmilitary tools as well. We must\n\n[[Page S10136]]\n\nmake a long-term commitment to promoting democracy abroad via a \ncomprehensive, sustained program which makes a realistic assessment of \nthe capabilities of such a program.\n  Obviously, much has changed since Senator Roberts and I submitted our \nlist last year, but I think the fundamentals remain the same. If \nanything, the events of September 11 have underscored several of the \npoints we were trying to make.\n  First, foreign policy matters. American leadership and engagement in \nthe world make a real difference to our security here at home.\n  I remember having lunch with Tom Friedman, the great author of ``The \nLexus and The Olive Tree,'' a best selling book. He said, ``Without \nAmerica on duty, there would be no America on line.''\n  We forget that our first line of defense in so many ways is America \non duty. So foreign policy matters.\n  Secretary of State Powell has done an awesome job, along with the \nPresident, and Secretary Rumsfeld, in arraying the international \ncommunity against terrorism, including the key countries bordering \nAfghanistan, in the effort to bring the terrorists and collaborators to \njustice. It is very clear now, if it was doubted before, that these \nefforts could not succeed without this multinational cooperation.\n  One of the things that has also been reinforced is that when we move \nto protect our national interests, we need to make use of the whole \nrange of instruments available to us. The instruments we have available \nare not only and not necessarily primarily our military forces, but our \ndiplomatic, economic, intelligence, and law enforcement assets as well, \nall of which are engaged today, even as I speak, in the fight against \nthe forces of terrorism.\n  Third, Senator Roberts and I were anxious to have our country take a \ngood hard look at its multitudinous overseas military engagements and \ncommitments, with an eye toward focusing on the vital and essential \ndeployments while deemphasizing other engagements which can divert both \nresources and attention from our most crucial national interests, of \nwhich homeland defense must be at the top of the list.\n  In so many ways, as someone who has traveled to the Balkans, Kosovo, \nand South Korea, it is a strange feeling to know that our country in \nour defensive effort guards Kosovo and protects South Korea almost \nbetter than it does New York City and Washington.\n  In short, I believe we can and must be prepared to commit all \navailable American resources, including military forces, in defense of \ntruly vital national interests, the most important of which is our \nhomeland defense. In other cases, I believe we must impose a much \nhigher bar before we put American service men and women in harm's way.\n\n  Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Henry Shelton put it \nvery well in an address to the Kennedy School at Harvard University. He \nsaid:\n\n       The military is the hammer in America's foreign policy \n     toolbox . . . and it is a very powerful hammer. But not every \n     problem we face is a nail. We may find that sorting out the \n     good guys from the bad guys is not as easy as it seems. We \n     also may find that getting in is much easier than getting \n     out.\n\n  It reminds me of a good line by Napoleon that wars are easy to get \ninto but hard to get out of.\n\n  General Shelton went on to conclude:\n\n       These are the issues we need to confront when we make the \n     decision to commit our military forces--\n\n  Even as we commit them today.\n\n       And that is as it should be because, when we use our \n     military forces, we lay our prestige, our word, our \n     leadership, and--most importantly--the lives of our young \n     Americans on the line.\n\n  Let me be very clear that the events of September 11 did, indeed, \ntouch upon our vital interests, and we can and will use our military \n``hammer'' to capture or kill those responsible. This body voted \nunanimously to confer that authority on President Bush and to stand \nfirmly behind our service men and women who, as the President said so \nwell, are ready to ``make us proud'' once again. Certainly this Senator \ndoes. I stand behind our forces, our troops, and our President in this \nresolve to accomplish this goal.\n  Finally, as I said before, Senator Roberts and I began our process \nover a year ago, convinced of the need to bring greater attention to \nnational security and foreign policy, as well as to forge a durable \nbipartisan consensus on the major elements of such a policy. Frankly, \nwe saw little evidence that either greater attention or more \nbipartisanship was likely anytime soon. This is where the opportunity I \nspoke of earlier comes in. At least for now, we have an attentive \nCongress and public and a bipartisan foreign policy. We have come a \nlong way. The challenge is to sustain that in the months and years \nahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we are trying to move to the bill that \nwill upgrade aviation security in our country. I hope we can work out \nan agreement that will allow us to start debating the aviation security \nbill.\n  What we are all trying to do is get a bill that is just on aviation \nsecurity. There are a lot of other issues people want to bring up that \nare quite legitimate issues, but I do not think we should put them on a \nbill dealing with aviation security because this issue is the one we \nneed to address right now. It is a separate issue, and it should be \nkept separate.\n  If we can assure the flying public that everything that can be done \nis being done to upgrade aviation security, that will mitigate the \ndamage we are seeing to our economy as a result of a smaller number of \nflights and smaller number of people traveling. We want to bring back \nthe aviation industry. We want people to go on vacations, to travel for \nbusiness, just as they did before September 11. We want people to stay \nin the hotels and rent the cars so the economy does not experience a \ndomino effect from airlines not flying and people being afraid to get \non with their daily lives.\n  We understand why people are concerned. I have been flying every \nweekend since September 11. I know their concerns. We need to address \nthe security issue so people will know they can fly and this, in \neffect, will begin to rebuild our economy.\n  What we are trying to put forward in a bipartisan bill is sky \nmarshals so that we can begin the recruitment and training to beef up \nthe Sky Marshal Program.\n  We want to make our cockpits more secure. We want to make sure our \npilots are protected and they are able to give their full attention to \nflying the airplane.\n  We are trying to upgrade the screening of carry-on baggage.\n  We have only had 3 weeks to determine the changes that need to be \nmade. I know the administration and Members of Congress are looking at \nall options for closing the loopholes in aviation security, but we can \ntake some major steps forward, even as we are studying other ways in \nwhich we can do better, by upgrading the training and the education \nrequirements for the screeners, to make sure they have enough training \nto recognize an illegal item.\n  We want to make sure there is armed supervision of those screeners, \nFederal marshals. Right now we have Guardsmen from the States and we \nhave detailees from other agencies that are overseeing screeners in \nmany airports. We want to make that more permanent so that people will \nknow it is not business as usual at the airports and that is why it is \nsafer to fly.\n  I hope we will be able to move to this bill today. It is important \nthat we finish the bill this week. We will have differences on some of \nthe details of the bill. We can have amendments and up-or-down votes. \nIf you win, you win; if you lose, you lose.\n  The basic agreement we have on the key components of the bill is \nsolid and bipartisan, and the components are also, I believe, agreed to \nby the administration. There are a couple of sticking points. We need \nto work those out, but we do not need to hold the bill up to work out \nthe differences. We need to go to the bill.\n  If we can get an aviation security bill passed in the Senate, send it \nto the\n\n[[Page S10137]]\n\nHouse, and send it to the President, the American people will begin to \nsee that there is a heightened awareness of the need for security, and \nthey will see the beginning of the implementation of the plans to do \nmore at our airports.\n  I want to thank all of those who are working on it, Senator McCain \nand I on our side, Senator Hollings and Senator Rockefeller on the \nDemocratic side. We are working very well together. We had a meeting \nwith the Secretary of Transportation, talking about the areas where we \nagree, which is 90 percent of the bill we would have before us.\n  I think we need to go to the bill. Let Congress work its will. Other \nMembers have some very good ideas. We need to start talking about them. \nI do not think we should waste this valuable time.\n  The President has said, and Congress has agreed, there are certain \nthings we must do quickly. We certainly took quick action for trying to \nshore up and stabilize the airlines. We have done that. We now need to \ngive our law enforcement agencies the ability to gather intelligence.\n  Our FBI is doing an incredible job of finding all of the tentacles of \nthese terrorist cells, but we need to give them the tools they need to \ncontinue that investigation and to find out where these people are in \nour country or in other countries that would affect our own security.\n  We need to act quickly on that antiterrorism bill. We need to act \nquickly on the aviation security bill. These are the priorities the \nPresident has set, and we need to go forward and address those. We are \nwasting time by not going to this bill, and I urge my colleagues to \nwork out the differences. Do not require us to have extraneous \namendments. Let us get on the bill. Let us have amendments that are \ngermane to the bill and go forward in the way we have always done, \nhaving our votes, getting the final passage. Let us do the important \nbusiness that will increase our capability to keep our country going, \nto keep our economy strong, to keep our people safe. That is our \nresponsibility, and that is what we should be doing right now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to talk about something that is \nvery familiar to the Presiding Officer: the meetings that the Senator \nand I have had with airline employees back home. The most recent \nmeeting was a rally at the Capital. We have made the commitment to \nthese workers that we want to help the industry. We want the industry \nto get back on its feet. That is critically important and what \neverybody wants.\n  We also believe the help has to be there for the employees. By the \nway, Mr. Richard Anderson, the CEO of Northwest Airlines, dropped by \nthe other day and left me a letter of support. He has come out as CEO \nof Northwest firmly, squarely, behind getting assistance to the \nemployees.\n  Maybe this has been said on the floor. I have been at briefings \ntoday, one of which was superb, with Secretary of State Powell, about \nwhom I cannot say enough good things in terms of his wisdom and his \nhopes for how we proceed now in the aftermath of September 11. I cannot \nbelieve some of my colleagues are opposing moving to the floor with \nthis airline safety bill in part because they are not committed to this \npackage of benefits for employees. They don't want to see it happen. I \nwill get people angry at me, and later we will have debate. I will be \npleased to debate people later. To me, it is heartless. When people are \nflat on their backs, you help them. That is part of what government is \nfor.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, Senator Dayton, I felt on Sunday, \nbeyond speaking at a rally, you sometimes get the sense that people are \nreaching out to you. It is not so much to shake your hand, it is not to \nbeg you, but to reach out for help. The handshake was more, in our \nState, a reaching out for help. It is frightening to be out of work and \nto not know how you will support your family.\n  We have this package to extend the unemployment benefits up to a \nyear, and actually improve the U.I. with more benefits, and calling on \nStates to increase what they will pay out, with the Federal Government \nproviding the money. And in this nightmare situation, which we don't \nhave to deal with, Senators, but if we did, if we were out of work, we \nwould sure want the help.\n  When you lose your job and then in a couple of months you lose your \nhealth care benefits, you cannot afford what is called the COBRA \nprogram. The idea was to help families provide for health care, to be \nable to afford the coverage and not be without any coverage.\n  For God's sake, how much longer do Senators think we should wait?\n  I am not going to go after the industry, I don't think they were \ncrying uncle. Frankly, as someone who has been a severe critic of \nNorthwest Airlines--I never been able to get along with them--I give \nMr. Anderson credit. I have had some of the employees say: He might \ncare about us. I give him a lot of credit. Several flight attendants on \na flight said that to me.\n  The truth of the matter is, they were ready, they had their array of \nlobbyists, et al, up here. We put the package through, and we were \ntold: If you don't indemnify us--several carriers said--we will shut \ndown Monday, a week ago. We didn't want that to happen.\n  But now we have employees out of work, what is it, 4,500 in our \nState, or thereabouts. We have Senators who do not want this bill \ncoming to the floor. First, we have to take the steps on airline \nsafety--no question about it--now. But it is absolutely appropriate to \nalso, in the same legislation, talk about Amtrak. It is part of the \ntransportation system. It is related.\n\n  But the other part of it is the employees. I say to the Presiding \nOfficer, I don't know if I will feel empty, depressed, or just furious \nand angry, to go back home this weekend and see some of those same \nemployees who are going to be saying: Why? Why? Why the delay? Why \ncan't you help us?\n  That is what I say to some of my colleagues. What is going on here? \nIn all due respect, this should be a no-brainer. We should have the \nairline safety bill out. We have amendments; people can vote for or \nagainst the amendments. But it is not business as usual. This is not a \nbusiness-as-usual time. This is not a typical time in our country.\n  I say to Senators, I know if you are thinking: In all due respect, \nPaul, don't be gratuitous; it is not like anyone needs to tell us that, \ngiven what happened to our country on September 11 and the murder of so \nmany people.\n  I get the impression that maybe on the economic hard times and what \nhas happened to people in their own lives here on the economic security \npart, there are a number of Senators who I don't think get it. They \ndon't get it.\n  I have not had a chance to talk to the majority leader. I assume we \nwill file cloture, have a vote, and force this issue. If people don't \nwant to vote for assistance for the aviation employees, let them vote \nno. I think it would be pretty hard to sleep if you were to cast such a \nvote.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, I remember 4 or 5 days after \nSeptember 11, I was coming back here and talking to some of the \nemployees and saying, hello, how are you, to a woman while checking in; \nthe woman said: All right; I'm hanging in there.\n  I realized what she was talking about was not September 11. She was \ntalking about herself because she knew they would be out of work. My \nfirst reaction was: Why wouldn't you be focused on September 11 and the \nslaughter of people in the country? Then I said to Sheila: Wait a \nminute; she was not wrong to react that way. She had to be concerned \nabout what would happen to her and her family. She knew she would be \nout of work.\n  These workers are asking us for help. I would like to smoke out \nSenators, have Senators over the next 2 days come out here and debate \nand tell us why they don't want to support an amendment, if that is the \ncase.\n  I have to make this distinction. I can some see Senators saying: \nWell, of all people, Paul, over the years, it is not like you haven't \ncome out here and slowed things up and used your leverage.\n  I understand that. Frankly, I don't know what the cause is here. \nMaybe I\n\n[[Page S10138]]\n\nam just being self-righteous. I don't, frankly, know what the cause is. \nIf the cause is, as I suspect, there are some Senators who don't want \nto see this package go through, then I say, just come on out here and \n``have at it,'' make your arguments, and let's vote.\n  We have a lot going on in terms of unity and Members of both parties \nfeeling so strongly about what happened. All of us, I think, have a lot \nof concerns. It is hard not to every day worry about, What next not to \nworry about? What kind of action are we going to take? What kind of \nmilitary action? What will be the reaction? Will we be successful? Will \nwe be able to hold the people who committed this act of murder \naccountable? Can we minimize the loss of life of helpless civilians? I \npray so. What will happen in Pakistan? What about other Middle East \ncountries? What about our own country? Will there be other attacks? \nWill our people be protected? What is happening to the economy?\n  The truth is, we should, by tonight, be near getting this bill done, \nand then we have to put together another economic stimulus package. I \ndo not know, but I think maybe our party, I say to the Presiding \nOfficer, is a little bit too timid. I think we have to put together a \nsignificant stimulus package. I think part of it can be tax rebates, \nespecially for the people who pay the Social Security tax who did not \nget any help. Let's put some money in the hands of people who are going \nto go out and spend it--do it. We should be extending the unemployment \ninsurance, the health care benefits as well, and definitely help small \nbusiness. There is no doubt in my mind that a lot of small businesses \nare really taking it on the chin.\n  There are child care expenses. There is affordable housing. There are \nsome things we can do that are like a marriage. Let's put some money in \naffordable housing. I have my own ideas. I will not go through \nspecifics today. I think I will tomorrow. Rebuilding crumbling \nschools--all of it has immense potential. And, frankly, we have to get \nonto that as well.\n  There is a whole lot we need to do, and the sooner the better. I \nguess I think the unity can apply to a lot of the challenges ahead. But \nI just find this refusing to proceed--maybe I am just coming on one of \nthese weeks where Monday we were supposed to deal with the mental \nhealth bill, not an unimportant piece of legislation. I am not going to \ntry to mix agendas. I will just say again the mental health equitable \ntreatment legislation is bipartisan. I have been fortunate enough to be \njoined on this effort with Senator Domenici. There are 65 supporting \nSenators. We could have done it in several hours with debate on \namendments. It was blocked.\n  By the way, there are going to be huge mental health issues, lots of \nstruggles for families. Nobody should doubt that.\n  I have done a lot of work with Vietnam vets with PTSD. I have seen \nit. There is going to be so much of that. And the fact is, once you say \nyou have to provide the same coverage for people dealing with this \nillness as with that, then you have the care following the money. Then \nyou get some good care out of this. That was blocked.\n  I have been trying to get to some legislation that passed the House \nunanimously. It seems small. But there is not anything I care more \nabout. It is for families dealing with a disease called Duchenne's \ndisease. Senator Cochran has been helping on it. It is muscular \ndystrophy for children, little boys, a problem with a recessive gene. \nIt is Lou Gehrig's disease, and for these little children there is no \nhope; there is no future. It is a very cruel disease, if you know Lou \nGehrig's disease. It takes everything away from these children and then \nthey die.\n  These families, they are so young when you meet them and the children \nare so young and they are just trying to get some focus in the Centers \nfor Disease Control, NIH, some centers for excellence. We have \nbipartisan support. My understanding is, again, some Senators do not \nwant to let that go through on unanimous consent.\n  There are things we can do that are good things for people that \nshould not be that controversial, that we should be able to do. Maybe \npart of what I am doing today is just expressing my overall \nfrustration. But I will say again, there is no more important piece of \nlegislation than this aviation safety bill.\n  I think the Presiding Officer, his suggestions about having the Guard \ninvolved and giving some people reassurance--the President is taking \nthat up. I am proud of the Senator from Minnesota. Thank you for \ngetting that idea out there. I think it will be adopted. It is part of \nwhat we will do in this transition period.\n  And then there are a lot of other proposals that make a whole lot of \nsense: federalizing the workforce, having highly trained people. I was \ntalking with Senator Hollings and he said a lot of people who now do \nthe security work, they should really have first priority to get the \njob training. It is not as if we just bash people and say: You are \ngone. Some are very qualified--with the training. Others may not be \nable to do the work.\n  There are other features as well. But the other part of it is I never \ndreamed we would have such a hard time getting help to the workers, to \nthe employees. Maybe there is something wrong with the way my mind \nworks. I am sure there are other colleagues who think so. But to me it \nis like 2 plus 2 equals 4. Yes, you help out the industry. Yes, we had \nto do it under emergency conditions. Yes, the next step is to make sure \nthe employees, all the people who have been part of this industry, get \nhelp. They are out of work. And there is opposition to this. It is \nobvious.\n  I guess we are basically at a point where we are going to file for \ncloture, have a vote on it, and I suppose this will go over to next \nweek. If so, fine. But as far as I am concerned--I have heard the \nPresiding Officer say this--I am getting to the point now where I think \nwe are going to have to be here quite a long time this fall. We have a \nlot of work to do. If it is going to be delayed, things are going to \nhave to extend on.\n  There is an education bill--the same kind of interesting issue where \nfor some reason there is a lot of opposition to providing the resources \nto which I think we made a commitment to schools. I would say to \nSenator Dayton, the Presiding Officer, my guess is--and I think we \nshould do this--this Monday we are going to have the hearing together \nand focus on the terrorist attack, the recession, and their effect on \nthe Minnesota population.\n  I think there will come a time where we probably should just focus on \neducation. Just imagine what is going to happen with the State budgets \nthat are going to contract, whether there will be the resources for the \nschools. Imagine the number of kids who will be eligible soon for the \nfree- and reduced-cost lunch program. Imagine the struggles families \nare going to have.\n  By the way, we could help these families if we could get some of \nthese benefits out there to them.\n  I think that ties in to another issue the Presiding Officer has \nworked on and been very outspoken on, directly correlated to whether or \nnot we are going to keep the IDEA program mandatory funding and fund it \nor get the money for title 1. There are things we can do now, \ncolleagues, that will help people.\n  I will finish this way: The two things that have most inspired me, if \nthat word can be used, given what we have been through as a nation, is, \nA, the wisdom of people in Minnesota and around the country who were \nnot--I said this to Secretary of State Powell, and I think everybody \nwould agree--the people are not impatient. They are not bellicose. They \nare not sayings ``Bombs away.'' People are very well aware of how \ndifficult this will be. They want to have it done in the right way. \nThey want it to be consistent with our values. They do not want to see \nthe kind of military action that will lead to massive loss of innocent \ncivilians.\n  They want to deal with the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. They \ndon't want people to be starving to death, people who have nothing to \ndo with the Taliban and nothing to do with terrorism. And the other \nthing is I think a lot of what I would call ``people values'' have come \nout. I don't know if I can remember another time in my adult life where \nI have seen people so involved in helping other people. Part of it, of \ncourse, is to help all the people who have lost loved ones in New York \nand those lost on the plane that\n\n[[Page S10139]]\n\nwent down in Pennsylvania and the Pentagon and D.C. and Virginia and \nsurrounding areas.\n  But I think it goes beyond that. If there is one good thing you can \npoint to, it is that I think people really are thinking more about ways \nin which they can help other people. Call it a sense of community or \nwhatever you want to call it. I can't for the life of me figure out why \nthat hasn't yet reached the Senate.\n  Where are the people values? How can we continue to delay helping \nthese employees who are out of work in the aviation industry? How can \nwe delay putting together a package? We call it economic stimulus, but \nthe truth of the matter is, the best thing you can do in an economic \nstimulus package is also get help to people flat on their back who can \nuse the money to consume because they have tried to make ends meet.\n  I have amendments. We have all worked together on the Carnahan \npackage. I thank the Senator from Missouri for her fine work. We want \nto see that passed. I think some of us have other amendments. We want \nto get to an economic stimulus package.\n  There is a lot of work to do here: Education, and appropriations \nbills. I hope the whole question of prescription drug costs for elderly \npeople doesn't just get completely put off. Frankly, those problems are \nno less compelling. I don't think I am exaggerating the point if I say \nthat it is not going to be easy on a lot of working families if they \nhave to end up with hard times and continue to have to help their \nparents and grandparents with prescription drug costs. It all gets tied \nin together.\n  It is all about communities. It is all about families. It is all \nabout our being a family. It is all about how to help people. There \nwere a lot of people who campaigned on this issue. Senator Dayton of \nMinnesota probably campaigned as effectively on this issue as anybody \nin the country.\n  It is not as if these issues go away. It is all a part of what we \nneed to do in the country. If I wanted to be kind of ``Mr. Economist,'' \nI would say: My God, elderly people are paying half their monthly \nbudget on prescription drug costs. Help them out so it is affordable, \nso they can have some money to consume with.\n  There are lots of things we can do that sort of represent a good \nmarriage of helping people, which also will enable people to consume, \nand which will also help our economy. We need to do it now. We should \ndo it for humanitarian reasons. We should do it out of a sense that we \nare our brothers' and sisters' keepers. We should do it with a sense of \n``there, but for the grace of God, go I.'' We should do it for economic \nreasons and national security reasons.\n  Here I am at 5 minutes to 5 on the floor of the Senate, and no one is \nhere because moving to the airline safety bill has been blocked. \nOutrageous.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to make some brief remarks about \nour progress, or lack of progress, on airport security, which is a very \nimportant and vital issue.\n  We had a good meeting with the Secretary of Transportation, Norman \nMineta, and I think we are defining some of our differences, as well as \nareas of agreement. I am hopeful that we can negotiate out those \ndifferences. We need to move forward with this legislation. It is now \n5:25 in the afternoon and we have not had a single amendment debated or \nproposed. We have not moved to the bill. We need to move to this \nlegislation.\n  Last week, with a degree of bipartisanship that was very gratifying, \nthis body passed legislation to take care of the financial difficulties \nthat airlines are experiencing and have experienced as a result of the \nterrorist attacks. Now we need to restore the confidence of the \nAmerican people in their ability to fly from one place to another with \na sense of safety and security, which they do not have today.\n  It is inappropriate for us not to act before we go out of session \ntomorrow. Already, there are only a few amendments that would need to \nbe considered. As I mentioned earlier, Senator Hollings, the chairman, \nand I have committed to opposing nonrelevant amendments no matter what \ntheir virtues may be. So I intend, tomorrow, if we are unable, for \nwhatever reason, to come down and ask unanimous consent that this \nlegislation be the pending business. I think it is very important.\n  I see the Senator from Nevada on the floor. I thank him for his \nefforts in trying to see this bill brought up and addressed before we \ngo out of session for the week.\n  I don't think we should allow any peripheral issues to prevent us \nfrom moving forward. I have had good will statements made from strong \nsupporters of Amtrak that they would not have those provisions on this \nbill. For those who are worried about the unemployed and others who \nhave suffered because of the airline shutdown, those people have also \nsaid we can move forward. There is no reason we should not. I hope we \nwill, and I hope we will not have to employ any parliamentary \nprocedures in order to do what we all know is necessary, which is to \nprotect the flying safety of our air transportation system.\n  By the way, the Air Transport Association is strongly in support of \nthis legislation. I have been visited by airline executives who have \nurged that we act as quickly as possible to restore the confidence of \nthe American people. I hope we will listen to them as well and not get \nhung up on some rather unimportant--when you look at the importance of \nthis bill--side issues.\n  So I hope we will act tomorrow, and, if not, I will try to come down \nto the floor and force action in whatever parliamentary fashion I can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment to the \nAviation Security Act that would ensure that results-oriented \nmanagement is a key component of whatever changes are ultimately made \nto our airport security system. We can not afford more business as \nusual. We have to insist that the traveling public is safe from those \nwho would perpetrate evil deeds like those of September 11.\n  First, my amendment requires the Federal Government to set and \nenforce goals for aviation security. It requires the head of aviation \nsecurity, within 60 days of enactment, to establish acceptable levels \nof performance and provide Congress with an action plan to achieve that \nperformance. Over the long-term, the head of aviation security must \nestablish a process for performance planning and reporting that informs \nCongress and the American people about how the government is meeting \nits goals. By creating this process, we will be constantly assessing \nthe threats we face and ensuring that we have the means to measure our \nprogress in preparing for those threats. This is a new, detailed method \nfor ensuring that performance management is in place specifically in \nthe government's aviation security programs.\n  I firmly believe that good people, well managed, can substantially \nimprove our aviation security. So this amendment gives those \nresponsible for aviation security enhanced tools to regain the \nconfidence of America's flying public. We employ a good mix of carrots \nand sticks to drive performance. For instance: Managers and employees \nwould be eligible for bonuses for good performance. The head of \naviation security may have a term of 3 to 5 years, which can be \nextended if he or she meets performance standards set forth in an \nannual performance agreement. This amendment establishes an annual \nstaff performance management system that includes setting individual, \ngroup, and organizational performance goals consistent with an annual \nperformance plan. The amendment allows FAA management to hold \nemployees--whether public, private, or a mix thereof, strictly \naccountable for meeting performance standards. Those who fail to meet \nthe performance measures that have agreed to could be terminated, be \nthey managers, supervisors, or screeners.\n  These provisions are not new. Agencies like IRS, the Patent and \nTrademark Office, and the Office of Student and Financial Assistance, \nalready have many of these flexibilities. This\n\n[[Page S10140]]\n\namendment targets these flexibilities specifically to the area of \naviation security so that we can immediately begin the process of \nensuring the public's safety.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator leaves the floor, we would like to \nreport to him that I finished speaking with Senator Hollings. Senator \nHollings and Senator McCain have worked together in the Commerce \nCommittee for many years now. I think the cooperation the two of them \nhave shown during this difficult time of the past 3 weeks is exemplary. \nI personally appreciate the work the two of them have done, setting \naside partisan differences and moving through difficult issues. I, too, \nhope we can figure out a way to move on to complete the work we have \nbefore us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Nevada in \ncomplimenting my friend from Arizona. It is also very much my hope and \ndesire that we can bring up the airport security bill and complete it \ntomorrow. I heard my colleague from Arizona say that both he and \nSenator Hollings are willing to object to amendments that are not \nrelevant to the underlying package. That is a concern of a lot of \npeople. That will help streamline and finish the bill.\n  I hope and believe we will have the bipartisan leadership in \nagreement with that so that we can keep nongermane amendments off this \npackage and we can pass the airport security bill. Then we can work on \nother issues together as well. I hope that is the case. We have had \ngood progress in working in a bipartisan way on a lot of issues. I \nwould like to see that the case on this package as well. Then we can \ntake up the antiterrorism package next week and finish it as well.\n  I thank my friend.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reid).

PETERSON\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution \n167, submitted earlier today by Senators McCain, Kerry, Gramm, and \nmyself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 167) recognizing Ambassador Douglas \n     ``Pete'' Peterson for his service to the United States as the \n     first American ambassador to Vietnam since the Vietnam War.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, on behalf of the other \nSenators--and I know they are in various negotiations on other \nlegislation; in Senator McCain's case, the Airline Security Act, and in \nthe case of Senator Gramm, he is involved in the Intelligence Committee \nright now--I say on behalf of all of them, and for me, what a great \nprivilege it is to recognize a public servant, Ambassador Pete \nPeterson, who served as a Member of Congress prior to being named by \nPresident Clinton as the first United States Ambassador to Vietnam.\n  We bring forth this resolution commending Ambassador Peterson because \nof his extraordinary leadership in helping bring about the Vietnam \nTrade Act, which this Senate passed earlier today. What is so poignant \nabout this story of Douglas Pete Peterson is the fact that when he \nfirst went to Vietnam during the Vietnam war as an Air Force pilot, he \nwas shot down and captured and held in captivity for over 6 years. He \nwas able to return to that country as Ambassador and has won the hearts \nof the people of Vietnam.\n  I remember reading a story that absolutely gripped me about a few \ndays before Pete Peterson departed as Ambassador to Vietnam, he had a \nreunion with one of his captors. This was a captor who, at a time of \ngreat stress, after Pete had been beat over and over again to the point \nof unconsciousness, and he did not know if he was going to live or die \nat that particular point, in his stupor of coming in and out of \nconsciousness, he motioned to one of his captors that he was thirsty, \nand his captor brought him a cup of tea.\n  A couple of days before Pete was to depart as the first Ambassador \nfrom America to Vietnam, and a very successful Ambassador, he had a \nreunion with that captor, and that Vietnamese gentleman offered him a \ncup of tea again.\n  How times had changed and what a great leader for us to have \nrepresenting America where he held no grudge; he did not want revenge. \nHe offered the best of America showing that we are a forgiving people. \nAfter serving six distinguished years as a Member of Congress from the \nState of Florida, for Pete, a Vietnam POW, to return to that country \nthat had held him captive the longest as one of the POWs, then to come \nback extending the hand of friendship with no malice in his heart, was \nto win the hearts of the Vietnamese people. In the process, he \nnegotiated and tweaked and nurtured the Vietnam trade bill, which we \npassed earlier today.\n\n  It is with a great deal of humility that I speak on behalf of so many \nothers, including Senator McCain. Although he was not in the same POW \ncamp with Ambassador Peterson, he clearly knew of him and thinks the \nhighest of him. My words are inadequate to express the thoughts of all \nthese other Senators.\n  I want to say one thing in closing about Pete Peterson. He is not \nonly a hero to so many in his public and professional life --his \nprofessional life as a military officer, as a Member of Congress, and \nas our first Ambassador to Vietnam--but he is also a role model as a \nhuman being. After he returned from Vietnam, he suffered through the \nyears of a long and torturous process of cancer with his first wife, \nfinally claiming her life, but Pete Peterson was right there with her \nthe whole way. He had the joy in Vietnam of meeting an Australian \ndiplomat's daughter of Vietnamese descent, his present wife Vi. They \nmake an engaging and attractive couple.\n  Mr. President, I offer these comments of appreciation as we pass this \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, four years ago, I rose in this body to \nencourage my colleagues to confirm the nomination of my friend Pete \nPeterson to serve as the American ambassador to Vietnam, the first \nsince the end of the Vietnam War. When we confirmed Pete for this \nimportant assignment in 1997, many of us could not have foreseen his \nsuccess in building a normal relationship between our two countries.\n  Indeed, the best measure of Pete's success is the fact that it seems \nquite normal today for the United States to have an ambassador resident \nin Hanoi to advance our array of interests in Vietnam, which range from \naccounting for our missing service personnel to improving human rights \nto cooperating on drugs and crime to addressing regional challenges \ntogether. That normalcy is due largely to the superb job Pete did as \nour ambassador to Vietnam.\n  As a former fighter pilot shot down and held captive for six and a \nhalf years, some would have assumed it was not Pete's destiny to go \nback to Vietnam to restore a relationship that had been frozen in \nenmity for decades. Indeed, there was a time in Pete's life when the \nprospect of voluntarily residing in Hanoi would have been unthinkable. \nMuch time has passed since then. Our relationship with Vietnam has \nchanged in once unthinkable ways.\n  Pete rose to the occasion and helped us to build the new relationship \nwe enjoy today. Pete's willingness, after having already rendered many \nyears of noble service to his country, to answer\n\n[[Page S10141]]\n\nher call again and serve in a place that did not occasion many happy \nmemories for him, was an act of selfless patriotism beyond conventional \nmeasure. I am immensely proud of him.\n  I know of no other American whose combination of subtle intuition and \nsteely determination, whose ability to win over both former Vietnamese \nadversaries and skeptics of the new relationship here at home, could \nhave matched the success Pete had in transforming our relations. Pete \ndid this in service to America, and as an acknowledgment that the range \nof our interests in Vietnam, and the values we hope to see take root \nthere, called for such an approach.\n  Our nation is better off for Pete's service. So are the Vietnamese \npeople. So are those Americans who learned the grim but whole truth \nabout the fate of their loved ones who had been missing since the war \nas a result of Pete's unending commitment to a full and final \naccounting. After the number of POW/MIA repatriation ceremonies over \nwhich he presided--each flag-draped coffin containing the hopes and \ndreams of a lifetime--Pete can confirm that providing final answers to \nall POW/MIA families is alone ample reason for our continuing \nengagement with the Vietnamese.\n  Pete Peterson has built a legacy that serves our nation and honors \nthe values for which young Americans once fought, suffered, and died, \nin Southeast Asia. I can think of no higher tribute than that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the Senate is considering a resolution in \nrecognition of the outstanding service of our former U.S. Ambassador to \nVietnam, Mr. Pete Peterson. I will comment briefly on the exceptional \nlife of Mr. Peterson.\n  Mr. President, Pete Peterson is an American in our proudest \ntradition. Throughout his adult life, he has served America as a career \nofficer in the United States Air Force, serving with bravery during the \nVietnam war, including a period of over 6 years of incarceration in a \nVietnam prison after having been shot down in combat.\n  Pete Peterson returned to the United States and to Marianna, FL, \nafter his long period of incarceration in Vietnam and, as a civilian, \nestablished his own business but continued his commitment to service, \nservice in the form of being a volunteer at the State's principal \nschool for boys who have the most difficult experience of delinquency.\n  Pete Peterson served as a role model to these young men who were at \nthe point in life where they either were going to recapture a sense of \npersonal responsibility and values or they were likely to spend their \nown adult life in another form of prison for periods of longer than 6 \nyears, even, that Pete Peterson spent in Vietnam.\n  He performed great service to these young men and, in the course of \nthat service, became aware of the role that service in elective office \nmight have in terms of furthering his interest in America's youth. And \nso, in 1990, Pete Peterson, in what many considered to be almost a \ncause without hope, announced that he was going to run for the U.S. \nCongress. He did, and by the end of the campaign had managed to rally \nsuch public support that he defeated an incumbent Member of Congress--a \nrare feat in these days.\n  He then served 6 years of very distinguished service in the House of \nRepresentatives. Having announced in 1990, when he first ran, that he \nwould only serve three terms, at the end of his three terms, in 1996, \nhe indicated he was going to return home to Marianna, having completed \nthat congressional phase of his public career. Little did he know there \nwas yet to be another important chapter before him. And that chapter \ndeveloped as a result of the Congress and the President--President \nClinton--reestablishing normal diplomatic relations with our previous \nadversary, Vietnam.\n  President Clinton asked Pete Peterson to be the first United States \nAmbassador to Vietnam in the postwar era. Of course, Pete accepted that \nchallenge to return to the service of the Nation that he so deeply \nloved.\n  He was an exceptional Ambassador. You can imagine the emotion he \nfelt, as well as the people of Vietnam--to have a man who had spent \nyears as a prisoner of war in Vietnam now returning as the first United \nStates Ambassador.\n  Any sense of bitterness, any sense of loss that Pete may have felt \nevaporated. He represented our Nation and reached out to the people of \nVietnam with unusual ability and warmth.\n  A testimony to his great service is the legislation that this Senate \ntoday approved, which is a trade agreement with Vietnam. This is \nsymbolic of the new relationship that will exist between the United \nStates and Vietnam as we rebuild our relationship based on our common \ninterest in advancing the economic well-being of both of our peoples. \nThis trade agreement would not have been before the Senate today but \nfor the exceptional skills, as our Ambassador to Vietnam, which were \nexercised by Pete Peterson.\n  So, Mr. President, I join those who are taking this opportunity, as \nwe enter into a new era of relationship with Vietnam, to recognize the \nparticular role which our former colleague in the House of \nRepresentatives, Pete Peterson, played in making this possible.\n  He is truly an exceptional American, but in the mold of so many \ngenerations of exceptional Americans. We are fortunate, as Americans, \nand those of us who know him also as a Floridian, to have served with \nand to have lived at the same time with such a special human being as \nPete Peterson.\n  I commend him for his many contributions to our Nation, and wish him \nwell, as I am certain he will be pursuing further opportunities for \npublic service.\n  Mr. Nelson of Florida. I ask unanimous consent the resolution and the \npreamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 167) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Resolutions Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent to proceed up to 22 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10141-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10141-S10144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in a matter that is very \nhard to discuss these days, when we are dealing with the aftermath of \nthe destruction that has been visited upon our country. I rise to speak \nof a matter that is at the very heart of our fight against terrorism.\n  Today I met with the Secretary of State, along with my Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee colleagues, including the occupant of the Chair, \nfor about 2 hours. I applaud the actions of President Bush and \nSecretary Powell and the rest of the administration throughout this \nterrible crisis. I applaud what he had to say at our meeting.\n  Of all the topics Secretary Powell discussed with me and other \nmembers of the Foreign Relations Committee, none was more important in \nmy view than this: We must make a bold, brave, and powerful decision to \nprovide generous relief and reconstruction aid to the people of \nAfghanistan and neighboring countries, even as we move toward war. We \nmust wage a war against the vicious thugs who attacked our nation, but \nwe must not permit this war to be mischaracterized as a battle against \nthe people of Afghanistan or the wider Muslim world.\n  If we can't make this critical distinction, all our efforts are \ndoomed to failure. The people of Afghanistan, who are looking for a way \nof ridding themselves of the Taliban regime, might direct their anger \nat us rather than at the brutal warlords who have caused them so much \nmisery and pain. The people of Muslim countries from Morocco to \nIndonesia could turn against the United States, with disastrous \nconsequences for many years to come--notwithstanding my belief that we \nwill prosecute this military effort with discreet and precise efforts \nto minimize civilian casualties.\n\n[[Page S10142]]\n\n  We have already seen how those who wish us ill can portray \nlegitimate, restrained military action as an indiscriminate attack on \ninnocent civilians, and how such an argument can be persuasive to so \nmany people in the Middle East. Saddam Hussein, a man who has killed \nfar more Muslims than any American attack before, during, or since the \ngulf war, has depicted the United States-led actions against Iraq as an \nassault on Iraqi women and children, an assault on Islam. That is a guy \nwho has killed more believers of Islam than just about anybody else--\nand yet he is able to put out a boldfaced lie, the lie that our \nsoldiers have gone out of their way to hurt innocent civilians. In \nfact, our soldiers have always gone out of their way to avoid \ncollateral damage to civilians, even during the height of the gulf war.\n  The United Nations' sanctions imposed since that time place no \nrestrictions on the delivery of food or medicine to the people of Iraq. \nQuite the opposite. Yet Saddam has won the international battle. He has \nconvinced a significant portion of the Islamic world that we are the \nreason the people of Iraq do not have food and medicine in sufficient \nsupply. It is Saddam who is starving his own people, deliberately \nsitting on billions of oil dollars earmarked for humanitarian aid to \nthe people of Iraq while he pursues his weapons of mass destruction and \nbuilds himself more palaces.\n  The reason I bring this up is that throughout much of the Muslim \nworld Saddam's propaganda remains convincing. People see these images \nof children and their mothers scrambling for food, the footage of \ndestroyed buildings, and they know the United States conducts bombing \nraids to enforce the no-fly zone and we are leading an international \ncoalition to maintain sanctions. So they conclude, with his distinct \nurging, that we are not acting in accordance with U.N. resolutions and \nthe consent of the world community, but that we are acting in the way \nSaddam Hussein portrays us as acting: victimizing his people, \noppressing women and children, and causing great hardship.\n  No matter how we cut it, he has won the battle over who's at fault. \nIf you had told me that was going to be the case after the gulf war, I \nwould have told you that you were crazy. One of the reasons he has won \nis we are so accustomed in America to not beating our own chests about \nwhat we do for other people, we are so accustomed to thinking that \npeople are going to be open minded, as we are. It is almost beyond our \ncapacity to believe anyone could think we were responsible for those \nwomen and children and old people in Iraq starving, being malnourished, \nand not having adequate medical care.\n  It is very simple in the Muslim world right now. When America bombs, \nAmerica is blamed for anything else that happens. And not just blamed \nfor what we have done, but we are blamed for what we have not done. It \nis not fair, but it is the fact. As the world's only superpower, we \nreceive a lot of misdirected blame under the best of circumstances. The \nnuances and subtleties of geopolitics don't get translated to the \nlanguage of the street. And once the bombs start to fall, any vestige \nof nuance is blown away with whatever they hit.\n  We cannot allow what happened in Iraq to happen in Afghanistan. Osama \nbin Laden and the Taliban leader, Mullah Omar, have been trying to cast \nthe current conflict in terms of religion and have been calling our \nefforts a crusade against Islam.\n  You mention the word ``crusade'' in the Middle East and it has a very \ndifferent context than when we use it here. It is not accidental that \nthe word is used by bin Laden. It conjures up several hundred years of \npainful history.\n  This is not a crusade. It is not a war against Muslims. And we cannot \npermit bin Laden and the Taliban to portray it as such. So how do we \nprevent it from happening this time?\n  We have all said the right words. President Bush, Secretary Powell, \nand most Senators gathered in this Chamber have all spoken out \nforcefully. Our rhetoric has been fine, but if we want to convince the \nworld's 1.6 billion Muslims of our sincerity, it will take much more \nthan our rhetoric. It will take action, real action, to save the lives \nof real people.\n  After my long-time involvement with and strong advocacy for Muslims \nin Europe, whenever I go to the Balkans I can barely take a step \nwithout being reminded of this dynamic. If my name is mentioned among \nMuslim leaders, I am thanked for being one of their saviors; I am \nthanked for being one of the people who has fought to help them--and \nI'm sure all those American servicemen and servicewomen over there now \nprotecting the Muslims in the Balkans feel the same. But none of that \nmessage has gotten to the Middle East. It is ironic.\n  So what we need to do is back up our words with our wallets. In my \nview, we must do this ahead of time.\n  We say we have no beef with the Afghan people, and we do not. But one \nout of four Afghans--perhaps 7 million people--are surviving on little \nmore than grass and locusts. We say our fight is only against the \nterrorists, along with their sponsors, and it is. But the people of \nAfghanistan have been subjected to constant warfare for the past two \ndecades. They are looking for help, and they are looking at us.\n  We did not cause the terrible drought that brought so many Afghans to \nthe brink of starvation, and we did not cause the Soviet invasion or \nthe civil war that followed. We were interested in Afghanistan, but \nonly when it suited our own interests. We paid attention during the \n1980s, but then came down with a case of attention deficit disorder. As \nsoon as the last Russian troops pulled out in 1989, our commitment \nseemed to retreat along with them. And I was here, so I share this \nresponsibility.\n  The years of bloody chaos that followed were what gave rise to the \nTaliban. If we had not lost interest a decade ago, perhaps Afghanistan \nwould not have turned into the swamp of terrorism and brutality that it \nhas become.\n  I say this not to cast stones, because I was here. We do not need to \nask who ``lost'' Afghanistan. There is more than enough blame to go \naround. It is not a matter of political party or ideological outlook. \nNobody--Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative--stepped up to the \nplate when it counted because we did not take it as seriously as it \nturned out to be.\n  It is time we all stepped up to the plate.\n  In fairness to the folks who were here, like me and others, the truth \nof the matter is we get called on from all over the world and we find \nourselves responding to whatever the crisis of the moment is.\n  It is time to reverse more than a decade of neglect, not only for the \nsake of Afghanistan, but for our sake. Not only for the sake of \nPakistan, which faces growing instability exacerbated by the enormous \nburden of sheltering millions of Afghan refugees. Not only for the sake \nof the Central Asian republics, all of which are threatened by chaos \nfomented in Kabul and Kandahar. We have to take action not merely for \ntheir sake, but for our own sake.\n\n  The tragedy of September 11 served as a stark reminder that isolation \nis impossible. What happens in South and Central Asia has direct impact \non what happens right here in the United States. If we ever were able \nto think of our nation as one buffered from far-away events, we can no \nlonger maintain that illusion. So what can we do?\n  Let me make this very bold proposal as to what I think we should and \ncould do. The plight of the Afghans had reached a crisis point before \nSeptember 11, and the prospect of military action has made matters even \nworse. The U.N. places the number of Afghan refugees at about 3 \nmillion, and in Iran at about one half that, with another million \ndisplaced within Afghanistan itself. These people are living--if one \ncan call it that--in conditions of unspeakable deprivation. One camp in \nthe Afghan city of Herat is locally called, quite appropriately, ``the \nslaughterhouse.'' The expectation of U.S. attacks has already prompted \nmore desperate people to flee their homes, and a estimated 1.5 million \nmay soon take to the road.\n  U.N. Secretary Kofi Annan has issued an appeal for $584 million to \nmeet the needs of the Afghan refugees and displaced people, within \nAfghanistan and in neighboring countries. This is the amount deemed \nnecessary to stave off disaster for the winter, which will start in \nAfghanistan in just a few weeks.\n\n[[Page S10143]]\n\n  We must back up our rhetoric with action, with something big and bold \nand meaningful. We can offer to foot the entire bill for keeping the \nAfghan people safely fed, clothed, and sheltered this winter, and that \nshould be the beginning.\n  We can establish an international fund for the relief, \nreconstruction, and recovery of Central and Southwest Asia. We can do \nthis through the U.N. or through a multilateral bank, but we must be in \nit for the long haul with the rest of the world.\n  The initial purpose of the fund would be to address the immediate \nneeds of the Afghans displaced by drought and war for the next 6 \nmonths. But the fund's longer-term purpose would be to help stabilize \nthe whole region by, as the President says, draining the swamp that \nAfghanistan has become.\n  We can kick the effort off in a way that would silence our critics in \nthe rest of the world: a check for $1 billion, and a promise for more \nto come as long as the rest of the world joins us. This initial amount \nwould be more than enough to meet all the refugees' short-term needs, \nand would be a credible downpayment for the long-term effort. \nEventually the world community will have to pony up more billions, but \nthere is no avoiding that now, not if we expect our words ever to carry \nany weight.\n  If anyone thinks this amount of money is too high, let me note one \nstark, simple and very sad statistic. The damage inflicted by the \nSeptember 11 attack in economic terms alone was a minimum of several \nhundred billion dollars and a maximum of over $1 trillion. The cost in \nhuman life, of course, as the Presiding Officer knows, is far beyond \nany calculation.\n  The fund I propose would be a way to put some flesh on the bones, not \nonly of the Afghan refugees, but on the international coalition that \nPresident Bush has assembled. All nations would be invited to \ncontribute to this fund, and projects for relief and reconstruction \ncould be carried out under the auspices of the United Nations. \nCountries that are leery of providing military aid against the Taliban \ncould use this recovery fund as a means to demonstrate their commitment \nto the wider cause.\n  Money from the fund would be used for projects in several countries. \nIn the short term, it could help front-line countries handle the social \nproblems caused by existing refugee burdens or the expected military \ncampaign. This would further solidify the alliance and give wavering \nregimes, especially Pakistan, a valuable ``deliverable'' to present to \nits own people.\n  The fund would also be used for relief efforts within Afghanistan \nitself. This could take several forms. It could help finance air drops \nof food and medical supplies. It could support on-the-ground \ndistribution in territories held by the Northern Alliance and other \nfriendly forces. And perhaps, most significantly, it could provide the \nPashtun leaders of the south with a powerful incentive to abandon the \nTaliban and join the United States-led effort.\n  Think of the impact. Many Pashtun chiefs, including current \nsupporters of the Taliban, are already on the fence. If the Pashtuns, \nwho are now going hungry, saw relief aid pouring into neighboring \nprovinces or in from the air, with their own leaders stubbornly stuck \nby Mullah Omar and refused such aid well, we could suddenly find \nourselves with a lot of new allies. The seemingly intractable problem \nof forging a political consensus in Afghanistan might become a whole \nlot easier to solve.\n  A massive humanitarian relief effort will not guarantee a favorable \npolitical solution. But it clearly is within the realm of possibility. \nWe can establish our credibility by committing ourselves to providing \nthis aid now, before the first bomb falls.\n\n  The funding that I propose will address not only the short-term goal, \nbut the more important (and more difficult) longer term ones as well. \nWhatever we do in Afghanistan--whether it involves the commitment of \nmilitary, political, or humanitarian assets--must be geared toward a \nlong-term solution. We cannot repeat the mistakes of the past. If we \nthink only in the short term, only of getting Bin Laden and the \nTaliban--which we must do, but that is not all we must do--we are just \nbegging for greater trouble down the line.\n  We have a unique opportunity here and right now--a window of \nopportunity that will not be open forever. Now, while the attention of \nthe country and the world is focused on this vital issue, we can create \na consensus necessary to build a lasting peace in the region.\n  This will be a multinational, multiyear, multibillion-dollar \ncommitment. And if we take a leading role, I am confident that other \nnations will follow.\n  Today is not the time to speak about political reconstruction of \nAfghanistan. The situation is extremely fluid, and delicate \nnegotiations are in progress. This Chamber is not the appropriate place \nfor such a sensitive discussion.\n  Today is also not the time to discuss all the details of the long-\nterm economic reconstruction package for the region. Once the immediate \nrefugee crisis is dealt with, there will be plenty of opportunity to \ndeal with the nitty-gritty of how best to help the people in the region \nrebuild their lives. I will not presume to lay out a long-term agenda \ntoday. But some of the foremost items on such an agenda might include \nthe following:\n  Creation of secular schools, both in Pakistan and Afghanistan, to \nbreak the stranglehold of radical religious seminaries that have \npolluted a whole generation of Afghan boys. The Taliban movement is an \noutgrowth of this network of extremist seminaries, a network which has \nbeen funded by militant forces around the world and has fed off the \nlack of secular educational opportunities.\n  We can also be involved in the restoration of women's rights. The \nTaliban created a regime more hostile to the rights of women than any \nstate in the whole world. Women under Taliban rule have been deprived \nof even the most basic of human rights. A critical element of the new \nschool system, I should emphasize, will be providing equal education \nfor girls and boys alike. If Afghan girls and women do not have a \nchance to go to school, they will never be able to have the rights they \nare so cruelly denied now by the Taliban.\n  De-mining operations: Afghanistan is the world's most heavily mined \ncountry. Clearing these mines will take time, money, and expertise. \nUntil these fields are cleared, farmers--whether currently trapped in \nrefugee camps or trapped by drought--cannot start farming their land.\n  Creation of full-scale hospitals and village medical clinics in \nAfghanistan and throughout the region. As in the case of schools, the \nabsence of such services has created a void filled by radical groups.\n  People sometimes ask why extremist organizations have been so \nsuccessful in recruiting support in the Muslim world. Let me tell you, \nthey don't do it all by hate. Many militant groups provide valuable \nsocial services in order to gain goodwill, and then twist that goodwill \nto vicious ends.\n  Another thing we can provide is a crop substitution program for \nnarcotics. This week, the Taliban reversed its short-lived ban on \ngrowing opium. As part of a long-term solution, we have to help the \nAfghan farmers find a new way to support their families. We cannot let \nAfghanistan resume its place as the world's No. 1 source of heroin.\n  Building basic infrastructure: Just as Saddam manipulated images of \nwar in Iraq, the Taliban could have success doing the same. We have to \ncounter this effort by drilling wells, building roads, providing \ntechnical expertise, and a whole range of development projects.\n  We are portrayed as bringing destruction to the region. We must fight \nthat perception: we must prove to the world that we are not a nation of \ndestruction, but of reconstruction.\n  This afternoon, the members of the Foreign Relations Committee and I \nhad a very productive meeting with the Secretary of State. Everything I \nhave said here today is an attempt to support Secretary Powell and \nPresident Bush in their efforts to send the world a simple message: Our \nfight is against terrorism--not against Islam. We oppose the Taliban \nnot the Afghan people.\n  We stand ready as a great nation, as a generous nation, as a nation \nthat has\n\n[[Page S10144]]\n\nled the world in the past, a nation whose word is its bond, and we \nstand ready to match our words with our actions.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10144-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE ANTITERRORISM PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to express my \nconcern about what is happening on the antiterrorism package. Two weeks \nago Attorney General John Ashcroft met with Members in an adjacent \nroom, 211, down the hall, and asked for legislation that week. I \nresponded we could not do it instantly but we could do it briefly.\n  Since that time, we have only had one hearing in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, a week ago yesterday, where we heard from Attorney General \nAshcroft for about 75 minutes. Most of the members of the committee did \nnot have a chance to question him. I did.\n  We really have a serious issue of prompt action by the Congress. But \nit has to be deliberative. We have to be sure of what is in the \nlegislation. When Attorney General Ashcroft testified, he said on the \ndetention of aliens, the only ones they wanted to detain were those who \nwere subject to deportation proceedings. My response to that was that I \nthought they had the authority now, but the bill was much broader. It \nauthorized detention of aliens without any showing of cause at the \ndiscretion of the Attorney General, and we could give the Attorney \nGeneral and law enforcement the additional authority. But it had to be \ncarefully drawn.\n  Similarly, on the use of electronic surveillance, the Attorney \nGeneral said he wanted to have the availability of electronic \nsurveillance on content only on a showing of probable cause, but the \namendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act were broader.\n  Here again, I think we can give the Department of Justice and law \nenforcement what they need, but we have to carefully craft the bill. We \nhave not had any hearings since. There is a meeting scheduled later \ntoday with all Republican Senators, with our ranking member, Senator \nHatch, to have what I understand will be compromise legislation which \nhas been worked out. But the difficulty is that the Supreme Court of \nthe United States has, in a series of decisions, struck down acts of \nCongress when there has been an insufficient record showing a \ndeliberative process and showing reasons for why the Congress has done \nwhat the legislation seeks to accomplish. In the area of law \nenforcement and civil liberties, there is, perhaps, more of a balancing \ntest than in any other field.\n  What we need to do is to have a record. If the Department of Justice \ncan show that there is a need for electronic surveillance which more \nclosely approximates the standards of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act than the traditional standards of probable cause--a \nreally pressing need with factual matters--that is something which the \nJudiciary Committee ought to consider. If there are pressing matters \nabout the detention of aliens--I understand the House has a bill which \nwould allow for detention for 7 days, which is a protracted period of \ntime--there has to be a showing as to what is involved. That can be \naccomplished only through the hearing process. Perhaps we need closed \nhearings. But I am very concerned, and I have communicated my concern \nthat something may happen in the intervening time which might be \nattributable to our failure to act.\n  I hope we will let the Judiciary Committee undertake its activities. \nWe have a lot of seasoned people there who have prosecutorial and \ngovernmental experience, who have things to add to really understand \nexactly what the specific needs are and to structure legislation which \nwill meet those specific needs and which, under a balancing test that \nthe courts have imposed, will survive constitutional muster.\n  But we are on notice and we are on warning that the Court will strike \ndown legislation if there is not a sufficient deliberative record as to \nwhy the legislation is needed.\n  It was my hope that we could have had a markup early this week, and \nwe still could with dispatch. There is no reason that the Senate can't \nhave hearings on Fridays, or on Saturdays, when we are not going to be \nin session, to have markups and sit down with Department of Justice \npeople to get the details as what they need perhaps in closed session \nand move ahead to get this legislation completed.\n  I think we can accommodate the interests of law enforcement, a field \nin which I have had some experience, and also the civil liberties and \nconstitutional rights, a field again that I have had some familiarity \nwith.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire for letting me \nspeak at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10144-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10144-S10145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE FUTURE OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, less than 2 weeks ago, legislation \nproviding $15 billion to the airline industry flew through the Congress \nlike a runaway express. The legislation moved so quickly that I am of \nthe view that additional steps are needed to impose accountability on \nthe airlines for this unprecedented infusion of taxpayer money.\n  One-third of the $15 billion is already on its way out the door of \nthe U.S. Treasury and will be given to the carriers according to a \nformula that they sought. Saturday is the deadline for deciding the \nbasic process and rules for apportioning the remaining $10 billion in \nloans and loan guarantees. The way this staggering sum of money is \nallocated will shape the structure of the airline industry for years to \ncome.\n  Yesterday the Wall Street Journal reported that the larger and \nfinancially healthier airlines have attempted to impose their terms for \nthe $10 billion in loan guarantees on the smaller and the weaker \ncarriers. If the Office of Management and Budget acquiesces to the \ndemands of the larger carriers, it could crush the smaller airlines in \nthe short term and squash significantly the hopes of competition and \nconsumer choice in the long run.\n  On the horizon of the aviation industry there may be only two or \nthree carriers dominating routes, dictating prices, and reducing \nservice to small and usually rural markets. It is for this reason that \nI come to the floor today, and I intend to outline several principles \nthat I believe the Congress should insist upon in order to keep an eye \non shaping the future of this industry so that there is real \ncompetition, affordable prices for consumers, and adequate service \nacross this country.\n  It is obviously critically important to focus on the short-term needs \nof getting people traveling again on those near empty planes and \nrestoring consumer confidence. But it is just as important to put in \nplace policies that protect the long-term interests of the flying \npublic and the taxpayer.\n  The $10 billion package of loans and loan guarantees is going to \ndramatically reshape the industry for years to come. On the question of \ncompetition, on whether flights are affordable, and whether rural areas \nare turned into economic sacrifice zones, the decisions that are going \nto be made in the next few weeks will have a dramatic impact.\n  The entire Senate understands that there is a national airline rescue \neffort underway. Since September 11, Congress has heard much from the \nairline industry about what the industry believes needs to be done. \nCongress has responded. It is time now for the Congress to set out what \nthe American people have a right to expect from the airline industry. \nFortunately, this job is going to be easier because the Comptroller \nGeneral, David Walker, and the Department of Transportation Inspector \nGeneral, Ken Mead, are in place in order to provide a crucial reality \ncheck. Already Mr. Walker has performed an important service of pulling \ntogether a General Accounting Office team, getting me and other Members \nof the Senate a sense of what the industry's loss projections are, and \nparticularly an analysis of their short-term needs. This type of \nindependent third-party review is going to be essential in the weeks \nand months ahead.\n  Let me give the Senate just a few examples of the important questions \nthat the public has a right to have debated\n\n[[Page S10145]]\n\nnow, in order to know to what the end product of this debate \ninvolving the $15 billion is going to lead. For example, suppose that \nthe $10 billion in loan guarantees is allocated in a way that favors a \nfew large carriers, which is something that is being sought by some in \nthe industry. The end result could be consolidation to just a couple of \nairlines, precisely the result the Government was trying to avoid when \nit blocked the proposed United-US Airways merger. Or suppose carriers \nuse loan guarantees to strengthen their operations in ``fortress hubs\" \nwhile pulling back elsewhere. The end result for many consumers would \nbe a monopolistic environment with little competition and few choices.\n\n  Of course, there is the risk that taxpayer dollars will be wasted on \nairlines that may not survive in any case or on airlines that really do \nnot need the help. Care has to be taken to ensure that these dollars \nare used to get the maximum for the American public.\n  Responsibility for avoiding these pitfalls lies, in the first \ninstance, with the Air Transportation Stabilization Board. The Board \nhas the authority to decide who will receive loan guarantee assistance \nand subject to what terms and conditions. The Congress, unfortunately, \nhas not provided this Board with a lot of guidance. The legislation \nprovides only general criteria, such as the requirement that the loan \nin question be prudently incurred. Congress has not told the Board \nwhere to place its priorities or what the goals should be. Therefore, I \nbelieve some guiding principles are needed with respect to how that $15 \nbillion is allocated. I propose the following principles this morning:\n  First, Government assistance must be allocated in ways that are going \nto promote and not hinder competition between the airlines. This must \nbe a primary goal because without competition the entire premise of the \nderegulated industry relying on market forces makes no sense. The \nGovernment cannot afford to focus narrowly on each individual loan \nguarantee application while ignoring the big picture issue of how the \noverall assistance package affects the balance of competition in the \nindustry.\n  Second, companies receiving assistance need to be monitored closely \nto make sure they are using the money responsibly. Are the taxpayer \nfunds being used to subsidize dividends to the shareholders, lucrative \ncompensation for top executives, or increased lobbying? The legislation \ndoes contain some provisions with respect to executive compensation, \nbut the additional issues I am raising could send a message, at a time \nwhen America is hurting, that some of the powerful may be profiting.\n  Third, companies receiving assistance and their major stakeholders \nshould be required to demonstrate that they are doing everything in \ntheir power to improve the situation. Companies would have to show that \nthey have a plan for returning to profitability and that the plan is \nactually being followed. Top managers should take salary reductions and \ndebtholders and employees should make sacrifices as well. Taxpayers who \nare funding that $15 billion legislative package should know that all \nof the company's stakeholders are helping to shoulder the burden.\n  Fourth, there needs to be an upside for the taxpayer. In the Chrysler \nbailout legislation, the Treasury Department received stock options \nthat eventually led to a substantial profit for the taxpayers. \nSimilarly, this effort should be coupled with a mechanism for the \npublic to recoup its investment when airlines return to profitability.\n  Fifth, service to small markets must not be a casualty of this \ncrisis. As airlines cut flights or routes in response to the current \npredicament, their first instinct may be to eliminate small market \nservice and turn small communities in Nebraska and Oregon and other \nrural States into sacrifice zones. Americans need an airline system \nthat connects the entire country and not just the large hubs. Any \nprogram of Government assistance to the airlines must seek to encourage \nthe airlines to maintain and indeed improve service in the small \nmarkets.\n  Sixth, companies should be rewarded for treating employees in a \nresponsible manner. Approximately 100,000 airline workers have already \nbeen laid off--but there are significant differences from airline to \nairline in the type of severance arrangements offered, and also in the \nefforts the airlines make to rehire workers when conditions begin to \nimprove again. When it comes to public assistance, companies with more \nresponsible labor policies should have a significant leg up in those \nloans and loan guarantees.\n  Seventh, and finally, the current focus on the interests of the \nairlines should not come at the expense of efforts to protect the \ninterests of consumers. The fact is, this is a concentrated industry in \nwhich consumers often face limited choices. There is a real risk that, \nif some air carriers fail, the competition situation may get worse \nbefore it gets better.\n  That makes consumer protection all the more important in a number of \nbasic areas--areas where the Department of Transportation Inspector \nGeneral has already said there is a serious problem, and that Members \nof this body have tried to address in passenger rights legislation.\n  There may be a need as this new effort goes forward for proconsumer \nrules in order to protect consumers.\n  Adhering to these seven core principles that I have laid out this \nmorning is not going to be easy. There is no simple rule or formula \nthat Congress should impose, or that the board could follow that would \nautomatically achieve all of the objectives that I have laid out today.\n  It is critical, in my view, in order to make sure this job is done \nresponsibly, for Congress to obtain on a weekly basis the information \nnecessary to exercise responsible oversight over the airline industry. \nThis information must be real-time data, including load factors, yields \nper mile, fares, type of aircraft, dividend payments, service to small \nmarkets, cancellations, workforce statistics and route information.\n  In the coming weeks, the Air Transportation Stabilization Board \nbegins to implement the loan guarantee program. I am certain the Senate \nCommerce Committee under the leadership of Chairman Hollings will be \nactively engaged. I am anxious to work with my colleagues to put in \nplace the principles that I have outlined today, as well, I am sure, as \nother Members of the Senate who will propose what they believe should \ngovern how this $15 billion is allocated.\n  The airline industry has been heard from. Now the public has a right \nto ask the airline industry to support policies and to work with the \nU.S. Congress to ensure that this is true competition, affordable \nprices, and decent service.\n  In closing, I am of the strong view that the work of the Congress on \nthat $15 billion legislation began when the bill passed. I hope and \ntrust that my colleagues will join with me in doing everything we can \nto ensure that at the end of the bailout process the American people \nare left with a more competitive airline industry, one that offers \nhigh-quality service to every area of the country and gives the public \nwhat they have a right to expect will be the end process of that \nunprecedented legislation that the Congress passed a little less than 2 \nweeks ago.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10145-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10145-S10146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEMORIAL TRIBUTE TO D. MICHAEL HARVEY\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, it is both with a sense of sorrow and \nwith great admiration that I rise today to pay tribute to an exemplary \npublic servant and a good friend, D. Michael Harvey, who died on August \n31, 2001. Mike served the United States Senate and the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources with distinction for some 22 years. He \noften said that there was no higher calling than public service. Mike \nworked for and counseled some of the giants of the committee: Clifford \nHansen of Wyoming; Lee Metcalf of Montana; Henry M. (Scoop) Jackson of \nWashington; Mark Hatfield of Oregon; Dale Bumpers of Arkansas; and J. \nBennett Johnston of Louisiana. He served at the direction of the \ncommittee's leaders, but all the committee's members--Democrats and \nRepublicans alike--had access to and benefit of his counsel.\n  Mike was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and raised in Rochester, NY. He \nreceived his B.A. from the University of Rochester in 1955. He joined \nEastman Kodak Co., for 4 years, before moving to Washington.\n\n[[Page S10146]]\n\n  Mike began his public service career in 1960 with the Bureau of Land \nManagement in the Interior Department, spending his last 4 years there \nas chief of the Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management. He \nreceived a J.D. from Georgetown University in 1963, while working at \nBLM. In the mid-1960s he served with the Public Land Law Review \nCommission and the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration.\n  In 1973 Mike accepted an invitation from Senator Henry M. Jackson to \nbecome special counsel to the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular \nAffairs. In February 1977, when the Senate reorganized its committee \nstructure and created the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, Mike was appointed its first chief counsel. Until his \nretirement in 1995, he served as majority chief counsel during the \nyears that the Democrats controlled the Senate and as chief counsel and \nstaff director for the minority when Republicans held the majority.\n  During his tenure with the committee, Mike played a key role in \ndeveloping landmark legislation involving Alaska lands, the regulation \nof surface coal mining, and Federal energy policy and land management. \nHis knowledge of the law regarding natural resources was enclyclopedic \nand his judgment was well-respected. Mike was dedicated to achieving \ngood public policy and his counsel was always given with that paramount \nobjective in mind. In addition to providing a sounding board on a huge \nrange of issues, Mike was a role model, a teacher and a mentor for his \ncolleagues. He established a high standard of professionalism among the \ncommittee staff and instilled it, by his example more than by precept, \nin the generation of young staff members that he trained.\n\n  Mike was known by all who worked with him for his dedicated \nprofessionalism and the breadth and depth of his substantive expertise. \nBut he was perhaps known best for the extremely high standard of ethics \nhe brought to public service. You could always get a legal opinion from \nMike of the highest caliber, and you could be absolutely confident that \nthe opinion was free of any special interest or personal prejudgment. \nHe was a talented professional and a fine human being.\n  Mike was actively involved in American Bar Association activities. He \nserved on the council of the ABA Section of Natural Resources Law. He \nwas past chairman of the Fairfax County Park Authority. He served as a \ncongressional adviser to the U.S. delegation to the third U.N. \nConference on the Law of the Sea and served on the board of governors \nof the Henry M. Jackson Foundation and the board of directors of the \nPublic Land Foundation. Mike often attended the theater, loved poetry, \nand was known to quote Shakespeare at length.\n  The Senate was fortunate to have the benefit of Mike Harvey's \nconsiderable talents for many years. I was privileged to have worked \nwith him and to have known him. Our deepest sympathies go out to Mike's \nfamily: his wife, Pat; his four children, Michelle, Jeffrey, David, and \nLeslie; and his 10 grandchildren. We share in their loss.\n  In eulogizing the great Scoop Jackson, Mike relied on a quotation \nfrom Shakespeare. I believe that Shakespeare's eloquent words apply as \nwell to the late Mike Harvey:\n\n       His life was noble, and the elements so mixed in him that \n     Nature might stand up and say to all the world: ``This was a \n     man.''\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10146-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CAPITOL HILL POLICE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Two brothers, Todd Justin Clinger, 20, and Troy Lee \nClinger, 18, were charged with attempted homicide after severely \nbeating a neighbor, Michael Aucker, 41. Police allege that one of the \nbrothers, Troy, said that Aucker tried to make a pass at them while the \ntrio drank beer in their trailer. Police said the three men walked out \non the deck, where the brothers allegedly punched and stomped on Aucker \nwith heavy work boots several times before taking the bleeding Aucker \nto his nearby trailer. Aucker was discovered a day and a half later by \na neighbor and co-worker.

I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10146-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10146-S10147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE NEED FOR RURAL AIR TRANSPORTATION\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I rise today to express my deep \nconcern with the state of the airline industry in the United States.\n  On Friday, September 21, Congress passed the ``Air Transportation \nSafety and System Stabilization Act.'' This bill provided the \ncommercial airline industry with $15 billion in emergency aid and \nloans. The intention of the bill was to ensure that our system of \ncommercial air transportation remained viable nationwide, both in less \npopulous rural areas and in larger metropolitan areas.\n  When this bill came before the Senate, I had reservations about how \neffective it would be. I was not convinced that it would do enough to \nhelp the tens of thousands of workers who were being laid off by the \nairline companies; I was not convinced that it provided adequate \nincentives to assist the airlines in correcting the management problems \nthat had forced them into a corner to begin with; I was not convinced \nthat it would do enough to encourage passenger confidence in the wake \nof the horrible hijackings of September 11; and I was not convinced \nthat we were taking adequate time to consider the ramifications of the \npackage. I expressed my reservations to several of my colleagues, and I \nwas assured that we would deal with those concerns soon after.\n  It would appear my reservations were well-founded. One important \nprovision of the stabilization bill was that the airlines would honor \ntheir service commitments so that small communities would not lose \nscheduled air service. This week, United Airlines announced that they \nare discontinuing service to Little Rock, AR. The cutback at Little \nRock was one component of a sweeping reduction in capacity which will \nreduce United's service from 2,300 daily flights worldwide to 1,900 \ndaily flights. According to the airline, the cutback is a result of the \nreduced demand for travel nationwide. Similar cuts were made in \nVirginia, Washington, and Alabama. The airline claims that service will \nresume if demand for air travel picks up.\n  The day after the United announcement, other airlines followed suit. \nAmerican Eagle, USAirways Express, Continental Express, TWA, Delta, and \nNorthwest all curtailed their service to Arkansas as well. Most of \nthese airlines only reduced their schedules, but it is still enough to \nlimit the options for transportation in and out of Arkansas. These cuts \nare a blow to the economic well-being of rural States. How\n\n[[Page S10147]]\n\ncan rural economies ever grow if we don't maintain transportation to \nthose States?\n  When the airline stabilization bill came before the Senate, there \nwere several legitimate reasons for us to support it. In the aftermath \nof the September 11 attacks, the federal government had shut down the \nairlines for nearly three days, dealing a serious blow to their \nrevenues. Furthermore, once the planes were in the air again, the \nairlines suffered a significant decline in passengers. When we passed \nthe bill, we were looking to ease the blow of the shutdown and \nsubsequent decline in ridership.\n  Now that I see how the commercial airlines are going to treat small- \nand mid-sized markets and rural States, it is clear to me that we may \nhave rushed the airline stabilization package. Certainly, if I had \nknown that the airlines were simply going to take the money and then \nannounce they would no longer serve my constituents, I might have \nthought again about the vote I cast in favor of that package.\n  I have contacted the Secretary of Transportation to express my \nconcerns and ask for a full review of these scheduled service \nreductions. I hope that my colleagues will join me in requesting this \nreview, to ensure that the American people are getting a fair return on \nthe investment they have made in the airline industry.\n  Perhaps the great lesson of the airline stabilization package is \nthat, if we are going to enact policy to build and strengthen our \neconomy, we need to have adequate discussion and debate to ensure that \nthe policies are effective, constructive, and broad-based. In the \ncoming weeks and months, as we take up other matters of economic \npolicy, funding for defense and national security, and agricultural \npolicy, let's take care to consider the ramifications and the realities \nof what we're dealing with so that we can do what's best for our entire \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10147-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DEFENSE NATIONAL STOCKPILE\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, I am pleased to join the Chairman and \nour colleagues from the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator \nCollins, and Senator Hutchinson, in a colloquy on the forest products \nindustry and the release of materials from the Defense National \nStockpile that poses a potential threat to this industry.\n  The forest products industry is an important industry for our Nation, \nand for my own State of Georgia as well. It is important in the sense \nthat it provides materials critical to our way of life, and also \nbecause it employs a large number of our fellow citizens. It is an \nindustry that reaches into a large number of States. Any process \nundertaken by a branch of our Federal Government that would harm the \nforest products industry would, therefore, be likely to draw the \nattention and the immediate response of this Congress. I certainly \nwould seek to participate in such a response, and to engender the \ngreatest possible support among my colleagues.\n  We have been faced in recent weeks with the prospect that the sale or \nother release of sebacic acid, a lubricant and plasticizer made by the \nforest product industry, by the Defense National Stockpile might result \nin the harmful depression of the sebacic acid market and thereby harm \nthe forest products industry. I have been following this matter \nclosely. My staff coordinated a meeting between the officials \nresponsible for the Defense National Stockpile and representatives of \nthe industry, in the hopes that such a meeting and negotiation would \nresolve any potential problems associated with the authority for \nFederal sebacic acid release. The officials responsible for the \nstockpile assured me that the current authorization for release of \nsebacic acid was not excessive and that the release would be gauged so \nas not to have a negative impact on the price of sebacic acid. These \nassurances were made while acknowledging the release of an additional \n400,000 pounds of acid, which I understand was needed this year in \norder to make up for the mismanagement of the contracting process for \nlast year's stockpile release.\n  The forest products industry in Georgia and, indeed, across the \ncountry is highly concerned with this year's proposed release, and has \nrequested that Congress restrict the authorization to release material \nfrom the stockpile. Having received assurances from the officials \nmanaging the stockpile release, along with their request that we avoid \nlegislation affecting the annual authorization to release sebacic acid, \nI am here today to serve notice that I will closely follow the scope \nand effect of any sebacic acid release over the next year. If the \nrelease has a negative effect on the market for sebacic acid, I will \nvigorously pursue legislation in the next authorization bill to curtail \nfuture releases of sebacic acid.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator. As does the Senator from Georgia, I \nview this matter as one of national importance, deriving from the \npolicies of the Department of Defense, which fall within the oversight \nof our Committee. I also share his concerns because, as does he and \nmany of our colleagues, I have constituents who depend on the forest \nproducts industry for their livelihood.\n  I am also pleased that we have agreed to this colloquy as a \nbipartisan expression of our mutual concern over the current Department \nof Defense release authority for sebacic acid. Having taken this \nmeasured step this year, I will monitor the impact of Department of \nDefense sebacic acid release on the market, and will be ready to join \nmy colleagues in taking legislative action as required.\n  The fact that an additional amount of acid is being released now, due \nto the acknowledged contracting miscues on the part of Department of \nDefense officials last year, is a further indication that we must be \nprepared to act in our oversight role to restrict future releases of \nsebacic acid. The horrible acts of terrorism that befell us on \nSeptember 11 have had an effect on our economy. I believe the \nDepartment must take current economic conditions into account as it \nimplements its releases of sebacic acid over the coming year.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank my good friend from Maine, Senator Collins, \nand our distinguished colleagues from the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. I need not tell them that the forest products industry is an \nimportant industry in Arkansas. I will stand with you, if it becomes \nnecessary, to restrict the Department of Defense authorization for \nrelease of sebacic acid. I know that we will be joined by many others, \non both sides of the aisle. It is easy to see that the impact of this \nissue has the potential to affect the quality of life of working \nAmericans across any number of states. I find it reassuring that our \nCommittee is making such a strong statement of our intention to act if \nnecessary. Our restraint this year demonstrates the trust we place in \nthe Department of Defense to act reasonably within the scope of current \nlegislative language. But that restraint will turn to resolve if the \nrelease of sebacic acid under the current authority proves harmful to \nthe sebacic acid market.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I appreciate the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Cleland, \nbringing this issue to my attention. I also appreciate the fact that \nthe Senators from Georgia, Maine, and Arkansas have sought a colloquy \non this issue to avoid offering an amendment to the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 and thereby slowing its passage \nin this time of crisis. The current law requires the Department of \nDefense to ensure that its sales of excess materials from the National \nDefense Stockpile do not adversely affect the markets for those \nmaterials. It is especially important in our current economic situation \nthat the Department not take actions that would harm the private \nsector. I fully expect that the Department will comply with the law and \nact prudently in this regard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10147-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10147-S10148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AMERICA: `BACK ON THE JOB'\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I would like to recognize \nthe tremendous outpouring of solidarity and support from America's \ncitizens in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks. The \nnation's collective reaction to the horror of that day has been one of \ncompassion and focused determination. I am pleased, not just with the \nresponse from our elected officials and our opinion-makers, but with \nall of our citizens across the country who have shown such courage in \nthe face of adversity.\n  In an outcome that has surely flummoxed the mastermind of this\n\n[[Page S10148]]\n\ntragedy, a reality has emerged: America is still strong and, because of \nthis tragedy, America ultimately will be even stronger.\n  There is no firmer support for this belief than the way in which \nAmericans have worked, as directed by our Commander-in-Chief, to get \nback to the demands of our daily schedules. The best civilian offense \nin the aftermath of these attacks is not to cower to fears of future \nattacks, but instead to quickly `get back on the job' and resume our \nroutines. To that end, our nation has been constructing an effective \nand forceful civilian offense. But we can still do more.\n  I have come to the floor today to encourage the continuation of \ndebate--specifically here in the Senate--on issues critical to our \nnational security. A return to such a dialogue should not be frowned \nupon or considered as a sign of splintered resolve, but rather as proof \nthat America and her values are alive and well.\n  I commend President Bush and his advisors for their efforts thus far \nin preparing our minds and our military for the long battle we've \nundertaken. Our leaders, both civil and military, have built a \ncoalition of nations sharing in our objective to thwart terrorist \nactivity around the globe. We've sent a clear message to our friends, \nand they have responded with strong support.\n  And just this morning, we've communicated another message. By \nannouncing our intent to reopen National Airport, we're telling not \nonly friends, but the whole world, that we Americans will not live in \nfear within our own borders. I am pleased with President Bush's \nannouncement. Now that added security measures have been implemented, I \nagree with him: It's time to unlock the symbolic front door to our \nnation's capital and re-affirm our commitment to get back to business.\n  That determination to get back to business is evident, not just at \nNational, but at airports across the country. We have increased \nsecurity measures at all airports, which in turn, have increased our \nsense that freedom has triumphed fear.\n  It's important to recognize, though, that the lack of convenience \nresulting from increased security measures cannot, and should not, be \nmisconstrued as a loss of liberty. Let us not confuse the longer lines \nat airports and the time-consuming luggage screenings as threats to \nliberty; instead, consider these measures as threats to terrorism.\n  We are witnessing America's most important moment, and we are meeting \nthe challenge with dignity and pride. With the events of September 11, \ntyranny has tried to mute the freedom that rings throughout our nation. \nWe have defeated similar efforts in the past, and we will defeat them \nagain. As long as we stand unified and stand strong, our spirit will \nnever be silenced.\n  The solidarity shown at the different levels of government of the \npast few weeks, within the various agencies, and across party lines has \nbeen unwavering. Here in the Senate, we swiftly approved legislation to \nprovide $40 billion toward the recovery effort and to help finance the \nretaliation measures currently being developed by the U.S. Military \nunder the direction of the President. In addition, we approved a \nresolution authorizing the use of force in response to the unwarranted \nattacks. Without question, this unity is an extraordinary asset for a \ncountry poised to wage an assault on terrorism.\n\n  A few weeks ago, at Yankee Stadium in New York, and earlier at the \nNational Cathedral in Washington, DC, thousands of people--Muslims, \nJews, Hindus, Christians--people of all faiths--came together and \nhonored and remembered the fallen heroes, the innocent lives, and the \nbright futures claimed by terrorism. At these services, and at services \nacross the country and in my home state of Nebraska, people revived \ntheir spirits and their faith in democracy.\n  These gatherings are visual displays of unity signaling that America \nis on the mend. Sure, for some of us, it may not ever feel like \n'business as usual' again, or at least for awhile, life in America may \nfeel more like business as `unusual.' Nonetheless, it is important for \nwe policymakers to get back to work, including debate and discussion of \nall these issues. Such action will help ensure the continued viability \nof democracy and the continued vitality of the United States of \nAmerica. After all, lockstep agreement among policymakers is not an \nAmerican ideal. The free exchange of ideas, which helped America \nflourish, was the terrorists' true target on September 11. The \nterrorists, who likely don't even understand the true meaning of \nfreedom, loathe America's system of government, her ideals and her \nliberty.\n  In response, we must show the world how the American government will \ncarry on, that the people will continue to have their say, and that \ndebate will still be the prelude to unity--and not the construct of \nobstruction.\n  To be clear, I am not saying we, as a nation, will no longer be \nunified in this effort to combat terrorism. I am simply saying that we \nall need to actively participate in developing, not simply rubber-\nstamping, policy.\n  As a legislative body, we can return to the comparatively mundane \nand, consequently, more polarizing issues without losing sight of our \nresolve to fight terrorism. By doing so, we will not have swayed our \nnational values to placate forces of evil.\n  Yes, in times of tragedy, it is imperative to find a common bond to \nbring our nation together. But, as we heal our wounds, we must give all \npeople, on all sides of an issue, a chance to be heard. After all, \ndemocracy is the healthiest alternative to war. Our weapons are words, \nand our nation's internal battles are fought on the grounds of the \nConstitution, rather than on the grounds of the combat zone.\n  I do not believe in the bitter partisanship that has, at times, \ncharacterized our nation, but I do believe that debate is critical to a \nstrong democracy. Freedom of expression is fundamental to life in \nAmerica and, by extension, to healthy debate here in Congress. We in \nthe Senate are free to speak our minds and hearts. And as a result of \nthat freedom, we need to freely come together and return to `normal' \ndebate empowered by the Constitution. Then, and only then, we will have \nsuccessfully given back to the country that has given so much to each \nof us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10148-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10148-S10149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      MAJOR GENERAL EDWARD SORIANO\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I rise today to honor a great \nmilitary leader, MG Edward Soriano, the outgoing commanding general of \n7th Infantry and Fort Carson, CO. Major General Campbell will assume \ncommand and General Soriano will be moving on to greater \nresponsibilities. As he and his wife Vivian depart Ft. Carson, they \nleave with a record of outstanding public service and numerous \nsignificant accomplishments.\n  Among these accomplishments is the Army's first housing privatization \nproject. This project has been a major success, is ahead of schedule, \nand is now a model for military installations throughout the country. \nAdditionally, General Soriano has overseen numerous successful \ndeployments of units, including the deployment of the 3rd Armored \nCavalry Regiment to Bosnia. Now, as our military forces conduct the war \non terrorism, it is evident that the service members and their families \nof Ft. Carson will benefit greatly from his work.\n  His efforts to improve the readiness and capability of Ft. Carson and \nits units has met with great success and will have a long lasting and \nsignificant positive impact on the soldiers and civilians who live and \nwork there. Furthermore he has ensured that Ft. Carson will provide our \nPresident and Secretary of Defense a first class platform from which to \ndeploy military power.\n  General Soriano has done his excellent work on the facilities at Ft. \nCarson, despite funding shortfalls. His most significant achievement, \nhowever, has been in preparing the war fighting capability of its \npeople. The soldiers and civilians at Ft. Carson are among the best in \nthe Army, and are proven performers. Any venture managed by the men and \nwomen of ``The Mountain Post'' will certainly meet with success.\n  Finally, General Soriano and his wife have developed and nurtured an \noutstanding working relationship with the people of Colorado Springs, \nsurrounding local communities, and the\n\n[[Page S10149]]\n\nnearby Air Force Bases. They will be sorely missed, but they leave an \norganization committed to the pursuit of excellence. I wish him good \nluck and God speed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10149-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMENDING WILLIAM F.

He also served the State as its representative on the \nnational board of the Independent Insurance Agents of America.\n  Bill was elected to IIAA's Executive Committee in 1995, and became \nits president last fall. He has worked effectively through the IIAA to \nstrengthen the competitive standing of independent insurance agents by \nhelping to provide the support they need to run more successful \nbusinesses. He served as chairman of IIAA's Education Committee for \nfour years, and in 1994 he received a Presidential Citation for his \nwork in this area.\n  For many years, Bill has also been an active and concerned member of \nhis community. He served as president and as a member the Board of \nDirectors for the Boston Children's Service, and has been active in the \nBelmont Youth Basketball program. He served as chairman of the Belmont \nRed Cross, and as treasurer for the Belmont Religious Council.

Madam President, I rise today to enter into the \nRecord a proclamation signed by the Governor of the State of Idaho.\n  Rapid population growth and urbanization have become catalysts for \nmany serious environmental impacts and they apply substantial pressures \non many facets of our infrastructure. These pressures often result in \ntransportation, health, sanitation, and public safety problems, making \nurbanization an issue that cannot be ignored.\n  It is, therefore, important for us to recognize the problems \nassociated with rapid population growth and urbanization. The Governor \nof the State of Idaho has proclaimed the week of October 21-27, 2001, \nas World Population Awareness Week in my State. I would like to commend \nthe Governor for his commitment to this issue.\n  I ask that the proclamation be printed in the Record.\n  The proclamation follows:\n\n                              Proclamation\n\n       Whereas, the world population stands today at more than 6.1 \n     billion and increases by some one billion every 13 years; and\n       Whereas, the most significant feature of the 20th century \n     phenomenon of unprecedented world population growth was rapid \n     urbanization; and\n       Whereas, cities and urban areas today occupy only 2% of the \n     earth's land, but contain 50% of its population and consume \n     75% of its resources; and\n       Whereas, the most rapid urban growth over the next two \n     decades is expected in cities with populations ranging from \n     250,000 to one million; and\n       Whereas, along with the advantages and amenities, the rapid \n     growth of cities leads to substantial pressure on their \n     infrastructure, manifested in security, health and crime \n     problems, as well as deterring the provision of basic social \n     services; and\n       Whereas, in the interest of national and environmental \n     security, nations must redouble voluntary and humanitarian \n     efforts to stabilize their population growth at sustainable \n     levels, while at all times respecting the cultural and \n     religious beliefs and values of their citizens; and\n       Whereas, World Population Awareness Week was proclaimed \n     last year by Governors of 32 states, as well as Mayors of \n     more than 315 United States cities, and co-sponsored by 231 \n     organizations in 63 countries; and\n       Whereas, the theme of World Population Awareness Week in \n     2001 is ``Population and the Urban Future'';\n       Now Therefore, I, Dirk Kempthorne, Governor of the State of \n     Idaho, do hereby proclaim the week of October 21 through 27, \n     2001, to be World Population Awareness Week in Idaho and urge \n     all citizens of our state to take cognizance of this event \n     and to participate appropriately in its observance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10149-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10149-S10150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SPINA BIFIDA AWARENESS MONTH\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President. I rise today to alert my \ncolleagues that October is Spina Bifida Awareness month.\n  Many Americans don't know much about Spina Bifida. For instance, most \ndon't know Spina Bifida is a neural tube defect and occurs when the \ncentral nervous system does not properly close during the early stages \nof a child's development in the womb. Even fewer American's realize \nthat the most severe form of Spina Bifida occurs in 96 percent of \nchildren born with this disease. However, thanks to the good work that \nthe Spina Bifida Association of America is carrying out to promote the \nprevention of Spina Bifida and to enhance the lives of all affected by \nthis condition, we are all learning more every day.\n  During the month of October the Association makes a special push to \nincrease public awareness about Spina Bifida, and future parents about \nprevention. Simply by taking a daily dose of the B vitamin, folic acid, \nfound in most multivitamins women of childbearing age have the power to \nreduce the incidence of Spina Bifida by up to 75 percent. That such a \nsimple change in habit can have such a profound effect should leave no \nquestion as to the importance of awareness.\n  However, awareness is not the only important work done by the Spina \nBifida Association of America. The Association was founded in 1973 to \naddress the needs of the Spina Bifida community and is currently the \nonly national organization solely dedicated to advocating on behalf of \nthe Spina Bifida community. There are more than 60 chapters serving \nover 100 communities nationwide.\n  One such chapter in Wichita, KS, was started by Tammy and Tim Wolke. \nTammy and Tim have four children, two of whom are adopted. Not only do \nthese heroic parents care for one child born with Spina Bifida, but \nalso a child with cerebral palsy. But caring for their own children \njust hasn't been enough to keep Tammy and Tim busy. So, in their ``free \ntime,'' the Wolkes have developed and cultivated a chapter of the Spina \nBifida Association of America which serves about 200 families in their \npart of Kansas.\n  As we discuss the wonderful work of the Spina Bifida Association of \nAmerica and the Wolkes, I would be remiss if I failed to mention \nanother great Kansan. In 1988, the Association established a \nscholarship fund to enhance opportunities for individuals with Spina \nBifida to achieve their full potential through higher education. This \nyear's four year scholarship of $20,000 was recently awarded to \nJennifer Maxton of Derby, KS. Thanks to this scholarship, Jennifer will \nbe able to attend the school of her dreams at the University of Kansas. \nJennifer is a truly amazing person who wants to become a pediatric \nsurgeon and study abroad in Nepal. As if those goals weren't lofty \nenough, Jennifer hopes to some day climb Mount Everest. Jennifer wants \nto improve the lives of others who have not been as fortunate as she. \nThis scholarship will start her down this path. I wish her the best of \nluck as she begins her academic life this fall as a Jayhawk.\n  I would also be remiss if I failed to mention that this evening, the \nSpina Bifida Association of America will be holding its 13th annual \nevent to benefit the Association and its work in local communities \naround the country. Washington Post Sports columnist, Tony Kornheiser \nwill be roasted at this event by a number of distinguished members of \nthe Washington community, including our Congressional colleagues \nSenator Clinton and Representative Steve Largent. I regret that I will \nbe unable to join my friends\n\n[[Page S10150]]\n\ntonight, but wish to commend the Association for all of its hard work \nto prevent and reduce suffering from this birth defect and to improve \nthe lives of those 70,000 individuals living with Spina Bifida \nthroughout our Nation. I wish the Spina Bifida Association of America \nthe best of luck in its endeavors and urge all of my colleagues and all \nAmericans to support its important efforts.\n  God bless the Spina Bifida Association and God bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10150-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COMMANDER RONALD JAMES VAUK\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute to a \nwonderful man, Lieutenant Commander Ronald James Vauk, whose life was \ncut short on September 11, 2001, while he was doing what he loved to \ndo, serving his country. He was a Reservist on duty as Watch Commander \nat the Naval Command Center when terrorists attacked the Pentagon in \nWashington, D.C. This tragedy was not only a savage blow to the United \nStates, but will forever be remembered in the hearts and minds of a \nloving family, a strong Idaho community, and many loyal friends.\n  Ron was a devoted husband and good father who was born to Dorothy and \nHubert Vauk and raised in Nampa, ID. He was the youngest of nine \nchildren and attended St. Paul's Catholic School and Nampa High School, \ngraduating in 1982. I had the pleasure of recommending Ron for an \nappointment to the United States Naval Academy after he served a year \nas an enlisted sailor. He graduated the Naval Academy in 1987 and \nmarried an incredible young women by the name of Jennifer Mooney. Ron \nhad an exemplary career as a Naval Officer and submariner, serving on \nboth the USS Glenard P. Lipscomb and the USS Oklahoma City. His love \nfor the Navy continued with his service as a Reservist and a project \nmanager for the Delex Corporation and then as an assistant group \nsupervisor in submarine technology for the Johns Hopkins University \nApplied Physics Laboratory. Ron's work at Johns Hopkins was extremely \nimportant, but he was always ready to serve our Nation as a Naval \nReserve Officer whenever called upon. He was a quiet genius who wasn't \nafraid to work hard to get the job done. And, he was a very good man \nwho loved his family and was devoted to his wife Jennifer and their \npride and joy, Liam, who is almost four years old. The entire family is \nexcited and looking forward to the upcoming birth of Ron and Jennifer's \nsecond child, expected in November.\n  Ron will also be sorely missed by his parents, Dorothy and Hubert, \nand their eight other grown children. Ron's brothers and sisters all \ncame together to be with Jennifer and son Liam at their home in Mt. \nAiry, MD. They are Charles Vauk, of Boise, Teri and Bill Masterson, \nCarson City, NV; Celia and Ken Shikuma, Huntington Beach, CA; David and \nSuzie Vauk, Nampa; Lynne and Alan Caba, Nampa; Gary and Julie Vauk, \nGrapevine, TX; Patricia Vauk and Paul Wilson, Minneapolis, MN; and \nDennis and Donna Vauk, Houston, TX. Ron is also survived by his father \nand mother-in-law Patrick and Carol Mooney of Baltimore, and sister and \nbrother-in-law Alissa and Chris DeBoy of Mt. Airy, MD, and 18 nieces \nand nephews. I know I speak for all my colleagues in the Senate in \nexpressing my profound sorrow to the Vauk family for their loss.\n  LCDR Ronald James Vauk was awarded the Purple Heart in the name of \nthe United States President for his ultimate sacrifice. General George \nWashington, this Nation's Founding Father, established the Badge of \nMilitary Merit in 1782 as a means of recognizing courage and \nsteadfastness in actual combat against the enemies of our Country. From \nthe original three Badges of Military Merit awarded by General \nWashington, we now have the Purple Heart. LCDR Vauk was one of the \nfirst casualties of the War on Terrorism. Rest assured, this war will \nbe won and the United States will continue to lead the world in \nprotecting freedom. Ron was at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, \nbecause he was bravely doing what he believed in and what needed to be \ndone. He was a thorough professional who believed in his country and \nhis duties as a Naval Officer.\n  On Monday I visited Jennifer, Liam and members of the Vauk family. \nJennifer is a remarkable woman, who bears the burden of this tragedy \nwith tremendous grace and dignity. I am very proud to recognize LDCR \nRonald Vauk and tell him and his family, Thank you from a grateful \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10150-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10150-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10150-4", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10150-S10151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:58 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 169.

Richard B. Cheney,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Vice President: There is transmitted herewith a \n     draft bill, the ``Veterans' Benefits Act of 2001,'' to \n     authorize a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for fiscal year \n     (FY) 2002 in the rates of disability compensation and \n     dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC), to make \n     modifications in the veterans home loan guaranty program, to \n     make permanent certain temporary authorities, and for other \n     purposes. All of the bill's provisions are in support of the \n     President's FY 2002 budget request for the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs (VA). I request that this bill be referred \n     to the appropriate committee for prompt consideration and \n     enactment.\n     Compensation and DIC COLA\n       Section 101 of the draft bill would direct the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs to increase administratively the rates of \n     compensation for service-disabled veterans and of DIC for the \n     survivors of veterans whose deaths are service related, \n     effective December 1, 2001. As provided in the President's FY \n     2002 budget request, the rate of increase would be the same \n     as the COLA that will be provided under current law to \n     veterans' pension and Social Security recipients, which is \n     currently estimated to be 2.5 percent. We estimate that \n     enactment of this section would cost $376 million during FY \n     2002, $7.1 billion over the period FYs 2002-2006 and $27.6 \n     billion over the period FYs 2002-2011. Although this section \n     is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA), the paygo \n     effect would be zero because OBRA requires that the full \n     compensation COLA be assumed in the baseline. We believe this \n     proposed COLA is necessary and appropriate in order to \n     protect the benefits of affected veterans and their survivors \n     from the eroding effects of inflation. These worthy \n     beneficiaries deserve no less.\n       Section 102 of the draft bill would amend 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1104(a) and 1303(a), respectively, to provide that, \n     in calculating the cost-of-living adjustment in the rates of \n     disability compensation and dependency and indemnity \n     compensation pursuant to the enactment of authorizing \n     legislation governing payment of benefits in FY 2002 and \n     thereafter, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall round \n     down to the next lower whole dollar any rate that is not \n     evenly divisible by one dollar. Currently, section 1104(a) \n     requires the Secretary to utilize this round-down \n     calculation method during FYs 1998 through 2002. This \n     requirement was added by Public Law No. 105-33, \n     Sec. 8031(a)(1), 111 Stat. 251, 668 (1997). This section \n     was renumbered (from 1103 to 1104) by Public Law No. 105-\n     368, Sec. 1005(a), 112 Stat. 3315, 3364 (1998). Section \n     102 is subject to the PAYGO requirement of OBRA. Enactment \n     of this section would result in no cost savings in FY \n     2002, but would result in savings of $14.5 million in FY \n     2003, $196 million over the period FYs 2002-2006 and $996 \n     million over the period FYs 2002-2011.\n     Housing Loans\n       Section 201 of the draft bill would terminate, effective \n     October 1, 2001, the authority of the Secretary to provide \n     financing in connection with the sale of a single-family home \n     acquired by (VA) following the foreclosure of a loan \n     guaranteed or made by VA. Such financing is commonly referred \n     to as a ``vendee loan.'' After that date, purchasers of VA-\n     owned properties would need to obtain financing from private \n     lenders. Vendee loans are not a veterans benefit. Currently, \n     all members of the public may purchase VA-owned homes and \n     obtain vendee financing. Veterans receive a very limited \n     preference with regard to purchasing such properties.\n       Subsection (a) would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 3733 to terminate \n     vendee loans effective October 1, 2001, except with respect \n     to properties for which VA accepted a purchase before such \n     date.\n       Subsection (b) would make a conforming amendment to 38 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 3720 regarding the powers of the Secretary to \n     dispose of property acquired under the housing loan program.\n       Section 201 is subject to the PAYGO requirement of OBRA. \n     Enactment of this section would result in a cost of $18 \n     million in FY 2002, and then savings of $50 million over the \n     period FYs 2002-2006 and savings of $227 million over the \n     period FYs 2002-2011.\n       Section 202 of the draft bill would make permanent the \n     increases in the fees collected from most veterans obtaining \n     or assuming a loan guaranteed, insured, or made by VA. These \n     increases were originally enacted by the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93). OBRA '93 increased the \n     fees for most VA guaranteed housing loans by 75 basis points, \n     or 0.75 percent of the loan amount, and established a fee of \n     3 percent of the loan amount on veterans who obtain a second \n     no-downpayment loan under the VA program. The increased fees \n     are now set to expire on September 30, 2008.\n       Section 202 is subject to the PAYGO requirement of OBRA. \n     The enactment of section 202 would not result in cost savings \n     until FY 2009. In FY 2009, cost savings would be $275 \n     million, and cost savings for the period FYs 2002-2011 would \n     be $841 million.\n       Section 203 would make permanent the VA ``no-bid formula'' \n     contained in 38 U.S.C. Sec. 3732(c). This formula determines \n     VA's liability to a loan holder under the guaranty and \n     whether or not the holder would have the election to convey \n     the property to VA following the foreclosure. As amended by \n     OBRA '93, the no-bid formula requires VA to consider, in \n     addition to other costs, VA's loss on the resale of the \n     property. The no-bid formula currently applies to all loans \n     closed before October 1, 2008.\n       Section 203 is subject to the PAYGO requirement of OBRA. \n     The enactment of section 203 would not result in cost savings \n     until FY 2009. In FY 2009, $23 million would be saved as a \n     result of enactment of this section. Total savings from FYs \n     2002-2011 would be $2 million.\n     Extension of Temporary Authorities\n       Section 301 of the draft bill would amend 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 5317 and 26 U.S.C. Sec. 6103, respectively, to \n     permanently authorize VA to verify the eligibility of \n     recipients of, or applicants for, VA's needs-based programs \n     through data matching with the Internal Revenue Service and \n     the Social Security Administration. VA's authority under 38 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 5317 expires on September 30, 2008. However, \n     authority under the Internal Revenue Code for this data \n     matching expires on September 30, 2003. This section is \n     subject to the PAYGO requirement of OBRA. Enactment of this \n     section would result in cost savings of $6 million in FY \n     2004, and would result in cumulative cost savings of $18 \n     million for the period FYs 2002-2006 and $48 million for the \n     period FYs 2002-2011.\n       Section 302 of the draft bill would make permanent the $90 \n     limitation on monthly VA pension payments that may be made to \n     beneficiaries, without dependents, who are receiving \n     Medicaid-covered nursing-home care by removing the existing \n     September 30, 2008, expiration date set forth in 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 5503(f). By reducing pension income, this provision \n     reduces beneficiaries' share of their nursing home expenses. \n     State Medicaid programs pay the difference, with a percentage \n     of their expenditures reimbursed by the Federal government. \n     This section is subject to the PAYGO requirement of OBRA. \n     While section 302 would maintain higher State and Federal \n     Medicaid costs, enactment of this section would result in VA \n     cost savings of $527 million in FY 2009. VA cost savings for \n     the period FYs 2002-2011 would be $1.6 billion.\n       Section 303(a) would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1710(f)(2)(B) to \n     make permanent a requirement that veterans eligible for \n     health care under 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1710(a)(3) pay a copayment \n     of $10 for each day they receive VA hospital care. The \n     requirement that veterans pay the copayment expires on \n     September 30, 2002. Section 303(a) would also extend the \n     current $5 copayment for each day a veteran receives nursing \n     home care. However, that $5 copayment will continue only \n     until such time that VA publishes final regulations \n     establishing a new copayment for nursing home care in \n     accordance with requirements of 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1710B, a new \n     provision added to title 38 by the Millennium Health Care and \n     Benefits Act, Public Law No. 106-117. This section is subject \n     to the PAYGO requirement of OBRA; however, the PAYGO effect \n     would be zero because OBRA requires that collections be \n     assumed in the baseline. Enactment of this section would \n     result in continued collections of $8 million beginning in FY \n     2003. For FYs 2002-2006, the collections would total $40 \n     million. For the period FYs 2002-2011, total collections \n     would be $80 million.\n       Subsection (b) would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1722A to make \n     permanent a requirement that certain veterans pay VA a \n     copayment for each 30-day supply of medication that they \n     receive on an outpatient basis. The requirement that veterans \n     pay the copayment expires on September 30, 2002. The \n     copayment amount is currently $2 for each prescription, but \n     section 1722A contains provisions allowing VA to increase the \n     copayment\n\n[[Page S10158]]\n\n     amount and VA is likely to increase the amount during FT \n     2002. This section is subject to the PAYGO requirement of \n     OBRA; however, the PAYGO effect would be zero because OBRA \n     requires that collections be assumed in the baseline. \n     Assuming continuation of only a $2 copayment, enactment of \n     this section would result in collections of $100 million in \n     FY 2003, $500 million over the period FYs 2002-2006, and $1 \n     billion over the period FYs 2002-2011. In addition, enactment \n     of this section would allow VA to implement the provision of \n     the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act \n     increasing co-payments, which would result in collections of \n     $268 million in FY 2003.\n       Section 304 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1729(a)(2)(E) to \n     permanently authorize VA to collect from third-party private \n     insurers for care VA provides to insured service-connected \n     veterans for their nonservice-connected disabilities. Under \n     existing law, the authority to collect from insurers expires \n     on September 30, 2002. This section is subject to the PAYGO \n     requirement of OBRA; however, the PAYGO effect would be zero \n     because OBRA requires that collections be assumed in the \n     baseline. Enactment of this section would result in \n     collections of $591 million in FY 2003. It would result in \n     collections of $2.5 billion for the period FYs 2002-2006 and \n     $5.9 billion over the period FYs 2002-2011.\n       Because this draft bill would affect direct spending and \n     receipts, it is subject to the PAYGO requirement of OBRA. The \n     Office of Management and Budget estimates that the provisions \n     authorized by this draft bill would result in a total PAYGO \n     cost of $19 million for FY 2002, but a PAYGO savings of $265 \n     million for FYs 2002-2006, and $2.6 billion for FYs 2002-\n     2011.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the submission of this legislative \n     proposal to the Congress, and that its enactment would be in \n     accord with the program of the President.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                              Anthony J.

A bill to provide for the establishment and implementation \nof a fingerprint processing system to be used whenever a visa is issued \nto an alien; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to introduce three bills \nthat will provide our first line of defense, our Consular Officers at \nour embassies and INS Inspectors at our ports-of-entry, with the \nresources and information they need to determine whether to grant a \nforeign national a visa or permit them entry to the United States. They \nare: The Terrorist Lookout Committee Act, the Visa Fingerprinting Act, \nand the Information Sharing to Strengthen America's Security Act.\n  I saw firsthand the consequences of serious inadequacies in \ncoordination and communication during my twelve years as ranking member \nof the House Foreign Affairs International Operations Subcommittee and \nchair of the International Operations Subcommittee of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. It was this lack of coordination that \npermitted the radical Egyptian Sheik Rahman, the mastermind of the 1993 \nWorld Trade Center bombing, to enter and exit the U.S. five times \nunimpeded even after he was put on the State Department's Lookout List \nin 1987, and allowed him to get permanent residence status by the INS \neven after the State Department issued a certification of visa \nrevocation.\n  These bills are an essential step toward removing a vulnerability in \nour national security that has continued through the years. For \nexample, the Inman report of 1984, which was commissioned by Secretary \nShultz after three terrorist attacks against the U.S. Embassy and \nmarines in Lebanon in 1983 and 1984, found that coordination between \nagencies must be improved. After the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in \nKenya and Tanzania, the Accountability Review Board, a board which is \nrequired by law to make findings and recommendations upon the loss of \nlife or property, made a recommendation that the FBI and State \nDepartment should improve their information sharing on terrorism. The \n2000 National Commission on Terrorism also recommended that the FBI \nshould establish a cadre of reports officers to distill and disseminate \nterrorism-related information once it is collected.\n  While intelligence is frequently exchanged, no law requires law \nenforcement and intelligence agencies to share information on dangerous \naliens with the State Department. The information sharing that does \noccur among agencies is done on a voluntary basis. Accordingly, the \nfirst bill I am introducing, the Information Sharing to Strengthen \nAmerica's Security Act, requires all U.S. law enforcement agencies and \nthe intelligence community to share information on foreign nationals \nwith the State Department so that visas can be granted with the \nassurance that the sum total of the U.S. government has no knowledge \nwhy an alien should not be granted a visa to travel to the U.S.\n  This bill increases the information sharing among our law enforcement \nagencies, our intelligence community, and the State Department, so that \nforeign nationals who are known by any entity of the U.S. Government to \nbe associated with, or members of, terrorist organizations are denied a \nvisa. This includes the FBI, DEA, INS, Customs, CIA and the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, DIA, all vital agencies in the war on terrorism.\n  The second bill I am introducing--the Terrorist Lookout Committee \nAct, builds on the Information Sharing to Strengthen America's Security \nAct by requiring a Terrorist Lookout Committee to be established in \nevery one of our embassies. This committee, which would be chaired by \nthe Deputy Chief of Mission, will be comprised of the senior \nrepresentatives of all law enforcement agencies and the intelligence \ncommunity. The purpose of the mandated monthly meeting is to provide a \nforum for these officials to add names to the State Department's \nConsular Lookout and Support System, CLASS, of those who are considered \ndangerous aliens and, if they applied for a visa, should undergo a \nthorough review and possible denial of the visa.\n  If no names are submitted to the list then the chair is required to \ncertify, subject to an Accountability Review Board, that no member had \nknowledge of any name that should be included. This requirement will \nelevate awareness of, and focus constant attention on, the necessity of \nmaintaining the most accurate and current information possible. \nFinally, quarterly reports by the Secretary of State are to be \nsubmitted to the House International Relations Committee and the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee.\n  To ensure that the foreign national who received the visa from our \nEmbassy is the same person using it to enter the United States, I have \nintroduced the Visa Fingerprinting Act. This bill requires the \nSecretary of State and the INS Commissioner to jointly establish and \nimplement a fingerprint-backed check system. Foreign nationals would be \nfingerprinted before a visa could be issued, with information \ncatalogued in a database accessible to Immigration officials. INS \nauthorities at port-of-entry would then be required to match \nfingerprint data with that of the foreign nationals seeking entry into \nthe U.S., with the INS certifying to the match before permitting entry. \nMy bill authorizes a one-time congressional expenditure to establish \nand implement the system, but the cost of operating the system would be \nfunded through an increase in the visa service charge required for each \nvisa.\n  The use of biometric technology such as fingerprint imaging, retinal \nand iris scans, and voice recognition, is no longer just a part of our \nscience-fiction movies, but has become a widely used means of identity \nverification. The U.S. Government uses it at military and secret \ninstallations for access to both information and the installations \nthemselves. Airports, such as Charlotte-Douglas International which \nutilizes iris scanning technology, have incorporated biometric \ntechnology to limit access to particular areas of the airport to \nauthorized personnel only.\n  Interestingly, the INS already started down this road when, in 1998, \nit began to issue biometric crossing cards to Mexicans who cross the \nborder frequently.

In America's \nwar on terrorism, we can do no less.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 1493. A bill to forgive interest payments for a 2-year period on \ncertain disaster loans to small business concerns in the aftermath of \nthe terrorist attacks perpetrated against the United States on \nSeptember 11, 2001, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nprovide tax relief for small business concerns, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the ``Small \nBusiness Leads to Economic Recovery Act of 2001.'' The senseless \nterrorist attacks of September 11th have dealt a severe blow to the \nNation and to our already struggling economy. The Small Business \nAdministration estimates that 14,000 small businesses are within the \ndisaster area in New York alone. These businesses clearly have been \ndirectly affected by this national disaster. But the economic impact \ndoes not stop there. For months small enterprises and self-employed \nindividuals across the country have been struggling with the slowing \neconomy. The recent terrorist attacks makes their situation even more \ndire.\n  In light of these events, the increasing calls from the small \nbusiness community for economic stimulus legislation have \nunderstandably increased. As the Ranking Member of the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I receive on a daily basis pleas \nfor help from small business in Missouri and across the Nation: small \nrestaurants who have lost much of their business due to the fall off in \nbusiness travel; local flight schools that have been grounded as a \nresult of the recent terrorist attacks; and Main Street retailers who \nare struggling to survive in the slowing economy. Clearly, we must act \nand act soon.\n  In response to these urgent calls for help, I have prepared the Small \nBusiness Leads to Economic Recovery Act of 2001, which is designed to \nprovide effective economic stimulus in three distinct but complementary \nways: increasing access to capital for the Nation's small enterprises; \nproviding tax relief and investment incentives for our small firms and \nthe self-employed; and directing one of the Nation's largest \nconsumers--the Federal Government--to shop with small business in \nAmerica.\n  When the Disaster Relief Program at the Small Business \nAdministration, SBA, was first established, the terrorist attack on New \nYork City and the Pentagon was hardly contemplated. Now that we as a \nNation are confronted with this nightmare, it is easy to see that are \ntraditional approach to disaster relief will not be helpful to the \nthousands of small businesses located at or around the World Trade \nCenter and the Pentagon.\n  In New York City, it may be a year or more before many of the small \nbusinesses destroyed or shut down by the terrorist attacks can reopen \ntheir doors for business. Small firms near the Pentagon, such as those \nat the Reagan National Airport or Crystal City, Virginia, are also shut \ndown or barely operating. And there are small businesses throughout the \nUnited States that have been shut down for national security concerns. \nFor example, General Aviation aircraft remain grounded, closing all \nflight schools and other small businesses dependent on single engine \naircraft.\n  Regular small business disaster loans fall short of providing \neffective disaster relief to help these small businesses. Therefore, my \nbill will allow small businesses to defer for up to two years repayment \nof principal and interest on their SBA disaster relief loans. Interest \nthat would otherwise accrue during the deferment period would be \nforgiven. It is my intention that this essential new ingredient will \nallow the small businesses to get back on their feet without \njeopardizing their credit or diving them into bankruptcy.\n  Small enterprises located in the presidentially declared disaster \nareas surrounding the World Trade Center and the Pentagon are not the \nonly business experiencing extreme hardship as the direct result of the \nterrorist attacks of September 11th. Nationwide, thousands of small \nbusinesses are unable to conduct business or are operating at a bare-\nminimum level. Tens of thousands of jobs are at risk of being lost as \nour nation's small businesses weather the fall out from the September \n11th attacks.\n  My bill provides a special financial tool to assist small businesses \nas they deal with these significant business disruptions. Small \nbusinesses in need of working capital would be able to obtain SBA-\nguaranteed ``Emergency Relief Loans'' from their banks to help them \nduring this period. Fees normally paid by the borrower to the SBA would \nbe eliminated, and the SBA would guarantee 95 percent of the loan. A \nkey feature of my bill is the authorization for the bank to defer \nrepayment of principal for up to one year.\n  My colleagues and I have been hearing time and time again during the \nlast three weeks since the terrorist attacks that small businesses are \nexperiencing significant hardship. Many small businesses were already \nexperiencing a downturn in business activity prior to September 11th. \nAs the White House Chief of Staff recently commented, our economy was \nin a downturn before September 11, and this downturn was further \nexacerbated by the terrorist attacks.\n  Historically, when our economy slows or turns into a recession, the \nstrength of the small business sector helps to right our economic ship, \nleading the nation to economic recovery. Today, small businesses employ \n58 percent of the U.S. workforce and create 75 percent of the net new \njobs. Clearly, we cannot afford to ignore America's small businesses as \nwe consider measures to stimulate our economy.\n  The Small Business Leads to Economic Recovery Act of 2001 also \nprovides for changes in the SBA 7(a) Guaranteed Business Loan Program \nand the 504 Certified Development Company Loan Program to stimulate \nlending to small businesses that are most likely to grow and add new \nemployees. These enhancements to the SBA's 7(a) and 504 loan programs \nare to extend for one year. They are designed to make the program more \naffordable during the period when the economy is weak and banks have \ntightened their underwriting requirements for small business loans.\n  Specifically, when the economy is slowing, it is normal for banks to \nraise the bar for obtaining commercial loans. However, making it harder \nfor small businesses to survive is the wrong reaction to a slowing \neconomy. By tweaking the 7(a) and 504 loans to make them more \naffordable to borrowers and lenders, we will be working against \nhistory's rules governing a slowing economy, thereby adding a stimulus \nfor small businesses. Essentially, we will be providing a counter-\ncyclical action in the face a slow economy with the express purpose of \naccelerating the recovery.\n\n  I have agreed to cosponsor a bill that Senator John Kerry, Chairman \nof the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, intends to \nintroduce in the near future to improve and strengthen the credit and \nmanagement assistance programs at the SBA in response to the September \n11th terrorist attack. I am pleased to report that his bill will \nincorporate key ingredients of Title I of the Small Business Leads to \nEconomic Recovery Act of 2001 by adopting the three tier approach to \nenhance the SBA's credit programs so they can respond more effectively \nand efficiently to the September 11th disaster.\n  With the contraction of the private-equity market over the past year, \nthe Small Business Investment Company, SBIC, program has taken on a \nsignificant role in providing venture capital to small businesses \nseeking investments in the range of $500,000 to $3 million. In the \ncurrent economic environment, the SBIC program represents an \nincreasingly important source of capital for small enterprises.\n  While Debenture SBICs qualify for SBA-guaranteed borrowed capital, \nthe government guarantee forces a number of potential investors, namely \npension funds, to avoid investing in SBICs because they would be \nsubject to tax liability for unrelated business taxable income, UBTI. \nWhen free to choose, tax-exempt investors generally opt to invest in \nventure capital funds that do not create UBTI.\n\n[[Page S10160]]\n\n  As a result, 60 percent of the private-capital potentially available \nto these SBICs is effectively ``off limits.'' The Small Business Leads \nto Economic Recovery Act of 2001 corrects this problem by excluding \ngovernment-guaranteed capital borrowed by Debenture SBICs from debt for \npurposes of the UBTI rules. This change would permit tax-exempt \norganizations to invest in SBICs without the burdens of UBTI \nrecordkeeping or tax liability. More importantly, this change in the \nlaw could double the amount of private capital being invested in small \nbusinesses through the Debenture SBIC program.\n  The access-to-capital provisions of the bill will go a long way \ntoward easing the cash-flow burdens that small firms are now facing, \nbut we can also tackle this problem from another perspective, reducing \nthe tax burden of small businesses. Accordingly, the second component \nof my Small Business Leads to Economic Recovery Act provides \nsubstantial tax relief for small businesses. These provisions hold the \ngreatest potential, in my opinion, for fast and effective tax stimulus \nfor small enterprises.\n  First and foremost, this bill would permit small businesses to \nexpense substantially more of their new equipment purchases by raising \nthe expensing limit to $100,000 per year and by increasing the \nexpensing phase-out threshold to $500,000. In addition, for small \nbusinesses that cannot qualify for expensing, the bill reduces the \ndepreciation-recovery period for computers, peripheral equipment and \nsoftware to two years.\n  Together, these provisions have several important advantages for \nAmerica's small businesses, especially in light of the current economic \nconditions. By allowing more equipment purchases to be deducted \ncurrently and reducing the recovery period for technology purchases \nthat must be depreciated, we can provide much needed capital for small \nbusinesses. With that freed-up capital, a business can invest in new \ncomputer equipment, which will benefit the small enterprise and, in \nturn, stimulate the sagging technology industry. Finally, new computer \nequipment will contribute to continued productivity growth in the \nbusiness community, which Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has \nstressed is essential to the long-term vitality of our economy.\n  Finally, these modifications will simplify the tax law for countless \nsmall businesses. Greater expensing means less equipment subject to the \nonerous depreciation rules. And for businesses that do not qualify for \nexpensing, shortening the recovery period for computer equipment from \nthe current five-year period will add some common sense to the tax law. \nSince most computers have outlived their usefulness after two to three \nyears, let alone five years, too many businesses are left to depreciate \nthis property long after it has become obsolete.\n  In short, the equipment-expensing and depreciation changes I propose \nare a win-win for small businesses, the technology industry, and our \nnational economy as a whole. But we do not stop there. The bill also \naddresses the limitation on depreciation that many small firms face \nwith regard to the automobiles, light trucks and vans that are so \nessential to their operations.\n  Specifically, the Small Business Leads to Economic Recovery Act \namends the limitations under section 280F of the tax code, which \ncurrently prohibit a small business from claiming a full depreciation \ndeduction if the vehicle costs more than $14,460, for vehicles placed \nin service in 2000. Although these limitations have been subject to \ninflation adjustments since they were adjusted in 1986, they have not \nkept pace with the actual cost of new vehicles in most cases. For many \nsmall businesses, the use of a car, light truck or van is an essential \nasset for transporting personnel to sales and service appointments and \nfor delivering their products. Accordingly, the bill adjusts the \nthresholds so that a business will not lose any of its depreciation \ndeduction for vehicles costing less than $25,000, which will continue \nto be indexed for inflation.\n  This provision of the bill will help ease the cash flow strains for \nmany small businesses, freeing critical capital that can be used for \ninvestments in new business vehicles. In turn, purchases of new cars, \nlight trucks or vans will offer much-needed stimulus for the nation's \nautomotive industry. Again, multiple benefits for a small change in our \ntax code.\n  My bill also responds to the difficult times facing the nation's \nrestaurant industry, which the National Restaurant Association \nestimates lost 60,000 jobs in September due to slower sales caused by \nthe current economic conditions and the recent terrorist attacks. While \nby no means a complete solution, we can lend a hand to the restaurant \nindustry, which is dominated by small businesses, by increasing the \nbusiness-meals deduction to 100 percent. This will provide an \nincentive for businesses to return to their local restaurants, and at \nthe same time assist non-restaurant businesses and the self-employed \nfor whom business meals are an unavoidable fact of life.\n\n  At the National Women's Small Business Summit, which I hosted last \nJune, a number of participants noted that unlike their large \ncompetitors, small enterprises often sell their products and services \nby word of mouth and close many business transactions on the road or in \na local diner. In many ways the business breakfast with a potential \ncustomer is akin to formal advertising that larger businesses purchase \nin newspapers or on radio or television. While the newspaper ad is \nfully deductible, however, the business meal is only 50 percent \ndeductible for the small business owner.\n  In addition, many self-employed individuals like sales \nrepresentatives spend enormous amounts of time on the road with no \nchoice but to eat in restaurants while away from home. For these \nindividuals the current 50 percent limitation on the deductibility of \nbusiness meals is a severe strain on cash flow, especially with the \nsoft market conditions they face for selling their products and \nservices. A 100 percent deduction will ease those strains and help \nsmall firms in these situations to weather the current economic storm.\n  The final tax provisions of my bill relate to a growing problem for \nsmall businesses--the alternative minimum tax, AMT. For the sole \nproprietors, partners, and S corporation shareholders, the individual \nAMT increases their tax liability by, among other things, reducing \ndepreciation and depletion deductions, limiting net operating loss \ntreatment, eliminating the deductibility of state and local taxes, and \ncurtailing the expensing of research and experimentation costs. In \naddition, because of its complexity, this tax forces small business \nowners to waste precious funds on tax professionals to determine \nwhether the AMT even applies. For these reasons, the bill includes the \nrecommendation of the Taxpayer Advocate to repeal the individual AMT. \nIn light of the current economic situation facing our nation's small \nenterprises, my bill will repeal the individual AMT beginning this \nyear.\n  For small corporations, the AMT story is much the same, high \ncompliance costs and additional taxes draining away scarce capital from \nthe business. Accordingly, for small corporate taxpayers, the bill \nincreases the current exemption from the corporate AMT. As a result, a \nsmall corporation will initially qualify for the exemption if its \naverage gross receipts are $7.5 million or less, up from the current $5 \nmillion, during its first three taxable years. Thereafter, a small \ncorporation will continue to qualify for the AMT exemption for as long \nas its average gross receipts for the prior three-year period do not \nexceed $10 million, up from the current $7.5 million.\n  The tax component of the Small Business Leads to Economic Recovery \nAct will provide significant cash-flow relief for small enterprises and \nmany incentives for them to continue investing in our economy for their \nlong-term well being. Together with the access-to-capital component, \nthe tax relief will give a significant boost to small businesses and \nour economy. But we can do more, we can call on the Nation's largest \nconsumer, the Federal Government, to shop with small business in \nAmerica.\n  Toward that end, my bill would make some subtle changes in the laws \ngoverning Federal procurement that will have a dramatic impact on \nexpanding contracting opportunities for small businesses. For example, \nwhen the Brooks Act was enacted in 1982, it prohibited small business \nset asides for\n\n[[Page S10161]]\n\ncontracts to provide architectural and engineering services valued at \n$85,000 or more. It has been almost twenty years, and the ceiling has \nnot been adjusted, not even once, to reflect inflation or other changes \nin the economy. My bill would increase this ceiling to $300,000 and \nwould create immediate opportunities for contracting officers in \nFederal agencies to increase the number of contracts set aside for \nsmall businesses.\n  It is also the Federal Government's policy that contracts valued at \nless than $100,000 be reserved for small businesses. This policy, \nhowever, is not followed by the General Services Administration, GSA, \nwith respect to the Federal Supply Schedule, FSS. Too often contracts \nfor less than $100,000 are filed by large businesses. Therefore, my \nbill would require that all Federal agency contracts, requirements or \nprocurements valued at less than $100,000 be reserved for small \nbusinesses. Again, this change in our law would have an immediate \npositive effect by making more contracting opportunities available to \nsmall businesses.\n  For contracts for property or services not on the GSA's FSS, my bill \nwould require that contracts valued at less than $100,000 be reserved \nfor competition among small businesses registered on the SBA's PRO-Net \nand the Central Contractor Register, CCR, at the Department of Defense, \nDoD. By using the two registries, small businesses would know where to \ngo to begin the process of competing for government contracts, and \ncontracting officers would have at their fingertips a list of hundreds \nof thousands of small businesses listed by industry category.\n  My bill would provide for a six-month announcement period, which \nwould be followed by a one year phase-in period during which 25 percent \nof the dollar value of all contracts valued less than $100,000 would be \nset aside for small businesses. After the first year, the set aside \nwould increase to 50 percent in the second and subsequent years.\n  Minority-owned small businesses and small businesses located in \neconomically distressed urban and rural areas are at a particular \ndisadvantage when competing for Federal government contracts. My bill \nwould offer improved opportunities for these small businesses as part \nof the disaster-recovery effort. It would provide that when a \ncontracting officer directs a contract to a HUBZone or 8(a) small \nbusinesses, the current ceiling on sole-source contracting would be \nremoved. This change would apply only to the money that is appropriated \nby the Congress specifically targeted to the September 11 disaster-\nrecovery effort.\n  The Small Business Leads to Economic Recovery Act is a comprehensive \nbill to help the Nation as well as the owners and employees of small \nbusinesses. Its relief is targeted and is designed to work tomorrow and \nin the immediate future. Now is not the time to focus on ten year plans \nand lengthy phase-in periods. Small businesses need help, today, and my \nbill will put cash in the business' bank account and in employees' \npockets. Small businesses have been the champions of past economic \nrecoveries. My bill gives small businesses the tools to accelerate a \nrecovery, so that our Nation's economic fortunes are reversed sooner \nrather than later.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nand a summary of its provisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1493\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Short Title\n\n       This section sets forth the title, ``Small Business Leads \n     to Economic Recovery Act of 2001.''\n\n                        Section 102. Definitions\n\n       This section provides the definitions of key words used in \n     Title I.\n\n            Section 103. Deferment of Disaster Loan Payments\n\n       In recognition that the small businesses eligible for \n     Disaster Assistance Loans will not be able to begin repayment \n     of the loans for up to two years, the bill provides that both \n     principal and interest payment will be deferred for two years \n     from the date of loan origination. Interest that accrues \n     during the deferment period would be forgiven.\n\n            Section 104. Refinancing Existing Disaster Loans\n\n       As the result of the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, \n     there are small businesses in the Presidentially-declared \n     disaster area that have outstanding SBA disaster loans. This \n     section will permit small businesses to refinance outstanding \n     disaster loans in the new disaster loans with the two-year \n     deferment provision.\n\n               Section 105. Emergency Relief Loan Program\n\n       This section creates a special one-year program at the SBA \n     using key components of the 7(a) guaranteed business loan \n     program to create a working capital loan program for small \n     businesses suffering significant economic injury as the \n     result of the September\n\n[[Page S10164]]\n\n     11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the \n     Pentagon. The loans would have a 95 percent guarantee, and \n     there would be no up-front borrower fee. The interest rate \n     would be the Prime Rate plus 1 percent. Banks would have the \n     option to defer principal payments for up to one year.\n       This special working capital loan program recognizes there \n     are small businesses nationwide that are experiencing serious \n     cash flow difficulties as the result of the terrorist \n     attacks, e.g., travel agencies, flight training and other \n     commercial users of single-engine VFR aircraft.\n\n       Section 106. Economic Recovery Loan and Financing Programs\n\n       As the result of the deteriorating economy, which was \n     experiencing a downturn prior to September 11, 2001, banks \n     had initiated steps to tighten the availability of credit to \n     small businesses. For Fiscal Year 2001, it is projected that \n     new loan originations may drop as much as 25 percent from the \n     projections on October 1, 2000.\n       This section will make significant changes for one year to \n     the 7(a) guaranteed business loan program. Loans would be \n     available for all qualified borrowers. The up-front loan \n     origination fee paid by the borrower, which ranges from 2.0 \n     percent to 3.5 percent depending on loan size, would be \n     eliminated. The guarantee percentage for the general loan \n     program would be increased from 75 percent to 85 percent. For \n     the LowDoc program, the guarantee percentage would increase \n     from 80 percent to 90 percent.\n       This section would also make similar changes to the 504 \n     Certified Development Company Loan Program. For one year, the \n     up-front fee paid by the bank making the loan in the first \n     loss position would be eliminated. Further, the annual fee \n     paid by the borrower would also be dropped.\n\n   Section 107. Small Business Investment Company Enhancement Program\n\n       The Administration and the SBIC industry has recommended \n     that the SBIC/Participating Securities Program become a fee-\n     based program, which would eliminate the need for an annual \n     appropriation. This change would entail enacting legislation \n     to increase the SBIC fee from 1 percent to at least l.38 \n     percent. This section would allow the SBA to increase the \n     annual fee to no more than 1.50 percent, which would support \n     a program level fo $3.5 billion in Fiscal Year 2002.\n\n     TITLE II--SMALL BUSINESS TAX PROVISIONS FOR ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n                  Section 201. Amendment of 1986 Code\n\n       This section clarifies that all changes in the bill are to \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as previously amended.\n\n   Section 202. Increase in Expense Treatment of Certain Depreciable \n                 Business Assets for Small Businesses.\n\n       The bill amends section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code to \n     increase the amount of equipment purchases that small \n     businesses may expense each year from the current $24,000 to \n     $100,000. This change will eliminate the burdensome \n     recordkeeping involved in depreciating such equipment and \n     free up capital for small businesses to grow and create jobs.\n       The bill also increases the phase-out limitation for \n     equipment expensing from the current $200,000 to $500,000, \n     thereby expanding the type of equipment that can qualify for \n     expensing treatment. This limitation along with the annual \n     expensing amount will be indexed for inflation under the \n     bill.\n       Following the recommendation of the National Taxpayer \n     Advocate, the bill also amends section 179 to permit \n     expensing in the year that the property is purchased or the \n     year that the property is placed in service, whichever is \n     earlier. This will eliminate the difficulty that many small \n     enterprises have encountered when investing in new equipment \n     in one tax year, e.g., 2001 that cannot be placed in service \n     until the following year, e.g., 2002. The equipment-\n     expensing provisions will be effective for taxable years \n     beginning after December 31, 2000.\n\n              Section 203. Expensing of Computer Software\n\n       In connection with the expanded equipment-expensing limits, \n     the bill also permits taxpayers to expense computer software \n     up to the new $100,000 limit on annual equipment expensing. \n     This provision will eliminate the compliance costs and \n     burdens of depreciation software over a three-year period, \n     which is often inconsistent with the product's actual useful \n     life. This provision will be effective for taxable years \n     beginning after December 31, 2000.\n\n   Section 204. Modification of Depreciation Rules for Computers and \n                                Software\n\n       For small business taxpayers who do not qualify for \n     expensing treatment, the bill modifies the outdated \n     depreciation rules to permit taxpayers to depreciate computer \n     equipment and software over a two-year period. Under present \n     law, computer equipment is generally depreciated over a five-\n     year period and software is usually depreciated over three \n     years. With the rapid advancements in technology, these \n     depreciation periods are sorely out of date and can result in \n     small businesses having to exhaust their depreciation \n     deductions well after the equipment or software is obsolete. \n     The bill makes the tax code in this area more consistent with \n     the technological reality of the business world. This \n     provision will be effective for computers and software placed \n     in service in taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2000.\n\n Section 205. Adjustments to Depreciation Limits for Business Vehicles\n\n       The bill amends section 280F of the Internal Revenue Code, \n     which limits the amount of depreciation that a business may \n     claim with respect to a vehicle used for business purposes. \n     Under the current thresholds, a business loses a portion of \n     its depreciation deduction if the vehicle costs more than \n     $14,460, for vehicles placed in service in 2000. Although \n     these limitations have been subject to inflation adjustments, \n     they have not kept pace with the actual cost of new cars, \n     light trucks and vans in most cases. For many small \n     businesses, the use of a car, light truck or van is an \n     essential asset for transporting personnel to sales and \n     service appointments and for delivering their products. \n     Accordingly, the bill adjusts the thresholds so that a \n     business will not lose any of its depreciation deduction for \n     vehicles costing less than $25,000, which will continue to be \n     indexed for inflation. This provision will be effective for \n     vehicles placed in service in taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 2000.\n\n      Section 206. Increased Deduction for Business Meal Expenses\n\n       The bill increases the limitation on the deductibility of \n     business meals from the current 50 percent to 100 percent \n     beginning in 2001 to provide an incentive for businesses to \n     return to their local restaurants. At the same time, this \n     provision will assist non-restaurant businesses and self-\n     employed individuals level the playing field. Unlike their \n     large competitors, small enterprises often sell their \n     products and services by word of mouth and close many \n     business transactions on the road or in a local diner. In \n     many ways the business breakfast with a potential customer is \n     akin to formal advertising that larger businesses purchase in \n     newspapers or on radio or television. While the newspaper \n     ad is fully deductible, however, the business meal is only \n     50 percent deductible for the small business owner.\n       In addition, many self-employed individuals like sales \n     representatives spend enormous amounts of time on the road \n     with no choice but to eat in restaurants while away from \n     home, further straining their cash flow. By increasing the \n     deduction to 100 percent, the bill addresses these problems, \n     as well as the lack of parity that small business owners face \n     with respect to individuals subject to the Federal hours-of-\n     service limitations of the Department of Transportation, such \n     as truck drivers, who are currently able to deduct a larger \n     portion of their business meals.\n\n Section 207. Modification of Unrelated Business Income Limitation on \n            Investments in Certain Debt-Financed Properties\n\n       With the recent contraction of the private-equity market, \n     the Small Business Investment Company, SBIC program, which is \n     overseen by the SBA, has taken on a significant role in \n     providing venture capital to small businesses seeking \n     investments in the range of $500,000 to $3 million. Debenture \n     SBICs qualify for SBA-guaranteed borrowed capital, which \n     subjects tax-exempt investors that would otherwise be \n     inclined to invest in Debenture SBICs to tax liability for \n     unrelated business taxable income, UBTI. When free to choose, \n     tax-exempt investors generally opt to invest in venture \n     capital funds that do not create UBTI. As a result, 60 \n     percent of the private-capital potentially available to \n     Debenture SBICs is effectively ``off limits.''\n       The bill would exclude government-guaranteed capital \n     borrowed by Debenture SBICs from debt for purposes of the \n     UBTI rules. This change would permit tax-exempt organizations \n     to invest in Debenture SBICs without the burdens of UBTI \n     recordkeeping or tax liability, thereby providing additional \n     capital for investment in small businesses across the nation. \n     This provision would be effective for acquisitions made on or \n     after the date of enactment of this bill.\n\n     Section 208. Repeal of Alternative Minimum Tax on Individuals\n\n       The bill repeals the individual Alternative Minimum Tax, \n     AMT effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2000. For individual taxpayers, the individual AMT has become \n     an increasingly burdensome tax. For the sole proprietors, \n     partners, and S corporation shareholders, the individual AMT \n     increases their tax liability by, among other things, \n     limiting depreciation and depletion deductions, net operating \n     loss treatment, the deductibility of state and local taxes, \n     and expensing of research and experimentation costs. In \n     addition, because of its complexity, this tax forces small \n     business owners to waste precious funds on tax professionals \n     to determine whether the AMT even applies.\n\n Section 209. Expansion of the Exemption From the Alternative Minimum \n                       Tax for Small Corporations\n\n       For small corporate taxpayers, the bill increases the \n     current exemption from the corporate AMT, under section 55(e) \n     of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the bill, a small \n     corporation will initially qualify for the exemption if its \n     average gross receipts are $7.5 million or less, up from the \n     current $5 million, during its first three taxable years. \n     Thereafter, a small corporation will continue to qualify for \n     the AMT exemption for so long as its average gross \n     receipts for the prior three-year period do not exceed $10 \n     million, up from the current $7.5 million. The increased \n     limits for the small-corporation exemption from the \n     corporate AMT will be effective for taxable years \n     beginning after December 31, 2000.\n\n[[Page S10165]]\n\n                 TITLE III--SMALL BUSINESS PROCUREMENTS\n\n   Section 301. Expansion of Opportunity for Small Businesses To Be \n     Awarded Department of Defense Contracts for Architectural and \n              Engineering Services and Construction Design\n\n       The Brooks Act was enacted in 1982 and prohibits any small \n     businesses set asides for architectural and engineering \n     contracts valued at $85,000 or more. No change in this \n     ceiling has been made since enactment of the Brooks Act. This \n     section would increase the ceiling to $300,000, which would \n     create, almost immediately, new Federal contracting \n     opportunities for small businesses.\n\n Section 302. Procurements of Property and Services in Amounts Not in \n                Excess of $100,000 From Small Businesses\n\n       This section would make more contracts valued at less than \n     $100,000 available to small businesses. Under the Federal \n     Supply Schedule, FSS, at GSA, all agency contracts, \n     requirements, or procurements valued at less than $100,000 \n     would be made from small businesses.\n       For contracts for property or services not on the GSA's \n     FSS, the procuring agency would set aside such contracts, \n     valued at less than $100,000, for competition among small \n     businesses registered on the SBA's PRO-Net and the DoD's \n     Centralized Contractor Registration, CCR, System. There would \n     be a two-year phase-in period. After an initial six-month \n     period, during the first year, 25 percent of the dollar value \n     of all contracts less than $100,000 would be awarded to small \n     businesses. This would increase to 50 percent in the second \n     and subsequent years.\n\n          Section 303. HUBZone and 8(a) Sole-Source Contracts\n\n       Contracts for property and services made with funds from \n     the ``2001 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for \n     Recovery From and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United \n     States'' will be exempt from the ceiling on sole-source \n     contracts under the HUBZone and 8(a) programs. Currently, the \n     ceilings are $3 million for service contracts and $5 million \n     for manufacturing contracts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM:\n  S. 1496. A bill to clarify the accounting treatment for Federal \nincome tax purposes of deposits and similar amounts received by a tour \noperator for a tour arranged by such operator; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, today I am introducing the Tour \nOperators Up-front Deposit Relief, TOUR, Act. This legislation codifies \na longstanding practice used by the tour operator industry to account \nfor prepaid deposits received in advance of a customers travel.\n  A tour operator puts together travel ``packages'' often involving a \nnumber of different elements: airlines, ground transportation, hotels, \nrestaurants, local guides and other services for one or more \ndestinations. Services often include the direct provision of tour \ncomponents such as motor coaches. The packages are sold to the public, \nusually through travel agents. Approximately 70 percent of retail \ntravel agent sales involve tour operator packages. A vacation package \ncombines multiple travel elements into an all-inclusive price. A tour \nis a trip taken by a group of people who travel together and follow a \npre-planned itinerary. In both instances, the travel has been planned \nby professionals whose group purchasing power insures substantial \nsavings. In addition, prepayment covers all major expenses which \nminimizes budgeting concerns.\n  Tour operators employ a long standing, universally accepted method of \naccounting which recognizes deposits as income upon the date of \ndeparture of the passenger. This treatment defers income recognition \nwhile the customer still has the right to cancel the travel without \nsubstantial conditions and prior to the tour operator's performing many \nof the tasks and making many of the commitments required to insure a \ntimely, safe and reliable trip.\n  Recently, the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, has adopted a position \nin selected tour operator audits which would, if generally applied, \nrequire virtually all tour operators to change their method of \naccounting for deposits. The IRS position is that tour operators must \nrecognize deposits as income upon receipt even though they may not \nincur expenses for months, or in some cases, more than a year. This \nposition is in direct contrast to guidance previously provided by the \nIRS. Revenue Procedure 71-21 acknowledges that accrual basis taxpayers \nshould be allowed to defer advanced payment for services under certain \ncircumstances but has improperly refused to interpret this ruling to \napply to tour operators.\n  If the IRS continues to pursue its position, it will raise the cost \nof operations for tour operators. This added cost will be passed on to \nAmericans seeking to travel. Given the difficulties facing this \nindustry in light of the events of September 11, the IRS position is \nparticularly misguided.\n  The legislation being introduced today clarifies that Revenue \nProcedure 71-21 applies to the tour operator industry. Under this \nProcedure, deposits become taxable income on the date the tour departs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1496\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE SELECTION OF \n                   OFFICERS FOR ASSIGNMENT AS THE COMMANDER IN \n                   CHIEF, UNITED STATES TRANSPORTATION COMMAND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense \n     Reorganization Act of 1986 envisioned that an officer would \n     be assigned to serve as the commander of a combatant command \n     on the basis of being the best qualified officer for the \n     assignment rather than the best qualified officer of the \n     armed force that has historically supplied an officer to \n     serve in that assignment.\n       (2) In order to provide for greater competition among the \n     Armed Forces for selection of officers for assignment as the \n     commanders of the combatant commands and assignment to \n     certain other joint positions in the grade of general or \n     admiral, Congress provided temporary relief from the \n     limitation on the number of officers serving on active duty \n     in the grade of general or admiral in section 405\n\n[[Page S10211]]\n\n     of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     1995 and thereafter extended that relief until September 30, \n     2003, but has also required that the Secretary of Defense be \n     furnished the name of at least one officer from each of the \n     Armed Forces for consideration for appointment to each such \n     position.\n       (3) Most of the positions of commanders of the combatant \n     commands have been filled successively by officers of more \n     than one of the Armed Forces since the enactment of the \n     Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of \n     1986.\n       (4) However, general officers of the Air Force with only \n     limited experience in the transportation services have \n     usually filled the position of Commander in Chief of the \n     United States Transportation Command.\n       (5) The United States Transportation Command and its \n     component commands could benefit from the appointment of an \n     officer selected from the two armed forces that are the \n     primary users of their transportation resources, namely the \n     Army and the Marine Corps.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.-- In light of the findings set forth \n     in subsection (a), it is the sense of Congress that the \n     Secretary of Defense should, when considering officers for \n     recommendation to the President for appointment as the \n     Commander in Chief, United States Transportation Command, \n     give careful consideration to recommending an officer of the \n     Army or the Marine Corps.\n\n     SEC. 904.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Rocky Flats National \n     Wildlife Refuge Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 3172. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal Government, through the Atomic Energy \n     Commission, acquired the Rocky Flats site in 1951 and began \n     operations there in 1952. The site remains a Department of \n     Energy facility. Since 1992, the mission of the Rocky Flats \n     site has changed from the production of nuclear weapons \n     components to cleanup and closure in a manner that is safe, \n     environmentally and socially responsible, physically secure, \n     and cost-effective.\n       (2) The site has generally remained undisturbed since its \n     acquisition by the Federal Government.\n       (3) The State of Colorado is experiencing increasing growth \n     and development, especially in the metropolitan Denver Front \n     Range area in the vicinity of the Rocky Flats site. That \n     growth and development reduces the amount of open space and \n     thereby diminishes for many metropolitan Denver communities \n     the vistas of the striking Front Range mountain backdrop.\n       (4) Some areas of the site contain contamination and will \n     require further response action. The national interest \n     requires that the ongoing cleanup and closure of the entire \n     site be completed safely, effectively, and without \n     unnecessary delay and that the site thereafter be retained by \n     the United States and managed so as to preserve the value of \n     the site for open space and wildlife habitat.\n       (5) The Rocky Flats site provides habitat for many wildlife \n     species, including a number of threatened and endangered \n     species, and is marked by the presence of rare xeric \n     tallgrass prairie plant communities.

AMENDMENT.\n\n       Section 568(d) of the Improving America's Schools Act of \n     1994 (15 U.S.C. 1 note) is amended by striking ``2001'' and \n     inserting ``2008''.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise today to offer a substitute \namendment to H.R. 768. This legislation, as amended, will extend for \nseven years an existing antitrust exemption granted to colleges and \nuniversities that admit students on a need blind basis. The exemption \nprovides protection for these schools to cooperatively develop a \nmethodology for determining financial need in order to best assess a \nfamily's ability to pay the costs of attendance.\n  There is no doubt that higher education opens doors and creates \nopportunities. It is therefore imperative that we in Congress do what \nwe can to keep higher education affordable for our nation's students \nand their families. Some of the best and most prestigious colleges and \nuniversities admit students without regard to their financial need, \nallowing talented students from disadvantaged backgrounds to achieve \ntheir full potential. This exemption allows those colleges and \nuniversities to generate a uniform methodology to determine a family's \nneed. The colleges and universities that use the exemption believe it \nallows them to attract needy students and maintain a thriving financial \naid program.\n  Discussions among colleges and universities using need-blind \nadmissions policies began more than thirty years ago. However, in 1989, \nthe Department of Justice filed suit against 23 colleges and \nuniversities alleging that their cooperation violated antitrust laws. A \nfederal district court ruled that the schools were subject to the \nantitrust laws. In 1991, most of the colleges and universities settled \nwith the Department of Justice with a promise to stop sharing \ninformation.\n  Faced with the prospect of eliminating their discussions as a result \nof the settlement, the colleges and universities sought a law allowing \nthem to meet. In 1992, Congress passed the original two-year antitrust \nexemption for those schools that guaranteed that their aid was need-\nblind. The exemption was extended in 1994 and 1997. With the lawsuit \nand the court order so fresh in our collective memory, it seems prudent \nto extend the exemption for a reasonable length of time, but not \nindefinitely. The exemption has always been grated on the theory that \ncooperation among universities in determining financial aid need \nbenefits prospective students and their families. But there is little \nif any objective data to support this proposition. So this amendment \ndirects the General Accounting Office (GAO) to study the effects of the \nantitrust exemption on undergraduate grant aid. The study will require \nschools who participate in discussions under the antitrust exemption to \nmaintain and submit records. While the study will be comparative, \nschools that do not participate in discussions permitted by the \nexemption will not be required to maintain or submit records.\n  As a general rule, I strongly oppose antitrust exemptions. Our \nantitrust laws guarantee competition, and competition means lower \nprices and higher quality for consumers--including students purchasing \na college education. but the colleges and universities using the \nexemption believe that the market functions differently in this case. I \nam therefore willing to extend the exemption for another seven years \nbut believe that any further activity in this area must be coupled with \nhard objective data providing that this exemption does indeed benefit \nstudents and their families. Too many families are struggling today to \nput their children through college. So we must act very carefully and \nwith full information before we pass a permanent antitrust exemption.\n  I would like to thank Representatives Lamar Smith and Barney Frank \nand their staffs for their work on this legislation in the House, and \nSenators DeWine, Leahy, and Hatch and their staffs for their assistance \non this substitute amendment. We hope the House will agree to these \nchanges and expeditiously send this legislation to the President for \nhis signature.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I appreciate the work that Senators Kohl \nand DeWine have done on this bill. I want to point out that while this \nbill extends the antitrust exemption for participating institutions' \nmethodologies and applications for need-based financial aid, that \nexemption is still limited to the institutions' dealings with potential \nstudents collectively. It has not, and does not, exempt those \ninstitutions from the prohibitions of the\n\n[[Page S10253]]\n\nSherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1, with respect to awards to specific individual \nstudents. Independent of any antitrust concerns, the participating \ninstitutions also assure us that they do not discuss or compare awards \nfor individual students, and we rely on their continuing that practice.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nsubstitute amendment be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table and any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record, and that the \ntitle amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1844) was agreed to.\n  The bill (H. R. 768), as amended, was passed.\n  The title was amended so as to read:\n\n       An Act to amend the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 \n     to extend the favorable treatment of need-based educational \n     aid under the antitrust laws, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10253-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, OCTOBER 4, 2001\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, throughout America the events of \nSeptember 11 have touched our people and have brought forth a level of \nthoughtful eloquence which has contributed to our ability to understand \nand to be able to deal with the extreme shock and pain of those \nagonizing images we all hold of the events of September 11.\n  On Sunday, I attended the services at my church, the Miami Lakes \nCongregational Church, where our pastor, Rev. Jeffrey Frantz, delivered \nan exceptional sermon. I would like his words and thoughts and message \nto be made available to a broader audience, and therefore I ask \nunanimous consent, Madam President, that Reverend Frantz' sermon, \n``Proud to be an American,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the sermon was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                      ``Proud To Be an American!''\n\n               Living Out Our Faith in a Dangerous World\n\n  (By Dr. Jeffrey E. Frantz, Miami Lakes Congressional Church, Miami \n                               Lakes, FL)\n\n     Isaiah 42:5-9, Matthew 5:1-16\n\n\n                                   i\n\n       In these past few weeks, now, since the September 11th \n     nightmare, our lives have been jolted and challenged, \n     stretched and turned upside down, like never before. It's \n     like so many have commented: everything has changed.\n\n       1. First, the sweeping impact, on all levels, of the tragic \n         event itself . . . the anger and rage, coupled with the \n         mourning and grief. We were left numb with disbelief.\n       2. And then, later, the realization that we have to somehow \n         get on with our lives. We have to put our lives back \n         together. We can't let fear tell us who we are. We have \n         to dig deeply into our self-understanding, our identity \n         as a people, and affirm the best of our traditions.\n       3. We've been dealt a deathly blow; and its reaches have \n         touched virtually every part of our lives: the economy, \n         all levels of our government, the entertainment world, \n         our psychological and spiritual life.\n\n       I was reading an issue of Time Magazine this past week that \n     predated the September 11th disaster. And it was like \n     virtually all of the news seemed suddenly irrelevant and \n     inconsequential. Suddenly Michael Jordan's possible comeback \n     to the NBA seemed trifling and insignificant. We weren't much \n     interested in who Jennifer Lopez might be marrying and where, \n     or in the latest rumor about Julia Roberts or Tom Cruise.\n       Suddenly all of the usual quibbling and whimpering that \n     clutter our lives seem out of place and so, so harmless. \n     Indeed, it's a new day. And a swelling patriotism is \n     everywhere. I've never seen America so united. We're coming \n     together as we never have in the past fifty years or more.\n       People, all over, are coming together. There are problems, \n     to be sure, with some of the understandable, but inexcusable \n     profiling that has been going on. And we must do all we can \n     to curb any such intolerance or injustice. It is a difficult \n     time to be an Arab-American.\n       Also, there's an eerie frenzy about the prospect of \n     biological warfare and chemical or germ warfare--scary stuff. \n     Still, people are coming together. Literally hundreds, if not \n     thousands, of relief efforts are underway around the nation, \n     even the world. The amount of money being raised in relief \n     support is already staggering.\n       American flags have never been in such resplendent display. \n     Patriotic hymns and expressions of one kind or another are on \n     every radio station and on every street corner.\n       American pride is rising to a magnificent height, and it \n     makes us proud.\n       I say this because, at our best, America is a wondrous \n     land, a delightful rainbow people of God's creative hand. Our \n     freedom is our heartbeat, our pulse. But our marvelous \n     diversity is freedom's precious child.\n       Reports suggest that people from as many as sixty nations \n     perished in the rubble of the World Trade Center. You see, \n     friends, we are the world! That's not a pronouncement of \n     arrogance; but rather it is a description of the incredible \n     variety of human beings that fill the reaches of our land.\n\n\n                                   II\n\n       Perhaps some of you saw the televised memorial observance \n     last Sunday afternoon from Yankee Stadium in New York City. \n     With some initial words from James Earl Jones, and emceed by \n     Oprah Winfrey, it was a moving and touching service \n     throughout.\n       Along with tear-streaked cheeks and broken hearts, the \n     diversity of America was everywhere. In the stands, to be \n     sure, with family members, deeply saddened, holding pictures \n     of missing loved ones. And up front around the podium: \n     clerics and clergy, holy men and women--arrayed in their \n     sacred garments, gathered to pray and read holy writings--a \n     magnificent diversity.\n       There were Christian and Jew, Muslim and Buddhist, Hindu \n     and Sikh, believer and non-believer--from every imaginable \n     ethnic group and tribe. America is the world!\n\n     O beautiful for spacious skies,\n     For amber waves of grain,\n     For purple mountain majesties,\n     Above the fruited plain.\n\n       I'm proud to be an American\n\n     America, America!\n     God shed God's grace on thee.\n     And crown thy good with brotherhood\n     From sea to shining sea.\n\n\n                                  III\n\n       This is our vision; this is our dream. It's part of our \n     inheritance, part of our history and tradition. Almost from \n     our inception, we have been what Second Isaiah called Israel, \n     a light to the nations.\n       This wasn't always Israel's self-understanding. She had \n     been God's chosen people, yes. But her chosenness didn't \n     necessarily extend beyond her borders. But, now, in exile . . \n     . seemingly defeated, a new vision of Israel emerged:\n\n     I will give you as a light to the nations,\n       said the prophet.\n     That my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth.\n\n       This universalizing of Israel's role and purpose marks a \n     break-through for Israel's self-identity. Israel's \n     chosenness, now, is to be shared . . . to the ends of the \n     earth. That my salvation may reach out to all people, says \n     the prophet.\n       Friends, America too, is such a light! Whether chosen or \n     not, America has always felt that God's hand was on us in a \n     special way. There is a tantalizingly thin line, that \n     lingers: between the arrogance of presumption and the \n     humility of endowment.\n       Still, no matter how we understand ourselves as Americans, \n     we are a nation of vast resources, of tremendous power and \n     wealth. We have so much to be grateful for. We have been so \n     wondrously blessed.\n       Along with our power and wealth comes great responsibility. \n     Whatever salvation God can work through us comes most \n     abundantly and effectively through our humility. And no \n     matter how we choose to construe our present national crisis, \n     our responsibility--in the way we respond--is enormous. \n     Clearly, all of the world is watching our every move, picking \n     up cues from what we do.\n\n\n[[Page S10254]]\n\n\n       1. I'm proud to be an American . . . in an America that \n     indeed is a light to the nations. An America that stands \n     tall, to be sure, but an America whose greatness is seen in \n     its humbleness of spirit.\n       2. Such humbleness of spirit, grounded in the teachings and \n     example of Christ, IS the key to our future, and indeed to \n     the future of the world, as we work our way through the chaos \n     and the complexity of these difficult times.\n\n\n     Blessed are the poor in spirit,\n       for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n     Blessed are the meek,\n       for they shall inherit the earth.\n     Blessed are those who hunger for righteousness,\n       for they shall be satisfied.\n     Blessed are the pure in heart,\n       for they shall see God,\n     Blessed are the peacemakers,\n       for they shall be children of God.\n\n\n                                   IV\n\n       There's been much talk, since September 11th, of our \n     vulnerability. Our vulnerability is, however, nothing new. \n     We've always been vulnerable. It's the human condition. These \n     blessed conditions, the beatitudes of Jesus, are transparent \n     reminders of this truth.\n       We cannot save ourselves. Understandably, we're frenzied in \n     our rush to make our lives safe again, to get our life back. \n     We see this abundantly exemplified, now, as we invest \n     enormous dollars and effort to beef up our national security \n     and intelligence on all fronts, as we clearly must do.\n       And yet, as people of faith, We've never lost our life. Our \n     life is in God and in God's eternal love and saving grace \n     that have no end.\n       Part of what is so vividly apparent in all of this is that \n     we live in a world that is irreversibly interdependent and \n     global; and we must increasingly see ourselves in this light. \n     In no way, therefore, can we isolate ourselves from the \n     sufferings, deprivations and tribulations of any nation. \n     We're too interconnected; our power and influence are too \n     great.\n       I'm proud to be an American . . . in an America that indeed \n     is a light to the nations. An America that rises to the \n     challenge of the requirements of greatness. We are a great \n     nation. And what are the requirements of our greatness.\n\n       1. To be a good listener. Humility and love demand this of \n     us: to embrace the other life . . . the other tribe . . . the \n     other religion with respect and honor.\n       2. To think long-term in whatever we do. We must be \n     deliberate and wise in our consideration of what kind of a \n     world--what kind of an Afghanistan, what kind of a Pakistan, \n     or any other nation--do we want to see emerge on the other \n     side of whatever action we take.\n       3. To respond to evil run amok. Evil of the proportions of \n     the current global terrorism must be eradicated. Global \n     terrorism must be stopped. Most likely, we cannot avoid some \n     measure of violence and aggression. But how we proceed, and \n     with what level of international support, is of the utmost \n     importance.\n\n\n                                   V\n\n       Violence and war must never--too easily, too quickly--\n     become options. Sometimes, when evil and demonic forces are \n     too out-of-control, we may well have no choice. But even \n     then, it is only with great mercy and sorrow in our hearts \n     that we act.\n       All of which is to suggest that violence, and resolution \n     through violence, are never as easy as we think. It's never \n     just a matter of going in and taking care of business. Ethnic \n     and tribal hatreds endure, as we are seeing today, for \n     decades and decades . . . even centuries.\n       We see that in Northern Ireland. We've seen it in Kosovo \n     and what was Yugoslavia, where ethnic and tribal hatreds have \n     been warning for centuries on end. We see it, now, in \n     Afghanistan: tribal warlords at odds, killing one another and \n     perpetuating the cycle of violence for generations to come. \n     And we see it, too, in the endless hostilities that continue \n     to cast a pall of gloom over Israel and Palestine.\n       Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke prophetically to us about the \n     problem with violence: ``The ultimate weakness of violence is \n     that it is a descending spiral, begetting the very thing it \n     seeks to destroy. Instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies \n     it. Through violence you may murder the hater, but you do not \n     murder the hate. In fact, violence merely increases hate, \n     returning violence for violence, adding deeper darkness to a \n     night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive hate \n     out; only love can do that.''\n       We're Christians, friends, children of God, before we are \n     anything else. That does not mean that we should not take \n     care of our own. It means that we understand that taking care \n     of our own is rooted, first, in an impulse of love and \n     respect, understanding and acceptance of all nations, all \n     religions.\n       I'm proud to be an American in an America that understands \n     that when the international community is strong and healthy--\n     when freedom and hope are finding their way around the earth, \n     when the dreams of people everywhere have hope of \n     realization--then America is strong. And then America is \n     safe.\n\n\n                                   vi\n\n       We're a light to the nations. I believe that. And I believe \n     it at the foot of the cross.\n       We must spread the light of God's blessings to all peoples. \n     This is not easy. In fact, it is very complex and will \n     require great sacrifice on our part, as it has in the past. \n     It will take time, even decades and more.\n       Yet, to work our way thru the rubble of September 11th, we \n     must make international coalitions and networks of \n     understanding our number one priority.\n       We must improve our sense of geography--our awareness of \n     other cultures and religions. We must lead from a strength \n     that exudes love, charity, compassion and historical \n     understanding. Because then, and only then, will we begin to \n     bring a healing and peace that endure to our fragmented \n     world.\n       Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom \n     of heaven . . . blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit \n     the earth . . . blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall \n     be called children of God . . .\n       You are the light of the world . . . let your light shine \n     before all the world . . . that the world may see your faith \n     and give glory to God in heaven .  .  .\n\n     America, America!\n     God shed God's grace on thee,\n     And crown thy good with brotherhood.\n     from sea to shinning sea .  .  .\n\n     How beautiful, two continents,\n     and islands in the sea .  .  .\n     That dream of peace, non-violence,\n     all people living free.\n\n     America, America!\n     God grant that we may be . . .\n     A hemisphere, indeed one earth,\n     living in harmony.\n\n       I'm proud to be an American, O yes; and to be a child of \n     the living God, the God of the heavens and the earth and all \n     that is in it. Amen.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Madam President. And to my colleague, Senator \nTorricelli, I say thank you for your forbearance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10254-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10254-S10255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            AIRPORT SECURITY\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nFlorida. Indeed, it was a pleasure to hear his remarks.\n  In my service in the Congress through these years, I have rarely--\nindeed, I have never--witnessed the solidarity of the membership, the \nfocus of purpose that has been evident since the tragedy of September \n11. Partisan differences, differences of region and philosophy have \nbeen impossible to discern in the debates on the Senate floor.\n  Tomorrow the Senate resumes debate on legislation to deal with \nairline and airport security. There may be a slight fissure in this \nwall of solidarity. I rise to address it this evening.\n  It is not necessarily a difference of party affiliation or of \nphilosophy, but it does have some regional implications where people of \ngoodwill can differ because of different experiences. It needs to be \nput in perspective, but it is still important.\n  This body is right, indeed; the Senate has no choice but to deal with \nthe issue of airport security. Our national economy has taken a \nterrible toll in the loss of employment and income. Lives have been \nlost. Families have been broken. Confidence in the freedom to travel in \nAmerica has been shaken--all because of the acts of terrorists who \nhijacked planes and killed our citizens.\n  To the cynic, our legislation represents closing the barn door. The \ncynics may be right. But that does not mean the Senate has a choice. \nWhether it is providing armed marshals on aircraft or federalizing the \ncheck-in system, changing cockpit doors, it may be too late for \nthousands, but it is still not too late for our country. It is a \nresponsibility we owe to the American people. It must be done, and it \nmust be done quickly. We can lament that we did not forecast the \nproblem, but we are left with the reality of dealing with it.\n  This, however, invites the question of whether the obligation of the \nSenate is simply to deal with the problem that is now before us, a \nproblem made clear by the terrorists themselves in the means by which \nthey hijacked these planes, their mode of operation, or whether our \nresponsibility is to anticipate.\n  On September 11, it was the hijacking of aircraft. There was no \nreason to believe that would be the mode of operation in a future \nattack.\n  In some areas of the country, transportation is simply defined. It is \neither aircraft or it is driving automobiles. In our great metropolitan \nareas, it is far more complex. More people use trains every day, I \nsuspect, in New York and Boston and Philadelphia and Chicago, perhaps \nin St. Louis or Miami or Los Angeles, perhaps in these places, but I \ncan assure you certainly in the State of New Jersey more people ride on \ncommuter rail, on Amtrak, than ride on\n\n[[Page S10255]]\n\nevery airliner combined. It is another spot of vulnerability. So are \nour reservoirs, our powerplants. All these are places of vulnerability \nthat must be addressed.\n  If the Senate tomorrow is to address safety in transportation, that \ndebate cannot be complete if we secure aircraft without dealing with \nrailroads because they are equally vulnerable.\n  Indeed, every Metroliner that leaves New York for Boston or \nWashington potentially can hold up to 2,000 people. Every train \nrepresents three 747s with average loads. Under any time in a tunnel \nalong the Northeast corridor where two trains pass, 3,000 or 4,000 \npeople can be vulnerable at an instant.\n\n  Indeed, long before this tragedy occurred, the Senate was put on \nnotice by Amtrak that its tunnels were aging and had safety \ndifficulties. Indeed, the six tunnels leading to Penn Station in New \nYork under the Hudson River were built between 1911 and 1920. The \nSenate has been told they do not have ventilation. They do not have \nstanding firehoses, and they do not have escape routes.\n  The Senate would like to deal with transportation safety by securing \nairplanes. If only life were so easy. It is more complex because \ntransportation in our country is more complex.\n  Imagine the scenes of people attempting to escape the World Trade \nCenter. You can get a concept of what it would be like for people \ntrying to get from under the Baltimore tunnels or the Hudson River \ntunnels, if there were a fire or other emergency. Five hundred or 1,000 \npeople under Penn Station alone would have to climb up nine stories of \nspiral staircases, which is also the only route for firefighters to \ngain access.\n  It is not just the New York tunnels. The tunnels in Baltimore were \nbuilt in 1877. The engineering was done by the Army Corps of Engineers \nduring the Civil War. They still operate. High-speed railroads \npurchased by this Senate at the cost of billions of dollars, which \noperate at 150 miles per hour, slow to 30 miles per hour in these \ntunnels to navigate their Civil War engineering. One hundred sixty \ntrains carrying thousands and thousands of passengers go through each \nof these tunnels every day in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, \nBaltimore, and, indeed, Washington, DC, itself.\n  The tunnels to Union Station in Washington that travel alongside the \nSupreme Court annex building were built in 1907 and service up to 60 \ntrains every single day and have the same difficulties.\n  This is not a new problem. It has been coming for years. It is a \nproblem in efficiency. It is an economic problem. But what looms most \nlarge today is it is an enormous safety problem. All of us must do \neverything possible to secure air safety, but if this Senate acts upon \nair safety without dealing with these Amtrak and commuter trains, we \nhave not fully met our responsibility. Closing the barn door is not \ngood enough when we can see open doors all around us that are other \ninvitations for attack.\n  Amtrak has proposed a $3.2 billion program to enhance safety: One, a \n$471 million security plan to assure that there are police in proximity \nto trains, bomb-sniffing dogs, and bomb detection equipment for \nluggage--uncompromisable, logical, and essential--two, a command center \nand new communications equipment to ensure that the police are in \ncontact with all trains, all police units at all times, including a \nhazmat detection and response system and fencing to assure that access \nto stations and trains can be controlled; third, $1 billion in safety \nand structural improvements for tunnels in New York, New Jersey, \nBaltimore, and Washington, as I have outlined, for fire and escape, and \na billion dollars in capacity enhancement for rail, bridges, and \nswitching stations along the Northeast corridor to deal with what has \nbeen a 40- to 50-percent increase in ridership since the September 11 \nattacks. This is necessitated by the need to have 608 additional seats \nfrom 18 Metroliners and Acela trains to deal with this demand, and to \nassure that the Nation has at least a duplicity of service for our \nmajor northeastern metropolitan regions, so if air travel is \ninterrupted again, or lost, there is some means of commerce, travel, \nand communication.\n\n  But indeed, while it is much of the Northeast, it is not entirely the \nNortheast. Amtrak trains, in a national emergency, could be the only \ncommunication with the South, great Western cities, and, most \nobviously, in the Midwest. This is a danger that confronts all \nAmericans. But, frankly, if it only concerns a single city in a single \nState in a great Union, when our citizens are in danger and the Nation \nhas been attacked, and a program of security and safety is required, we \nshould deal with those safety requirements that affect all States, as \nwith our airliners. But even the least among us should be part of that \nprogram--to assure that their unique transportation needs are safe and \nsecure.\n  This debate will be held tomorrow. I know some people would like to \navoid it entirely. It is unpleasant to have any differences. We all \nwant to agree on everything. In this instance, it may not be necessary. \nBut some of us have raised this issue of expanded rail capacity and \nrail safety not for months but for years. Forgive me, but across my \nState there are 3,000 families who have lost a son, or a daughter, or a \nmother, or a father--not to injury but to death. This is not a \ntheoretical problem. Terrorism has struck my State, as it struck \nWashington and New York--only it may have consumed even more of our \nlives. While it is every American's loss, you can understand we feel it \nmost acutely. For me, responding to the attack will never be enough. \nOur responsibility is to forecast the next problem and assure that it \nnever happens. We are grateful for resources for the victims, but our \nduty is to assure that there are no more victims. That is what Amtrak \nand rail safety is all about. This debate will be had tomorrow. It is \none we dare not lose.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the previous order entered, I be allowed to speak for \nup to 5 minutes, and then have the Senate adjourn at that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10255-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10255-S10256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REOPENING NATIONAL AIRPORT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I had a longer speech I wanted to give \nwith charts and graphs and items such as that, but I want to take the \ntime this evening to just register my deepest concern about the \nreopening of National Airport. This goes back a long way with me. I \nremember when however many billions of dollars was put into modernizing \nNational Airport, and I have been saying for many years that it is just \nan accident waiting to happen. Quite frankly, we were very lucky when \nthe Air Florida flight crashed into the bridge, in that it didn't get \nany higher and crash into downtown Georgetown or the Lincoln Memorial \nor the Jefferson Memorial.\n  I remember that day as though it were yesterday, when that Air \nFlorida flight took off and crashed into the 14th Street Bridge. I \nthought at that time--maybe if it had a little bit less ice on the \nwings, a little bit more power, and a few things were different--about \nwhere that plane might have come down. Whatever the reason for having \nNational Airport located where it was in the past, I think those \nreasons have been shunted aside and overcome, right now at least, by \nwhat happened on September 11.\n  Notwithstanding the act of the terrorists, I still believe National \nAirport is still an accident waiting to happen. The approaches--I don't \ncare what anybody says--are intricate and hard to fly in the best of \nconditions. You have an airport where, as one of our briefings told \nus--I think one of the people who briefed us about National Airport \nsaid that if you are in a landing configuration, the time from the \nairport to the Capitol is less than 30 seconds; from there to the White \nHouse is less than 20 seconds, and to the Pentagon it is less than 15 \nseconds. There is no way you can put a perimeter or fence around \nWashington, DC, if you have an\n\n[[Page S10256]]\n\nairport such as National right downtown. You can't do it.\n  So, therefore, I have thought for a long time that National Airport \nought to be moved someplace further out in Virginia. It is true that we \nneed an airport, but it ought to be either down 95 or out west \nsomeplace, outside the city, so you can put a 20-mile or so perimeter \naround this city into which no aircraft is allowed. And then you might \nhave a good perimeter defense of Washington, DC.\n  But I have the sneaking suspicion that National Airport is being \nopened because it is convenient--convenient to the higher-ups in \nGovernment. It is convenient to us. It is convenient to me; personally, \nit is convenient. I love National Airport. It is 10, 15 minutes from my \nhouse. Otherwise, I have to drive to BWI or Dulles. But I have to put \naside my convenience for what I think is the greater interest of this \ncountry.\n  There has been a lot of talk about how much money we put into \nNational in upgrading it. It is a beautiful facility. But what would it \ncost to replace this Capitol? You could never do it. Or the White House \nor the Lincoln Memorial or the Jefferson Memorial or everything else \nthat is so precious and almost sacred to our Nation?\n  So I disagree that somehow, if we kept it closed, it means the \nterrorists have won. I disagree. I think National ought to be opened \nsomewhere else. There is plenty of open territory outside of \nWashington, DC, to the south and to the west. There are a lot of big \nareas out in Virginia. It would still be an economic income to the \nState of Virginia and the upper Virginia area. It is needed, but it is \nnot needed where it is. So I wanted to register my concern about the \nreopening of National Airport, and, quite frankly, I don't think it \nshould have been there in the first place. If you could turn the clock \nback, it should have been put somewhere else. Certainly, the amount of \nmoney that was put into upgrading it in the last few years, while it is \na magnificent facility, I think was unwise. I said so at the time and I \nsay it again today. There are a lot of things that could be done with \nthat facility there. Look at what they did with Inner Harbor at \nBaltimore. Just think what that would do for tourism with tourist \nattractions beside an airport.\n\n  I see it from two standpoints: First, the defense of Washington, DC, \nand having an adequate perimeter of defense; and, second, because of \nthe type of approaches in and out of National, there is an inherent \ndanger.\n  I wanted to register my concerns. I hope we will take another look at \nthis issue and rebuild National Airport some other place farther \noutside the city.\n  Madam President, my time has expired. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/03/senate-section/article/S10256-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
