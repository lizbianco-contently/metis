Madam President, I stand in this Chamber as a strong \nsupporter of the steel industry. In fact, I would match my record of \nsupport for the steel industry, for steelworkers,\n\n[[Page S4512]]\n\nand for steel retirees, with any person in this Chamber or in the other \nChamber.\n  We have had a long history in western Pennsylvania--from my days in \nthe House and prior to that--in the steel industry. We have dealt with \ncrises, one after another, in this industry. The most recent crisis has \nperhaps been the most crippling, costing lots of companies going into \nbankruptcies, costing lots of steel jobs, and, tragically, lots of \nsteel retirees losing their health care benefits.\n  In the last session of Congress, I worked with Senator Rockefeller to \nfollow through with the U.S. steelworkers' No. 1 priority, which is to \ntry to get a quota bill passed in the Senate. I worked very hard on my \nside of the aisle, and we got a majority of our Members to vote for a \nquota on steel imports.\n  The other side of the aisle was not so generous. In fact, my \nrecollection is, if we had gotten just half the Democrats, we would \nhave been able to pass that, but we did not. So we failed in the No. 1 \nrequest from the United Steelworkers Union.\n  Last year, at the beginning of this session, management and labor got \ntogether, retirees got together, and they came up with their No. 1 \npriority for this Congress. It was to file a section 201 action, to try \nto find comprehensive relief for the steel industry.\n  So like I did the session before, I took on that challenge. I think I \nam very safe in saying I was the first Member of Congress--certainly \nthe first Member of the Senate--to personally ask the President of the \nUnited States to file that action. I did so.\n  I think in his first month in office he was in Beaver County, PA. I \ntalked with him at length about the importance of this industry to \nPennsylvania, to the country, the importance to our steelworkers' and \nto retirees.\n  I continually worked with the President, the Secretary of Commerce, \nour Trade Representative, other Secretaries who were involved--\nSecretary of Treasury--and pushed for the President to file the section \n201 case.\n  After several months of exhorting them to do so, publicly and \nprivately, the President followed through. He followed through and he \nfiled the case. I testified, not once but twice, before the ITC in \nsupport of the section 201 case.\n  When the decision came down, I again went back and worked with the \nadministration on making sure there were adequate remedies. We met on a \ncontinual basis, daily basis toward the end, to make sure that there \nwere adequate remedies. Why? Because the steelworkers, the retirees, \nand the companies understood the most important thing we could do is \nstop the hemorrhaging, stop the bankruptcies of steel companies, \nbecause these companies that were going into bankruptcy now, under the \ncurrent climate of steel, were not going to go into bankruptcy to \nreorganize and come back out again. In most causes, they were going to \nliquidate. That means, when they liquidate, retirees lose their health \ncare benefits, they lose their pension benefits. We lose jobs, too, \nbecause they liquidate. They sell off assets. Some are reused; some are \nnot. The ones that are reused, they have new contracts.\n  The jobs were not as ``lucrative'' as they are today. This is why it \nwas the No. 1 priority, because it helped retirees; it helped workers, \nand it helped companies stay alive and pay benefits and have good-\npaying jobs. I worked and worked and worked, and we got 201 relief that \neveryone in the steel industry feels very good about. It helped \nretirees. There are retirees receiving benefits today who would not be \nreceiving them if the President had not enacted the remedies he did \nunder section 201. That is a fact. There are companies in business \ntoday that would not be in business today if that had not happened. \nThere are companies that did not file bankruptcy.\n  Every steel company in America, maybe with the exception of a major \nsteel company, maybe with the exception of Nucor, had said they were \ngoing to file bankruptcy if 201 remedies were not sufficient. To my \nknowledge, there have been no bankruptcies since 201. The fact is, we \nhave done more for the steel industry, I have worked to do more for the \nsteel industry, than anybody else.\n  There was a second component about which the steelworkers and \nretirees and companies were concerned. That was legacy costs. What was \nthe issue with legacy? Legacy was important because we wanted to help \nretirees have security. But the most important part of the legacy cost, \npicking up the cost, was to encourage the steel industry to \nconsolidate, to become more efficient, to restructure. Why? So they \nwould be stronger entities that would be able to carry those retiree \ncosts in the future and carry those companies in the future.\n  What we were going to do was to help the consolidation by picking up \nsome retiree costs of some companies to encourage these companies to \nconsolidate with stronger entities.\n  A few months ago during the energy debate, I worked with Senator \nStevens and others to try to craft a bill that would do just that. It \nwould be a substantial benefit to enough retirees to encourage the \nsteel industry to consolidate and become more efficient, become \nstronger in competition with foreign competitors.\n  We had an amendment to the ANWR drilling bill. Why was it an \namendment to the ANWR bill? Because ANWR produced billions upon \nbillions of dollars in revenue to the Federal Government that we could \nuse to help pay for retiree benefits. We could fully fund a program \nthat would incentivize restructuring. The whole purpose of doing the \nretiree benefit was to incentivize restructuring so we could have a \nmore stable industry to take care of retirees for the long term and \nprovide better quality jobs for the long term.\n  We offered a piece of legislation that did that. Let me be very \nclear. The steelworkers unions walked away. They walked away. Why? \nBecause it was on a bill they were not in favor of. It was on a bill, \nANWR, that they were not in favor of and that the majority leader was \nnot in favor of, and many others from the other side. They walked away. \nWhy? Politics. They walked away from a comprehensive restructuring of \nlegacy costs. Why? Politics.\n  Of the people who are offering this amendment on which cloture will \nbe voted on Tuesday, of the seven sponsors of that amendment, six voted \nagainst a comprehensive legacy cost restructuring; six of the seven \nvoted no on a much more comprehensive benefit that would have \nincentivized restructuring of the steel industry.\n  What are we offering today? We are offering a very narrow 1-year \nbenefit that will not only do nothing to encourage restructuring but, \nfrom the industry representatives I have talked to, will in fact do the \nopposite. It will discourage restructuring because of the way it is so \nlimited in its application. It picks winners and losers.\n\n  Yes, we will provide retirement benefits to retirees of companies \nthat have gone bankrupt and stopped paying retiree benefits for health \ncare. We will do that for 1 year. But the consequence of it is, we will \nnot get the restructuring we need.\n  I am opposed to this amendment, not because I am opposed to the \nSenate doing something to pick up restructuring costs for the industry, \nnot because I am opposed to having something done in the Senate to help \npick up retiree health care costs. This is the wrong step. It is \npolitics. It is raw, blatant politics. What is this amendment attached \nto? It is attached to the bill to which virtually every one of the \nsponsors of the legislation is opposed. You have heard from many on my \nside of the aisle and a few on the other who have said if this \namendment is included, they will vote against the trade bill. They will \nsink this bill.\n  So what are we doing? We are playing a cruel hoax. It is a hoax. We \nare playing a hoax on retirees. We are playing a hoax on steelworkers. \nWe are playing a hoax on the steel industry. The hoax is that this is \nsomehow going to help retirees. In the long term it will not. It will \nnot lead to the restructuring of the steel industry. What this will do \nis help sink the trade bill, which I know many who are supporting this \namendment would love to see. But that is a hoax. To stand up and say \nyou are for retirees when you are introducing a piece of legislation \nthat is going to be counter to restructuring, which is the best thing \nwe can do for retirees, is a hoax.\n\n[[Page S4513]]\n\n  Yes, I am opposed to this legislation. It doesn't solve the problem. \nIt is politics in its rawest, in its most crass form. You are preying \non retirees who desperately need health care. You are playing politics \nwith their health. It is wrong. It is not the right course.\n  We had a chance to do the right thing for the industry, for workers, \nand for retirees, and because of politics, under ANWR, the answer was \nno. Now we play politics again, and we play with people's lives. The \nanswer should be no.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, as one of the Senators representing \nthe steelworkers in the upper peninsula and throughout Michigan, I wish \nto indicate, contrary to my colleague who just spoke, that I can't \nthink of a more appropriate place to talk about helping steel retirees \nwho have lost their health insurance, those who have lost and will lose \ntheir jobs because of unfair competition, unfair steel dumping, unfair \ntrade practices, than to debate it and attempt to fix it on a trade \nbill. I hope my colleagues will support standing up for our steel \nretirees on the trade bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/17/senate-section/article/S4513-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4513-S4514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise to speak about one of the most \nimportant issues affecting our families, seniors, the business \ncommunity, every part of our economy. That is the explosion in the cost \nof prescription drugs. Prices are skyrocketing, and too many of our \nseniors who use the majority of prescriptions--our seniors on average \nare using 18 different prescriptions in a year--find themselves in a \nsituation that is absolutely untenable. We have heard these stories \nover and over again.\n  On this side of the aisle, we have two ideas we are putting forward. \nFirst, we have to have an updated Medicare to cover prescription drugs. \nWe have to do it in a way that is comprehensive and helps our seniors. \nI call upon my colleagues from the other side and in the House of \nRepresentatives to join us in real prescription drug coverage.\n  Secondly, we know we have to lower the price. Prices need to go down \nfor everyone. When I talk to our small business community, I talk to \nfarmers in the State of Michigan, I talk to the big three automakers, \nwherever I am in Michigan talking about the cost of doing business, \neveryone wants to talk about health care. They understand that the \nexplosion in their health care premium is because of the uncontrollable \ncost of prescription drugs.\n  I have been putting forward, and have met with a number of my \ncolleagues, four different ideas. I will speak specifically about a \nbill we are now introducing that we talked about yesterday with \ncolleagues. There are four different ideas we have been promoting. If \nwe did those things, prices would go down. Prices would go down \nimmediately. Even as we know any kind of comprehensive Medicare \nprescription drug benefit will take time to phase in, there are things \nwe can do now.\n  The American people, who subsidize the research, who underwrite the \ncost for tax credits and deductions for the development of these drugs, \ndeserve to see something happen now.\n  First is to make sure the generic laws work. I commend my colleagues, \nSenators Schumer and McCain, for their continuing efforts. We have a \nbill that will close loopholes, that will stop the ability of the drug \ncompanies to be able to manipulate the law so that lower priced \ngenerics are precluded from the market. We know if that were to pass, \nwe could see a tremendous drop in prices. We know if we opened the \nborder to Canada so that we could in fact see not only individuals but \nbusinesses and hospitals and pharmacies developing business \nrelationships across the border to bring back American-made, safe, FDA-\napproved drugs, we could drop prices almost in half.\n  I find it ironic, as we are in the middle of a discussion on a trade \nbill, that the only things you cannot take back and forth across the \nborder from the great State of Michigan into Canada are American-made \nprescription drugs. So we need to open the border. I welcome colleagues \njoining us to do that. We could drop prices tomorrow 40 to 50 percent \nif we did that.\n  Thirdly, we know that since the FDA changed their rules on \nadvertising, direct consumer advertising, starting back in the mid-\n1990s, there has been an explosion of excessive advertising. While \ncompanies say they spend more on research than advertising, there is \ngreat evidence to the contrary. So we have introduced legislation to \nsay simply that you can write off as much advertising and marketing \nexpenses on your taxes, that taxpayers will subsidize advertising and \nmarketing to the same level we subsidize research--the same level. If \nyou want to do more advertising, do more research, because taxpayers \nwant to see the research done.\n  Then, finally, I joined with my colleagues, Senators Durbin, Leahy, \nLevin, Boxer, Dorgan, and others to introduce legislation to give \nStates the flexibility to set up programs to pass a law on Medicaid \ndiscounts to their citizens who don't have prescription drug coverage \nand are not eligible for Medicaid.\n  There are 30 States that have enacted some kind of a law to help \ncitizens with prescription drug coverage. Unfortunately, we have seen \nthe drugmakers trade association, PhRMA, mounting legal challenges to a \nnumber of States that have attempted to lower prices for their \ncitizens. They have fought these efforts. I am specifically referring \nto lawsuits against Maine and Vermont because the drug lobby doesn't \nwant them to extend the Medicaid discount--the price that is paid for \nMedicaid--to those who are not Medicaid recipients but need help, who \ndon't have prescription drug coverage. So we have introduced the Rx \nFlexibility for States Act. We are calling it the Rx Flex Program. It \nwill simply say that what is being done in States, what is innovative, \nin our attempts to reach out and use the purchasing power of the States \nunder Medicaid to provide additional price reductions to those who \ndon't have insurance, who are not on Medicaid--that those are legal.\n  We have heard colleagues on both sides of the aisle, both sides of \nthis great Capitol Building, talk about the States as being the place \nfor flexibility, creativity, and new ideas. Well, this legislation says \nwe are going to remove the legal hurdles that are preventing States \nfrom providing lower priced prescription drugs to all of their \ncitizens.\n  Right now, we have States that are spending millions of dollars \nfighting suits from the drug companies because the companies fight \neverything that is attempted that would lower prices for our citizens.\n  This legislation specifically would indicate that those States that \nare using the clout of Medicaid purchasing power to expand to allow \nthat same price to be given to those without prescription drug \ncoverage, who are in need of prescription drug help in their States, \nwould be able to do that. Right now, the lawsuits have been filed. We \nknow that while Maine's program has been upheld in court, Vermont's \nprogram was not, and both States are embroiled in very lengthy appeals \nprocesses.\n  I am very hopeful that as we are working to put together a very \nstrong, effective Medicare prescription drug program, we can also pass \nthis legislation to reinforce that States, on their own, can proceed to \ndo what is necessary to make sure their citizens have access to lower \npriced prescription drugs and that we will pass those other measures we \nhave been talking about that will allow us to lower prices, create more \ncompetition across the border, get a better balance between advertising \nand marketing expenses and research, and that we will be able to create \na system where we in America not only create the best drugs, the new \nlifesaving medications, where we don't only subsidize and underwrite \nand fund the research through the National Institutes of Health, and \nother mechanisms, but our people can actually get those drugs.\n  Right now, it is not a good deal when we are the ones who are \ncreating, supporting, and subsidizing the creation of these \nmedications. Seniors will sit down this morning, this noon, and tonight \nand decide: Do I eat, pay the electric bill, pay my rent, or can I get \nmy medicine this week?\n  We can do better. I am committed to doing better. Colleagues of mine \nare committed to doing better. We want a\n\n[[Page S4514]]\n\nprescription drug benefit. We want to lower prices. There are ways to \ndo it. We can do it now. I ask my colleagues to join with us in this \neffort.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/17/senate-section/article/S4514-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, last evening in the debate, we had a good \ndiscussion of the need for the Senate to affirm through this action \ntoday that NATO should be expanded as a general principle. We also \nestablished that there ought to be very careful criteria for that \nexpansion and examination of each of the candidates, as opposed to a \ndone deal at the end of the trail, in which the Senate then receives a \ntreaty without that careful examination country by country.\n  I have appreciated the colloquy with the Senator from Virginia, \nSenator Biden, and myself in which I think we established both of those \nfacts--the desirability for a more robust NATO, and that would include \nmore members, likewise--members that in fact carry their weight. As the \nSenator from Virginia pointed out, Americans may be involved in an \narticle 5 declaration to defend those countries that would come in. In \naddition, we would anticipate that they would defend us.\n  Madam President, I point out that we are having this debate at this \npoint very largely because the President of the United States has asked \nus to have it. Likewise, we have received correspondence from the \nSecretary of State and the Secretary of Defense pointing out how \nimperative it is that we take this action to affirm that the United \nStates stands solidly in terms of expansion of NATO and the careful \nconsideration of its membership.\n  The act we discuss today also has money for seven candidates, on the \npresumption that these are serious candidates, that this money will \nmake a difference in terms of training, interoperability of equipment, \nthe general proposition as partners for peace. These nations have \ndemonstrated great interest in the alliance and therefore deserve our \nhelp.\n  We pointed out last evening, in fact, the money was appropriated last \nDecember--the money is out there. This is the authorization of the \nmoney. Some have asked, is the authorization following too far behind? \nOur response is, no, if we take action.\n  This is why the President wants this action prior to his taking a \nvery important trip to the summit with President Putin in Russia next \nweek.\n  Madam President, I hope that today we will join in support of the \nFreedom Consolidation Act of 2001 because this bill provides assistance \nto the nations, as I mentioned. It gives us an opportunity for Congress \nto affirm our solidarity with our allies and our confidence in the \nfuture of the alliance.\n  I point out that our own President, George Bush, gave an important \nspeech last year in Warsaw in which he said:\n\n       All of Europe's new democracies from the Baltic to the \n     Black Sea and all that lie between should have the same \n     chance for security and freedom.\n\n  He went on to say he believed ``in NATO membership for all of \nEurope's democracies that seek it and are ready to share the \nresponsibility that NATO brings.''\n  The cold war may be over, but the security and welfare of America and \nEurope are very closely linked, and our common goal must continue to be \nthe building of a Europe which is whole and free.\n  I mentioned in the debate last evening my own visits last September \nto the three Baltic States--Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania--and Romania, \nand Bulgaria to visit with leadership about the specific criteria. That \nvisit has been replicated by other Senators, most recently by our \nAmbassador to NATO, Mr. Burns, who has laid out a very concrete plan \nfor each of those nations to affirm their interest and to give us a \nbasis to judge that interest.\n  I finally point out that NATO is a truly remarkable institution \nbecause its members have joined together to assure that the ideals we \nshare--we have a collective, moral, and military strength--are enhanced \nin the world at a time of the war on terrorism, at a time in which \nliterally the dispute as to whether out of area or out of business has \ngone by the boards.\n  The war is out of area, by definition. The threats are all over the \nworld. The need for flexibility and for more of us to be involved is \napparent. As President Bush pointed out, that means filling in the \ngeography of Europe--Romania and Bulgaria and the southeast part--which \nis so important as a link not only to Greece and Turkey, our allies, \nbut to the Middle East. The Baltic States were altogether \nmischaracterized by the former Soviet Union. They were always \nindependent. We reaffirm that is the case. We see this as a cardinal \nprinciple of this legislation.\n  Finally, I point out that NATO is the alliance that places us in \nEurope. We are not a part of the European Union. We are a part of the \ntransatlantic military alliance with headquarters in Brussels, with an \nAmerican who has been in charge for many years. It is tremendously \nimportant. We appreciate Europe, and NATO is the major way in which we \nindicate that appreciation and participation.\n  The question now is, Should we expand that to countries that have \ntaken on democracy, have taken on defense responsibilities, have shown \nthrough the Partnership for Peace their eagerness and their willingness \nto be with us?\n  My answer is in the affirmative, and I hope the Senate will vote \noverwhelmingly in favor of this action today that our President be \nfortified as he proceeds into important diplomacy.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I yield to our distinguished colleague \nfrom Texas 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  It is very important for the United States and Europe to have the \nkind of alliance that NATO has been. It has been the greatest defensive \nalliance in the history of the world, but I feel as if I am \nexperiencing deja vu all over again.\n  The Senate is once again considering a measure to endorse the \nexpansion of NATO without having satisfactorily addressed any of the \nsame questions that loomed over the alliance 4 years ago when we made \nthe first recent expansion.\n  In April of 1998, this body voted to expand NATO without articulating \na rationale for NATO in the post-cold-war era, without calculating a \nreliable estimate of the cost of the expansion, without establishing an \ninteralliance dispute resolution process, without evaluating the \nmilitaries of the respective candidates to see what they offered and \nwhere their problems were, and without determining how the alliance can \neffectively coordinate military action amongst an even larger and more \nunwieldy membership.\n  Here we are in 2002 with the same questions unanswered, and yet we \nare on the cusp of enlarging again. I have never thought that any of my \nconcerns about the structure and purpose of NATO should be directed at \nany one\n\n[[Page S4515]]\n\ncountry. I do intend to vote for this resolution because I think we \nshould expand the Partnership for Peace, we should get countries ready, \nwe should try to bring their militaries up to speed, and the President \nwants this ability before he goes to Europe. I understand that, and I \nsupport the concept of an alliance with Europe.\n  What is the alliance's purpose? This is a defensive alliance to \nprotect the democracies of Western Europe from the Communist threat of \nthe East. That threat has evaporated. Our President is going to make an \nagreement with Russia in the next week that will have a mutual \ndisarmament pact that will bring down our stash of nuclear weapons and \ntheir stash of nuclear weapons. We are friends with the Russians.\n  Today the threat for which NATO was first put in place is gone. We \nshould have a strategic military alliance, but we need to talk about \nwhat functions it will have. If we are going to go offensive, as we did \nin Kosovo, how are we going to do it? Everyone knows the problems we \nhad in trying to get unanimity when we were bombing Serbia. Everybody \nknows that was an almost impossible task. Yet here we are talking about \nadding new members without talking about what kinds of offensive \nalliances we are going to have.\n  In fact, as we are looking now at the hotspots around the world, some \nof the NATO allies agree with what we are doing in certain places; some \nhave been less helpful. We need to have a purpose for NATO, or are we \ngoing to set our alliances according to the operations and interests of \ndifferent parties involved so that we should stretch our dollars in a \nway that allows us the flexibility to determine which alliances we will \nhave for any particular operation?\n  The cost of NATO is a big one for the United States. One-half of our \npermanent foreign forces are in Europe. We have a commitment to provide \n25 percent of the NATO budget. We spend $170 million to $180 million in \nmilitary construction for NATO, and we have a $500 million commitment \nfor U.S. military construction in NATO countries. So we are talking \nabout almost $1 billion, about three-quarters of a billion dollars in \nconstruction costs in European countries and/or NATO. That is a big \npart of our budget when we also have major commitments in the Middle \nEast, major commitments in Korea in the DMZ, and major commitments, of \ncourse, ongoing in Afghanistan, the Philippines, and places regarding \nthe war on terrorism.\n  We need to assess the costs before we go forward with this kind of \nprocess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator for yielding me the time. I think \nwe are not ready to do this, but I certainly am not against expansion \nof NATO.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I rise to express my support for the \nFreedom Consolidation Act of 2001.\n  I support this bill because I support the enlargement of the NATO \nalliance to admit qualified nations and that is, at its essence, what \nthis bill does. I would not support this bill if it supported \nenlargement without conditioning enlargement on nations being willing \nand able to assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership. \nI also would not support this bill if it sought to identify one or more \nnations as being qualified for NATO membership. Since this bill does \nneither of those things, I support the bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I am please to join my \ndistinguished colleague and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee to discuss the merits of the Freedom Consolidation Act.\n  Like Senator Warner, I have been deeply troubled by aspects of NATO \nexpansion and by what NATO expansion means in the post-cold-war era. \nNATO's original mission was clearly understood--we were standing up to \nthe Soviet threat. Today, NATO's mission is very unclear, and the \norganization itself has become a bloated bureaucracy where politics \noften dictate military decisions.\n  NATO's involvement in the Balkans and the manner in which military \noperations were conducted during the Kosovo air campaign are prime \nexamples of a NATO without a clear mission and with a broken \ndecisionmaking structure.\n  Let me make one thing clear--I believe every nation deserves the \nright to self-determination. I am proud to state that I was an early \nadvocate of Baltic independence from the Soviet Union even when some in \nthe U.S. Government were opposed to the breakup of the Soviet Union. I \nhave great admiration for the Baltic people--the Latvians, the \nLithuanians, and the Estonians--they all suffered greatly and they \ndeserve to be free nations as do all nations. I can understand their \ndesire to join NATO and to integrate more fully into Western \ninstitutions. However, I believe that before we even consider expanding \nNATO, we must have a clear understanding of the mission of NATO.\n  For example, just the other day, NATO accepted Russia as a junior \npartner of sorts. Russia will now participate as an equal partner in \nmany of the discussions and decisions of NATO. How do we reconcile the \nexpansion of NATO to countries that Russia is opposed to admitting to \nNATO? We also have to consider Russia's own problems, such as the \nconflict in Chechnya--could NATO and the United States be pulled into \nthe Chechnya conflict? We must also consider, frankly, whether NATO is \nrelevant in today's world.\n  Hopefully, we are finding that coalitions for the sake of coalitions \nare not necessary. As European countries continue to downsize their \nmilitaries, the burden on the United States becomes greater and \ngreater. Increasing its membership without significant reforms and a \nbetter understanding of its mission, does not make sense.\n  NATO is becoming a mini-U.N., an unwieldy and overgrown organization \nwhich will demand much of us, our commitment, our military, our \nnational wealth, but which will return little to us for our investment. \nAlthough I understand a country's desire to join NATO, we must first \naddress the many problems in NATO before we even consider expanding its \nmembership. Therefore, I will vote against this legislation, not \nbecause I do not support the security needs of the countries of the \nBaltic and Eastern Europe, but because the mission of NATO and the \norganization itself need serious work.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I rise today to voice support for Freedom \nConsolidation Act of 2002 of which I am an original cosponsor.\n  Over 5 years ago, as Governor of Virginia I visited Poland, the Czech \nRepublic, and Hungary. I supported the admission of these Central \nEuropean countries into NATO. And, wisely about 4 years ago the U.S. \nCongress enacted legislation that would ensure that Poland, Hungary, \nand the Czech Republic were not the last emerging or reborn democracies \nto join the NATO. That was the right decision then and it is the right \ndecision now. We should bring such aspiring democracies into our fold. \nAnd include them in the important decisions and responsibilities that \naffect the world as a whole. The nations seeking admittance have worked \nhard to meet the strict requirements. Many of these nations have \nundergone monumental changes from the days of communist occupation that \nhave positively transformed them into freely elected, legitimate \ngovernments. Expanding the alliance to include nations that have made \ngreat changes in establishing human freedoms in their laws and \npractices is consistent with the 1949 NATO Treaty preamble which reads:\n\n       [The Parties] are determined to safeguard the freedom, \n     common heritage and civilization of their peoples, founded on \n     the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule \n     of law . . .\n\n  It is in the best interest of the United States to nurture young \ndemocracies around the world. Coach them on the great values and \nprinciples stated in the NATO preamble. Working toward fulfilling the \nrequirements of NATO's Membership Action Plan, shows the commitment \naspirant nations have made to NATO's basic principles: collective \ndefense; common values; and the promotion of democracy.\n  NATO membership is a catalyst for Western values, principles and \nactions. It is to the benefit of the United States and NATO to ensure \nthe security of nations that desire a place among the community of \ndemocracies. The Freedom Consolidation Act of 2002 does not\n\n[[Page S4516]]\n\npredict which nations will be chosen, nor should it. Instead it sends a \nclear message to nations aspiring to freedom. That message is: Your \nefforts have been recognized and future progress will be rewarded with \nadmittance to the most effective treaty organization in history.\n  It is very difficult to consider any issue related to international \nrelations without viewing it in the context of the September 11th \nterrorist attacks. We must remember the nations that arose to stand \nwith the United States mere hours after the horrifying attacks. When \nthe United States needed support, it did not have to make calls, NATO \nwas there--ready and poised to act along side of our nation. Passing \nthe Freedom Consolidation Act is but one step we can take to ensure \ncontinued support through NATO. During this war on terrorism the United \nStates has recognized that we cannot live alone in this world, \nespecially in intercepting terrorist finances, gathering information, \nas well assisting with personal, equipment, and military operation \nsupport. Countries all over the globe have been instrumental in our \nsuccess and their assistance continues to expose the people that \nplanned and carried out those vile acts.\n  The varied contributions of NATO allies and aspirants include: \nreconnaissance, refueling, Special Forces missions and many other \nsignificant duties that have aided our troops. This cooperative effort \nis a great example of the useful necessity of NATO. As we expand this \njust war into new regions, we need to develop new relationships and \nallies to ensure the safety of the world's democracies. I know there \nare many of my colleagues questioning the value of bringing new members \ninto the alliance. There is sentiment that these nations are receiving \na great benefit while adding little. I would dispute that argument; \nNATO is not a free ticket. All who aspire to join NATO work hard to \nmake the kind of military, economic, and democratic reforms necessary \nto gain membership. This makes them a stable ally, and during these \nchaotic times we need committed partners. Many of those being \nconsidered for membership have proven their mettle. They have seen the \ncost of war, the value of freedom, and have stood strong with America.\n  As we consider new members we must also revisit the responsibilities \nof the existing nations. We must continue to urge our partners to \nprepare and improve their military capabilities. My colleague and good \nfriend Senator John Warner said it best, ``NATO is first and foremost a \nmilitary alliance.'' NATO must address the growing imbalance between \nthe United States and our European partners. It is not in the best \ninterest of the alliance or European nations to have the United States \nshoulder such a large part of the military burden. Senator Warner's \ninsight is important and should be a top priority for the young \ndemocracies we hope to bring into the strongest alliance on Earth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, last December I watched carefully as the \nSenate received from the House this legislation which we are about to \nadopt. I urge Senators to vote for it. There will be one ``no'' vote, \nin my judgment. That is the Senator from Virginia. I do so for the \nfollowing reasons: I believe this subject deserved debate, and that is \nwhy I interposed an objection on the UC to have this passed last \nDecember, 40-some millions of dollars of taxpayers' money to give to \nthese nations.\n  If we were able to separate this legislation between authorization \nfor these funds, I would vote for it because I think it is important we \nexpend these funds for these nations which are trying very hard, some \nnine nations--although the money applied to only seven of the nine--\nseven nations which are trying to put together, within their respective \ncountries, the fabric and the infrastructure necessary to hopefully \nqualify for NATO.\n  I am in favor of some expansion. I am not against any country. I am \nnot for any country. The purpose of my objecting was I believed the \nSenate should have a debate before we passed it. I thought I was \nsuccessful, but in the darkness of the Senate, as so often happens, the \nappropriators appropriated the money. So it was a hollow act on my \npart.\n  At long last we had a very good debate last night and I succeeded in \nmy objectives: Clarifying with the two distinguished colleagues on the \nfloor, the chairman and the ranking member, that this language, which I \ndeem as an invitation to join--if one looks at the overall rhetoric, \none sees it is very skillfully put together. It commits the Senate and \nthe Congress to nothing other than the authorization of funds, but I \nthink it could be misinterpreted and misleading to the aspirant \nnations, and the people, the journalists, and all who will cover the \nactions by the Senate and, indeed, the Congress now to approve that.\n  I say so for these reasons. The act is entitled the ``Gerald B.H. \nSolomon Freedom Consolidation Act of 2001.''\n  Turning to the dictionary, I read the meaning of ``consolidation'': \nTo bring together into a single whole, unite and combine.\n  This is a bad choice of words, in my judgment. This sends a message \nthat all nine, or all seven, should join. I think we lose sight of the \npurpose of NATO--it is a military organization--which is only if there \nis a compelling military rationale for additional members, and each \nmember must be fully ready and prepared to take up their \nresponsibilities under article 5, which says an attack on one is an \nattack on all.\n  So I will vote no, probably the only one, but I will continue to be a \nwatchdog or, as some of my colleagues said, a ``barnyard dog.'' I am \ngoing to make certain this Senate carefully reviews those credentials, \nand we will not have, I say with respect to my chairman and ranking \nmember, suddenly a beautifully embossed document from the President of \nthe United States as a consequence of meetings abroad, and here they \nare.\n  Do you think this Senate is going to go into it with that document \nfor ratification and single out countries? We cannot do it that way. We \nhave to do our work beforehand. I repeat, we have to do careful work. I \nwill move in my committee, the Armed Services Committee. I hope my \ncolleagues will do likewise. To those of us who can travel to these \nnations, I urge that we do so.\n  My motives and goals for opposing this legislation are very simple. I \nam not against an orderly, well thought out process leading to some \nmeasure of expansion; my fight is for preservation.\n  NATO is the most extraordinary military treaty in the history of \nmankind. Let's not sow the seeds of its demise.\n  This legislation being voted on today can be divided into two parts: \none, authorize appropriations--which I support--for seven of the nine \naspirant nations; and two, a compilation of rhetoric, primarily quotes \nextracted from speeches and documents, which form a matrix that can \neasily mislead people into believing that the United States Congress, \nby enactment of this legislation, is sending an invitation to one and \nall aspirants to join NATO. They need only RSVP in the affirmative.\n  I think we all agree that we are months away from deciding on which \nof the aspirant nations meet the criteria to be invited to join NATO. \nTherefore we should not be on the verge of adopting legislation that \nimplies that aspirants ``from the Baltic to the Black Sea and all that \nlie between'' should be invited to join the Alliance.\n  I speak and vote against this legislation not as a sign that I oppose \nNATO expansion, but rather as a warning that we simply do not have the \nfacts before us to render an informed judgement on the message this \nlegislation sends across the Atlantic.\n  In closing, I would urge my colleagues to review the statement my \ngood friend Mr. Lantos made on November 7, 2001 in the House of \nRepresentatives. On page H7867 on that day's Congressional Record, Mr. \nLantos stated:\n\n       And I strongly endorse the statements of the 10 applicant \n     countries that eventual NATO membership for all of them will \n     be a success for the United States, for Europe and for NATO.\n\n  While I deeply respect my friend's good intentioned views, that \nstatement makes it clear to me that the proponents of this legislation \nhave already reached the conclusion that all applicants should be \ninvited to join NATO. I believe it is to early in the process to reach \nthat conclusion.\n\n[[Page S4517]]\n\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. How much time is available to the Senator from Delaware?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. How much is in the control of the Senator from Virginia?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute, fourteen seconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I will let the Senator from Virginia \nclose.\n  I can assure my distinguished colleague from Virginia that Senator \nLugar, I, and others in the Foreign Relations Committee will have \nthorough hearings on this, as we did before.\n  This bill merely reaffirms the open-door policy for NATO enlargement \nwhich was first enunciated by the Clinton administration and now has \nbeen continued by the Bush administration. It does not authorize new \nfunds that would throw the budget out of whack. It merely authorizes \nmonies that have already been appropriated by the Arms Export Control \nAct.\n  Voting for this legislation does not indicate any Member's intention \nto vote for or against any potential aspirant to NATO. Exactly which \ncountries will be invited by the alliance is a decision that will be \nmade more than 6 months from now at a NATO summit in Prague, and \nthorough Senate debate on ratification of NATO enlargement will occur \nsometime at the end of this year and the beginning of the next. \nEveryone is going to have an opportunity to decide whether they are for \nor against this.\n  I remind my colleagues that 4 years ago, the Senate spent 7 lengthy \ndays in floor debate on the ratification of admission to NATO of \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. I managed that resolution, and \nI am certain the Senate will scrutinize the aspirants invited to \nPrague, just as we did in 1998. What the bill does mean is that the \nSenate authorizes the foreign military financing assistance to help \nthose candidate countries meet the alliance's stringent membership \nrequirements.\n  This bill will help NATO extend the zone of stability eastward and \nsouthward on the continent so that sometime within the next decade we \nwill be able to say for the first time, I think, in all of modern \nhistory that we have a Europe whole and free.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Freedom Consolidation Act. I \nyield the floor to my friend from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my two colleagues, the chairman and the ranking \nmember, for an excellent debate. Other Members have participated, but \nlet us not forget that this is a military alliance, and in the event \ntroops are called out, our men and women in the Armed Forces will \noccupy the foxholes, the tanks, the revetments, and take the risks \nalongside the others.\n  What concerns me about NATO is this--I quote not the Senator from \nVirginia but Secretary General Lord Robertson of NATO:\n\n       The United States must have partners who can contribute \n     their fair share to operations which benefit the entire Euro-\n     Atlantic community. . . . But the reality is . . . hardly any \n     European country can deploy usable and effective forces in \n     significant numbers outside their borders, and sustain them \n     for months or even years, as we all need to do today. For all \n     Europe's rhetoric, an annual investment of over $140 billion \n     by NATO's European members, we still need U.S. help to move, \n     command and provision a major operation. American critics of \n     Europe's military incapability are right. So if we are to \n     ensure that the United States moves towards neither \n     unilateralism nor isolationism, all European countries must \n     show a new willingness to develop effective crisis management \n     capabilities.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. This quote clearly indicates we have to be a watchdog of \nNATO as we begin to invite in more and more countries.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield 1 minute to Mr. Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I merely want to say I endorse the \nstatements made by the Senator from Virginia.\n  I want to explain my rationale for not supporting H.R. 3167, the NATO \nExpansion Act.\n  In 1998, I voted to support the last round of NATO enlargement which \nculminated in the assession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic.\n  Over the past 2 years, at least two of these countries have not made \nmuch progress in restructuring and modernizing their military forces \nand infrastructure.\n  I am concerned that this bill provides an open invitation to the 10 \ncandidate countries, irrespective of their readiness or qualifications.\n  We should strongly support countries into the alliance that are ready \nfor NATO membership and that can significantly contribute to the \nEuropean security mission.\n  We first need to determine what is the long-term mission of NATO, \nthen assess how countries can contribute to that mission, and evaluate \neach candidate based on that overall criteria.\n  We need candidate states that can help support the alliance in \nmaintaining peace and stability throughout the region.\n  For example, the United States flew over 60 percent of the combat \nmissions in the Kosovo conflict. We need to look for capabilities that \nenhance the alliance and its members, not detract from it nor add \nsubstantial costs.\n  There is also a significant price tag for bringing nations into NATO \nthat are not ready for membership. The alliance, to which the United \nStates already contributes about 25 percent of the costs, will have to \nprovide financial assistance to help these countries modernize their \nArmed Forces and infrastructure.\n  We do not know the overall cost to do this, but it is my hope that we \nshould carefully proceed with NATO expansion and weigh each nation's \nreadiness to become a full partner in NATO.\n  I urge the member nations of NATO to proceed cautiously and address \nthe issue of expansion with great care.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I come to the floor to express my \nsupport for H.R. 3167, the Freedom Consolidation Act. Last week I \nreceived a letter from Secretaries Powell and Rumsfeld expressing their \nsupport for this bill. President Bush has also requested that the \nSenate consider this bill before he leaves on his trip to Russia next \nWednesday. I am pleased that we could accommodate his request, and I \nwish the President every success on the visit.\n  This is a straightforward bill. It cites earlier legislation leading \nup to the last round of NATO enlargement, quotes President Bush's pro-\nenlargement June 15, 2001, Warsaw speech, adds Slovakia to the \ncountries eligible to receive assistance under the NATO Participation \nAct of 1994, and authorizes a total of $55.5 million in foreign \nmilitary financing, FMF, under the Arms Export Control Act for Estonia, \nLatvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and Romania.\n  Most importantly, this bill reaffirms the position of the United \nStates on NATO enlargement: that the door to NATO membership remains \nopen, and that those countries that are prepared to meet the \nobligations of membership--as it relates to defense capabilities and \ndemocratic and political readiness--are welcome to join.\n  NATO enlargement has enjoyed and continues to enjoy bipartisan \nsupport in the United States Senate. It is an issue that unites \nDemocrats and Republicans. At a time when we and our allies are engaged \nin a global war on terrorism, we recognize more than ever the need for \nallies--and for new allies.\n  As we face a shared and multidimensional threat, we must recognize \nthat each new ally brings substantial political, economic and military \ncontributions to the effort in Afghanistan and around the world.\n  The terrorist attacks of September 11 underscore the need to \nconsolidate the peace on the European continent so that North America \nand Europe, from, as the President has said, the Baltic Sea to the \nBlack Sea, can focus their energies on the new threats of the 21st \ncentury.\n  This is an important message for the President to take on his trip. \nBut another part of the President's trip is also about closing a \nchapter from the 20th century.\n\n[[Page S4518]]\n\n  The President announced Monday morning that he and President Putin \nwill sign a new treaty to deal with the nuclear weapons left from the \ncold war.\n  The treaty limits the United States and Russia to no more than 1,700-\n2,200 deployed weapons by 2012.\n  Any time we can get an agreement to reduce the number of nuclear \nweapons deployed in the world, that is a positive step, and I commend \nthe President for taking it.\n  But there are a still a series of questions about that treaty that \nneed to be answered. Does it require destruction of any existing \nnuclear weapons? Does it include provisions to secure Russian \nstockpiles? Does it spell out a transparent timetable for when each \nside must reduce the number of deployed weapons to the agreed upon \nlevel? Does it include any new verification provisions? And lastly, \ndoes it address the issue of tactical nuclear weapons?\n  I hope the President will use this historic trip to address these \nquestions, which go to the heart of one of the principal security \nthreats the United States faces today--the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction, and the potential for those weapons to fall into the \nhands of terrorists.\n  So let's send the President off on this important trip with the \nimportant message contained in H.R. 3167--that we want to continue to \nremake and improve our relations with the whole of Europe, including \nRussia.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3167, and ask unanimous consent \nto print in the Record a copy of a letter, dated March 20, that Senator \nLott and I sent to the Romanian Prime Minister, and a letter to me from \nPresident Bush, dated April 11, on the same.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 2002.\n     His Excellency Adrian Nastase,\n     Prime Minister, 1, Victoriei Square,\n     District 1, Bucharest, ROMANIA.\n       Dear Mr. Prime Minister: We write to congratulate you on \n     convening this important meeting with the other Prime \n     Ministers of Europe's new democracies. It is an important \n     stepping stone to the NATO summit in Prague next November.\n       At a time when the United States and its allies are engaged \n     in a global war on terrorism, we are grateful for the support \n     that you and your colleagues have provided. Americans \n     remember who their true friends and allies are at times of \n     war. The threat we face is a shared one, and we appreciate \n     and value the substantial political, economic and military \n     contributions that the countries represented in Bucharest are \n     making to the coalition effort in Afghanistan and around the \n     world. You are demonstrating in practice that you want to be \n     allies of the United States. It is indeed a ``Spring of New \n     Allies.''\n       At the NATO Summit in Prague in November, Alliance heads-\n     of-state will be making an important decision about \n     continuing the process of NATO enlargement. We want to take \n     this opportunity to reiterate that NATO enlargement has \n     enjoyed and continues to enjoy bipartisan support in the \n     United States Senate. It is an issue that unites Democrats \n     and Republicans.\n       We therefore look forward to the Prague summit and the \n     opportunity to take the next step in building a Europe whole \n     and free in alliance with the United States. We urge you and \n     your colleagues to continue to work hard and devote the \n     necessary resources to making your countries the strongest \n     possible candidates. As President Bush put it in Warsaw last \n     June, our vision is to extend the zone of democracy and \n     security to as many qualified countries as possible from the \n     Baltic to the Black Sea, including, as our allies in Greece \n     and Turkey have argued, the important Southern dimension. The \n     terrorist attacks of September 11th have only underscored the \n     need to consolidate the peace on the continent so that North \n     America and Europe can focus their energies on the new \n     threats of the 21st century.\n       Mr. Prime Minister, once again, we commend you and your \n     colleagues for your contributions to a strong, dynamic and \n     more secure North Atlantic community. Working together we are \n     confident that we can attain our collective vision of a \n     Europe whole and free.\n     Tom Daschle.\n     Trent Lott.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, April 11, 2002.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I have seen the letter you and Senator \n     Lott sent to Romanian Prime Minister Nastase for the \n     Bucharest Summit of the Vilnius-10 countries. Thank you for \n     your leadership on this issue.\n       I strongly agree that NATO enlargement has been, and should \n     remain, a bipartisan issue. We must work together on this. I \n     noted the importance you place on the southern European \n     candidate countries.\n       We have an historic opportunity to intensify reforms and \n     consolidate freedom in nations that were once behind the Iron \n     Curtain. We can do this while building a new NATO-Russia \n     relationship. This is an opportunity that we cannot afford to \n     miss.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   George W. Bush.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, of course, we agree with the Senator from \nVirginia. That is the purpose of this debate, to draw the attention of \nthis Senate to a momentous decision that is to come. We must examine \nboth armed services and foreign relations, and we pledge to do so, and \nthe criteria of each of the countries. NATO is important. It must \nsucceed. Therefore, we ask support for this resolution our President \nhas asked us to give him.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Conrad) \nand the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota (Mr. Conrad) would vote ``no.''\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Madam President, all week long the average length of \ntime it has taken to have a vote has exceeded 30 minutes. That is just \ntoo long. There is no way we are going to continue to accomplish as \nmuch as we need to accomplish before the end of next week if we have to \nbe spending 30 and 40 minutes on a vote. We are going to have to start \ncutting off this time more aggressively. I want to put all colleagues \non notice that we are not going to tolerate the extent to which our \ngood will is violated as these amendments are voted upon.\n  Please come over and vote within the 15 or 20 minutes allotted for \nthe vote. Extending it twice as long is just unacceptable and a real \ndisservice to all our colleagues who are waiting to do their work.\n\n[[Page S4519]]\n\n  Madam President, as I said, we have all day today and all day on \nMonday for Senators to offer amendments. I know Senator Dorgan is \nwaiting to offer an amendment. There will be other Senators who will \ncome to the floor.\n  The authors of the steel amendment have kindly accepted our \nsuggestion to set aside their amendment in order to accommodate other \nSenators who wish to have their amendments offered. I think it is very \nimportant that we use these days for full consideration of other \namendments.\n  It is my intention at this point to file cloture on the bill on \nMonday in order to have a cloture vote on Wednesday. So amendments will \nhave to be disposed of prior to Wednesday.\n  It is my expectation that we will be taking up a supplemental \nappropriations bill, in consultation of course with Senator Byrd, \nbefore the end of next week. There is no way we can do that unless we \nbring our debate on this bill to a successful close.\n  So we have a lot of work to do next week. We want to finish the bill. \nWe want to finish the supplemental bill. We may take up other issues as \nwell, including some reference to the budget. So it is necessary that \nwe use the days between now and then to the maximum degree possible.\n  I urge Senators to come over and have their amendments considered. \nSenator Reid will be here, and other members of the leadership, but \nprimarily Senator Reid, who has offered to offer the amendments on \nbehalf of Senators who may have travel schedules that will not \naccommodate their offering of amendments. So there is no reason these \namendments cannot be offered. Senator Reid will be here to offer them \nor Senators can come and offer them themselves. But all day today and \nall day Monday we are open for business and we are determined to use \nthese days to the maximum degree possible.\n  I thank my colleagues for what I think has been a very productive \nweek on this bill. Their cooperation has been very catalytic in \nbringing about the final days of debate on the bill--with the one \nexception that we are spending too much time on the votes themselves.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/17/senate-section/article/S4519-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 2179\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 375, S. 2179, \nthat the bill be read a third time, passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, this legislation was just \ncalled to my attention. We have not had a chance to review it and to do \na hotline on it to see if there are any problems with it. It looks like \nsomething we will be able to clear, but at this time we have not had a \nchance to do that so I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. I find it unbelievable that my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle would object to a bill, unanimously passed by the \nJudiciary Committee, to honor the law enforcement and public safety \nofficers who risk their lives daily to keep us safe. The bill I \nintroduced provides a small amount of money to honor those who have \nbeen injured or killed in the line of duty. As we celebrate Police \nOfficers Memorial Week, it is troubling to me that anyone would want to \ndeny them the recognition that they are due.\n  I hope whoever is blocking this bill from passing will reconsider \ntheir opposition and let us honor these brave men and women.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, there is a process of doing legislation in \nthe Senate. This was just reported, as I understand it, yesterday. I \nmade the point I had not had a chance to review it at all.\n  I note we should honor, in whatever way possible, men and women who \nhave fallen in the line of duty as law enforcement and public safety \nofficers. But just looking at this preliminarily, it provides Federal \ngrants to States, local governments, and Indian tribes to establish \npermanent tributes to honor men and women who are killed or disabled \nwhile serving as law enforcement or public safety officers. We have had \nthat happen in my home community. Policemen and highway patrolmen have \nlost their lives. We should honor them. We should do that locally and \nprivately.\n\n  For the Federal Government to encourage and maybe to participate is \nworth considering, but there is a principle here. I am not sure it is \none that we want to just approve without having a chance to take a \ncloser look at it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/17/senate-section/article/S4519-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4519-S4525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE EXPANSION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, might I \ninquire of my colleague from Nevada, the disposition of the amendment \nthat you just referenced would conclude at what point on Tuesday? In \nother words, what time would the vote be on the steel amendment?\n  Mr. REID. At 11 a.m., which would be voting on cloture on the \namendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Voting on cloture on the steel amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, could the Senator tell me, is there an \nestablished order on recognition following that vote for the purpose of \noffering amendments?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I appreciate the Senator's question. I was going to \nmake a statement on that. We have a list that is already in the Record \nof the order in which amendments will be offered.\n  The next amendment will be a Republican amendment. We understand \nSenator Allen is the person who is going to offer that. Following that \nwould be the Kerry amendment, then a Republican amendment, then Dorgan \namendment, and on down the line.\n  I would say, however, that I am going to offer some amendments on \nbehalf of other Senators during the day. But anyone who wants to come \nto the floor--including the Senator from North Dakota, if he is here \nand wants to debate the Cuba amendment he is going to offer--today \nwould be a good time to do that.\n  As the majority leader has indicated, today we will stay in session \nas long as people have something to say. On Monday we are going to come \nin around 1 o'clock in the afternoon. The same would apply on Monday. \nPeople can offer amendments on Monday. There will be no votes, but some \nof these amendments will be debated. Some of them will be accepted. For \nother amendments we will schedule votes. And we could schedule those \nvotes, of course, on Tuesday.\n  So I think a lot of progress could be made today and on Monday. We \nwill work our way on down the list.\n  Did that answer the Senator's question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe so. I am only concerned that we \nhave time, prior to the filing of the cloture motion and a vote on \ncloture on this bill, to offer amendments. I have offered one \namendment. I have two additional amendments. I certainly want to be \nable to offer them.\n  As I understand it, the Senator from Nevada has indicated that, \ndespite the fact there is a list of amendment, if we are able to be \nhere today and/or Monday to offer additional amendments, nothing will \npreclude us from offering those amendments. Is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. If there is no one here to offer an amendment, the \nagreement is that we would set whatever amendment is next in order \naside and go to the next amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, now we are on the bill; is that right, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The bill is open for amendment.\n  As I have indicated, it is my understanding that Senator Allen wishes \nto offer an amendment. He does not appear to be in the Chamber.\n  The other understanding we certainly need to have is that if the \nDemocrats offer five amendments in a row, the Republicans, when they \nare ready to offer their amendments, can also offer five amendments to \ncatch up with us. And that is the understanding we have had. And \ncertainly that should be the order of things so we treat people fairly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3439 To Amendment No. 3401\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Enzi, Senator Cantwell, Senator Hagel, Senator \nJohnson, Senator Roberts, and Senator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside and the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Enzi, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Roberts, \n     and Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered 3439.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To permit private financing of agricultural sales to Cuba)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. AGRICULTURAL SALES TO CUBA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 908 of the Agriculture, Rural \n     Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001 (22 U.S.C. 7207) is amended \n     by striking subsection (b).\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 908(a) of the \n     Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration \n     and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001 (22 U.S.C. \n     7207(a)) (as amended by subsection (a)), is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``(a)'' and all that follows through \n     ``Notwithstanding'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding'';\n       (2) by striking ``(2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in \n     paragraph (1)'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in subsection (a)''; \n     and\n       (3) by striking ``(3) Waiver.--The President may waive the \n     application of paragraph (1)'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(c) Waiver.--The President may waive the application of \n     subsection (a)''.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Cuba suffered a hurricane that had a \nfairly significant impact on the island. The Cubans wanted to purchase \nAmerican food, and they did. They purchased well over $100 million in \nfood from our country: Corn, wheat, dried beans, eggs, and much more.\n  However, the legislation that allows us to sell food to Cuba \nprohibits any financing of these sales--even private financing. Cubans \nhave to pay cash, and it is illegal for U.S. companies or banks to be \ninvolved in the transactions. Now, this should strike most people as \nrather strange. We will allow our farmers to sell wheat or eggs or \ndried beans to Cuba, but they can't even use private financing to do \nthe sale.\n  So the ban on extending credit by U.S. private banks and companies to \nCuba means transactions are carried out in cash. And the payments \ncannot even be made directly. When Alimport, the agency in Cuba that \npurchases this food on behalf of the Cuban people, makes a purchase, \nthe money has to go through a French bank, in a transaction that takes \n40-plus hours.\n  Well, when we were putting together the Senate version of the Farm \nBill, we decided to do something about this problem. We inserted a \nprovision into the Senate version of the Farm bill that allowed private \nfinancing of agricultural sales to Cuba. No U.S. government financing--\njust private financing.\n  The vast majority of Senators voted for this amendment. Then the \nHouse of Representatives, by a vast majority, passed a resolution \ncalling on the House conferees to accept this provision in conference. \nBut the measure was taken out of the conference report anyway.\n\n  The amendment we are offering today to the trade bill is identical to \nthe provisions that were in the Senate version of the Farm Bill. Not \none word has been changed.\n  What we are trying to overcome here is a small group of lawmakers \nthat are trumping the will of Congress.\n  You know, when we passed the legislation that allowed our farmers to \nsell food from Cuba, a Congressman from Florida was quoted in the Miami \nHerald as saying that he was satisfied that the language in the \nlegislation was restrictive, making it difficult for United States \ncompanies to do business in Cuba because they will have to go through \nthird countries for financing. My colleague in the House of \nRepresentatives did not care about the intent of the legislation--he \nwanted to make sure that it was as difficult as possible for our \nfarmers to sell food to Cuba. He said he was pleased with the outcome.\n\n[[Page S4521]]\n\n  Well, I am not pleased with that. I think it makes no sense. And it \njust defies belief that when the Senate recently tried to fix the \nproblem, the will of the Congress was ignored again. The Senate version \nof the Farm Bill had a provision to allow private financing of \nagricultural sales to Cuba, which passed by a 2 to 1 margin. The House \nvoted 273 to 143 to endorse the Senate provision for more trade with \nCuba, and to have the House conferees accept it. But guess what? It was \ndumped out of conference anyway.\n  So we are back, to offer the same amendment, word for word. The \nSenate has already voted on this. The bipartisan support is \nsubstantial. I mentioned cosponsors of this amendment, who are many, \nRepublicans and Democrats. My expectation is we will continue to offer \nthis amendment until the will of the Congress prevails.\n  This measure is long overdue. Do you think Castro has ever missed a \nmeal because we won't sell food to Cuba? The restrictions on food sales \ndo nothing but hurt poor, sick, and hungry people. It is not a moral \nthing to do, to use food as a weapon, as a part of our foreign policy. \nAnd it is not a smart trade policy, not when we are depriving U.S. \nfarmers of a market for their crops.\n  In coming months, we are going to have to deal with a separate aspect \nof Cuba policy: the restrictions on Americans who want to travel to \nCuba. I just held a hearing on that.\n  Let me describe this policy through the eyes of a retired \nschoolteacher in Illinois. She was reading a cycling magazine published \nin Canada. She is a retired schoolteacher in her sixties, and she likes \nto bicycle. She saw an ad about a bicycling trip to Cuba, and she \nsigned up. She went to Cuba with nearly a dozen other people, and they \nbicycled for 7 or 8 days. She loved it. She came back to this country, \nback to Illinois, and a year later she got a letter from the U.S. \nDepartment of the Treasury saying: guess what, we are fining you $7,500 \nfor bicycling in Cuba.\n  Is that an unusual story? No, it is happening all across the country. \nWe are slapping around the American people, restricting their travel \nrights because we are upset with Fidel Castro.\n  I want to bring democracy to Cuba. The wrong way to do that is to use \nfood as a weapon and to penalize Americans who would travel in Cuba. \nThe effective way to do it is to flood Cuba with American products and \nvisitors.\n  We are told in the Senate that the way to deal with China and move \nthe Communist government in China in the right direction is to have \ngreater engagement, more trade, more travel. The same is true with \nVietnam. That is the way to deal with Communists, because they can't \nresist the relentless march of capitalism and freedom. But a small \npocket of people in our country refuse to apply that same approach to \nCuba. That makes no sense. The majority of the Members of the House and \nSenate know that.\n  Our amendment today deals only with the private financing of sales of \nfood. This amendment does what the Senate has already done on the \nprevious occasion. There is not a word changed. I hope for its \nfavorable consideration. And we will have more to say on the subject of \nCuba policy in the weeks and months ahead.\n  One final point: My colleague from the State of Washington has worked \nwith me to construct this legislation and put it in this bill. I regret \na number of the other cosponsors are not here. I wish we had had an \nopportunity to offer the amendment when they were all here. They have \nexpressed similar sentiments in the past--Senators Hagel, Enzi, and \nRoberts, and others who believe as I do and as Senator Cantwell does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Dorgan-Cantwell \namendment that removes existing restrictions on United States banks \nfrom financing the legal export of American food and medical products \nto Cuba.\n  My colleague from North Dakota has very eloquently pointed out that \nour country cannot use food as a weapon. I applaud him for his \nleadership in the committee in having hearings about the travel \npenalties being placed on Americans and also the prohibition of some \nAmerican farmers from traveling to Cuba to discuss either cash \npurchases or, if this language is changed, the United States financing \nof legal agricultural purchases by Cuba.\n  This amendment is particularly appropriate. If you think about it, \njust last week we passed a farm package basically dedicating our \nefforts to try to improve the farm economy in America. We did this with \nthe underlying goal of trying to improve the economic competitiveness \nof American farmers by helping them open up markets. Today we were in \nthe Chamber talking about how to make it easier to have trade \nnegotiations. With this amendment, we have an opportunity to fix what \nis really an arbitrary, unjust, and illogical sanction on food exports. \nIn doing so, if we change this procedure, we open up potentially \nbillions of dollars of markets for American farmers.\n  Our colleagues may remember that in the 106th Congress, Congress \npassed the Trade Sanction Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 in \nan effort to preclude unilateral sanctions on the export of American \nfood and medical products. In passing this language, Congress sent an \nimportant message through TSRA that food and medicine were not to be \nused as a political tool of foreign policy. Practically speaking, the \nlegislation made it possible for American farmers to export their \nproducts around the world, though the law did require licenses from the \nexecutive branch for exports to Cuba, Libya, Sudan, and Iran.\n  The TSRA not only addresses the importance of humanitarian goals of \npreventing famine and hunger, but it also provides important markets \nfor U.S. agricultural producers, particularly in Cuba.\n  Cuba, a market that has been closed to U.S. exports since 1961, \ncurrently imports approximately $750 million in agricultural products \nfrom countries around the world, including European allies. And one \nrecent study by Texas A University suggested a long-term export \nmarket potential of up to $1.2 billion for U.S. agricultural products.\n  However, Mr. President, there was a catch with the legislation as it \npassed in that it put a restriction on the use of any private financing \nor letters of credit from U.S. banks for those purchases. The \nrestriction only applied to Cuba--not Sudan, Libya, Iran, or any other \ncountry--just Cuba. So as my colleague has suggested, food is being \nused as a political weapon against Cuba.\n  This legislation undermines the spirit of the TSRA in that it \neffectively continues to use food and medicine as a foreign policy \ntool. As any farmer can tell you, financing is a critical element of \nselling your products both domestically and throughout the world. We \nare blocking American food from going to Cuba because of that inability \nto get private financing.\n  The potential for the Cuban market to our farmers has been \ndemonstrated over the last months by the announcements of cash \npurchases of over $90 million in agricultural products that has been \nmade--the first United States-Cuba commercial transaction since 1961. \nSo we know the Cubans are interested and are willing to pay cash. But \nwe cannot finance agricultural sales of this magnitude by cash \npurchases.\n  This opening is particularly important in my home State. Washington \nhad a strong trading relationship with Cuba prior to the embargo, and I \nthink we would be in a good position to benefit from opening up these \nagricultural markets.\n  Industry experts predict that Cuba's markets could bring substantial \nrevenue to farmers in my State on products like peas, lentils, apples, \nsweet cherry and pear production, and many other products. I think \ngiven the events of the last week, with President Carter opening a new \nchapter in our history with Cuba, and the positive steps that have been \ntaken by the Cuban Government in allowing him to come there and address \nthat nation, it is critically important that we rethink this limitation \nwe have had on private financing. My colleagues have said we believe \nthat food and medical products should be sold to Cuba. We have agreed \nto that. Now all that stands in the way is this arbitrary limitation of \nsaying we are not going to allow you to finance it with private banking \nin the United States. That is a mistake.\n  We cannot continue this policy and hold not just the Cuban people \nhostage to food and medical products, but U.S.\n\n[[Page S4522]]\n\nfarmers who have products they can sell there. If we have said we \nbelieve they should be able to sell those products into that country, \nwe should be willing to say that there can be financing for those \nproducts as well.\n  As my colleague from North Dakota mentioned, we voted on this \namendment. It was part of the farm package that passed out of the \nSenate. We will keep pushing this until we are successful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nher work on this amendment. As I indicated before, this amendment has \nbroad bipartisan support. The Senate has already expressed itself \npreviously. By a wide margin, the Senate says we ought not to use food \nas a weapon.\n  I understand that Fidel Castro has been sticking his finger in our \neye for a long while. I don't stand here wanting to make life better \nfor Fidel Castro. I want to bring democracy to Cuba. After 40 years of \nfailure with an embargo that doesn't work, it seems that we ought to \ntry something else.\n  I have been to Cuba. What I learned there is that Fidel Castro says \nthe reason the Cuban economy is in deep trouble is because the United \nStates has its hands around the Cuban economy's neck. This embargo is \nwhat they blame for Cuba's economic troubles. I am not saying that \nFidel Castro is right. I am just saying this embargo has been Fidel \nCastro's biggest and best excuse for all of the shortcomings of his \nregime. He uses it, has continued to use it, and he says to the Cuban \npeople that is the reason they have this trouble.\n  In any event, it seems to me at some point you would learn a lesson. \nFidel Castro has been in power in Cuba through 10 U.S. Presidents. \nClearly, what we have been doing has not been working. How about trying \nsomething different? My sense is that the more people travel in Cuba \nand the more investments you have in Cuba, the more Cuba's economy is \nopen, the more likely it is that Castro will lose his grip on power in \nCuba. My goal is to bring democracy to Cuba. But we don't, in my \njudgment, serve our interests, or anybody else's, by saying we want to \nuse food as a weapon.\n  Because I and others have fought to open the window just a bit, food \nis now going to Cuba, however slowly. Cuba is able to buy it from our \ncompanies and our family farmers. We now have chicken legs, turkey \nbreasts, and dried beans being offloaded in Cuba because they bought \nthem from the United States. Good for them and good for us.\n  At a time when we are beset by terrorist threats, worrying about \nfuture acts of terrorism, those responsible for our nation's safety and \nwelfare have much better things to do than to worry about shutting off \nthe flow of chicken legs, turkey breasts, dried beans, wheat, and eggs \nto Cuba. We ought to worry a whole lot more about bombs from terrorists \nthan about our farmers selling dried beans to Cuba.\n  We just held a hearing in which we found that the Office of Foreign \nAsset Control and the Treasury, which is responsible for tracking down \nterrorist funding--has at least some of their staff tracking Americans \nwho have traveled in Cuba. A fellow who testified at my hearing on \ntravel to Cuba came from Senator Cantwell's State of Washington. His \nparents were missionaries to Cuba, and built a little church there. \nAfter Castro came to power, his family returned to America. A few years \nago, this poor fellow's parents tragically died in a house fire. He \ndecided to honor their memory by taking their ashes back to Cuba, to \nbury them in the little church that they had built decades earlier. He \nwent to Cuba for just one day, and did just that. Upon his return, he \ntold the Customs Service that he had been to Cuba, and explained the \ncircumstances. Months later, he got a letter saying, guess what, you \nhave to pay a fine of $7,500.\n  I am just saying that when government officials responsible for \ntracking down terrorists are spending their time chasing down folks \nlike this poor fellow, they just don't have their eye on the ball.\n  The amendment we are offering today having to do with private \nfinancing of agricultural sales to Cuba is also a call to reason.\n  This amendment is an amendment that deserves the support of the \nentire Senate. I hope we will be able to approve this amendment just as \nwe did in the Senate version of the Farm Bill, and I hope this time the \nprovision will survive conference.\n  It is time for us to say it is not moral to use food as a weapon. \nThis country is bigger and better than that. I have traveled to refugee \ncamps around the world and I know their misery and share their pain. We \nall understand that using food as a weapon is not something that \nrepresents the best of this country. That is why in this instance, and \nevery instance, I want this country to stop it. This amendment simply \nopens the door a bit wider so that the flow of food to Cuba--food \npurchased by Cuba--can be done through normal private financing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from North Dakota. I thank the Senator for introducing \nthis amendment, which will directly benefit our American farmers and \nthe citizens of Cuba who have suffered from inadequate access to food.\n  This amendment would amend a provision that has undeniably hurt the \neconomic viability of our agriculture sector since the passage of the \nTrade Sanctions and Reform Act, TSRA, in 2001. The TSRA, which \nprohibited the use of private financing for food and medicine sales to \nCuba, instituted an embargo on all exports to Cuba last year. The TSRA \nprovision effectively eliminated one of our nearest and most easily \naccessible agricultural markets. Our amendment today seeks to remedy \nthis unworkable situation.\n  Given the crisis in American agriculture, the prospect of selling to \na new market is welcome news to U.S. farmers and exporters. In my home \nState of Wyoming, agriculture is a driving force behind economic \nsustainability, and I firmly believe this amendment will strengthen the \nposition of local farmers as they work to compete at the international \nlevel. Allowing food exports to Cuba will not only transfer critically \nneeded supplies to the suffering Cuban people, but it will also create \na potential new market for American farmers and exporters.\n  Opponents of this amendment will argue that we should not soften our \nposition on the Cuban embargo, that Cuba has not earned the right to \ntrade, and that we should continue to shut off this socially and \neconomically repressed nation from the world. They will reiterate that \nisolating Fidel Castro's regime is our only hope in forcing him to \nrecognize the error of his ways. I disagree. Our embargo is not \nworking, because we are not the only country in the world that can \nprovide food and medicine to Cuba. As such, Castro does not have to \ntrade with us. The real losers in this battle are the Cuban people and \nthe American farmers. The United States must develop a policy that goes \nbeyond the embargo. Food and medicine are not tools of war, and should \nnot be used as such.\n  I truly believe this amendment will strengthen our country's role as \na promoter of democracy and freedom. Food and medical attention are the \nmost basic of human needs, and until those are satisfied, the Cuban \npeople will not put political reform at the top of their agenda. The \nU.S. must first help to satisfy the basic needs of the Cuban people, \nand then push toward full political reform. This amendment takes us one \nstep closer to that goal. As history has proven, political reform comes \nwhen individuals are exposed to worlds unlike their own. Take China for \nexample, opening trade and encouraging dialogue with the Chinese has \npromoted capitalism and democracy in their country. This amendment \nwould increase that exposure and would improve the social and economic \nwell-being of the Cuban population.\n  As one of the principal sponsors of the 2001 Export Administration \nAct, which was passed by the Senate last September but has yet to see \naction in the House, I understand the importance of export controls and \nI recognize the delicacy of this situation. However, I do not believe \nfood and medicine should be controlled under unilateral sanctions. We \nneed to tightly control some exports, but food should be allowed to \npass as freely as possible across our borders. I encourage my \ncolleagues to vote for this amendment,\n\n[[Page S4523]]\n\nnot only for the sake of the Cuban people but for the sake of our own \nlocal farmers and their families. Now is the time to chart a new course \nfor United States-Cuba relations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3406 To Amendment No. 3401\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I wish to call up amendment No. 3406, which \nis at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

With the permission of the Chair, I would like to address \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is free to speak.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, this amendment, which is entitled the \nHomestead Preservation Act, is an amendment to the trade promotion \nauthority/trade adjustment assistance substitute which is currently \nbeing considered. First and foremost, I thank my good colleagues, \nSenator John Edwards of North Carolina, Senator John Warner of \nVirginia, and Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, for their \nimportant cosponsorship of this amendment. Their leadership and \nunderstanding of the desirability for this amendment is very important.\n  I say to my colleagues in the Senate that this is an amendment which \nis designed to help displaced workers get access to short-term, low-\ninterest loans to help cover monthly home mortgage payments while they \nare looking for a new job. This is a commonsense, compassionate \nlegislative idea designed to help working families who, through no \nfault of their own, are adversely affected by international \ncompetition.\n  During the past several months, all Americans have been deluged with \nnews of recessions, plummeting consumer confidence, and rising \nunemployment. While these are uneasy times for everyone, in States such \nas North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Southside and \nSouthwest Virginia, and every State with heavy concentrations of \nmanufacturing, especially in the textile and apparel industries, they \nhave been especially hard hit.\n  Nationwide, employment in apparel manufacturing has been just \ndevastating. Factory employment has plummeted just in the last year and \na half. One out of every three layoffs in Virginia is from the \nmanufacturing industry, although only one in six jobs in Virginia is in \nthis sector. Virginia's Southside region and Southwest Virginia region \nare already suffering from the effects of international competition.\n  Nationwide, an average of 37,500 Americans lose their jobs because of \nNAFTA-related competition each year. During the 1990s, Virginians saw \nthe loss of 15,400 apparel jobs, a decline of 54 percent, and 15,300 \ntextile jobs, a decline of 36 percent.\n  That is bad news. However, please understand, Mr. President, I \nstrongly believe that fair and free trade is necessary and desirable if \nAmerican businesses are to have the opportunity to promote their goods, \nservices, and continue to expand their growth abroad.\n  NAFTA, despite those negative stories I just went through in \nVirginia--and it is similar in other States, I suspect--has actually \ncreated a net increase in employment. So while on balance it is a net \nincrease, we still do need to recognize there are good, hard-working \npeople who end up losing their jobs.\n  When NAFTA came into effect, I was Governor of Virginia, and we led \ntrade missions to Quebec, Ontario, and to various places in Mexico, \nfrom Veracruz to Mexico City. We were able to bring back an agreement \nfrom Mexico and Canada that initially meant a half a billion dollars in \nnew investments and sales for Virginia. These investments were made \npossible only by fair and free trade.\n  While trade is helping our economy as a whole, there still are good, \nhard-working families who have been adversely affected by international \ncompetition, especially in the textile and apparel industries.\n  Anytime a factory closes, it is a devastating blow to all the \nfamilies in the community and region. Usually to these textile \nfacilities which are not in big urban or suburban areas. They are \nusually in smaller, more rural communities.\n\n  I was especially proud of how the close-knit Southside communities in \nVirginia came together when people\n\n[[Page S4524]]\n\nlost their jobs, when companies such as Pluma or Tultex closed their \ndoors. These individuals should not have to go through these hard times \nalone.\n  After the Tultex plant closed in Martinsville, right before Christmas \nin December 1999, people donated toys to the Salvation Army to make \nsure Christmas came to the homes of thousands of laid-off workers.\n  I am proposing that the Federal Government do its part to help these \npeople through these tough times. There are already thoughtful programs \nin place, such as the NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance Program \nthat helps workers obtain additional job skills, training, and \nemployment assistance. That program provides extended unemployment \nbenefits during job training. These programs are the result of a \ncommonsense, logical understanding and the conclusion that people can \nlose their jobs because of trade agreements. They are not losing their \njobs because of anything they did wrong or because they do not want to \nwork. For the most part, these are folks who have worked in these \ncompanies for a great number of years. In some cases there are entire \nfamilies working at these companies. Their parents and their children \nmay all work together in some of these mills.\n  We ought to find a way to ease the stress and turmoil for people \nwhose lives are unexpectedly thrown into transition after years of \nsteady employment with a company that just suddenly disappears.\n  While these hard-working families are trying to find appropriate new \nemployment, they should not have to fear losing their homes as well. \nFor most people and their families, the biggest financial investment \nthey make in their lives is their home. Many have considerable equity \nbuilt up in their homes.\n  Many Government agencies already have low-interest loan programs that \nare in place to help families who have met unexpected economic \ndisasters, such as natural disasters--which include floods, tornadoes, \nand hurricanes.\n  When I look at the factory closings and literally thousands of jobs \nbeing lost, it is an economic disaster to these families and \ncommunities, and its effects are just as far-reaching and certainly as \neconomically devastating as floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes.\n  Like in a natural disaster, families displaced by international \ncompetition are not responsible for events leading to the factory \nclosings. The Federal Government, in my view, ought to make similar \ndisaster loan assistance programs available to our temporarily \ndisplaced workers. This is the rationale for introducing the Homestead \nPreservation Act.\n  This legislation will provide temporary mortgage assistance to \ndisplaced workers, helping them make ends meet during their search for \na new job. Specifically, the Homestead Preservation Act authorizes the \nDepartment of Labor to administer a low-interest loan program, say 4 \npercent, for workers displaced due to international competition. An \nindividual, who qualifies for the program will be eligible for up to 12 \nmonthly home mortgage payments.\n  The program is authorized at a maximum of only $10 million a year for \n5 years. The loans will be distributed through an account providing \nmonthly allocations to cover the amount of the worker's home mortgage \npayment. The loans could be paid off once the person finds another job \nor repaid over a period of up to 5 years. No payments would be required \nuntil 6 months after the borrower has returned to work full time.\n\n  Again, if someone is laid off and they want to apply for these loans, \nthey can only get a loan for 12 months for monthly mortgage payments, \nand then 6 months after they get back on their feet, they will have to \npay it off over a 5-year period. This program will only be available \nfor workers displaced due to international competition and who also \nqualify for benefits under the NAFTA Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram. Furthermore, they actually have to be participating in such \nprograms.\n  Like the NAFTA-TAAP and the TAA benefits program, the Homestead \nPreservation Act recognizes that some temporary assistance is needed as \nworkers take time to become retrained, reeducated, expand upon their \nskills, and search for new employment.\n  As Governor, I enjoyed nothing more than being able to recruit and \nbring new investment, new jobs, and enterprises into Virginia. By \nrecruiting new businesses, we brought in more jobs and better jobs for \nthe hard-working, caring people of Virginia. For example, in the \nMartinsville, Henry County area, we were able to get Drake Extrusion in \nGreat Britain to open a new facility in Virginia. They chose \nMartinsville Industrial Park for its new carpet and bedding fiber \nmanufacturing plant. This was announced as a $12 million investment \nwhich doubled since its opening in 1995. It brought in additional small \nbusinesses, and they now employ about 225 people.\n  Unfortunately, it can take time to bring new companies and new \nindustries into a region, just as it takes time to learn a new skill or \nearn a degree. The displaced families, unfortunately, in many cases, do \nnot have the time because they have monthly bills that must be paid in \nfull with no excuses.\n  The Homestead Preservation Act provides financial assistance \nnecessary to bridge the time it takes to find employment. Without this \nbridge, many working families would not be able to take advantage of \nthe opportunities that are out there for them. They would be denied the \nnecessary tools to help them succeed in the changing economy.\n  The current economic situation for our country has made it even more \nvital that the Federal Government do what is right by our workers in \nthe textile and apparel industries and indeed in all industries \nsuffering high rates of job losses due to international competition.\n  Because of international competition, textile and apparel workers are \neven more vulnerable to the current economic situation, making them \nill-equipped to weather an economic downturn.\n  The reason I say this is because in the year 2000, the average wage \nrates in Virginia for a textile or apparel worker were 77 percent and \n57 percent, respectively, compared to the overall wage rate for \nVirginians. What that means is that their wages are providing them less \nmoney for their family's rainy day savings account, and right now it is \nstorming for many of these families.\n  When these workers are displaced, in many cases meager savings and \ntemporary unemployment benefits are frequently not enough to cover \nexpenses that have previously fit in within the family's budget.\n  Without immediate help, many of these families, at a minimum, risk \nlosing their credit ratings. And in the worst case scenario, they could \nlose their home or their car, or both. The biggest financial investment \nmany people make in life is in their home, and when they lose their \nhome, they have lost a great deal. Their credit ratings are obviously \ndamaged. Many have a great deal of equity built up in that home, and \nmuch is lost, including their dignity.\n  It is important that we enable and try to assist people in keeping \ntheir homes and protect their credit ratings. We should do so as these \npeople work toward strengthening and updating their skills as they \ncontinue a search for a new job.\n  The Homestead Preservation Act provides the temporary financial tools \nnecessary for displaced workers to get back on their feet. And when \nthey get back on their feet, they not only still have a home, but they \nalso have the ability to succeed.\n  In my view, it is a caring, logical, and responsible response. I hope \nmy colleagues will vote on this matter, possibly as early as next \nTuesday. I hope they support this commonsense, compassionate idea that \nwill help those individuals who have lost jobs due to international \ncompetition, while we still go forward with trade promotion authority, \nthe Andean measure, and trade adjustment assistance.\n  All of these measures are very important, but let's make sure we are \nhelping everyone that is negatively impacted. We need to also \nunderstand the balance that is necessary as this country opens up new \nmarkets, tears down barriers, which allows our goods, our products and \nservices, and our technology to enter into other areas.\n  We need to recognize there are some who will need help in transition \nto get back on their feet. Let's make sure\n\n[[Page S4525]]\n\nthey do not lose their homes because they have been displaced by \ninternational competition. They are good families, they are hard-\nworking families, they are diligent, and this is the least I think we \ncan do as we enter into these trade agreements.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. On behalf of our leader, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see the majority leader on his feet, so I will wait \nuntil he finishes, although I would like to perhaps ask him whether he \nunderstands any reason that--as I understand, this is a motion to \nproceed; is that correct? Was this a motion to proceed to the bill \nincluded in the majority leader's request?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this is not only a motion to proceed but \nit would be the circumstances under which we would consider the bill \nitself.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This is the legislation which we have addressed in this \nbody that was passed by a vote of 56 to 42, I believe as an amendment \non the Defense authorization bill last year; am I correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct. We have addressed this \nlegislation in the past. As I will make known for the record, this is \nidentical legislation to what was passed before. It is legislation we \nwill take up either under a unanimous consent agreement or through a \nmotion to proceed at some point in the not too distant future.\n  My hope was we could work out arrangements whereby we could expedite \nthe consideration of the legislation. As the Senator has accurately \nnoted, we have addressed this successfully in the past and it is \ncritical that we have an opportunity once again to ensure that this \ntime the legislation does not die in conference. That is what happened. \nThe amendment was dropped in the conference committee, even though the \nSenate had passed on a bipartisan basis this bill as an amendment to \nthe Defense authorization legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I stand corrected. The vote was 57 to 42 in the Senate. \nAs the Senator knows, we passed this on a UC in 1999 by 57 to 42. It \nhas been reported out of the Judiciary Committee 12 to 7. In a vote on \nthis issue in the House of Representatives, there were 232 Republicans \nand Democrats alike who effectively supported it.\n  I ask the Senator a final question. This past week we had one of the \nmost extraordinary events that we experience annually, when the police \nofficers gather on the westside of the Capitol. The names were read of \n233 officers who died in the line of the duty, a good part of those who \ndied in the terrorist acts. No one asked those law enforcement \nofficials what their race was, what their ethnicity was, what their \nreligion or sexual orientation was. They died.\n  We all take a great sense of pride in their service to this country. \nWe have all taken a great sense of pride in the work of selfless \nindividuals who tried to help the victims during this period: organized \nblood drives, organized assistance to the families, without asking \nabout their race or religion or ethnicity or sexual orientation.\n  Is the Senator perplexed, as we celebrate both the lives that were \nlost and celebrate the extraordinary heroism and gallantry of the men \nand women, does the Senator find it somewhat ironic we cannot in this \nbody make sure we are going to protect those individuals from the \nvicious acts of bigotry and hatred and prejudice taking place in the \nUnited States, acts that have actually escalated in recent years?\n  Does the Senator feel a sense of frustration about why this body \ncannot come to grips with a reasonable debate and discussion, as we \nhave in the past, and have action, either for or against this?\n  Does he not share the concern of many families, and the 500 religious \nleaders from all of the great faiths that urged this body to pass this \nlegislation expeditiously, and share the frustration they are feeling \nas religious and moral leaders?\n  Does the Senator feel we have an important responsibility to get to \nthis legislation and consider it and take action and do it in an \nexpedited manner?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts has asked \nsome very good questions.\n  I share his frustration and his utter dismay that a bill of this \nimportance would have difficulty passing the Senate right now. How can \nanyone be opposed to a bill that is already supported by 500 \norganizations? How can anyone be opposed to a bill that has already \npassed on an overwhelming basis--in one case, unanimously?\n  How can anyone be opposed to a bill that addresses the fact that \nalmost every day at least three hate crimes on the average are \ncommitted? How can anyone be opposed to a bill with the title Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act? For the life of me, I don't understand.\n  At the end of the day, whatever day it is, this legislation will \npass. It will pass the easy way or the hard way, but it will pass. We \nwill not adjourn without having passed this legislation. It is that \ncritical. The time has come and gone for delay, for explanation, for \nexcuse, for anything else. There is no reason why this legislation \nshould not pass by an overwhelming bipartisan margin.\n  I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Massachusetts and his \nextraordinary leadership in this issue. I join in acknowledging the \nimportance of this legislation and asking our colleagues to join in \nensuring its passage.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Those assurances, Mr. President, are enormously \nimportant and a tribute to all Americans, one of the great challenges \nto free ourselves from all forms of discrimination.\n  I acknowledge the strong support and leadership of Senator Gordon \nSmith, a prime mover on this among our Republican colleagues. Also, \nSenator Specter has been a very strong supporter.\n\n[[Page S4526]]\n\nThis is a matter of conscience and a defining value for us as a \nsociety.\n  Since the tragedies of September 11, a new spirit has grown across \nAmerica--one where individuals and communities come together to help \nthose in need. We have praised the brave actions of the firefighters \nand police officers who gave their lives to save others, and we have \ndone so without inquiring about their sexual orientation, gender, race, \nor religion. We appropriately call heroes the men and women who, \nwithout regard for their own lives, saved the lives of strangers--and \nwe have never asked if they were gay or lesbian; African American, \nAsian American, White, or Latino. It is important to take this spirit \nto the next level, to come together as a nation to stop the \nperpetration of senseless act of violence against individuals because \nof the religion they practice, the color of their skin or their sexual \norientation.\n  Hate crimes are a national disgrace--an attack on everything this \ncountry stands for. Attorney General Ashcroft recently compared the \nfight against hate crimes to the fight against terrorism, describing \nhate crimes as ``criminal acts that run counter to what is best in \nAmerica--our belief in equality and freedom.''\n  Although America experienced a significant drop in violent crime \nduring the 1990s, the number of hate crimes has continued to grow. In \nfact, according to FBI statistics, in 2000 there were nearly 8,000 \nreported hate crimes committed in the United States. That's over 20 \nhate crimes per day, every day.\n  Hate crimes send a poisonous message that some Americans are second \nclass citizens who deserve to be victimized solely because of their \nrace, their ethnic background, their religion, their sexual \norientation, their gender or their disability. These senseless crimes \nhave a destructive and devastating impact not only on individual \nvictims, but entire communities. If America is to live up to its \nfounding ideals of liberty and justice for all, combating hate crimes \nmust be a national priority.\n  Yet for too long, the federal government has been forced to stand on \nthe sidelines in the fight against these senseless acts of hate and \nviolence. The hate crimes bill will change that by giving the Justice \nDepartment greater ability to investigate and prosecute these crimes, \nand to help the states do so as well. Now is the time for Congress to \nspeak with one voice, insisting that all Americans will be guaranteed \nthe equal protection of the laws. We must pay more than lip service to \nthis core principle of our democracy. We must give those words \npractical meaning in our modern society. No Americans should feel that \nthey are second-class citizens because Congress refuses to protect them \nagainst hate crimes.\n  S. 625 is the same bipartisan bill passed two years ago with 57 \nvotes. Over the last 2 years, support for passage of this bill has only \ngrown, as more and more Senators become aware that hate crimes impact \nevery community, every neighborhood and every family across the nation.\n  We can and should pass this legislation swiftly. Not another day \nshould pass before we take action to fight and prevent these senseless \nacts of violence.\n  I thank the leadership for giving the American people the assurances \nwe will take action on this legislation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator again for his presence on the floor \nand his strong statement.\n  I add a couple of additional thoughts. In 1996, two women were found \nmurdered, their hands bound, their throats cut, just off the \nAppalachian trail in Shenandoah National Park. Their deaths were \nprofound tragedies for those families and their loved ones. They also \nsparked a wave of fear among women and the gay community, that what \nhappened to those two hikers could just as easily happen to them.\n  That response, that fear, is exactly what makes hate crimes different \nfrom all other crimes. They target individuals, but they intimidate and \ndehumanize entire groups of people. Last month, Attorney General \nAshcroft announced that the defendant in this case will be tried using \nthe Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act. This is the first time a \nFederal murder prosecution will use this provision of the law.\n  At his press conference announcing the indictments, Attorney General \nAshcroft said:\n\n       Criminal acts of hate run counter to what is best in \n     America--our belief in equality and freedom.\n\n  Attorney General Ashcroft is absolutely right. Americans know that \nhate crimes injure the victim, the community, and the entire Nation. No \none should be attacked simply because of his or her race, religion, \ngender, physical disabilities, or sexual orientation. However, it is \nironic to hear the Attorney General say that the Department of Justice \nwill aggressively investigate, prosecute, and punish criminal acts of \nviolence motivated by hate and intolerance. It is ironic because the \nonly reason the Attorney General is able to pursue this case in this \nmanner is because the two women were on Federal property when the crime \nwas committed. Had this tragedy occurred outside the National Park, it \nwould have been up to the State and local authorities, and the \nsentencing enhancement that the Justice Department is seeking would not \nhave even been a possibility.\n  As Senator Kennedy has said, until we pass the hate crimes \nlegislation pending before Congress, the promise to aggressively \nprosecute hate crimes is an empty promise. For several years now we \nhave attempted to pass the hate crimes legislation that he and others \nhave introduced. I included it as part of our leadership bills \nintroduced at the beginning of this Congress because I believe it is \nmuch more than a Democratic priority. It ought to be a national \npriority.\n  The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act would assist State and \nlocal authorities when a hate crime such as the Shenandoah murders \noccurs within their jurisdiction. The bill would expand current Federal \nprotections against hate crimes based on race, religion, and national \norigin. It would amend the criminal code to cover hate crimes based on \ngender, sexual orientation, and disability. It would authorize grants \nfor State and local programs designed to combat and prevent hate \ncrimes, and help the Federal Government to assist State and local law \nenforcement officials investigating and prosecuting hate crimes.\n  I might say, Mr. President, this is directed just as much at those \nwho are the perpetrators of hate for reasons of religion. There is a \nrising and disconcerting trend in anti-Semitism in this country that \nalso ought to be addressed. Hate crimes are committed in the name of \nanti-Semitism just as they are committed with other motivations. Those \nwho profess to be concerned about anti-Semitism in this country ought \nto be concerned about the passage of this legislation. That also is why \nI am troubled by those who now choose, for whatever reason, to oppose \nthis unanimous consent request and oppose moving this legislation \nforward.\n  In the fall of 2000 this same legislation passed the Senate as an \namendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill, as we noted \njust a minute ago. There is no more need to delay. If we could pass it \nbefore, we can pass it again. We know the need is clear, the support is \nthere. It is time to finish the job we started 2 years ago. We need to \npass the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act and pass it quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/17/senate-section/article/S4526-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4526-S4527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MOTOR VEHICLE FRANCHISE CONTRACT ARBITRATION FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am concerned that there has been a \nRepublican objecting to considering the Motor Vehicle Franchise \nContract Arbitration Fairness Act, S. 1140. Senator Lott and I are \ncosponsors of this bill to provide basic fairness to many small \nbusinesses in Mississippi and South Dakota, and thousands more across \nthe country.\n  This legislation enjoys exceptional bipartisan support. In fact, more \nthan 60 Senators have cosponsored the Motor Vehicle Franchise Contract \nArbitration Fairness Act, including, I might add, the chairman and \nranking members of the Judiciary Committee.\n  It enjoys such exceptional bipartisan support because it restores \nfundamental fairness to the automobile franchising process.\n  Today, large automobile manufacturers are forcing small business \nautomobile dealers to sign away their legal\n\n[[Page S4527]]\n\nrights as a condition of entering into a franchise agreement. These \nfranchise contracts are presented by the automobile manufacturers as a \n``take it or leave it'' proposition, without any room for good faith \nnegotiations. It is wrong for one party to take advantage of its raw \nnegotiating power to limit the legal rights of another party.\n  This bipartisan bill amends the Federal Arbitration Act to right this \nwrong by simply reserving voluntary arbitration to resolve disputes \nbetween the dealers and manufacturers.\n  Senator Johnson and I have heard from many automobile dealers in \nSouth Dakota who agree with us that this is an important piece of \nlegislation. They have had enough of being forced into accepting \nmandatory binding arbitration clauses as part of their franchise \ncontracts. They are just small business owners trying to keep their \nlegal rights and make a living. South Dakota automobile dealers tell me \nthey just want to be treated fairly, and they should be treated fairly.\n  I hope the minority will soon allow the Senate to consider the \nbipartisan act. This matter is a matter of basic fairness for thousands \nof small business owners across the country. The time has come for the \nmajority of the Senate to be heard on this important issue.\n  Mr. President, I see no one who is seeking recognition, so I yield \nthe floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am introducing an amendment to the \ntrade package that is currently before us. I strongly support the \nintent of both the Andean Trade Preference Act and the Generalized \nSystem of Preferences. These programs seek to help the Andean countries \nof Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and other developing nations, by \napplying preferential treatment to their exports. We agree to reduce or \neliminate tariffs on imports from these countries in order to help them \ndevelop a stronger economy.\n  These programs benefit both sides. They improve the lives of the \nexporting countries' citizens through improved economic opportunities \nthat result from open access to the U.S. market--the best market in the \nworld.\n  For example, since the Andean Trade Preference Act went into effect \nin 1991, the Andean nations have experienced $3.2 billion in new output \nand $1.7 billion in new exports. This has led to the creation of more \nthan 140,000 legitimate jobs in the region.\n  But this act expires, and we must renew it. These programs help the \nUnited States by developing better markets for our exports. If we can \nhelp developing countries increase economic growth and prosperity, \nthey, inevitably, will demand more imports, which provide U.S. \nmanufacturers with more consumers for our products. This, of course, is \ngood for the U.S. economy.\n  Another important benefit from the Andean Trade Preference Act is \nthat by providing people of these regions with employment opportunities \nin legitimate businesses, they will, hopefully, not participate in the \nnarcotic business that is rampant in parts of those areas. This will \ncontribute to the stability of their region and the stability of our \nhemisphere.\n  It is clear that the Andean Trade Preference Act and the Generalized \nSystem of Preferences help both sides. Since we are giving a benefit to \nthese countries, we are also asking something in return, to ensure that \nwe do not help any country that works against our interests in other \nways.\n  For this reason, we have established, in the underlying bill, \nconditions that a country must meet in order to qualify as a \nbeneficiary. Conditions we have required in the past include that a \nbeneficiary not be a Communist-controlled country. We have insisted \nthat a country not be one that has or will expropriate the property of \nU.S. citizens. There must be a rule of law so that if an investment is \nmade in that country, they will be safe from having it expropriated.\n  In the Andean trade bill before us, we add several new conditions. \nFor example, we require that the President consider the extent to which \ncountries are committed to the World Trade Organization and are \nparticipating in negotiations for a Free Trade Area of the Americas. \nThis will ensure their commitment to free trade.\n\n  The President also must consider the extent to which they have helped \nus in our counter-narcotics efforts and anti-corruption efforts before \nproviding these trade benefits. These and other conditions play an \nimportant role in ensuring we do not help countries that may turn \naround and work against us or our citizens in the future.\n  As I reviewed the list of criteria we have established, I noticed a \nglaring omission. We are in the middle of a war on terrorism, yet there \nis no requirement that a country support our efforts in this battle for \nfreedom. It is clear we cannot win this war alone. We need the help of \nour friends around the world to track down terrorists and cut off \nfunds. More than $100 million in assets of terrorists and their \nsupporters have been frozen around the world. The United States has \nfrozen about $30 million of this money. The rest has been cut off by \nvarious allies.\n  We need cooperation like this to defeat this enemy. Therefore, I am \noffering an amendment to the trade package that establishes a \nrequirement that a country support our efforts in the war on terrorism \nin order to receive beneficiary status under the Andean Trade \nPreference Agreement or Generalized System of Preferences.\n  The kind of help each country can give to us will vary, and it may \ndepend on the circumstances a particular country faces and the \nopportunities presented to that country. Some will help us militarily. \nSome will help cut off funds. Others will share intelligence. Some may \ndo so publicly, others privately. It is even possible that a country \nmight not have the opportunity to provide us with anything but moral \nsupport. So I do not think it is appropriate to specify the kind of \nhelp a country must give. But I do believe we must make it clear that \nwe expect any country receiving these preferences to do what they can, \nand what they are requested to do, and that the President take that \ninto consideration when determining these preferences.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this effort to ensure that we are \nable to\n\n[[Page S4528]]\n\nprosecute this critical war effectively with the help of nations that \nwill benefit from our preferential treatment.\n  Also, as we increase commerce with these countries--which we surely \nwill because of these good trade agreements--we want to make sure they \nare cooperating so that they will help us keep any contraband product \nout of America, as we would also expect not to take contraband into \ntheir country.\n  So I think these are good additions to this bill. We have certain \nconditions already. We are in the fight for our life for the freedom of \nour country, and we want every country with whom we have commerce, and \nwhere there is an ingress and an egress, to work with us to make sure \nwe do not have any kind of terrorist activity in our country or in our \nhemisphere.\n  We have already suffered enough. September 11 has changed our way of \nlife. It has changed our attitude. It has changed so much about what is \nnecessary to protect our country. So we must ask every country--\nespecially countries in this hemisphere, but every country--that we \nwill have trade with, and commerce with, countries where we will go in \nand out, and work with them on a basis of trust, to help us in whatever \nway we request.\n  I think it is little to ask, and certainly it will be in their best \ninterest, as well as ours, for terrorists not to come in and be active \nin their countries. That will hurt them in their efforts to represent \ntheir people and have free markets in their countries.\n\n  So I hope that my colleagues will support this amendment at the \nappropriate time. I will certainly speak later as we move on with this \nbill.\n  I certainly hope we are going to pass this bill. The Andean Trade \nPreferences and the General System of Preferences are so important to \nour country. There are 130 free trade agreements in the world. The \nUnited States is party to only 3. That hurts our exporters. It hurts \nour jobs market. And it hurts countries that we could do more trade \nwith if we did not have the tariffs that would keep prices from being \nas low as possible for all of our consumers.\n  So we need this bill. We need to give the President the ability to \npromote trade and to make trade agreements. I hope we will move on \ntoward finishing this bill next week and giving the President another \ntool to open markets and strengthen our economy and help other \ncountries strengthen theirs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be laid \naside so that we can have other amendments offered through the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3442 to amendment No. 3401.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the United States Trade Representative to identify \n effective trade remedies to address the unfair trade practices of the \n                         Canadian Wheat Board)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. TRADE REMEDIES WITH RESPECT TO CANADIAN WHEAT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On February 15, 2002, the United States Trade \n     Representative issued an affirmative finding under section \n     301 of the Trade Act of 1974 that the acts, policies, and \n     practices of the Government of Canada and the Canadian Wheat \n     Board are unreasonable and burden or restrict United States \n     commerce.\n       (2) In its section 301 finding, the United States Trade \n     Representative expressed a desire for long-term reform of the \n     Canadian Wheat Board. However, since concluding on February \n     15, 2002, that the Canadian Government and the Canadian Wheat \n     Board are engaged in unfair trade practices, the United \n     States Trade Representative has not undertaken any initiative \n     to seek reform of the Canadian Wheat Board. Moreover, the \n     United States Trade Representative has not imposed any trade \n     remedy that would provide United States wheat farmers with \n     prompt relief from the unfair trade practices.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the United States Trade Representative should identify \n     specific trade remedies that will provide United States wheat \n     farmers with prompt relief from the unfair trade practices of \n     the Canadian Wheat Board in addition to efforts to seek long-\n     term reform of the Canadian Wheat Board.\n       (c) Reporting Requirement.--No later than October 1, 2002, \n     the United States Trade Representative shall report to \n     Congress a specific plan for implementation of specific trade \n     remedies to provide United States wheat farmers with prompt, \n     real relief from the unfair trade practices of the Canadian \n     Wheat Board, and a specific timetable to seek long-term \n     reform of the Canadian Wheat Board, ensuring that there is no \n     undue delay.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will describe this amendment very \nbriefly. It deals with the wheat trade dispute we have had with Canada.\n  Wheat growers in my State, on behalf of wheat growers all around our \ncountry, brought a Section 301 case alleging unfair wheat trade by \nCanada.\n  Following an investigation by the International Trade Commission, the \nU.S. Trade Ambassador's office came to the following conclusion, and I \nquote:\n\n       The [Canadian Wheat Board] has taken sales from U.S. \n     farmers and is able to do so because it is insulated from \n     commercial risks, benefits from subsidies, has a protected \n     domestic market and special privileges, and has competitive \n     advantages due to its monopoly control over a guaranteed \n     supply of wheat. The wheat trade problem is long-standing and \n     affects the entire U.S. wheat industry.\n\n  That is from the U.S. Trade Ambassador's office.\n  When the U.S. Trade Ambassador decided that our farmers were victims \nof unfair trade from Canada, his office said they were committed to \nfour trade remedies, but they would explicitly not impose tariff rate \nquotas as a penalty on the Canadians. They said, instead, that they \nwould pursue other approaches.\n  First, they say they will take the Canadians to the WTO. Of course, \nthat means years and years and years of talk, and likely no action.\n  Second, they said they would examine the possibility of initiating \nU.S. countervailing duty and antidumping petitions. They can self-\ninitiate those cases. I don't think they will. They seldom ever self-\ninitiate countervailing duty or antidumping cases. I hope they do. I \nwould encourage them to do it. But I am not holding my breath. I expect \nthey will--as most trade officials have over decades and decades--fail \nto self-initiate such a remedy.\n  Third is to identify specific impediments preventing United States \nwheat from entering Canada and present these to the Canadians. Well, \nthese impediments have been around for a long while. I have seen them \nfirsthand in a trip I took to the Canadian border, riding in a little \norange truck with a friend of mine. We were stopped at the border and \ncouldn't take the durum wheat into Canada. We did it just as a \ndemonstration. All the way to the border, we found Canadian 18-wheel \ntrucks bringing wheat south, but you couldn't get any wheat into \nCanada. I think the Canadians know all about the impediments they have \nerected they don't need to have the U.S. trade ambassador coming to \nthem with a list.\n  Fourth, the trade ambassador hopes to seek a solution to the problem \nof the WTO agricultural negotiations, which are scheduled to be \ncompleted by 2005. A fair number of farmers will be out of business by \nthen. My amendment today says what we would like is that a remedy be \nprovided sooner than that.\n  You know, when the U.S. Trade Ambassador announced that he was not \nwilling to impose tariff rate quotas at this time, here is what the \npresident of the Canadian Wheat Board president said: ``Since the \nUnited States did not impose tariffs, we have successfully come through \nour ninth trade challenge.'' In other words, he said that the fact that \nthe United States found them guilty of violating trade rules meant \nnothing, because no tariffs have been imposed.\n  Well, that does not sit right with me. My amendment expresses the \nsense of Congress that prompt action is in order. And it sets forth a \nreporting requirement: No later than October 1, 2002, the United States \nTrade Representative shall report to the Congress, first, a plan for \nimplementation of specific trade remedies to provide United States \nwheat farmers with prompt relief from the unfair trade\n\n[[Page S4529]]\n\npractices of the Canadian Wheat Board and, second, a specific timetable \nto seek long-term reform of the Canadian Wheat Board, ensuring there is \nno undue delay.\n  It is just not acceptable for the U.S. Trade Representative to tell \nU.S. farmers who put together their own money to file expensive 301 \npetitions: Yes, you are right that Canada is playing unfairly, but we \nare not going to do anything about it anytime soon.\n  This amendment says we demand action. We will expect a report on \nOctober 1 from the trade ambassador about what specific remedies he \nwill propose on behalf of American farmers who are now victims of this \nunfair trade.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so I might offer amendments on behalf of other \nSenators, and that in each instance the amendments to be set aside and, \nonce the amendment has been reported by number, the reading be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3430 To Amendment No. 3401\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Kerry, I call up \namendment No. 3430.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Kerry, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3430 to amendment No. 3401.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure that any artificial trade distorting barrier \n  relating to foreign investment is eliminated in any trade agreement \n  entered into under the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of \n                                 2002)\n\n       Section 2102(b) is amended by striking paragraph (3) and \n     inserting the following new paragraph:\n       (3) Foreign investment.--The principal negotiating \n     objective of the United States regarding foreign investment \n     is to reduce or eliminate artificial or trade distorting \n     barriers to trade-related foreign investment.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on a matter at the very \nheart of our war on terror: the deteriorating security conditions in \nAfghanistan. If current trends continue, we may soon find that our \nhard-won success on the battlefield has melted away with the winter \nsnow.\n  In the eastern part of the country, brutal warlords are openly \ndefying the authority of the central government and slaughtering \ninnocent civilians.\n  ``Kill them all: men, women, children, even the chickens.'' Those \nwere the orders of warlord Bacha Khan when\n\n[[Page S4531]]\n\na rival drove him out of the city of Gardez in January. Three weeks ago \nhe returned, and rained 200 rockets on the sorry city. About 30 \ncivilians were killed and 70 others wounded, most of them women and \nchildren. Today, this thug's tanks still occupy the streets of Gardez, \nhis bandits terrorize the inhabitants of nearby Khost, and the central \ngovernment can do nothing but watch.\n  Chairman Karzai, the legitimate leader of Afghanistan, sees his \nauthority openly flouted, while his Defense Minister weighs the pros \nand cons of obeying his superior's lawful orders. Meanwhile, the \nhelpless governor of the province warns that the chaos is rapidly \nturning the local population against both the Karzai administration and \nAmerica. He's hardly alone: journalists quote many local residents \nblaming the United States for the deterioration of security, and even \nlonging for the order of the Taliban period.\n  ``America has replaced the Taliban with the warlords,'' one villager \ntold the New York Times, ``and what we have is the death of \ninnocents.''\n  Nor is Gardez an isolated example. In Mazar-e Sharif, at the other \nside of the country, clashes between two rival warlords killed half a \ndozen people earlier this month. Both of these warlords were, and still \nare, on the U.S. payroll, but that hasn't brought a cessation of \nviolation. Just last week, the airport at Jalalabad came under missile \nattack, for the first time since the Taliban vacated the city in \nNovember.\n  What is going on? What happened to the images of Afghans dancing in \nthe street that we all remember from the liberation of Kabul last fall? \nWhat happened to the widespread joy and optimism that I encountered \nduring my own visit to Afghanistan in January? Why are people actually \nlooking back on the Taliban era with nostalgia rather than horror? It \nis simple: the very same conditions that enabled the Taliban to come to \npower in the mid-1990s are rapidly emerging again. Let's remember why \nthe Taliban were able to make their regime stick. It wasn't their \nmilitary prowess--we found that out in November. It wasn't the \npopularity of their oppressive ideology--we found that out last fall as \nwell. What enabled the Taliban to hold power was simply that, for a \ncritical mass of the Afghan people, they represented the least-bad \noption. For many Afghans, the cruel order of the Taliban was preferably \nto cruel of warlords.\n\n  And now this same disorder is overtaking Afghanistan once again. Not \nonly is the United States failing to rein in the warlords, we are \nactually making them the centerpiece of our strategy. Unless we take a \nserious look at our policy, I greatly fear we may be setting the stage \nfor a tragic replay of recent Afghan history.\n  Why do the people of Gardez blame America for the vicious actions of \nwarlords like Bacha Khan? Well, maybe it is due to the fact that this \nkiller is on the U.S. payroll. He has been taking our money since \nDecember, when his troops stood by and let al-Qaeda terrorist escape \nfrom Tora Bora; many U.S. military sources believe that Osama bin Laden \nhimself escaped, due to the double-dealing of Bacha Khan and his \ncomrades. Granted, the war effort in Afghanistan forces us to rely on \nsome unsavory characters. I am under no illusions here. Sometimes, in \nwarfare, you have got to make a deal with the Devil. But sometimes the \nDevil just takes your money and laughs. Bacha Khan is a perfect \nexample. After letting al-Qaeda troops escape from Tora Bora, he conned \nthe U.S. military into bombing his personal rivals--by labeling them \nal-Qaeda.\n  He, and other warlords like him, are supposedly helping us hunt down \nTaliban remnants, but with allies like than, who needs enemies? I \nregret to say that this is exactly the question many Afghans are asking \nabout us. The United States, and the world community, have pledged \nbillions of dollars to the recovery of Afghanistan. But all the money \nin the world won't do much good without one overriding thing: security.\n\n       Anyone knows that without security, very little else is \n     possible; humanitarian workers can't move around, internally \n     displaced people won't go back to their homes, refugees won't \n     return to the country, the Afghan diaspora won't be willing \n     to send money in and send in themselves to try to help put \n     structure back into that terribly war-torn nation.\n\n  This is not just my opinion; it is a direct quote from Secretary of \nState Rumsfeld, on April 22. So why does the administration steadfastly \nresist any expansion of the U.N.-mandated International Security \nAssistance force, or ISAF?\n  Afghan leader Hamid Karzai, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and \njust about every expert on the map has called for an expansion of ISAF, \nin both scope--it is currently confined to Kabul--and tenure. Its \nmandate expires long before the transition to democratic government is \nscheduled to take place.\n\n  The long-term solution is to rebuild Afghanistan's army and police \nforce, and we have taken our first steps in this process. But it can't \nhappen overnight: it will take at least 18 months, more likely several \nyears, just to train and equip a barebones force capable of bringing \nbasic order to the country. In the meantime, there are only three \nalternatives: having American troops to serve as peacekeepers, building \nup a robust international force, or permitting Afghanistan to revert to \nbloody chaos.\n  The first option can be described as status quo-minus. U.S. forces \nare currently imposing a rough order in the country, but, as the \ncurrent chaos in Gardez shows, not on any consistent basis. They are \nspread thin, and they are not officially tasked to perform this \nfunction. ``Our mission here is to capture or kill al-Qaeda and senior \nTaliban,'' said a U.S. military spokesman, as the rockets fell on \nGardez, ``But particular factional fighting? I don't think it's for us \nto get into.''\n  In the coming months, U.S. forces will be even less able to serve as \nde facto peacekeepers. As large scale offensive operations shift to \nsmaller scale Special Forces deployments, the number of U.S. troops \navailable will drop accordingly. There are currently about 7,000 \nAmerican soldiers in Afghanistan--far too few to serve as peacekeepers \nas well as warfighters--and the assets are already being redeployed. In \nApril the Pentagon cut its naval force commitment to Operation Enduring \nFreedom in half, to one carrier and 2,000 marines afloat. This month, \neight B-1 bombers based in Oman began returning home to Dyess Air Force \nBase in Texas. The redeployment says good things about our success \nagainst al-Qaeda--but does not signal a strong commitment to stay the \ncourse.\n  Soon the crunch time could come in a matter of months and our policy \nwill be put to the test. As local warlords keep probing our resolve, we \nwill either have to re-task more and more U.S. troops to de facto \npeacekeeping operations, or we will have to retreat. Wouldn't it be \nbetter to let allies share the burden? An international security force \nis clearly in our national interest: if we want our military presence \nin Afghanistan to be focused on fighting al-Qaeda and Taliban holdouts, \nwe should be eager for other countries to take the lead in \npeacekeeping. We should be lending our full support to ISAF expansion, \nto view it as a force-multiplier. Instead, the administration treats it \nas an impediment to ongoing operations. One administration source even \ndescribed ISAF expansion as a ``cancer that could metastasize'' \nthroughout the country. Is it any surprise, given this attitude, that \nother nations are reluctant to help fill the security void? Without \nstrong, decisive U.S. leadership, including, but not limited to, an \nironclad commitment to back up our allies militarily if their troops \ncome under enemy attack, no international force can possibly succeed.\n  So what about option three--placing our trust in the hands of the \nwarlords? Maybe we can bribe and cajole them into turning themselves \ninto good citizens. Maybe they will behave better in the future than \nthey have in the past, better than they are behaving today. Maybe--but \nI wouldn't bet on it. Yet this bet--the wager that the warlords will \nhalt their deprivations during the 2 years before an Afghan army can be \ntrained--seems to be the totality of the administration's strategy.\n  Three weeks ago, on April 22, Secretary Rumsfeld essentially admitted \nas much: ``How ought security to evolve in that country depends on \nreally two things,'' he said. ``One is what the interim government \ndecides they think ought to happen, what the warlord forces in the \ncountry decide they\n\n[[Page S4532]]\n\nthink ought to happen, and the interaction between those two.'' I must \ndisagree with the Secretary on this: we should let out policy be \ndictated by ``what the warlord forces think ought to happen.''\n  Did we put American troops in harm's way merely to do the bidding of \n``the warlord forces''? Did we spend $17 billion in military \nexpenditures in the Afghan campaign merely to serve the interests of \n``the warlord forces''? Did we decimate al-Qaeda and remove the Taliban \nfrom power merely to hand power over to ``the warlord forces''? Brutal, \nbloodthirsty, barbaric warlords are not the solution to Afghanistan's \nproblems. These ``warlord forces'' are the source of Afghanistan's \nproblems.\n  Does this matter to America? What about the option of letting \nAfghanistan degenerate into the state of lawlessness that made way for \nthe Taliban? That is obviously not in the interest of Afghanistan, but \nis preventing it a national priority for the United States? I submit \nthat it most certainly is.\n  After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, America turned \nits back as the country disintegrated into chaos. The President was \nright when, in his speech at the Virginia Military Institute last \nmonth, he promised not to repeat this mistake. The brutal disorder of \nthe early 1990s created the Taliban--and if we permit this condition to \nreturn, the cycle will almost certainly repeat itself. Let's not forget \nwhy we went to war in the first place: Afghanistan had become a haven \nfor the mass-murderers who attacked our homeland on September 11. \nWithout internal security, the country will again become a den of \nterrorists, narcotics traffickers, and exporters of violent insurgency. \nThe President was right to say, ``We will stay until the mission is \ndone''--but I hope he understands what our mission really is. In \nconcrete terms, our mission, in addition to ferreting out remnants of \nal-Qaeda and the Taliban, is ensuring basic security for the fledgling \nAfghan Government-- providing it protection from the vast array of \ninternal and external threats to its very existence.\n\n  For the immediate future, probably 2 years, that means an \ninternational armed presence, whether U.S. troops or an expanded ISAF. \nI believe ISAF makes much more sense, but however the force is \nconstituted it must have the following components: It must be deployed \nthroughout the country, controlling the five to seven major cities and \nthe main highways connecting them. It must have robust rules of \nengagement, and the weapons to impose order on unruly warlords. These \nmust be peacemakers as much as peacekeepers. It must have the full \ndiplomatic, financial, and military support of the United States.\n  Whether or not American troops are part of this force--they currently \nare not, but we shouldn't rule this option out--we must provide an \nunquestionable commitment to back up ISAF as it fulfils its mission. \nOther nations are willing to take on the dangerous work of patrolling \nthe front lines--but not unless they know that the cavalry stands ready \nto ride to the rescue. It must have the assurance that the world \ncommunity--and particularly the U.S.--will stay the course. We can't \ncut and run if resistance increases. The greater the uncertainty about \nAmerican commitment to security, the greater incentive our enemies will \nhave to challenge our resolve.\n  Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld has suggested that $130 million of \nfunds previously appropriated to the Defense Department be devoted to a \nfund for quasi-diplomatic endeavors related to the war against \nterrorism. I suggest that the best use of this money would be to \nsupport peacekeeping efforts in Afghanistan, whether conducted by the \nDefense Department directly or by our coalition partners operating \nunder an expanded ISAF. Funding an effective international security \nforce in Afghanistan would not only free up American military assets \nfor warmaking missions, it would also deter terrorist forces from \nreclaiming the ground they have so decisively lost. With the Loya Jirga \nprocess scheduled to start in mid-June and Afghanistan's nascent \ngovernment under daily attack by enemies both internal and external, I \ncan think of no better or more urgent use for these funds.\n  We must, I submit, lead the way in guaranteeing the security of \nAfghanistan for the relatively brief period before it can stand on its \nown. We must do this to honor the promise that President Bush made, on \nbehalf of all Americans. We must do this to demonstrate our values to \nthe wrest of the world. We must do this to safeguard our own national \nsecurity interests, to make sure that our military gains since \nSeptember 11 are not all wiped away. We must do this because it is \nsmart, because it is necessary, and because it is right.\n  I believe that the best way to achieve this goal is through an \nexpansion of ISAF. The immediate devotion of $130 million, money which \nthe Defense Department stipulates that it does not require or want for \nthe costs of war-fighting operations, would be an excellent place to \nstart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/17/senate-section/article/S4532-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4532-S4533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TRAGIC TOLL\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in just the last 16 weeks, tragically ten \nchildren have been murdered in metro Detroit. Eight of these kids have \ndied after being shot. The oldest was 16 years old and the youngest was \na mere 3 years old. Three years old, Mr. President. According to the \nDetroit Free Press, in the last four months in metro Detroit nearly as \nmany children have been murdered by guns as in all of last year. These \nare truly horrific events made even more so by their randomness. Many \nof these kids were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n  Destinee Thomas, one of the youngest victims, only 3 years old, was \nkilled while watching television in her own bedroom when someone fired \nan AK47 into her home. The Detroit Police Department and the people of \nDetroit were so outraged by her death that the police department \nlaunched Project Destinee, a special effort by law enforcement to \naggressively investigate and pursue gang members involved in the \nshooting.\n  Eight year old Brianna Caddell was also killed by an AK-47 when an \nunknown gunman opened fire on her house. This little girl was in bed \nsleeping.\n  Another victim, 16 year old Alesia Robinson, was killed by a single \ngunshot to the face. According to police, her 19 year old boyfriend was \nplaying with a gun on the front porch, firing it into the air. When \nAlesia asked him to stop, police said, he pointed the gun at her and \nfired. The 19 year old has been charged with first-degree murder.\n  These horrific events underline the need for the vigorous enforcement \nof our gun laws and the overwhelming need for common sense gun safety \nlegislation. In light of these tragic events, I once again urge my \ncolleagues to support gun safety legislation.\n  I know my colleagues join me in extending our thoughts and prayers to \nall of those who have lost their friends and family members to gun \nviolence.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Detroit Free Press \nbe entered into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Detroit Free Press, May 14, 2002]\n\n                           10 Lives Cut Short\n\n       This year, 10 children ages 16 and younger have died as a \n     result of homicides in the metro area--all of them in \n     Detroit.\n\n\n                 January 13--Jameise Scaife, 3 days old\n\n       Doctors performed an emergency cesarean section to deliver \n     Jameise after his pregnant mother jumped from a burning \n     apartment building set ablaze by an arsonist.

Police say Walker and a 19-year-\n     old friend allegedly planned to rob two men as they left the \n     motel. But when they announced the holdup, one of the men \n     pulled out a gun and shot Walker, police said.\n\n\n                   February 21--Brennon Cunningham, 3\n\n       Died of strangulation. Brennon was found dead in a bedroom, \n     wet from a bath. Police allege that his mother, Aimee \n     Cunningham, 34, tried to make authorities believe Brennon \n     drowned. She is charged with first-degree murder.\n\n\n                     February 25--Ajanee Pollard, 7\n\n       Fatally shot in the head when a gunman opened fire on her \n     family's car as they were about to go shopping. Her brother, \n     Jason Pollard Jr., 6, lost his pancreas and suffered other \n     internal organ damage from gunshots. Her two sisters, Aerica, \n     6, and Alyah, 4, also were wounded, as was their mother, \n     Aelizabeth Niebrzydowski. Two men, Joel\n\n[[Page S4533]]\n\n     Allen, 24, and Willie Robinson, 25, are charged with Ajanee's \n     killing and with assault with intent to commit murder. Police \n     say the shooting was prompted by a dispute over a $40 radio.\n\n\n                      March 23--Destinee Thomas, 3\n\n       Shot and killed while watching television in her bedroom \n     when someone opened fire on her home with an AK47. Two men, \n     Julian Key, 19, and Cedric Pipes, 21, are charged with first-\n     degree murder. Outraged by her death, police and prosecutors \n     launched Project Destinee, an effort to round up all members \n     of the rival gangs they allege were involved in the dispute \n     that led to the shooting.\n\n\n                     March 28--Alesia Robinson, 16\n\n       Killed by a single gunshot wound to the face. Alesia's \n     boyfriend, Darron Kilgore, 19, is charged with first-degree \n     murder. According to police, Kilgore was playing with a gun \n     on the front porch, firing it into the air.

Christopher's \n     12-year-old half-brother was charged in juvenile court with \n     manslaughter and possession of a firearm. The suspect's \n     family said the pair were playing with a gun they found in a \n     playground and that the shooting was an accident.\n\n\n                      April 10--Brianna Caddell, 8\n\n       Shot and killed while sleeping in her bed.

Ira Keener then turned \n     the gun on herself. Police said Ira Keener, who suffered from \n     severe asthma, had experienced delusions and had a mental \n     breakdown about a month before the shooting.

SYLVIA FACTOR ON HER 80TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. CRAIG. The world was a bustling time in 1922: the tomb of \nKing Tutankhamen was unearthed, Benito Mussolini was granted temporary \ndictatorial powers in Italy, James Joyce's Ulysses was published, \ninsulin was isolated leading to the first successful treatment for \ndiabetes, and the Lincoln Memorial here in Washington, DC, was opened \nto the public. It also marked the year that a very special lady was \nborn. Her name is Sylvia Factor.\n  I want to take this opportunity to recognize Sylvia on the occasion \nof her 80th birthday on May 17. I have met Sylvia and can say without \nhesitation she is a truly exceptional woman. She has witnessed a lot in \nher lifetime and is living proof the American dream can come true. A \nfirst-generation American, her parents immigrated to this country from \nEastern Europe in the hopes of making a better life for their family.\n  Sylvia grew up in Wilkes Barre, PA, and the Bronx, NY, and was swept \nup into the war effort as a young woman. During World War II she \nanswered the call to support her country like so many other ``Rosies,'' \nby helping manufacture the Corsair airplane for the United States \nMarines at Chance Vought. She later supported her family by working at \nColumbia Records in Bridgeport, CT, and then 28 years at Raybestos-\nManhattan in Stratford, CT.\n  Today, she is still an active member of her community, using her \nretirement years to contribute to the well-being of others in many \nforms. Sylvia volunteers at the Jewish Home for the Elderly in \nFairfield, CT, and the Jewish Family Services of Bridgeport. She sets \nthe kind of example President Bush was seeking in his call for all \ncitizens to volunteer in their communities, and it is an example worth \nfollowing.\n  She also enjoys visiting with her friends and family, including her \nson Mallory, daughter-in-law Elizabeth and grandchildren: India, \nMallory III, and Cailley Factor. Today I congratulate Sylvia for all \nshe has done, and continues to do, for her country and community. I \nonly hope that I can be as active and vibrant as she is when I reach \n80. I wish her a heartfelt happy birthday, with many more to \nfollow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/17/senate-section/article/S4533-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4533-S4534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO VAL G. HEMMING, M.D.\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Dr. Val G. \nHemming, M.D., Dean of the F. Edward Hebert School of Medicine at the \nUniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, USUHS. Tomorrow, \non May 18, 2002, following the graduation ceremonies at the School of \nMedicine, Dr. Hemming will mark the end of his 37 year career in \nFederal service.\n  Dean Hemming's Federal career began in the United States Air Force \nwhere he served for 25 years as a career officer and physician from \n1965 through 1990. In 1987, Dr. Hemming was selected to serve as the \nChair of the USUHS School of Medicine Department of Pediatrics, a \nposition in which he continued to serve as a civilian upon his \nretirement from the Air Force, at the rank of Colonel. In 1995, he was \nappointed interim Dean of the School of Medicine, and following an \nextensive search process, he was selected as Dean in May of 1996.\n  As dean, Dr. Hemming has worked to further the established mission \nand goals of the USUHS School of Medicine. Under his leadership, the \nUniversity has continued to provide the Nation with highly qualified \nhealth professionals dedicated to career service in the Department of \nDefense and the U.S. Public Health Service. These graduates leave USUHS \ntrained to provide continuity in ensuring medical readiness and the \npreservation of lessons learned during combat and casualty care. This \ncritical role is, in fact, the significant factor that led the Congress \nto establish USUHS in 1972.\n  During his career, Dr. Hemming has served as an advisor to Congress, \nmost recently testifying before the House Veteran's Affairs Committee's \nSubcommittee on Oversight and Investigations during hearings that \nresulted from the events of September 11, 2001. Dr. Hemming's knowledge \nand unique expertise provided valuable insight as the Committee \ndiscussed the urgent requirement for civilian physicians to be trained \nin the medical response to weapons of mass destruction, WMD. \nSignificantly, those hearings resulted in proposed legislation \nrecommending that the USUHS School of Medicine share its WMD-focused \ncurricula with the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  It is exceptional leadership such as that of Dean Hemming and the \ndedicated careers of his uniquely trained School of Medicine graduates, \ncombined with the extraordinary USUHS faculty and staff, which led to \nthe awarding of the Joint Meritorious Unit Award to USUHS by the \nSecretary of Defense on December 11, 2000. Dr. Hemming's commitment and \nleadership was also recognized in the tribute paid by the Secretary of \nDefense Donald Rumsfeld who recently wrote:\n\n       The Department takes great pride in the fact that the USUHS \n     graduates have become the backbone for our Military Health \n     System. The training they receive in combat and peacetime \n     medicine is essential to providing superior force health \n     protection, and improving the quality of life for our service \n     members, retirees, and families. All of us in the Office of \n     the Secretary of Defense place great emphasis on the \n     retention of quality physicians in the military. The USUHS \n     ensures those goals are met.\n\n\n[[Page S4534]]\n\n\n  As Dean Hemming retires from his distinguished career, it is \nincumbent to point out that amid all of his successes as an academic \nleader, Dr. Hemming also achieved significant success as a scientist. \nHis research interests have included pathogenesis of Lancefield group B \nstreptococcal infections in the neonate and pathogenesis of lower \nrespiratory tract bacterial and viral infections in infants and young \nchildren. Indeed, his research in the Respiratory Syncytial Virus, RSV, \ninfection resulted in the first biological product for the prevention \nand reduction of RSV infection in children; his product, which was \napproved by the Food and Drug Administration in January of 1996, has \ncontributed to the fight against an infection that had claimed the \nlives of 4,500 children and hospitalized more than 90,000 children in \nour Nation each year.\n  Our Nation can be proud of Dr. Hemming's long and distinguished \ncareer of service and I am pleased to join with his family, friends and \ncolleagues in expressing appreciation for the significant contributions \nhe has made to the health of the uniformed services and that of all \ncitizens, particularly our children. I certainly wish him continued \nsuccess and happiness in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/17/senate-section/article/S4534-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OREGON HERO OF THE WEEK\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am proud to rise today \nto pay tribute to a true American Patriot from my home state of Oregon. \nThis week, I want to recognize the service and compassion of Sho \nDozono, of Portland, OR.\n  Mr. Dozono, President and CEO of Azumano Carlson Wagonlit Travel and \nthe Azumano Group, is a respected member of the Portland business \ncommunity. He continually tries to improve his community and has served \non a number of boards and commissions including the Portland Metro \nYMCA, Portland Multnomah Progress Board, and was recently elected to \nserve as the chair of the Portland Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce \nboard of directors.\n  But like so many employers, after September 11, 2001, Mr. Dozono was \nforced to lay off employees and watch as the effects of the terrorist \nattacks spread across the country to his west coast home. Mr. Dozono \nand his wife Loen decided that they would not allow their own financial \ndifficulties to keep them from showing their love and support to the \nvictims in New York City. What started as an idea of a bus convoy \nacross the United States grew into an inspirational display of \npatriotism and compassion, aptly named the ``Flight for Freedom''. Mr. \nDozono brought together over 1,000 Oregonians to answer the call of \nMayor Rudy Giuliani for tourists. Not only did the group lend a healing \nhand to the broken economy of New York City, but the ``Flight for \nFreedom'' was instrumental in convincing Americans everywhere to travel \nagain. The week-long trip, which included marching in the Columbus Day \nParade, attracted worldwide publicity and earned recognition from New \nYork and national officials. At a crucial time, Dozono persevered to \nshare his belief in the American dream with those whose light had been \ntragically dimmed.\n  I rise to salute Sho Dozono, not only for his inspirational efforts \nafter 9/11, but because his desire to improve his community is a life-\nlong commitment. In 1997, Dozono traveled to Philadelphia to represent \nthe City of Portland at the Presidential Summit on Volunteerism in \nAmerica, chaired by then-retired General Colin Powell. He is a former \nchair of the Portland Public Schools Foundation and co-chaired a march \nthat raised over $11 million to save teaching positions that would have \notherwise been cut because of reduced funding.\n  This month as we honor and celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage \nMonth, I find it very appropriate to rise and recognize the efforts of \nSho Dozono. I believe Mr. Dozono is to be commended for his ongoing \nefforts to serve his community and country, and I salute him as a true \nhero for Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/17/senate-section/article/S4534-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO HENRY WOODS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the life \nof Henry Woods, a great scholar and beloved Federal judge in Arkansas. \nJudge Woods passed away unexpectedly in March, and I wish to take a \nmoment today to honor his many achievements and express sorrow for his \nloss. There is no question but that his legal expertise, unique \nperspective and commanding presence will be sorely missed by so many in \nmy home State.\n  Henry Woods was born on March 17, 1918, in Abbeville, MS. He attended \nthe University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, where he received a \nbachelor's degree in 1938 and a law degree in 1940. Following his \nformal education, Judge Woods served in a variety of positions, \nincluding as a special agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a \ntrial attorney in Texarkana and Little Rock and as coordinator for the \nsuccessful gubernatorial campaigns of both Sid McMath and Dale Bumpers. \nHenry was also past president of the Arkansas Bar Association and \nArkansas Trial Association. At 62, he was nominated U.S. District \nJudge, Eastern District of Arkansas, by President Carter and began a \nnew chapter in his professional life while most of his peers were \nplanning for retirement.\n  Like so many Arkansans who had the good fortune to know Judge Woods, \nI will always remember him for his intellect and commitment to social \njustice. Whether Judge Woods was in the courtroom or the classroom, he \nnever wavered in his passion for fairness and equality, even when he \nendorsed positions he knew would ignite strong criticism. As long as \nJudge Woods believed what he did was right, he was prepared to take the \nheat. This was true when he spoke loudly and openly against Gov. Orval \nFaubus' use of the National Guard at Central High and later when he \nissued several controversial court rulings in his role as presiding \nJudge in the Pulaski County school desegregation case.\n  As I have reflected on Judge Woods' prolific life, I am comforted by \nthe fact that his towering legacy and impassioned spirit will live on \nthrough the countless individuals he inspired. Death has ended Henry \nWoods' life, but it hasn't extinguished his invaluable contribution to \npublic service in Arkansas. I and others who were raised to believe \nthat serving in public office is a high and noble calling owe a deep \ndebt of gratitude to Judge Woods and others from his generation. I, for \none, have been deeply moved by his life and will always be mindful of \nthe example and high standard he set.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/17/senate-section/article/S4534-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SALEM NEW HAMPSHIRE MARCHING BAND\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise here today \nto honor the achievements of the Salem High School Band and Color Guard \non their exemplary show in the competition leading to their selection \nto play in the nationally televised Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.\n  Congratulations are in order for Salem High, as they have also played \nin the 2001 Tournament of Roses parade, which is attributed with some \nof the success this time around in the granting of the New York parade. \nThere were only 12 bands chosen nationwide between nearly 300 high \nschools or colleges competing for the honor.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the outstanding growth of the Manchester Airport. Recently \nit has completed the changes and additions that have been underway for \nthe last 8 years helping pave its path as one of the premier airports \nin the state. These changes include a 158,000-square-foot passenger \nterminal with a 70,000-square-foot terminal addition, and a six level \nparking garage and connecting pedestrian walkway. These drastic \nimprovements have taken this once small, and seldom used airport and \nturned it into a legitimate point of travel. With all this advancement \nit has been a point of destination for more than 3.2 million passengers \nin 2001.\n  In addition, cargo shipping has become a growing factor at the \nManchester airport as it is now ranked the third largest cargo airport \nin New England. A recent impact report has shown that the business \nrelated to the airport added 500 million in 1998 and is estimated at \nmore than 1 billion annually by 2010.\n  Factors such as convenience, ample parking, and greater customer \nservice has created an airport that the citizens of Manchester can be \nproud of. I commend Kevin Dillion, airport director of Manchester for \nbeing named the Travel Person of the Year in 2001. The outstanding \nservices available at Manchester will surely be a factor in the growth \nof the airport. This project has truly added to the appeal Manchester \nholds for all travelers. It is an honor and privilege representing the \ngood people of Manchester.\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to a pillar in the entrepreneurial community of New Hampshire. \nMrs. Annalee Davis Thorndike, the creator and manufacturer of the \ncollectible Annalee Dolls, passed away Sunday April 7, 2002, at the age \nof 87. The Annalee Mobilitee Dolls are considered some of the most \nfamous manufactured items to come from New Hampshire in the 20th \ncentury.\n  Beginning in 1930, Annalee and her husband took the first step in \nturning her dollmaking hobby into a business. Flourishing, the business \nreached a total of 250 to 300 employees in the Lakes Region. Displaying \nher dolls in the White House at times, Thorndike was awarded the \n``Collectibles and Gift Industry Pioneer Award'' in 1997. Epitomizing \nthe American spirit and following through with her dreams, Annalee's \ndolls will always be a proud part of the communities as the greatest \ncollectible dolls to ever come from New Hampshire.\n  Five years ago Thorndike stepped down from head of operations and \nturned the business over to her sons. New Hampshire is excited to see \nthe Annalee Mobilitee Dolls continue to be manufactured in the same \nlocation they have been since 1955 when Annalee founded the company. \nToday a museum of dolls can be visited at the manufacturing site. A \ntrue spirit and friend of New Hampshire, Annalee David Thorndike will \nbe sorely missed by all citizens of the great state. It is an honor and \nprivilege to have represented Mrs. Annalee Davis Thorndike in the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/17/senate-section/article/S4535-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 3694.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize \nthe Commissioner of Food and Drugs to conduct oversight of any entity \nengaged in the recovery, screening, testing, processing, storage, or \ndistribution of human tissue or human tissue-based products; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Human \nTissue Transplant Safety Act of 2002, which would provide a much needed \nregulatory framework to help ensure the safety of transplanted human \ntissue. In 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, FDA examined \nthe public health issues posed by human tissue transplantation and \nconcluded that the existing regulatory framework was insufficient and \nneeded to be strengthened. Yet more than 5 years later, the agency has \nfailed to implement critical regulatory changes and strengthen \noversight of tissue processors, known as tissue banks. The legislation \nI am introducing today is designed to help remedy the gaps in the \nregulatory safety net.\n  While people are familiar with the concept of organ donation, tissue \ndonation is not well understood by most Americans. Yet the tissue \nindustry is very diverse and is growing rapidly. In fact, tissue \ndonations now make possible about 750,000 transplants per year. The \nrecovery and medical use of tissue, including skin, bone, cartilage, \ntendons, ligaments, and heart valves, are unlike organ transplants \nbecause the tissue is usually not transplanted ``as-is'' from the \ndonor's body into that of the recipient. Rather, donated tissue \nfrequently undergoes considerable processing before it can be used. \nBone from a donor's femur, for example, can be reshaped into a \ncomponent designed to give support to a recipient's spine.\n  Technology that greatly reduces the risk of rejection now allows \nsurgeons to use actual bone in their patients rather than metal or \nother synthetic substances. In addition, donated tissue, once it is \nprocessed, can frequently be stored for a period of time. In contrast, \norgans must be transplanted into the recipient's body within hours of \ntheir recovery.\n  The organizations that make up the tissue industry are collectively \nreferred to as tissue banks. Some are engaged in tissue recovery, while \nothers process, store, and distribute human tissue. Tissue donation is \na generous, selfless act that improves the lives of many Americans. \nJust one donor, in fact, can help a large number of people in various \nways. Skin donations, for instance, can be used to heal burn victims or \naid in reconstructive surgical procedures. Ligaments and tendons can be \nused to repair worn-out knees. Bone donations can be used in hip \nreplacements or spinal surgery enabling recipients to regain mobility. \nDonated arteries and veins can restore circulation, and heart valves \ncan be transplanted to save lives.\n  The phenomenal growth and increasing competitiveness of the industry \nin its search for new sources of donated tissue, however, have resulted \nin some problems. Tissue obtained from unsuitable donors has been \nallowed to enter the American tissue supply, raising serious doubts \nabout the adequacy of federal regulations. Other concerns involve \nwhether or not the practices of some tissue banks are sufficient to \nreduce the danger of spreading such illnesses as the human variant of \nmad cow disease. Because communicable diseases such as HIV and \nhepatitis, among others, can also be transmitted through tissues, it is \nvital that potential donors be screened for suitability and tissue be \ntested effectively, to make sure it is safe.\n  FDA recognized these issues in 1997, and the agency published its \n``Proposed Approach to the Regulation of Cellular and Tissue-Based \nProducts.'' The FDA proposed to: (1) require infectious disease \nscreening and testing for cells and tissue transplanted from one person \nto another; (2) require that cells and tissues be handled according to \nprocedures designed to prevent contamination and preserve tissue \nfunction and integrity; and (3) require all tissue processing \nfacilities to register with the agency. Thereafter, FDA promulgated \nthree separate regulations that address these requirements. But of \nthose, only a registration requirement has been implemented.\n\n  Five years later, the majority of the proposed regulatory changes \nstill have not been adopted, and, remarkably, FDA officials recently \nadvised me that the agency cannot even tell me when the remaining \nregulations will be made final.\n  The FDA's failure to act in this area that affects public health and \nsafety is simply inexcusable. It is a case, apparently, of bureaucratic \ninertia at its worst.\n  I have long been concerned about the vulnerabilities that exist in \nthe tissue industry and the adequacy of the Government's oversight.\n  Last year--exactly a year ago--as the chairman of the Senate \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I held a hearing to look at \ntissue banks and the efficacy of the current regulatory framework. The \ntestimony was deeply troubling.\n  For example, one witness testified that some unscrupulous tissue \nbanks have engaged in a practice in which tissues that were initially \ntested positive for contamination were simply tested over and over \nagain until the technicians achieved the negative result they wanted.\n\n[[Page S4537]]\n\n  Let me explain that again. This is human tissue that has tested \npositive for contamination, and the reaction to that was to keep \ntesting it until a negative result came up. You cannot keep testing \ninto compliance. Obviously, there is a problem if, even once, the \ntissue tests positive for contamination; and it should not be used.\n  The FDA official in my hearing called this ``testing tissue into \ncompliance'' a practice that is obviously unsafe and must be stopped.\n  The hearing also revealed that scores of tissue banks have never once \nbeen inspected by the FDA. And of those that have been inspected, some \nwere found to have had deficiencies, but they were never reinspected to \nsee that the problems had been corrected.\n  Moreover, the FDA had no concept, prior to the registration \nrequirement, of how many tissue banks were actually operating. The FDA \nthought there were possibly 150. More than 350 registered as a result \nof the one requirement that the FDA did put into effect.\n  As a result of the subcommittee's in-depth investigation, I concluded \nthat serious gaps existed in the FDA's regulation. But I also thought, \nand hoped, and have received promises from the agency, that it would \nact. After all, it had developed a good, sound strategy back in 1997.\n  So last year, in the hearings that I held a year ago this month, the \nFDA promised me that the regulations would be made final.\n  Unfortunately, I have been proven wrong about the FDA's commitment to \nreform. And the lack of action has had serious, indeed, tragic \nconsequences.\n  In November of last year, a 23-year-old man died in Minnesota after \nundergoing routine knee surgery in which tissue was transplanted into \nhis body. It contained a deadly bacteria which ultimately killed this \nyoung man. Others have fallen seriously ill because of the tainted \ntissue transplants.\n  In March of this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nreleased findings that linked bacterial infections in donated human \ntissue to allografts that had been used for transplants in 26 cases. \nAnd the number, undoubtedly, is going to increase since the CDC's \ninvestigation is still ongoing.\n\n  I have tried to work with the FDA to expedite the implementation of \nthe proposed regulations. I have asked, repeatedly: What does the FDA \nneed? Are more resources needed? Just tell us what you need. But, \nunfortunately, the threat to public health that the FDA identified so \nlong ago continues to exist today.\n  In an effort to prevent any further tragedies, I am today introducing \nlegislation to require the FDA to go forward and issue these much \nneeded regulations.\n  First, my legislation will explicitly authorize the FDA to regulate \nany entity that engages in the recovery, screening, testing, \nprocessing, storage, or distribution of human tissue, or human tissue-\nbased products. In other words, all tissue banks would be required to \nadhere to the standards that the FDA has identified as necessary for \nensuring public safety. This provision would remove any doubt about the \nFDA's authority to regulate tissue banks.\n  Second, the legislation will make it mandatory for all tissue banks \nto register with the FDA. If any tissue bank is out of compliance with \nFDA requirements, the agency will be authorized to suspend and, if \nnecessary, revoke the tissue bank's registration, to prevent the bank \nfrom operating.\n  Third, the legislation will require tissue banks to report adverse \nincidents, including the detection of an infection within 15 days. \nCurrently, tissue banks are not required to report adverse incidents to \nthe Federal Government. And if they do not voluntarily report \nincidents, it is very difficult for the Federal Government to take \neffective action.\n  Finally, the bill also requires the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to develop a database to store the adverse incident reports. \nThat central repository of information would be very useful to the CDC.\n  I want to emphasize that the vast majority of tissue banks operate in \na safe, professional manner. We are now very fortunate that advances in \ntechnology allow tissue to be used in ways that truly enhance lives for \nthousands of Americans.\n  This legislation will help ensure that the transplantation of human \ntissue saves lives, not ends them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2533. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for miscellaneous enhancements in Social Security benefits, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The \nSocial Security Benefit Enhancements for Women Act of 2002. I am proud \nto be joined by my colleague from California, Senator Feinstein. This \nlegislation makes fiscal improvements in benefits for women under the \ncurrent Social Security system. These improvements will increase the \nbenefits for disabled widows, divorced retirees, and widows whose \nhusbands died quickly after an early retirement.\n  While these benefit changes are small in scope, they represent a \nbipartisan effort to provide more economic security for women who work \nhard, sacrifice much and yet still live near poverty. Women comprise \nthe majority of Social Security beneficiaries, representing almost 60 \npercent of all Social Security recipients at age 65 and 71 percent of \nall recipients by age 85. Those impacted by this legislation, the \ndisabled, divorced and elderly widows are more likely to live near the \npoverty line.\n  Clearly we would like to do more for these beneficiaries. Yet there \nis a limit in the number and scope of improvements we are able to make \nas we face broader Social Security reform issues. This small benefit \npackage passed the House on May 14, 2002, by a stunning vote of 418 to \n0. We feel that a similar vote can send these changes to the President \nand we can show that bipartisanship is a route that will work when it \ncomes to future Social Security reform.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the bill printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2533\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 113\n\n       Whereas George Washington, at his headquarters in Newburgh, \n     New York, on August 7, 1782, devised the Badge of Military \n     Merit to be given to enlisted men and noncommissioned \n     officers for meritorious action;\n       Whereas the Badge of Military Merit became popularly known \n     as the ``Purple Heart'' because it consisted of the figure of \n     a heart in purple cloth or silk edged with narrow lace or \n     binding and was affixed to the uniform coat over the left \n     breast;\n       Whereas Badges of Military Merit were awarded during the \n     Revolutionary War by General George Washington at his \n     headquarters, in Newburgh, New York, on May 3 and June 8, \n     1783;\n       Whereas the Badge of Military Merit, an award for valor in \n     the Revolutionary War, is the inspiration for today's Purple \n     Heart medal;\n       Whereas on the bicentennial of General Washington's \n     birthday in February 1932, the Badge of Military Merit was \n     redesignated by General Douglas MacArthur, then Chief of \n     Staff of the Army, as the Purple Heart, to be awarded to \n     persons killed or wounded in action against an enemy of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas more than 800,000 members of the Armed Forces have \n     been awarded the Purple Heart;\n       Whereas the Nation, as it fights the forces of evil that \n     would undermine those democratic principles upon which the \n     Nation was founded, continues to add brave members of the \n     Armed Forces to the ranks of those who have received the \n     Purple Heart;\n       Whereas the State of New York has dedicated substantial \n     resources to the creation of the National Purple Heart Hall \n     of Honor to be constructed at the New Windsor Cantonment, a \n     New York State Historic Site, in New Windsor, New York, to \n     honor those individuals who have been awarded the Purple \n     Heart and to inform and educate the people of the United \n     States about the history and importance of this distinguished \n     combat award;\n       Whereas the National Purple Heart Hall of Honor will be a \n     permanent place of remembrance of the service and sacrifices \n     made by the members of the Armed Forces wounded or killed in \n     service to America from World War I through the current war \n     against terrorism, both at home and abroad; and\n       Whereas as the Nation continues to defend the American way, \n     there will be a need for a distinguished place to honor those \n     who in the future are awarded the Purple Heart for their \n     service and sacrifice: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes and supports the efforts of the State of New \n     York to develop the National Purple Heart Hall of Honor in \n     New Windsor, New York;\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to \n     participate in the development of the National Purple Heart \n     Hall of Honor; and\n\n[[Page S4539]]\n\n       (3) encourages Federal departments and agencies to \n     cooperate, assist, and participate in the development of the \n     National Purple Heart Hall of Honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/17/senate-section/article/S4539-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3439.

DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM THROUGH TRADE ACT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States is now engaged in a war against \n     terrorism, and it is vital that the United States respond to \n     this threat through the use of all available resources.\n       (2) Open markets between the United States and friendly \n     nations remains a vital component of our Nation's national \n     security for the purposes of forming long, lasting \n     friendships, strategic partnerships, and creating new long-\n     term allies through the exportation of America's democratic \n     ideals, civil liberties, freedoms, ethics, principles, \n     tolerance, openness, ingenuity, and productiveness.\n       (3) Utilizing trade with other nations is indispensable to \n     United States foreign policy in that trade assists developing \n     nations in achieving these very objectives.\n       (4) It is in the United States national security interests \n     to increase and improve our ties, economically and otherwise, \n     with Russia, Central Asia, and the South Caucasus.\n       (5) The development of strong political, economic, and \n     security ties between Russia, Central Asia, the South \n     Caucasus, and the United States will foster stability in this \n     region.\n       (6) The development of open market economies and open \n     democratic systems in Russia, Central Asia and the South \n     Caucasus will provide positive incentives for American \n     private investment, increased trade, and other forms of \n     commercial interaction with the United States.\n       (7) Many of the nations in this region have secular Muslim \n     governments that are seeking closer alliance with the United \n     States and that have diplomatic and commercial relations with \n     Israel.\n       (8) The nations of Russia, Central Asia and the South \n     Caucasus could produce oil and gas in sufficient quantities \n     to reduce the dependence of the United States on energy from \n     the volatile Persian Gulf region.\n       (9) Normal trade relations between Russia, Central Asia, \n     the South Caucasus, and the United States will help achieve \n     these objectives.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--(1) Prior to extending normal trade \n     relations with Russia and the nations of Central Asia and the \n     South Caucasus, the President should--\n       (A) obtain the commitment of those countries to developing \n     a system of governance in accordance with the provisions of \n     the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation \n     in Europe (also known as the ``Helsinki Final Act'') \n     regarding human rights and humanitarian affairs;\n\n[[Page S4541]]\n\n       (B) ensure that those countries have endeavored to address \n     issues related to their national and religious minorities \n     and, as a member state of the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), committed to adopting special \n     measures for ensuring that persons belonging to national \n     minorities have full equality individually as well as in \n     community with other members of their group;\n       (C) ensure that those countries have also committed to \n     enacting legislation to provide protection against incitement \n     to violence against persons or groups based on national, \n     racial, ethnic, or religious discrimination, hostility, or \n     hatred, including anti-Semitism; and\n       (D) ensure that those countries have continued to return \n     communal properties confiscated from national and religious \n     minorities during the Soviet period, facilitating the \n     reemergence of these communities in the national life of each \n     of those countries and establishing the legal framework for \n     completion of this process in the future.\n       (2) Earlier this year the Governments of the United States \n     and Kazakhstan exchanged letters underscoring the importance \n     of religious freedom and human rights, and the President \n     should seek similar exchanges with all nations from the \n     region.\n       (c) Permanent Normal Trade Relations for Russia.--\n       (1) Presidential determination and extension of \n     nondiscriminatory treatment.--Notwithstanding any provision \n     of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et \n     seq.), the President, after certifying to Congress that all \n     outstanding trade disputes have been resolved with Russia, \n     may--\n       (A) determine that such title should no longer apply to \n     Russia;

Mr. President, there will be no rollcall votes on Monday. \nThe next rollcall vote will occur at approximately 11 a.m. on Tuesday \non cloture on the steel amendment to the trade act.\n  I would say all staff members and all Senators should understand that \nthe majority leader, in consultation with the Republican leader, today \nannounced we are going to do a much better job of condensing the votes. \nVotes will be 15 minutes, and we have, over months, said that we would \nextend those 5 minutes. But that extension has now gone 15 minutes, so \nour votes have now become 30-minute votes.\n  People are going to start missing votes. I know they are going to be \nupset, but people are going to miss votes. We are not going to \ncontinually waste everyone else's time. We have numerous votes to \nconduct next week, as indicated by all these amendments that have been \noffered. Even if we did not have a lot of votes, there is no need to \nhave people, when there is a vote, stand around waiting for other \npeople to complete their business. People waste lots of time.\n  One reason people are not here when they are supposed to be is they \nknow the votes do not take the amount of time they are supposed to \ntake. So I hope people cooperate. If not, they are going to have a \nvoting record not as good as they would like.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/17/senate-section/article/S4547-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MAY 20, 2002, AT 1 P.M.\n\n  Mr. REID.
