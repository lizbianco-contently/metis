Madam President, yesterday there was considerable talk on \nthe Senate floor regarding the Republican energy plan, using that term \nloosely, talking about the need for us to move forward. The majority \nleader has announced that we are going to take up an energy bill in \nFebruary. He has given a date. I guess it is difficult for some to take \nyes for an answer. We are going to go to an energy bill just as soon as \nwe get back. It is important we do that.\n  In the meantime, there is this constant harangue from the other side \nabout how important it is that we go to an energy bill right now. We \nagree that there should be an acknowledged policy in this country. It \nis very important we do that.\n  We have to understand that under their plan, an increase in oil \nimport dependence would go from 56 percent today to well over 60 \npercent by the year 2010.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, which is part of \nthe DOE, by 2010, cars, light trucks, and SUVs will use an additional \n1.8 million barrels of oil a day. Total oil use will increase by twice \nthat much to about 3.6 million barrels a day. The Republican plan does \nvirtually nothing to address oil consumption. Their mantra is supply, \nsupply, supply.\n  Nothing the United States does will have any impact on the price of \noil. That price is determined in the world market. If we don't address \nour consumption, we might drive the price higher.\n  The United States currently uses 25 percent of the world's oil \nsupply.\n  U.S. oil production has been declining since 1970. Even if ANWR were \nopened to oil development, the most optimistic scenario would only \nresult in a net increase of less than half a million barrels a day. \nThat is a lot of oil, but certainly it will not do anything to address \nthe major problems we have in this country. Those problems relate to \nconsumption.\n  This assumes that oil companies don't shift production from other \nplaces in the United States. There are 32 million acres in the Gulf of \nMexico that have been leased but not developed.\n  Most of the dollars spent on developing new oil supplies are invested \noutside the United States. Why? Because there is more oil outside the \nUnited States. We, who are so proud of our natural resources, must \nacknowledge, reluctantly but truthfully, that we don't have a lot of \noil in the United States. It is estimated that out of 100 percent of \nthe oil reserves in the world, we have 3 percent in the United States. \nMost of the dollars spent in developing new oil supplies are in places \nsuch as Russia, Africa, Brazil, the Caspian and, of course, the Middle \nEast.\n  Major oil companies, led by Exxon, just committed $30 billion to \ndevelop gas and water projects in Saudi Arabia. This is a picture of \nthe signing of that deal. Mobil has done well. We don't need to cry \nabout how Mobil is doing in the economic world. Let's talk about \nExxonMobil. I am glad they are doing well, but let's not cry about how \nthey are doing. Profits in 2000 were $12.40 billion, total upstream \nprofits. Profits from the U.S. oil and gas production is this much; you \ncan see that. Investment in U.S. production is this much. We have \nlearned how much they are doing with the Saudi Arabia program. The \npicture is of Lee Raymond of Exxon signing that deal. It was for $30 \nbillion. The United States is spending that much. Investment in non-\nU.S. production in Saudi Arabia, Angola, Qatar, and others, is $5.2 \nbillion. Madam President, we should understand where the money is \ngoing.\n  Natural gas: On the other hand, natural gas is currently being \nproduced from existing oilfields on the North Slope of Alaska, and then \nreinjected because there is no pipeline to bring the gas to the lower \n48 States.\n  Natural gas demand is projected to increase by 24 percent by 2010. We \nin the United States have a choice. We can build a pipeline to bring \nthe gas to market. We can do that. It would be expensive, but it would \nbe very productive and good for the consumer. Or we can become \ndependent on liquefied natural gas from oil and gas exporting countries \nas we are for our other oil.\n  So the question is: Arctic gas or liquefied natural gas from OPEC. \nEleven of the world's gas-exporting nations gathered in Iran in May of \nthis year for the inaugural meeting of the Gas Exporting Countries \nForum. They control two-thirds of the world's natural gas reserves.\n  According to the OPEC bulletin of June 2001, ``Not only was the Gas \nExporting Countries Forum born in the capital city of an OPEC member, \nbut the two groups also have five members in common: Algeria, \nIndonesia, Iran, Nigeria, and Qatar. They can unite and coordinate \ntheir policies in much the same way as OPEC has done in the past four \ndecades.'' That should give us pause.\n  We need a stimulus from the energy policy. Some argue that opening \nANWR to oil development would be a great economic stimulus. As we now \nknow, the job numbers thrown around have been grossly exaggerated.\n\n  CRS estimates job creation from ANWR might be between 60,000 and \n130,000. Again, this assumes jobs are not just shifted from the Gulf of \nMexico or the Rocky Mountain region.\n  Construction of an Arctic natural gas pipeline would create between \n350,000 and 400,000 jobs in steel production, pipe manufacturing, \ntrucking and shipping, and construction jobs for 3 to 4 years for \nassembling the pipeline. These projections are derived from the \nestimated construction costs and the Bureau of Labor Statistics for \npipeline construction, and this is the same approach as the CRS \nanalysis used for ANWR.\n  This pipeline would be a mammoth project, requiring 4 times as much \nsteel as used for all the cars produced globally in 1999. The steel for \nthe pipe would be enough to give each person on Earth enough stainless \nsteel to make cutlery for six elaborate table settings. The potential \nnatural gas resources could supply the American market for 50 to 60 \nyears.\n  It seems that we have an easy choice to make. We can do it ourselves \nor we can be dependent on foreign oil. In the speeches we hear from the \nother side, I hope they will recognize that we can't continue to \nconsume, consume, consume and meet our energy needs. We are going to \nhave to cut back on consumption. We can do that in a number of simple \nways. We can make cars more fuel efficient. We can save millions of \nbarrels of oil a day by making our cars more efficient. Also, we need \nto look at what we are going to do with alternative energy sources, \nsuch as sun, wind, geothermal, biomass, and also spend some money--real \ndollars--in hydrogen development. For example, Senator Harkin, for \nyears, has worked with me in trying to come up with a hydrogen program \nin the United States. It can be done, but we can't get the research \ndollars to do it. We know it is a safe product. If you had a container \nof hydrogen that started leaking, you would get water vapor. That is \nwhat you would get--not the sludge and these terrible messes that we \nget in the ocean and on land.\n  In short, we are no longer going to stand by and let the other side \nspeak about what a terrible thing is happening and that we are not \ndoing something about energy policy. We want to do something. We want \nto have a full and complete debate, recognizing that\n\n[[Page S12115]]\n\nthe answer to the problems of America is not drilling in the Arctic \npristine wilderness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I rise this morning to offer my strong \nsupport for the Railroad Retirement Survivor Improvement Act of 2001. \nIt is a piece of legislation that truly will modernize the railroad \nretirement system and help ensure that our railroad retirees are \noffered benefits that are consistent with what is made available in the \nprivate sector to other industrial workers throughout our economy.\n  Quite frankly, this is simply a fairness issue, to which I think we \nneed to attend. It is strongly supported on both sides of the aisle, \nand I think we ought to do away with the procedural hangups that are \nkeeping us from addressing this issue and moving forward.\n  Today's railroad retirement system is deeply outmoded, badly in need \nof reform. Unlike most pension plans, the current pension system for \nrailroad workers has tied the hands of those who have the fiduciary \nresponsibility to manage it. It can't invest in private market assets, \nbonds, or equities. Instead, under the current law, the railroad \nretirement system is required to invest only in Government securities. \nThat is whether it is the tier 1 benefits, which are like Social \nSecurity, or tier 2 programs, which are very consistent or the moral \nequivalent of a private pension system.\n  The result is that railroad retirees and their families are being \nplaced at a significant and, I believe, unfair disadvantage relative to \ntheir peers in the economy.\n  Throughout modern pension activities, we have a different result than \nwhat happens for rail workers because they are not able to retire with \nthe same certainty and security that other workers are, and their \nfamilies are prejudiced as well because of the lack of effectiveness in \ntheir investment programs and retire programs. We need to do something \nabout it.\n\n  This program is very simple and very straightforward. The legislation \nbefore us also represents a political compromise that enjoys broad \nsupport, as I suggested, by Republicans and Democrats, labor and \nmanagement. It has wide sponsorship throughout all interested parties. \nIt makes sense from an economic standpoint, a consistency standpoint, \nand certainly a political standpoint. After all, most people in this \nChamber--putting this into a personal perspective--are not being forced \nto invest in pension plans that are limited only to Government \nsecurities.\n  Under the Thrift Savings Plan, Government employees, like most in the \nprivate sector, can invest in the private market, stock index funds, \ndebt index funds--a whole host of options that improve the performance \nprofile of the assets involved in the pension funds.\n  These funds historically have done better, and the academic history \nand testing objective data show private pension funds need more \nopportunities than just being limited to Government securities. I do \nnot understand why we are denying to railroad workers the same \nopportunity that we have as public employees.\n  Because private debt and equities generally provide these higher \nreturns, this also would allow for significant improvement in the \nretirees' benefits: For example, a simple concept such as reducing the \nretirement age from 62 to 60 after 30 years of service. It is a pretty \nstraightforward, simple, commonsense view and is very consistent with \nwhat goes on in the private sector.\n  Also, widows and widowers would be guaranteed benefits at an amount \nno less than the amount of the annuity that the retiree received. If \none works all their life to build up an annuity that is sensible, the \nwidow or widower should receive more than 50 percent of the retiree's \nannuity. That is also pretty consistent with actions in the private \nsector.\n  This legislation will allow a retirement system to reduce its vesting \nrequirement from 10 years to 5 years, a very standard feature in all \nprivate sector pensions. We ought to take advantage of this opportunity \nto modernize the railroad retirement system and put it in a consistent \nformat with other elements in our society's retirement programs.\n  I am concerned that the reason this legislation is not moving is \nbecause there are those who believe we somehow are going to pilfer the \nmoney. The opposite is true. I believe when we do not properly manage, \nas a fiduciary, retirees' money, we are actually limiting their \nability, and the pilfering is really our fault, not theirs. We ought to \ndo something about that.\n  I am concerned about what is really happening. I believe it is \nsometimes the view of some that we are trying to limit our options in \nmanaging retirement funds. It is quite possible people are presuming \nthat if we make this kind of move with respect to railroad retirement \nactivities and pension investments, we must have an analogy that works \nfor Social Security. There is reason to believe we ought to be thinking \nabout how we manage our Social Security trust funds so that we secure \ntheir actuarial responsibility over the long run.\n  I hope we are not standing against doing something that makes sense \nfor railroad workers because we have this great desire to resist \nmodernizing our practices in how we handle our pension funds.\n  It is time for us to move forward with this legislation. It was \noverwhelmingly supported in the House. There is something approaching \n75 cosponsors in the Senate. This is 21st century investing--actually, \nit is 20th century investing practices, and we need to make sure our \nrailroad workers have that same right. I hope we will avoid all this \nhaggling about procedure and move forward to protect their retirement \nthe way we expect others in the economy to proceed.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I am proud to have been an original \ncosponsor of the bipartisan Railroad Retirement and Survivors' \nImprovement Act of 2001 when it was introduced this spring. This \nlegislation has strong bipartisan support and it deserves action before \nCongress adjourns this year.\n  In West Virginia, we have over 11,000 retirees and their families \ncurrently depending on railroad retirement, and almost 3,500 West \nVirginians working for the railroads who will need their railroad \nretirement in the future. These hardworking railroad employees have \ndone tough jobs for years, and because of the physical work and often \nharsh outdoor working conditions, they deserve a good retirement \npackage, at a earlier age than current benefits allow.\n  Nationwide, there are currently about 673,000 railroad retirees and \nfamilies, and about 245,000 active rail workers. They, too, deserve a \nbetter retirement program, and I want to work with them to promote this \nhistoric package supported by both rail labor and rail management.\n  There can be no doubt that improving retirement benefits for railroad \nworkers, retirees, and their families must be one of our top \npriorities. Right now, it takes 10 years of service before a railroad \nworker becomes vested in the retirement plan, while private companies \ncovered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, vest \ntheir employees in just 5 to 7 years.\n  The need to dramatically improve benefits for railroad widows and \nwidowers is also obvious and has gone unaddressed for far too long. It \nis cruel to slash the benefits of the widow of a railroad retiree at \nthe death of her spouse, as the current policy does. Railroad widows \nhave called my offices and pleaded with me at West Virginia town \nmeetings to understand how essential this legislation is for them.\n  A railroad widow living in Hinton, WV, recently told me that her \ncurrent railroad pension benefit is too small for her to pay the \npremium for railroad health insurance. This widow's husband died when \nhe was just 56, and she was only 46. She has been struggling to \nmaintain her home and pay her bills, and can just barely do that, but \nshe cannot afford to buy health insurance. She deserves a better deal. \nRailroad widows in my state and across our country living on fixed \nincomes face a tough challenge to maintain their homes and their \ndignity. Increasing pension benefits for railroad widows should be a \npriority before this Congress adjourns.\n  Today, experts predict that the Railroad Trust Funds are solvent for \nthe next 25 years, and existing policy offers\n\n[[Page S12116]]\n\nguaranteed benefits to railroad retirees and their families. Under the \nnew plan, the railroads would pay less taxes into the Railroad \nRetirement Trust Funds, but the fund would create an investment board \nto invest its reserves in private equities, so the increased rate of \nreturns would cover the expanded benefits. Under the plan, there is a \nprovision to increase railroad taxes in the future when necessary to \nfully fund the railroad retirement benefits.\n  As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I have been pushing hard \nto enact this legislation to improve benefits for railroad retirees and \ntheir families. I will be working with Finance Chairman Baucus and \nSenate Majority Leader Daschle to achieve our goal of improving \nrailroad retirement. Our railroad workers, our retirees, and their \nwidows have been waiting too long for a better retirement package. It \nwould be wrong for Congress to leave without acting on this vital \nprogram.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat the time be charged equally.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    The Energy Bill Must Be Debated\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I have heard several comments this \nmorning with regard to energy, yet I am still in a fog about why we are \neven discussing this legislation.\n  Americans should know that September 11 not only changed the entire \nNation but it also changed the mindset in Washington, DC. I can \nremember that morning because we were in a press conference talking \nabout enhanced 9-1-1, legislation that was passed and signed by \nPresident Clinton. Basically what it did was it allowed the technology \nto move forward in our wireless communications that when someone used \ntheir cell phone and they hit 9-1-1, they got the nearest first \nresponder or emergency responder.\n  In a State such as Montana where we have large rural areas, this is \nvery important. I held a safety conference in Helena during the August \nbreak. We had around 200 people attending, saying we need to locate \npeople whenever an emergency comes in on a cell phone because we have \ngreat distances to cover.\n  With the technology of triangulation of the towers and enhanced GPS, \nwe can now locate the 9-1-1, or the emergency caller, just as we can \nwhen we pick up a phone in our own home where it is wired.\n  We were taking a look at the deployment of that technology in a news \nconference on that morning of September 11 when the terrorists decided \nto take their bite out of the United States of America. It was a \nshocking thing when we saw the second airplane go into the second tower \nand then the one that hit the Pentagon in Washington, DC. It changed \nour perspective on everything.\n\n  I bring that up because we are in a war, and the only defense against \nterrorists who will forfeit their lives to carry out a mission, the \nonly way to prevent those people from doing great harm to our country, \nis to keep them on the run where they do not have a lot of time to plan \nto do bad things to us.\n  I congratulate the President this morning because we are taking out \nthe al-Qaida and the terrorists who perpetrated this act of war on our \ncountry.\n  We are also in a recession. We have an agricultural sector that is \nhurting, and we are talking about something that affects none of the \nthings that are affecting our country today. Nothing in this \nlegislation, with the time we think we have left of this year, the \nfirst half of the 107th Congress, will stimulate the economy. It has \nnothing to do with the economy.\n  I am a cosponsor on the bill. We have farmers who are walking into \ntheir banks to renew their operating loans, and what are the bankers \ntelling them? We have to have some concrete evidence this Government is \ngoing to be in your corner next year. We have been every year, but now \nthey want to tie it down a little tighter. Yes, that is a stimulus. \nAgriculture is about 20 percent of the GDP in this country. It is very \nimportant, and it all starts at the production level. We do not hear \nanybody talking about that.\n  Yesterday morning I brought up the fact that energy is a part of \nthis, and we hear speeches even this morning on energy, but we only \nhear speeches. Put a bill on the floor. Allow a bill to come to the \nSenate. We will debate conservation. We will debate the economy. We \nwill debate production. The President had a task force put together \nheaded by Vice President Cheney, and a lot of the actions he wants \ntaken are not allowed to be debated. Make no doubt about it. We are at \nwar, and then we hear speeches. We have an energy crisis, but we hear \nspeeches. The economy continues to slip; we continue to hear speeches. \nPut the bill before the Senate. That is all I say.\n  The Railroad Retirement Act probably has as many cosponsors as have \never cosponsored a bill in this body. Some folks would say fairness. \nFairness to whom? Fairness with the rest of the country? It does \nnothing that would heal some of the ills that are afflicting our \ncountry right now.\n  What I am saying is let us get our work done. If we want to talk \nabout energy, put an energy bill before the Senate. That is all we ask. \nThen we will let the chips fall where they may. That is what we should \nbe doing this morning if we move forward on anything.\n  Let us do something substantive. Let us complete the appropriations. \nI serve on the Appropriations Committee. The assistant minority leader \nserves on that committee. We have worked together on a lot of issues, \nand I think he will agree that it is not going to take a lot of work or \na lot of time to finish. As soon as we get the Defense appropriations \nand complete a stimulus bill, then let us go home and let us recharge \nthe batteries. Let us talk to the people back home. Let us find out \nwhat their agenda is, what they want to see this Government and this \nCongress do as we complete the year 2001.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3090\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the junior Senator from Montana, my good \nfriend, and I have worked together on a number of issues. We were the \ntwo who handled military construction appropriations for many years. He \nis a pleasure to work with. I enjoyed working with him this year on the \nInterior appropriations bill. In answer to my friend, the reason we are \ntalking about energy this morning, it has been talked about so much \nfrom the other side, I must reply.\n  Regarding the railroad retirement bill, it is important legislation. \nFor the widows, it is an important piece of legislation. I acknowledge \nwe should move these appropriations conference reports as quickly as we \ncan. Transportation was resolved yesterday. That is big news. We hope \nto complete that this week as soon as the House does.\n  Yesterday it was noted that if we moved to the House bill, which will \nbe the vehicle for the railroad retirement legislation, the stimulus \nbill would be displaced. We agreed that the stimulus bill should not be \ndisplaced. We did not raise a point of order to knock it off the \ncalendar. We could have raised a point of order against a Republican \nvehicle and then the stimulus bill would be gone forever from this \nsession of the legislature. We chose not to do that. We agreed the \nstimulus bill should not be displaced. That is the reason we asked to \ncall the railroad bill up by unanimous consent, but that was objected \nto by a Republican colleague.\n  To ensure again that the stimulus bill is not displaced by the \nrailroad retirement bill, I ask unanimous consent the stimulus bill, \nH.R. 3090, recur as the pending business immediately upon the \ndisposition of the railroad retirement bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. On behalf of the Republican leadership, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The objection is heard.\n\n\n                         Senate Work Priorities\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, let me speak for a few moments on the \nissue of railroad retirement, the stimulus package, and the business \nbefore the Senate. Our assistant Republican leader is on the floor and \nwants to speak to the motion to proceed, so I will be brief.\n\n[[Page S12117]]\n\n  I rise in support of railroad retirement and have been a cosponsor of \nthat legislation for the last several years. There is adequate time to \ndeal with this issue. We can deal with it now following the stimulus \npackage or certainly we can deal with it next year. The Democratic \nleadership has chosen to bring it up and force the issue at this time. \nIt is an important piece of legislation. There are 75 cosponsors in the \nSenate. The Senate Finance Committee has worked some on it. The House \nhas worked on it and passed it.\n  Is it a perfect piece of legislation? No. It goes a long way to fix a \nflawed system, a system at this time that is in deep trouble, a 65-\nyear-old system that has been treated poorly in the past in many \nrespects and will not serve the retirees or the railroad system \neffectively well in the future.\n  As a result of an effort on the part of management and labor to bring \nthis issue together, they have worked hard to do so. There are many on \nmy side who disagree and some on the other side who disagree. This \nissue does not find unanimous support in the Senate. I would hope \nissues of such critical nature could find unanimous support, but that \nwill not happen.\n  It is important this issue be addressed. I hope the Senate can work \nits will. I will support efforts to bring it to the floor. At the same \ntime, I hope the Democrat leadership understands a recession has been \ndeclared in this country by the institutions that measure our economics \nand measure the output of our economy. If we are in recession--and we \nare--we ought to deal with a stimulus package that will bring \ninvestment and job creation back to the marketplace.\n  We ought to be understanding that we are at war. We ought to move \nexpeditiously, as the House now is, to deal with the DOD package to \nmake sure our men and women in harm's way are adequately funded, and \nthat all of the issues of post-September 11 are dealt with in the \nappropriate fashion. That doesn't mean we have to stay here for the \nnext 3 weeks to get that done.\n  We do our timely work now; we come back in late January and do the \nbalance. This is an issue that could have been dealt with in late \nJanuary, as can agriculture, as energy, I hope, will be with a date \ndefinite and a vote up or down to pass. If energy is not dealt with in \nthat fashion, and if the majority leader does not choose to give us a \nclear signal as to how energy will be voted on, energy will be an \namendment to any amendable bill that comes before the Senate following \nthe current effort.\n  This bill will be amendable. Maybe energy fits well into a railroad \nretirement package. It is every bit as critical to a broader base of \nthe American economy as this bill is very critical to a lot of people \nin my State and across the Nation.\n  To reiterate, I support the railroad retirement legislation. I am one \nof the 75 cosponsors in the Senate. In the last Congress, when I was \nbriefly a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I had an opportunity \nto participate in the hearings on the bill and vote in favor of passing \nit and sending it to the Senate floor for consideration. While I am a \nsupporter of this bill, I can understand why some of my colleagues have \ngenuine problems with it. Does this bill take a flawed system and make \nit perfect? No. However, does this bill take a flawed system and \ndramatically improve it? Yes.\n  I am here today to urge my colleagues: Do not let the perfect be the \nenemy of the very, very good. It is no small feat that rail labor and \nrail management came together, reasoned together in good faith, and \ndevoted a great deal of energy, expertise, and old-fashioned innovation \nto improving a 65-year-old system in a bright and forward-thinking way. \nThey have fashioned a remarkably good bill. It removes a 65-year-old \nrequirement that assets of the system be invested solely in Federal \ninstruments. It permits the kind of investments that any other industry \npension plan might make. As a result, over time the system will bring \nin more revenue, and that will permit better benefits for retirees and \nsurviving spouses, while reducing the contributions needed from rail \nemployers.\n  It is important to remember that this bill also provides for the \npossibility that the returns on investments might be less than history \nsuggests they will be. If that should occur, it would trigger an \nautomatic adjustment mechanism requiring more contributions from the \nindustry. This protects the federal government and the nation's \ntaxpayers. On the other hand, if returns are greater than projected, \nboth labor and management will be able to reduce contributions further. \nThe new Investment Trust created by the bill will not include any \ngovernment employees and will not be appointed by any. Trustees will be \nsubject to ERISA fiduciary standards. They will be able to hire \nprofessional pension investment advisors. Congress will annually \nreceive a report on the results of the investment efforts.\n  Let me also address the so-called ``cost'' of this bill. I agree with \nthe House of Representatives that changing the investment mix is not an \noutlay, but just a new means of financing the government's obligations \nunder the system. Those who take balanced federal budgets seriously \nshould have no reason to back away from this legislation.\n  Mr. President, the thousands of working men and women, retirees, and \nsurviving spouses who will benefit from this legislation have waited \npatiently while this bill has been reviewed again and again. They have \nwaited long enough. This bill is an enormous step in the right \ndirection, and one the entire Senate should support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I rise in opposition on a motion to \nproceed. I have great respect for my friend and colleague from Nevada, \nbut I happen to disagree that moving to railroad retirement is what we \nshould be doing. Railroad retirement is an issue that some people say \nhas been considered by Congress. It hasn't been considered. We didn't \nhave a hearing in the House; we didn't have a hearing in the Senate. We \nhave a bill written by special interest groups, by railroad companies \nand unions. They negotiated a deal and said, great, now have the \nAmerican taxpayer pay for it.\n  If there is ever special interest legislation, this is it. We are \ngoing to say we want to set aside the stimulus package so we can take \nthis bill up. I have told my friends and colleagues if we take it up, \nwe will have to have a lot of amendments and a lot of debate.\n  I read where tier 1 is the same thing as Social Security. But it is \nnot. It is not the same thing. There are differences. People who \nreceive Social Security do not get to retire at age 60 with 100-percent \nbenefits. And this is what this legislation does for railroad retirees.\n  Under private pension benefit plans, survivors of deceased usually \nreceive 50 percent; the survivors under this bill receive 100 percent. \nWe are going to do that? We are going to put that in the statute and \nsay the Federal Government will pay for it?\n  People say they want to be treated like the private sector. Private \nsector gets to invest in the stock market. Great. Make this a private \nsector plan. We can do that. We are going to give them $15 billion, \nthat is a heck of a cash infusion to a pension system. We have never \ndone that in the history of America where we have taken $15 billion, \ngiven it to one industry for their retirement system. It benefits \nprimarily a few companies and a whole lot of employees and retirees. \nThey have worked it out in a mutually beneficial manner. They both \nbenefit, almost exactly the same amount. They negotiated a deal to save \n$4 billion in 10 years and the employees get $4 billion in new \nbenefits. And the Federal Government will gives them $15 or $16 billion \nin the process.\n  I question the wisdom of doing that. We have not had a hearing and \nhave not been able to ask people: Why are we doing this? How does it \nwork? Where does the money come from?\n  If we move to this bill, as I expect may well happen but, will have \nto have some amendments. We will have to consider should tier 1 really \nbe equivalent to Social Security. If they are going to be in the Social \nSecurity system and pay Social Security taxes, they pay identical tier \n1 taxes to Social Security, shouldn't we give them identical Social \nSecurity benefits? Or do we give them benefits far in excess of what \nSocial Security provides? We are going to have to consider that.\n\n[[Page S12118]]\n\n  What about this survivor benefit? They say this is great, we have a \nsurvivor benefit, and it is a big increase. Everyone likes it. If we \nare going to increase the survivor benefit for railroads, should we do \nit also for Social Security? Or conversely, should survivor benefits, \nat least for Social Security, be the same for all Social Security \nbeneficiaries? There is a big difference. We have to look at that and \nwe have to look at the cash infusion. The argument is made that this is \njust moving $16 billion of Government IOUs over into the private sector \nfor real investment.\n  I asked the Treasury Secretary, how are you going to do it? He said: \nI am going to go out and borrow $16 billion. We are in a deficit \nsituation. It is all going to be added to debt, so we are going to add \n$16 billion to our national publicly held debt that you and I and all \ntaxpayers will be paying interest on every year. That means if we are \npaying something like 6 percent interest on $15 billion, we are going \nto be paying $1 billion per year in interest maybe forever for this \ncash infusion to go to this retirement fund which will greatly increase \nbenefits and also reduce the contributions to that retirement fund.\n  I used to be a fiduciary and trustee of a retirement fund. You can't \ndo that. You would have the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation \nsaying: You are not making your minimum allocation requirements to make \nthese funds adequately financed. You are doing just the opposite. You \nhave a grossly underfunded actuarial benefit that is required, and you \nare not making those payments.\n  We are doing just the opposite. We have an unfunded plan that has \nfinancial problems in the future, and what we are doing is cutting \ntaxes and increasing benefits. Oh, yes, we are going to transfer a \nwhole bunch of money so it will last a little while, but it doesn't \nlast even that long. As a matter of fact, it is kind of startling to \nfind out the amount of money available. This fund starts evaporating \npretty quickly. It is projected in 20 years the taxes are going to have \nto be raised as much as 70 percent--in 20 years, because of the \nshortfall.\n  My biggest problem is the way we have directed scorekeeping in here \nto say we are not going to count that $15 billion. Hocus pocus--write a \ncheck, and it doesn't count. That really bothers me.\n  There is language in the House-passed bill on page 25 that says:\n  Means of financing. For purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974 and the Balanced Budget Act and Emergency Deficit Control Act of \n1985--and on and on--notwithstanding the purchase or sale of non-\nFederal assets--shall be treated as a means of financing--i.e., it \ndoesn't count; they are kind of clever legal words that say it doesn't \ncount.\n  It will be interesting to see how Democrats and Republicans vote on \nthis bill because we have a little section in here that says ``the \nbudget doesn't count.''\n  I ask you, if you can do this for the railroad retirement system, why \ncan't you do it for Social Security? Why don't we write a check for $1 \ntrillion or $1.8 trillion, or whatever the Social Security trust fund \nbalance is that is Government-held debt, Government IOUs to itself? Why \ndon't we just write a check for that entire amount and say now we have \nreal securities?\n  If you do it, you are going to have outlays and we are going to have \nto borrow money. This $16 billion we are going to have to borrow. We \nare going to increase the national debt to do this.\n  I wonder if people really thought about that and what that really \nmeans. Can we do this for Social Security? Is this real? Are we moving \naway from Government T-bills into Government stocks? No, we are not. We \nare moving away from Government IOUs, which are on paper, into real \ndebt that we will have to write checks for and pay interest on every \nyear--real debt, publicly held debt that could be held in the United \nStates or overseas, on which we will be writing checks. We will have to \npay interest on it to the tune of $1 billion a year.\n  We will put it in the railroad retirement fund and at the same time \nsay: Railroad companies, you don't have to pay as much. We are going to \nreduce your taxes. Even though you signed contracts that are very \ngenerous in retirement benefits, we are going to reduce your \ncontribution. Incidentally, retirees, because you were willing to go \nalong with this, we are going to increase your benefits. We are going \nto give you benefits nobody else has in the private sector. We are \ngoing to give you benefits that are greater than Social Security.\n  You are tier 1, which is supposed to be equivalent to Social \nSecurity. In Social Security, the retirement age is going to 67. For \ntier 1 benefits, the retirement age is going to 60. For Social Security \nbeneficiaries, for everybody--every Senator, every civil servant, \nemployee who is on Social Security today--when they receive benefits, \nevery person in the private sector on Social Security today, if they \nretire at 62, they receive 80 percent of their normal retirement \nbenefit--80 percent.\n  Not railroad retirement; it is 100 percent under age 62, and under \nthis bill it will be 100 percent at age 60. And they pay the same \ntaxes. That is 12.8 percent, 6.4 percent by the employer, 6.4 percent \nby the employee for tier 1 taxes and Social Security taxes. These are \nthe same taxes everybody else pays in America, but they get a lot \nbetter benefit under this bill we are considering.\n  The House almost passed this bill unanimously. Did they really know \nwhat they were doing? Did they realize the cost implications of this \nlegislation? Does that really make sense, and can we afford it? Is this \ntrust fund in such good shape we can give the most generous benefits in \nAmerica? Does it make financial sense to do that? I don't think so.\n  I think people are going to be embarrassed when sometime, at some \npoint, if and when this bill ever becomes law--and it has not become \nlaw yet because it still has to go through the amendment process, and I \nhope we can improve it, I hope we can strike out language that says \nthis $16 billion check we are going to write doesn't count.\n  I am on the Budget Committee. I have been on the Budget Committee for \n21 years. I am horrified by this language. I am embarrassed the House \npassed it, and I am embarrassed we would even consider it in the \nSenate. So we are going to have amendments to strike it, and we will \nfind out whether or not people think when you write a check it doesn't \ncount. If we say it doesn't count, let's just tear up the Budget Act \ntotally.\n  Speaking about budgets, a lot of people are talking about \nemergencies. I met with the President last night, and I said we have \nbeen trying to respond to emergency situations in a bipartisan fashion, \nbut I am looking at spending that is growing rather dramatically. The \nPresident proposed a budget that grew at 6.1 percent. We had an \nagreement at $686 billion. We signed a letter. Members of Congress \nactually asked the President to sign the letter that said: Here is our \ndeal. October 2, our budget deal, $686 billion discretionary spending, \na growth rate of 7.1 percent. We added a few billion more for \neducation. All signed on, this is the deal.\n  Then we agreed, let's add $40 billion as a result of the September 11 \nattack. So that moved the $686 up to $726 billion. The growth of \nspending now is 13.3 percent. That doesn't include $16 billion coming \nin for railroad retirement. That doesn't include $16 billion or $15 \nbillion or $7.5 billion for additional homeland security. That doesn't \ncount the additional billions of dollars--we don't know how much it is \ngoing to cost--in the victims' compensation fund that is already the \nlaw of the land. That doesn't count the $15 billion we have for airline \nsecurity and loan guarantees.\n\n  If we add all that together, we are on a spending spree in Congress. \nIt looks to me as if people are trying to ram through all the spending \nthey can this year because they know that next year we are in red ink. \nNext year we are going to have deficits.\n  There was a front page story in the Washington Post today alluding to \nthe situation that we may have deficits for several years, so let's run \nthis through now and put in little language in the bill that says it \ndoesn't count.\n  So I hope to have several amendments to this legislation if we are \nforced to consider it. Although, I think it is more important that we \nstay on\n\n[[Page S12119]]\n\nthe stimulus package and visit this legislation at another time. I hope \nwe finish the Nation's business. I hope we get our appropriations bills \ndone, pass the stimulus package trying to help this economy which is in \na recession, and go home. But if we are going to say let's come out and \nspend this kind of money, we are going to have to rework this program \nand improve it.\n  Let's allow the unions and railroad companies to come up with \nwhatever benefits they want. I don't care if they have retirement at \nage 40, as long as they pay for it and don't ask us to pay for it. If \nit is their retirement system and they are responsible for it, great. \nIf they are asking taxpayers to pay for it, wait a minute, we should be \na little more cautious. If they are going to have survivor benefits \ngreater than almost every survivor benefit in America, that is fine, as \nlong as they pay for it. But don't ask us to guarantee it.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote no on the motion to move off the \nstimulus package and move on the railroad retirement bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. While the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma is on the \nfloor, I ask unanimous consent the time for debate prior to the cloture \nvote on the motion to proceed to H.R. 10 be extended until 10:30, with \nthe time equally divided and controlled as under the previous order, \nand that the remaining provisions of the previous order governing the \ncloture vote remain in effect.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object, I suggest the absence of \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of all \nparents and grandparents, teachers, clergy, mentors, law enforcement, \ntreatment and prevention coalitions, and all the others who work every \nday to prevent illegal drug use from destroying the lives of our young \npeople. Our country needs John Walters, the President's nominee for \ndrug czar, to be confirmed. It is shameful that here we are in \nNovember, and Mr. Walters remains the President's only Cabinet member \nwho has not been confirmed.\n  To say that the confirmation of Mr. Walters has been obstructed is by \nno means an exaggeration. It has been 203 days since the President \nannounced his choice of John Walters to be the next Director of the \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy. It has been 177 days since the \nSenate received his nomination. It has been 50 days since Mr. Walters' \nhearing before the Judiciary Committee. And it has been 21 days since \nhis nomination was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by a wide \nmargin and sent to the Senate floor. How many more days, weeks, and \nmonths can we expect this nomination to linger before a vote is finally \nscheduled? In my view, we have already waited much too long.\n  John Walters' confirmation will also add another much-needed weapon \nto our arsenal in the war against terrorism. Since the September 11 \nattacks, there has been much discussion about the nexus between drug \ntrafficking and terrorism. We know that proceeds from the manufacturing \nand trafficking of opium poppy helped sustain the Taliban's control of \nAfghanistan. We also know that terrorist organizations routinely \nlaunder the proceeds from drug trafficking and use the funds to support \nand expand their operations internationally, including purchasing and \ntrafficking illegal weapons. I am sure in the coming months and years, \nwe will continue to learn about the clandestine connection between \ndrugs and terrorists.\n  The situation in Afghanistan also bodes ill for the world's supply of \nheroin. In 2000, over 70 percent of the world's heroin was produced in \nAfghanistan. Stockpiles of Afghan heroin were reportedly dumped on the \nmarket after the September 11 attacks. While officials in America and \nEurope are bracing for the onslaught of cheap heroin that will soon be \nhitting the markets in all neighborhoods across America and Europe, we \nhave no drug czar. The\n\n[[Page S12120]]\n\nhead of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the DEA, Asa Hutchinson, \nrecently referred to the situation in Afghanistan as a ``rare \nopportunity'' for U.S. antidrug efforts to act on the successes of the \nmilitary campaign and influence the future direction of heroin \nproduction in Afghanistan. While I have great confidence in the work \nAsa Hutchinson and the DEA are doing, the administration needs its lead \ndrug control policy official in place to help formulate a comprehensive \npolicy designed to reduce significantly heroin production in \nAfghanistan.\n\n  Mr. Walters will have to work closely with law enforcement and \nintelligence authorities to ensure that the international component of \nthe Nation's drug control policy is designed not only to prevent drugs \nfrom being trafficked into America but also to prevent the \nmanufacturing and sale of drugs for the purpose of funding terrorist \nactivities. Mr. Walters is eminently qualified to carry out this task, \nand I am confident that he will be a first-rate Director. He is the \nright person for this job.\n  John Walters' career in public service has prepared him well for this \noffice. He has worked tirelessly over the last 2 decades helping to \nformulate and improve comprehensive policies designed to keep drugs \naway from our children. By virtue of this experience, he truly has \nunparalleled knowledge and experience in all facets of drug control \npolicy. Lest there be any doubt that Mr. Walters' past efforts were \nsuccessful, let me point out that during his tenure at the Department \nof Education and ONDCP, drug use in America fell to its lowest level at \nany time in the past 25 years, and drug use by teens plunged over 50 \npercent. Mr. Walters has remained a vocal advocate for curbing illegal \ndrug use. Tragically, as illegal drug use edged upward under the \nprevious administration, his voice went unheeded.\n  John Walters enjoys widespread support from distinguished members of \nthe law enforcement community, including the Fraternal Order of Police \nand the National Troopers Coalition. His nomination is also supported \nby some of the most prominent members of the prevention and treatment \ncommunities, including the National Association of Drug Court \nProfessionals, the American Methadone Treatment Association, the \nPartnership for Drug Free America, National Families in Action, and the \nCommunity Anti-Drug Coalitions of America. All of these organizations \nagree that if we are to win the war on drugs in America, we need a \ncomprehensive policy aimed at reducing both the demand for and supply \nof drugs. Mr. Walters' accomplished record demonstrates that he, too, \nhas always believed in such a comprehensive approach. As he stated \nbefore Congress in 1993, an effective antidrug strategy must \n``integrate efforts to reduce the supply of as well as the demand for \nillegal drugs.''\n\n  Despite this groundswell of support, ever since Mr. Walters was first \nmentioned almost 7 months ago to be the next drug czar, several \ninterested individuals and groups have attacked his nomination with a \nbarrage of unfounded criticisms. Because of these untruths, I believe \nhis confirmation has been delayed, and I feel compelled to respond to \nsome of these gross distortions of John Walters' record.\n  The most common criticism I have heard is that John Walters is \nhostile to drug treatment. This is categorically false. He has a long, \ndocumented history of supporting drug treatment as an integral \ncomponent of a balanced national drug control policy. You do not have \nto take my word on this. You need only look at the numbers. Keep in \nmind, just today, just an hour ago, we passed the Hatch-Leahy ``Drug \nAbuse Education, Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2001'' out of the \nJudiciary Committee. The bulk of the money in that bill will go for \ndrug treatment, education, and prevention programs. And we have done so \nwith the advice and counsel of Mr. Walters. So that is a false \naccusation. But look at the numbers.\n\n  During Mr. Walters' tenure at ONDCP, treatment funding increased 74 \npercent. Compare that with the increase over 8 years for the Clinton \nadministration of a mere 17 percent. This commitment to expanding \ntreatment explains why John Walters has such broad support from the \ntreatment community. It is simply inconceivable to believe that all of \nthe prominent groups that are supporting Mr. Walters would do so if \nthey believed he was hostile to treatment programs.\n  Another recurring criticism is that Mr. Walters doesn't support a \nbalanced drug control policy that incorporates both supply and demand \nreduction programs. This criticism, too, is flat wrong and again belied \nby his record. For example, in testimony given before this committee in \n1991, Mr. Walters, then acting Director of ONDCP, laid out a national \ndrug control strategy that included the following guiding principles: \neducating our citizens about the dangers of drug use, placing more \naddicts in effective treatment programs, expanding the number and \nquality of treatment programs, reducing the supply and availability of \ndrugs on our streets, and dismantling trafficking organizations through \ntough law enforcement and interdiction measures.\n  Mr. Walters' support of prevention programs is equally evident. His \ncommitment to prevention became clear during his tenure at the \nDepartment of Education during the Reagan administration. He drafted \nthe Department's first drug prevention guide for parents and teachers \nentitled, ``Schools Without Drugs'' and created the Department's first \nprevention advertising campaign, and implemented the Drug-Free Schools \ngrant program.\n  These are not the words or actions of an ideologue who is hostile to \nprevention and treatment but, rather, represent the firmly held beliefs \nof a man of conviction who has fought hard to include effective \nprevention and treatment programs in the fight against drug abuse.\n  Some have also charged that Mr. Walters doesn't believe the oft-\nrepeated liberal shibboleth too many low-level, ``non-violent'' drug \noffenders are being arrested, prosecuted, and jailed. I, too, plead \nguilty, and we have the facts on our side. Data from the Bureau of \nJustice Statistics, BJS, reveals that 67.4 percent of Federal \ndefendants convicted of simple possession had prior arrest records, and \n54 percent had prior convictions. Moreover, prison sentences handed \ndown for possession offenses amount to just 1 percent of Federal prison \nsentences. It is flatly untrue that a significant proportion of our \nFederal prison population consists of individuals who have done nothing \nother than possess illegal drugs for their personal consumption.\n  The simple fact is that the drug legalization camp exaggerates the \nrate at which defendants are jailed solely for simple possession. Mr. \nWalters, to his credit, has had the courage to publicly refute these \nmisleading statistics. And to these critics I want to make one other \npoint perfectly clear. Those who sell drugs, whatever type and whatever \nquantity, are not, to this father and grandfather, nonviolent \noffenders, not when each pill, each joint, each line, and each needle \ncan--and often does--destroy a young person's life. Mr. Walters' \ncritics have shamefully distorted his statements to claim that he \nfavors jailing first-time, nonviolent offenders.\n  I am committed 100 percent to expanding and improving drug abuse \neducation, prevention, and treatment programs, and I know that John \nWalters is my ally in this effort. Earlier this year I introduced S. \n304, the Drug Abuse Education, Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2001, a \nbipartisan bill that I drafted with my good friend, Senator Leahy, \nSenators Biden, DeWine, Thurmond, Feinstein, and Grassley. This \nlegislation will dramatically increase prevention and treatment \nefforts. In drafting the bill, I repeatedly solicited Mr. Walters' \nexpert advice. I know, and his record clearly reflects, that he agrees \nwith me and my colleagues that prevention and treatment must remain \nintegral components of our national drug control policy.\n  We just passed that bill out of the Judiciary Committee this morning. \nI hope it will be called up immediately and passed out of the Senate \nbecause it will make such a difference in the lives of our young people \naround this country. If I recall correctly, Joe Califano, the former \nhead of HEW, Health, Education, and Welfare--now Health and Human \nServices--called this bill truly revolutionary and one that he could \nsupport wholeheartedly. He is not alone.\n\n  We need to shore up our support for demand reduction programs if we \nare\n\n[[Page S12121]]\n\nto reduce illegal drug use in America. This belief is bipartisan. Our \nPresident believes it. Our Attorney General believes it. Our Democratic \nleader in the Senate believes it. My Republican colleagues believe it. \nAnd most importantly, John Walters believes it.\n  Since being nominated in May, Mr. Walters has made himself available \nto all Senators on the Judiciary Committee. He has throughly answered \nall questions posed to him by the Judiciary Committee, as well as \nquestions from Senators not on the Committee. I commend the President \nfor his selection and nomination of John Walters, and I call upon the \nDemocratic leader to end the delay, remove all holds, and schedule a \nvote on Mr. Walters' nomination as early as possible, this week, if he \ncould. At a time when we are at war, it is simply not prudent or proper \nto play politics with this nomination. I urge my colleagues to reject \nthe efforts of those who have wrongfully sought to taint John Walters \nand to support an immediate vote on his nomination.\n  Finally, I urge Chairman Leahy not to let this session end without \nholding hearings for the deputy positions at ONDCP. Mr. Walters needs \nhis team in place. I look forward to working with my Senate Republican \nand Democratic colleagues and the administration to carry forward our \nfight against drug trafficking and terrorism.\n  Let me make one or two final remarks. I was pleased to see the \nJudiciary Committee pass out the nine additional district judges, one a \ncircuit court judge nominee and eight district court nominees, and, in \naddition, to pass out two other top officials in the Bush \nadministration and, of course, a number of U.S. Attorneys. I commend \nour chairman for doing that. I commend him for moving forward on these \njudges.\n  We have come a long way from when the criticisms reached their \nheight. We still have a long way to go because there are still 101 \nvacancies in the Federal judiciary as I stand here today. Frankly, that \nis probably 101 too many. Be that as it may, we all know that we have \nto do something about them.\n  As we prepare to recess, there is one startling fact that needs more \nattention. On May 9, President Bush nominated 11 outstanding attorneys \nto serve as Federal appellate court judges. To this date, nearly three \nquarters of those nominees are still pending in the Judiciary Committee \nwithout a hearing. Although all of these nominees received qualified or \nwell-qualified ratings from the American Bar Association, only 3 of \nthose first 11 nominees have had a hearing. At present, there are 30 \nvacancies in the Federal courts of appeals. Some courts, such as the DC \ncircuit, are functioning under a dramatically reduced capacity.\n  President Bush has responded to the vacancy crisis in the appellate \ncourts by nominating a total of 28 top-notch men and women to these \nposts, a number of circuit court nominees that is unprecedented in the \nfirst years of recent administrations. Yet the Judiciary Committee has \nmanaged to move just five appeals court judges from the committee to \nthe Senate floor for a vote. Last year at this time we had 67 vacancies \nin the Federal judiciary. Since Senator Leahy has become chairman, the \nvacancy rate has never been below 100. I am concerned that this number \nwill only continue to grow after Congress recesses next month.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side to use the remaining weeks of \nthis session to hold hearings and votes on judicial nominees to combat \nthe alarming vacancy rate.\n  Having said that, I am pleased that the chairman did allow nine \njudges to pass out today. I hope he will continue to work in a \nbipartisan fashion with me to pass more out. I am proud to work with \nSenator Leahy. I certainly want to cooperate with him in every way I \npossibly can. I believe the other Republicans on the committee do as \nwell.\n  There is a lot of criticism that goes back and forth on judges. I \nhave to say, it is difficult to be chairman of this committee. I \nsympathize with Senator Leahy on some of the difficulties he has had. I \nknow there are people on his side who would just as soon not have any \nBush judges go on through, as there were occasionally on our side. It \nis very difficult to meet some of the objections and to overcome them \nand to resolve some of the political problems that arise. We have to do \nit. We have to stand up and work with both sides to get the Federal \ncourts as full as we possibly can so that justice can proceed, \nespecially in the case of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia, the District Court of the District of Columbia as well, so \nthat we can handle all of the terrorist issues that will come before \nthat particular court.\n  Having said all of that, I hope we can move ahead with John Walters; \nif there are any holds, that they will be removed; and if they won't \nremove them, I hope the majority leader will ignore the holds, bring \nthis up for a battle on the floor, and then have a vote up or down and \nlet the chips fall where they may.\n  I believe Mr. Walters will be confirmed. I believe he must be \nconfirmed. If we don't get him confirmed, I believe the rate of youth \ndrug use will continue to rise. Frankly, we have had enough of that. We \nhave to get a very tough policy going again on drugs, and that should \ninclude both the supply and demand sides.\n  I will make sure that this new administration, under John Walters, \nwill take care of the demand side as well as the supply side. If we \npass S. 304 through the Senate on which Senator Leahy and I have worked \nso hard, I believe it will go to the House. I believe they will pass \nit, and it will go a long way toward resolving some of the really \nserious drug problems we have among our young people.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his \nleadership. He works so hard on the floor on a regular basis to make \nsure things run smoothly and we get about the business of deliberating \nimportant issues. At this time, there is no more important an issue \nthan the economic stimulus package. As we move around the Nation, \nclearly people have lost jobs\n\n[[Page S12122]]\n\nand businesses are hurting. We need to spark this economy, to move it \nforward.\n  There was good news yesterday on Capitol Hill. The leaders--Democrats \nand Republicans--came together to start a process to lead to a stimulus \npackage, a recovery package that will truly help all Americans. I have \ntaken a look at many of the proposals here, and I certainly support the \nDemocrats' position that we need to help families who have lost their \njobs. If you are unemployed in America today and you are lucky enough \nto have unemployment insurance, you get about $230 a week on which to \nlive. Imagine for a moment, as you follow these proceedings, what life \nwould be like on $230 a week, trying to make your mortgage or rental \npayment, pay utility bills, buy food for your family, and provide for \nthe necessities. It is very difficult.\n  Over half of the unemployed workers don't even have unemployment \ninsurance. They have left part-time jobs and they have no help. It is \nno wonder we are finding that food pantries and kitchens for the poor \nacross America are being overwhelmed with those coming in asking for \nhelp at the end of the year. It is important that we remember these \npeople as part of the stimulus package. Money given to these families \nis money that will be spent on the necessities of life, and that would \nbe an expenditure that would not only help them but equally important, \nspark the economy because they are going to be making purchases that \nhelp retailers and producers of goods and services across America.\n  In addition, health insurance is one of the first casualties of an \nunemployed family. And $500 or $600 a month for a COBRA plan, a private \nhealth insurance plan, is beyond the reach of most families. Think for \na moment. If you are one of those lucky Americans, such as myself, \nwhose family is insured, what would it be like to know that tomorrow \nyour health insurance is gone; you are one accident or one illness away \nfrom disaster?\n  We don't want that to happen to the families of the unemployed. That \nis why the Democrats pushed hard to keep that in the package.\n  Let me tell you another thing we can do to spark the economy. We need \na tax cut that will have an immediate impact and is fair. One I have \ntalked about over the last several weeks--\nSenator Domenici of New Mexico raised it as well--is a Federal tax \nholiday. It means that for a month we would suspend the collection of \nFederal payroll taxes on employees and employers across America. What \nis the impact? If your family earns, say, $40,000 a year, it means that \nin that month-long payroll tax holiday you would see an additional $250 \nin your paycheck, $250 at the end of the year for important purchases \nfor your family, for holiday purchases, for year-end purchases that you \nmight otherwise have put off.\n  The good thing about this approach is that it is fast, focused, and \nit is fair. It not only helps workers, every worker who gets a payroll \ncheck, it is going to help businesses, particularly small businesses.\n  Let me give you an illustration. If you had a small business with 100 \nemployees, with each employee having an average income of $40,000, it \nwould mean for your small business, in that month-long holiday period, \nan additional $25,000 in tax savings. Why does small business need \nthat? The last time I talked to people running a small business, they \ntold me, for example, the increase in health insurance premiums is \ncausing a real problem and hardship. So they can turn around and make \nsure their employees are covered and also have this money through a tax \nholiday.\n\n  This idea has strong bipartisan support. It certainly makes more \nsense for us to spend the $30 billion involved in this proposal rather \nthan to put it on a tax cut for people in the highest income categories \nin America. This payroll tax holiday, which I and Senator Domenici and \nothers support, would be focused on helping employees and employers \nacross America. We can do this. The Congress can enact it. We can say \nto the American people, even before this holiday season comes to an \nend, we are going to provide them a real tax cut and real tax relief.\n  I hope as part of our bipartisan package we can include this \nprovision. We can get this economy moving and do it in the right way, \nand do it in a fair fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to commend my colleague from \nIllinois for his comments. I wish to associate myself with the comments \nof both Senator Durbin and Senator Domenici, who are involved in \nadvocating common-sense approach to put money in people's pockets \nimmediately. I congratulate them for doing that.\n  I also rise to speak about what needs to happen in terms of economic \nrecovery and an economic stimulus package. I commend our leader, \nSenator Daschle, for bringing together the leaders for discussions. I \nthank the leaders on both sides of the aisle for sitting down together \nto move this measure because we do need to move quickly on a stimulus \nand recovery package. But we all know it has to be the right thing.\n  I am very concerned about what the House Republicans passed and the \nfact their approach is so very different from what mainstream \neconomists are telling us needs to be done in terms of moving this \neconomy forward quickly. What we saw in the House was an attempt to \nplace into law another round of large tax cuts for the top 1 percent of \nthe public, and literally billions of dollars in tax cuts for the \nlargest multinational corporations--supply-side economics at its best--\nhoping that it would trickle down somehow in time to help small \nbusinesses, workers, professionals, middle-income people, somehow that \nit would trickle down in order for people to be able to receive some \nkind of assistance during this recession.\n  We know in the past that approach has not worked. I am here today to \nencourage us to do what mainstream economists across the board have \nsuggested we do, which is to put something in place that is immediate, \ntemporary, and stimulates the economy by putting money directly into \npeople's pockets. I think the payroll tax holiday is one good way to do \nthat. It would certainly support small businesses.\n\n  We hear a lot of talk about big business in the Congress. Yet small \nbusiness is the fastest growing part of our economy, employing millions \nof people. They, too, have been affected--many times more so by what \nhappened in terms of the recession. We need to make sure we are \nfocusing on support for small business, whether it is being able to \nwrite off investments more quickly, whether it is a payroll tax \nholiday. I think supporting small business in this equation is very \nimportant.\n  I want to share some facts. We know that if we focus on those who \nhave lost their jobs, whether it is through the airline industry since \nSeptember 11 or other jobs in our economy, when we give dollars \ndirectly to those who are unemployed, they turn around and buy \ngroceries for the family, school supplies, Christmas, or other holiday \ngifts. Those activities are important to keep the economy going. It \nmoves the economy along, and it helps our families. It is a win-win \nsituation for everyone.\n  Studies have also shown that for every $1 invested in unemployment \ninsurance, we generate $2.15 in the gross domestic product. A 1999 \nstudy by the Department of Labor estimated that unemployment insurance \nmitigated the real loss in GDP by 15 percent. That is real, that is \nmeasurable, and it is an immediate stimulus to the economy. In the last \n5 recessions, real loss of GDP was mitigated by 15 percent, and the \naverage peak number of jobs saved was 131,000 jobs.\n  Economists are telling us that this is not just about doing what is \nfair; it is the best solution. It is the best way to stimulate the \neconomy. Joseph Stiglitz, co-winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize in \nEconomics, has stated: We should extend the duration and magnitude of \nthe benefits we provide to our unemployed. This is not only the fairest \nproposal but also the most effective. It is the most effective for the \neconomy. People who become unemployed cut back on their expenditures. \nGiving them more dollars will directly increase expenditures and \nimprove the economy.\n  We are talking about a demand-side approach. The Republicans in the \nHouse of Representatives have said\n\n[[Page S12123]]\n\ntrickle-down economics, supply side, that is the way to get the economy \ngoing. Economist after economist has come forward to say the problem is \nnot supply. In my State of Michigan where we make outstanding \nautomobiles, trucks, and SUVs, we want folks to purchase those \nvehicles. We know the problem is not supply; the problem is demand and \npeople having a job, having income, and being able to purchase that \nvehicle. It is demand side, and that is what the economists are all \ntelling us.\n\n  I want to speak about the economy and why we need to expand the \nunemployment insurance needs and modernize the system and why the \nSenate Democratic approach is so important to women in our economy.\n  When we look at unemployment insurance today, only 23 percent of \nunemployed women meet the current unemployment insurance eligibility \nrequirements. Only 23 percent of unemployed women meet the eligibility \nrequirements of unemployment insurance. Women who are heads of \nhouseholds and families dependent upon two incomes are \ndisproportionately and unfairly affected by layoffs and by our current \nunemployment system.\n  That is why the Senate Democrats have put forward a modernization of \nunemployment compensation by covering both part-time and low-wage \nworkers. This proportionately helps women more than it does men because \nwomen are more likely to be in part-time positions or in lower wage \npositions.\n  Unfortunately, the administration plan and the House plan do nothing \nto include part-time or low-wage workers. Sixty percent of low-income \nworkers are women and 70 percent of part-time workers are women.\n  I believe it is important for us to understand that those part-time \nworkers may be care giving for their children, may be care giving for a \nmom, a dad, a gramps or grandma who need assistance. They are \nfulfilling other family obligations while providing important income \nfor their family. They should not be left out of the economic picture. \nWhen we are looking for ways to support the economy and working men and \nwomen, we need to remember those women who are working part time or are \nin low-wage professions.\n  Women are the majority of workers in industries that have been \nhardest hit by the economic downturn: 56 percent of retail sales, 69 \npercent of restaurant and wait staff, 65 percent of kitchen workers, 79 \npercent of flight attendants.\n  I find it so disconcerting that here we are, long past September 11 \nwhen we immediately responded to the concerns--and I supported doing \nthat--of the airline industry to help them recover from what happened \non September 11, we have yet to pass a bill to support the people who \nwork in that industry.\n  We were promised that if we dealt with the industry first, we would \ncome back to those hundreds of thousands of airline industry-related \nworkers who had been laid off. Yet we have not done that. Again, we see \nthat this disproportionately affects women.\n  Also, women only earn 76 percent of men's median income, and women of \ncolor earn 64 percent of the wages of working men. As a result, women \nhave a greater need for income replacement when they are unemployed. It \nis important to note that we are talking about women who are providing \na significant percentage of their family income, in addition to caring \nfor their children and caring for older adults and all of the other \nwork in which women are involved. For poor female heads of households \nwho work part time, their earnings represent 91 percent of the family \nincome. If they lose their job, we are talking about 91 percent of the \nfamily income disappearing. Failure to replace the wages of part-time \nworkers through unemployment insurance benefits detrimentally impacts \nworking women and their families.\n  This is about doing the right thing in stimulating the economy. It is \nabout coming up with ways that support small business, as well as \nlarge, and our workers. It is about tax cuts that go to low- and \nmoderate-income people who will put that back into the economy.\n  Also, this is about making sure we remember the large part of our \nworkforce, our women, who are disproportionately affected by the \ncurrent unemployment system. It is designed in a way that unfairly \npenalizes women who are working part time while caring for their \nchildren and caring for loved ones at home or working in important but \nvery low-wage jobs.\n  This debate about stimulating the economy, about economic recovery, \nis incredibly important for everyone. We need to keep an eye on the \nfact that the policies we set may, in fact, have different results for \nworking women than for working men, and we need to remember women and \ntheir families as we put together this economic recovery package.\n  I urge we do what is right, what is fair, and most importantly what \nis effective, what the economists across this country have said we need \nto do, put money into the pockets of working people and those who are \nunemployed, and make sure we do not forget our small businesses as part \nof this economic recovery process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Under the previous \norder, the Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to address some of the issues my \ndistinguished friend from Michigan has been discussing. First of all, \nnot only can we not agree as to what belongs in the stimulus package, \nwe cannot seem to agree in the Senate, unfortunately, as to what our \npriorities ought to be. We are a nation at war and in recession. Those \nought to be our priorities. Yet we are talking about railroad \nretirement, we are talking about farm bills, everything but what we \nought to be discussing.\n  We ought to be talking about the issues my friend from Michigan has \nraised concerning the stimulus package. I will address that for a few \nmoments myself. There is no doubt for some time now there has been \npretty much a consensus on the idea we need a stimulus package. Later \non in my remarks I will discuss further whether or not that is really \nnecessarily true. I think there has been a consensus, but there \ncertainly has been no consensus as to what we ought to do about it and \nwhat belongs in it.\n  In fact, there is no consensus as to what in fact stimulates the \neconomy. Everybody has their own ideas. We have our own ideas in this \nChamber, and we state them authoritatively. But it is not only us, it \nis the economists. We cannot really say the economists think this or \nsay that. They think everything and they say everything. They are on \nall sides of all of these issues. So are businesspeople, labor people. \nRemarkably, their economic philosophy seems to somewhat coincide with \ntheir vested interest, which is not really different from the rest of \nus, I suppose. That is the situation we are confronting.\n\n  I want to discuss for a moment where we are, examine the validity of \nthe ideas we are using in support of our positions in general terms, \nand then discuss what we should do about it.\n  Assume for a moment this is not a political issue. One could make \nthat case. There have been a lot of disparaging remarks about certain \nprovisions in the House bill. There certainly have been a lot of \ndisparaging remarks about what came out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, all the pork and unrelated items, but we can put that aside \nfor a moment. We can put aside the remarks of the former adviser to \nPresident Clinton, who in a local publication said it is in the \nDemocrats' self-interest to defeat a stimulus package or not have one \nbecause it might affect the economy negatively and President Bush would \nget blamed for a negative economy. I do not think that is the way most \nof my colleagues believe, but those thoughts exist.\n  Unfortunately, we do spend a little bit too much time in this body \ntalking about how to divide the pie instead of trying to figure out how \nto make the pie bigger, who is going to get what. There is the tax-\ncuts-for-the-rich rhetoric, of course, we all have heard, ignoring the \nfact that 80 percent of the individual tax cuts would go to small \nbusinesspeople who provided 80 percent of the new jobs over the last \ndecade.\n  I must say I find it somewhat ironic that every time we get into the \nstimulus discussion, we talk about tax breaks for the rich, when the \nsame folks who make those arguments are also promoting a farm bill \nwhere 10 percent of the richest people in farming get 61 percent of the \nbenefits. So\n\n[[Page S12124]]\n\ntax cuts for the rich are bad, but pork for the rich is good.\n  Let us set all that aside for a moment, take the political aspects \nout of it, and talk about the economics of it. Basically, we have two \ndifferent economic views in this body--at least two main ones--as to \nwhat in fact does stimulate the economy. We each make statements as to \nwhat will stimulate it and what will not, but we never provide any \nauthority or any evidence or any historical precedence for what we are \nsaying.\n  There are four or more proposals now before us: The House bill, the \nSenate Finance bill, the President's bill, a compromise that is being \nworked on; a lot of things in common among all of those bills: Rebates \nfor low-income folks, additional unemployment benefits, health care \nprovisions. We disagree on the amounts of those, but those are pretty \nmuch common to all of these proposals, and if a stimulus package \npasses, that is going to be in there. That is where the similarity \nbreaks down and the division begins.\n  There is nothing wrong with philosophical divisions. That is why we \nhave elections, and that is why we have parties. Everyone is entitled \nto their opinion, but they are not entitled to their facts or their \nhistory. Let us examine which side is supported by history or precedent \nor facts and which is not.\n  On our side of the aisle, we basically think the majority of the \npackage ought to be tax cuts for the private sector, working men and \nwomen who are carrying the load and paying the taxes, and that includes \na speed-up of the reduction of the individual tax rates. That way, \npeople can get not just an extra check in their pocket one time, but \nthey can rely on a tax system that is going to be lower, and they can \nlook at it in the future and base their conduct, whether it is \nadditional work or additional investment, on a tax code that has \nbeen changed to their benefit on out into the future, not just a check \nbut a change of policy. That is what we believe.\n\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle basically seem to think \nthe way to stimulate the economy is spending by the Federal Government, \nand therein lie the differences and the debate. Our friends on the \nother side of the aisle and some on our side, and many in the media and \nsome economists, point out we need to get money into the hands of the \nconsumer by means of the Federal Government, which incidentally is \nmoney that either has to be borrowed or on which people have to be \ntaxed. That is where the Federal Government gets its money and \nredistributes it to others in the form of checks which they will \nimmediately spend.\n  The argument goes, the lower the income level, the more likely they \nare to spend it. So getting checks into the hands of consumers will \nstimulate the economy. The problem is there is not any evidence to \nsupport that proposition. I know it is often said. It might even be \nconsidered to be common wisdom at this stage of the game. But I submit \nall of the evidence and historical precedent indicate Federal spending \nprograms designed to grow the economy have not proven to be successful.\n  What are my citations for that? I am accusing other folks of not \ngiving their reasons, historical precedent or evidence. ``Thompson, \nwhat are your citations?'' one might say. I cite studies prepared by \nthe Joint Economic Committee back in 1988. I cite the 1930s, when in an \nattempt to ameliorate the effects of the Great Depression, we saw a \npercentage of the gross domestic product in this country almost triple \nwhile unemployment doubled.\n  I cite the case of Japan. They have been trying to do this \nfordecades--spend themselves into prosperity. They have had 10 separate \nspending stimulus packages in the 1990s, to no effect. France and \nSweden have had similar problems. I ask, if in fact we really run our \neconomy based on an ATM principle, where we have it figured out, that \nwe have to put in our card, our solution, our congressional solution, \nand out comes the result we want, why do we ever tolerate recession \nanyway? Why do we not print some more money? Why do we not send out \nsome more checks? Why do we ever sustain the average recession of 11 \nmonths? Why do we go that long if that is the solution? It is an easy \nsolution and an easy one to understand. I submit it is because it has \nnot proven to work.\n  On the idea the poor will spend more, there is no historical evidence \nfor that either. It might seem logical, but a lot of things that seem \nlogical are not borne out in real practice. The last time we sent \nchecks out, 18 percent of people spent them. According to the \nPresidential adviser, Mr. Hubbard, I was reading the other day he says \nall the economic evidence is that people spend at various income \nlevels. People basically spend the same percentage. We already have the \nbudget with $686 billion in spending, an additional $40 billion that \nhas been allocated, and an additional $15 billion in airline support.\n\n  Certainly, when we hear of economists saying this is a solution, you \nwould not want to include Mr. Greenspan in that category. He doesn't \nsay that spending is the way to do this. He says if we do it, we cannot \ndo it fast enough to have any effect anyway. In fact, by the time it \nkicks in, by the time our governmental spending kicks in and the checks \nget in the mail, are received and spent, even if it works the way we \nwant it to, it will be too late. If the average recession lasts 11 \nmonths--and ours started last March--we are going to have to hurry up \nor the doggone recession will be over before we act and we will not get \ncredit for anything. There is no way we can possibly have anything that \naffects the economy by next February or spring. We could assist it if \nwe did exactly the right thing. Is it worth $100 billion under those \ncircumstances, when we cannot agree on the components? I question that.\n  What about the other side? I have been talking about the philosophy \nof Federal spending being the answer to stimulating the economy. What \nabout this side of the aisle? As to the idea that the private sector is \nthe source of the solution for recession and that tax cuts, and \nespecially marginal rate cuts, is an integral part of that, what about \nthe evidence for that? I submit the historical evidence to support that \nproposition is just as clear as the historical evidence that fails to \nsupport the Federal Government spending proposition.\n  The evidence is, those kinds of tax cuts not only grow the economy \nbut they produce more revenue to the Federal Government. President \nKennedy pointed that out. He said: It is not a matter of either tax \ncuts or higher deficits; the more you cut taxes, the more revenue you \nwill generate. Of course, he was right.\n  Incidentally, the rich pay more as a percentage of the taxes paid \nwhen you have the marginal rate tax cuts than beforehand. At every \nlevel it is borne out, and especially marginal rate reductions, which \nencourage work, encourage investment, are the kinds of action that get \nthe economy going. Sending someone a check to buy a pair of gym shoes \nwill be momentarily beneficial to somebody, I suppose, but that is not \nthe kind of policy that strengthens our economy or causes that money to \nrecirculate or to be there for a longer period of time.\n  What is my historical evidence? I refer to the 1920s, the 1960s and \nthe 1980s. During those periods, the country went with that approach. \nIn every instance, we had more economic growth, more revenue to the \nFederal Government, and the richer paid a higher percentage of the \ntaxes that were paid in terms of dollars. From 1961 to 1968, the \neconomy expanded 42 percent because of President Kennedy's tax cuts, \nover 5 percent a year. I would settle for that. We could use a little \nof that right now.\n  When you look at the package from the Finance Committee or what is \nbeing talked about in the Chamber by my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle, the best I can figure is, only 20 to 25 percent of the \npossibly $100 billion package would in any way justify being called \nstimulative, if you look at the evidence and do not just pick this \neconomist's statement who is aligned philosophically with one group or \nanother economist aligned with another group or someone who comports \nwith our own philosophy.\n  My concern is that in all this compromise language talk, we will say, \nOK, let's do what we often do around here and take both of them: Have \nthe tax cuts and additional spending. That is what got us in trouble \nbefore. We do not need to go that way. Not only would it not be good, \nit would be harmful.\n\n[[Page S12125]]\n\n  We will need that revenue. If we had good reason to believe such an \napproach that just gave pennies on the dollar to stuff that would be \nstimulative, and the rest would make us feel good and help us with \ncertain voters in certain segments of the economy--we are all concerned \nabout the unemployed. I am as concerned about unemployed in Tennessee \nas unemployed in New York. They are all unemployed and all deserve our \nconsideration, and they will under these bills, but they will not \nstimulate the economy.\n  We have only begun to assess the costs of what happened in September. \nWe know now almost overnight not only will we have to spend a whole lot \nmore in our defense budget, but we have law enforcement, public health \nfacilities, nuclear facilities, government buildings, Border Patrol, \npost offices, airports, mass transit. Those are all directly at the \nfeet of the Government and the private sector. We have handling of the \nmail, insurance costs, transportation costs. Somebody said it is not \nthat ``just in time'' philosophy with the average business, it is \n``just in case'' philosophy. That will cost money. Slowing \nglobalization has hit a lot of company pockets; computer security--all \nthese things cost a lot of money in the public and private sectors. \nUnless we are very sure what we are doing with $100 billion or $85 \nbillion, we should not do it.\n  Now the OMB Director says we will be in deficit at least until 2005. \nIf we cannot at least get half of a stimulus package that stimulates \nthe economy, we should not do it. We do not know how long the recession \nwill be. If it is average, we have already bottomed out and are working \nour way back. Nobody knows for sure. But we do know retail sales are \nup, unemployment stabilized, low oil prices, and interest rate \nreductions have put more money into the consumer's hands faster than \nthe Federal Government could. The stock market is not doing too badly.\n  We should give ourselves a chance. There is a good argument to be \nmade that we can do the right thing, have policy that stimulates the \neconomy, which is the private sector, and a large portion has to be tax \ncuts and rate reductions which are tried and true. We can also make \nsome compromises and do some things in terms of spending that many \nthink are not stimulative but within the bounds of political reality, \nrealizing that has to be part of the package, and have a decent mix and \nmaybe do some good. Anything less than that, I fear, would do harm.\n  I hope the President draws the line and says something to the effect, \nif part of this package cannot be stimulative, I will veto it. I think \nthat is a position we ought to take. I don't think we have been talking \nabout this for so long and the markets are so convinced and have been \nconvinced that this is what we are going to do and it is such a great \nidea. I don't think they are paying that much attention to us in that \nregard. I don't think that train is down the track that far that we \nhave to pass something, regardless. I will not vote for something \n``regardless'' that is, in the long term interests, detrimental to the \neconomy of this Nation. But it will be unfortunate if we do not have \nthe opportunity to do something that would be beneficial and come \ntogether on something that would be beneficial.\n\n  I still hope we will be able to do that because I think that would be \nthe best solution for the economy and for the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I wonder if the senior Senator, the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee, would respond to a question.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I wonder if the Senator is familiar with the Federal \nReserve's view of how they model or look at the economy, and how tax \ncuts and spending cuts work through the economy. We just had a Joint \nEconomic Committee meeting yesterday in preparation for that. We went \nback and looked at some of their models which are based on statistics \nand observations through time.\n  When you were commenting earlier, I thought it would be worthwhile if \nI mentioned that, at least according to the Federal Reserve's models, \nspending has a multiplier effect of 1.4 times in the first year \nrelative to tax cuts, which have about a half of 1 percent impact in \nthe first year.\n  Sometimes when you drag those out over a longer period, you catch up \nwith the benefits of taxes, depending on the nature of them. But there \nis solid evidence in the economic community, and I think among the \nFederal Reserve, that spending can have and often does have meaningful \nmultiplier effects on the economy. That is why so many people would \nargue, and I think they would argue based on fact, or at least data, \nthat there is reason to believe that spending does have a positive \nimpact on the economy.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I will respond to my friend that I do not doubt that. I \ndo not know the details of how they do that. I am aware that they do \nit. I do not doubt, as I have indicated, someone, going down at the \nmicro level, going down and getting a check and buying some goods has \nsome effect; that a lot of people doing that might not have some \neffect.\n  I think the difference has to do with short term versus long term. \nThe history I have read on the subject concerning a concerted effort by \nthe Government, with Federal spending programs over a period of time--\nwhether it be the United States in the 1930s, or Japan for the last \ndecade--has not proved beneficial, has not brought about growth. So we \nmight be talking about the difference between microeconomics and \nmacroeconomics. I am not sure. I do not dispute the statistic that the \nSenator gave, but I think the studies that were done from the Joint \nEconomic Committee back in 1998 is the other side of that coin.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Would the Senator comment on whether he believes \nunemployment benefits tend to get expended or not in the process of \ngoing to people who have lost their jobs? Do you think that goes to \nsavings? Is that what I am reading you to say?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. No, I think you can assume in most cases, if you are \ntalking about that very small part of the economy that has to do with \nunemployment benefits, that those checks probably are spent.\n  My concern, I suppose, is that if you expand that concept, then why \nnot send everybody a check. A lot of people laughed at Senator McGovern \nseveral years ago--what was the size of the check he wanted to send \neverybody, $1000? Why not extrapolate that concept, if the concept is \nthe solution?\n  I think there is some factual validity to what you are saying. But I \nam saying if you expand that concept in terms of the overall economy, \nthe evidence is not there to support it.\n  If it is that simple, if that is the solution, why do we ever put up \nwith a recession? When we first see one, why don't we decide to whom we \nwant to send the checks and get it over with and the economy will \nbounce back?\n  Mr. CORZINE. I appreciate the remarks of the distinguished Senator. I \nthink there really is--the point that I was trying to make--some \nevidence that spending does have meaningful impact on the growth of the \neconomy. I will make sure I send you over a copy of the Federal Reserve \nBulletin's commentary on this so you can get a sense of what this is \nabout.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the recess be \npostponed until 1 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 5 months ago, America had a projected \nbudget surplus of $2.7 trillion over the next 10 years. The stock \nmarket was soaring. The question before us was one that most leaders \ncould only dream of: ``What should be we with out prosperity?''\n  At that time, we came to this floor to debate our Nation's fiscal \nfuture--how could we sustain that hard-won prosperity, meet our great \nunmet needs, and, yes, provide meaningful tax relief for millions of \nAmerican families.\n  Democrats put forward a balanced plan that maintained our fiscal \ndiscipline, while at the same time making sound investments in our \nchildren, our health, and our security, and provide tax relief.\n  Because we recognized how fragile and inaccurate budget projections \nare, we left room to deal with an economic downturn or an unforeseen \nemergency.\n  Unfortunately, our approach was not the one that prevailed.\n\n[[Page S12126]]\n\n  Instead of a balanced and fiscally responsible plan, we ended up with \none so top-heavy with tax cuts, it left little room for other \ninvestments, and no flexibility for a change in circumstances.\n  I made no secret of the fact that I was unhappy with that debate, and \nits outcome. But based on the administration's predictions--and \nassurances--that we could afford such cuts without running into \ndeficits or shortchanging our priorities, the majority of my colleagues \nvoted for it.\n  Early this morning, just several months after receiving those \nassurances, and several months into the administration's 10-year plan, \nwe now learn that the White House budget director is predicting that \nour government is likely to run budget deficits until 2005. This is a \nstark reversal from the situation this administration inherited less \nthan a year ago.\n  This is a marked departure from the rosy predictions we were being \noffered just months ago.\n  So, how did this happen? Let's start with how it did not happen.\n  As deeply as the September 11 attacks impact our lives, our security, \nand our economy--they are not responsible for the fiscal situation in \nwhich we now find ourselves.\n  While the attacks of September 11 seemed to change everything in a \nmoment, the economic trends before September 11 were clear.\n  As a panel of economists announced earlier this week, our economy had \nofficially entered a recession in March.\n  Neither does our current situation have to do with congressional \nspending.\n  We have not spent a dollar more than what the President and the \nCongress agreed to, either in the course of the normal appropriations \nprocess, or in response to the events of September 11--not a dollar.\n  Although we have taken a great deal of action in the aftermath of \nthese attacks--supporting the President's use of force in Afghanistan, \nkeeping the airlines solvent, giving law enforcement additional tools \nto combat terrorism, and strengthening airport security--to date, we \nhave actually spent less than $40 billion. So why are we now facing \ndeficits when just months ago we were looking at years of surpluses?\n  Regrettably, what we feared then is what we are faced with now. The \neconomic plan that was passed ate up nearly two-thirds of what was an \noptimistic prediction of our 10-year surplus. It left no room for an \neconomic slowdown, or an unanticipated emergency.\n  As Robert Reischauer, the former Director of the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office said:\n\n       Had we not had the tax cut, it's likely that we would have \n     skated along with close to a balanced budget, despite the \n     costs of the war and the effort to contain terrorism.\n\n  Even more ominously, the administration warned that decisions about \ntaxes and spending in the next year ``will determine whether we ever \nsee another surplus.''\n  Despite the fact that some of us did not approve of the plan that got \nus here, all of us should now work together to make sure that we pass \nan economic recovery plan that helps--rather than exacerbates--the \nproblem.\n  As we consider a package to stimulate the economy, we need to be \nextremely careful to pursue a policy that is temporary, truly \nstimulative, and--now more than ever--fiscally responsible.\n  As I look at the Republican proposals, I am disappointed to see that \nthey are based on tax cuts that fail these simple yet essential tests, \nand they do little or nothing for the dislocated workers who most need \nour help.\n  In the weeks since September 11, Democrats and Republicans have been \nable to work together in a way that I haven't seen in all my time in \nWashington.\n  Our ability to speak together and work together is one of the \nreasons, I believe, we have been able do so much, so quickly, in \nresponse to the attacks and the continuing terrorist threat. The fiscal \noutlook we are now facing is as serious as anything we have faced to \ndate.\n  We need to renew that same spirit, if we are to address this problem \nas well.\n  Right now, we have an opportunity to help those who are hurting, and \nlift our economy in the process.\n  It is an opportunity we cannot afford to lose.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to come to the floor because I do fear \nwith these economic projections--we have said on several occasions we \nknew the real possibility existed--that we will revert right back to \nthe bad old days of deficits and huge new debt. I never dreamed it \nwould be this soon. I never dreamed we would be talking in the third \nquarter--now the fourth quarter of this calendar year and the first \nquarter of the new fiscal year--that we would have deficits well into \nthe third year beyond this year.\n  That ought to be as strong an indication as we ever need that what we \ndid last spring was a mistake; that what we did in economic policy with \nthe passage of that tax cut was a disaster, not only for our economy \nbut for our ability now to respond to the array of challenges we face \nin the aftermath of the crisis of September 11.\n  How sad it is that the legacy of the last 8 years did not last longer \nthan a few months. I am very hopeful we will take to heart the \nadmonition of the Budget Committee chairman who has asked every Member \nof our Senate body to look very carefully at the report made by the OMB \nDirector, to look at it with the recognition that, as we face these \nother additional challenges, whether it is the economic stimulus plan \nor the array of other challenges we face as we meet the needs of our \ncurrent situation in fighting terrorism, that we do so prudently and \nwith the recognition that a major mistake was made last spring.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask the Chair, are we under an earlier \nagreement for a time limit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Senator Carnahan will \nhave 10 minutes, but there is not a particular sequence.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of Senator Carnahan's remarks I be granted 10 minutes in \nmorning business, and following the conclusion of my remarks Senator \nReed be granted 10 minutes, and that the time be charged against \npostcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, we are to recess at \n1 o'clock. Is the Senator asking to extend that time?\n  Mr. DAYTON. No. I am not asking to extend the time. Maybe the Chair \ncould clarify exactly what we are in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have 16 minutes remaining before the recess \ntime. Under the previous order, the Senator from Missouri is recognized \nfor 10 minutes. That leaves 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that order be \nmodified: That at the conclusion of Senator Carnahan's remarks, I be \ngranted 10 minutes to speak as in morning business, after which Senator \nReed be granted 10 minutes to speak in morning business, the time be \ncharged against postcloture, and the time for the recess be extended \nuntil the completion of Senator Reed's remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I am very encouraged to hear that the \nleadership has begun negotiations regarding the stimulus package.\n  Congress has been paralyzed on this issue for weeks now. And while we \nsat here at an impasse, economists confirmed that our Nation is in a \nrecession.\n  We must act quickly to jump start our slowing economy. It is well \npast time for us to find common ground.\n  As we seek compromise, I encourage my colleagues to keep in mind the \ngoal of a stimulus package.\n  In order to truly promote economic growth, the policies we approve \nshould take effect immediately, they should have a temporary cost, and \nthey should focus on those individuals and businesses most likely to \nspend and invest additional cash.\n  These are the bipartisan principles that we started with. These \nprinciples ought to guide our negotiations now.\n  A wide range of proposals will be on the table for this negotiation.\n  The Republicans have a plan, and the Democrats have a plan. The \nCentrist Coalition has its own proposal.\n\n[[Page S12127]]\n\n  From among all these ideas, we must put together a balanced, \nreasonable package.\n  In the end, the stimulus package needs to promote business \ninvestment, spur consumer demand, and assist those Americans who have \nlost their livelihoods during this recession.\n  Shortly before Thanksgiving, Senator Domenici, with the support of my \ncolleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, added a new and interesting idea \nto the debate. They suggested that Congress should provide a payroll \ntax holiday for the month of December. This idea has some merit. It \nwould distribute benefits across a broad range of taxpayers, including \nmost individuals who earn less than $80,000 a year. And it would \nprovide needed cash to businesses based on the size of their payrolls.\n  However, the question remains:\n  How does this new idea fit into the overall stimulus debate?\n  It has been suggested that a payroll tax holiday could substitute for \nproposed rebate checks to low-income workers.\n  I have serious reservations about such a tradeoff.\n  Rebate checks of $300 would go to low-income workers who have not yet \nreceived any tax refund this year.\n  Let me give you an example.\n  A single mother working full time at a minimum wage job would \nprobably be eligible for a $500 rebate check. This money could help her \nput food on the table, or cover the rent, or keep her old car going a \nfew months more.\n  However, under the Social Security tax holiday, she would receive \nabout $50 worth of tax relief--not enough to make a real difference.\n  That is not a fair trade.\n  I am sure that the single mother who is struggling to make ends meet \nwould not consider that a good deal.\n  This is not to say that the payroll tax holiday has no place in a \nstimulus package. Rather, I simply suggest that it is not an \nappropriate substitute for tax relief for our lowest income workers.\n  In spite of this observation, I think that the payroll holiday may \nhave a place in the stimulus package. The payroll tax holiday has the \nbenefit of providing assistance to both workers and businesses. It is \ntherefore appropriate that it be included in place of other individual \nand business tax cuts under consideration.\n  I propose that the payroll tax holiday is appropriate in lieu of two \nproposals in the House bill: The acceleration of the 28 percent tax \nrate cut, and the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, or \nAMT.\n  Let us first look at the impact of my suggestion for individuals.\n  Under current law, the 28 percent tax bracket is scheduled to be \nreduced to 25 percent by 2006. It has been proposed that it would be \nstimulative to implement this cut next year. This tax cut would benefit \nmarried couples filing jointly with income over $45,000, and \nindividuals who earn more than $27,000. This is approximately one-\nquarter of all income tax payers.\n  On the other hand, a payroll tax holiday will help almost all \ntaxpayers.\n  Americans are subject to payroll taxes on the first $80,400 of income \nper year.\n  In other words, every worker who has earned less than about $80,000 \nby the end of November would get a tax break. And very importantly, the \npayroll tax break is immediate and temporary.\n  If we accelerate the rate cuts next year, it will still cost us money \nin 2003, in 2004, and in 2005.\n  In all, over the next 10 years the accelerated tax cuts could cost \n$78 billion. But only the money put into workers' hands now can \nstimulate the economy. The payroll tax holiday would inject more money \ninto the economy now. It would cost less in the long run than \naccelerating rate cuts. And it would benefit a much greater number of \nworkers. In short, the payroll tax holiday meets our basic principles \nfor stimulus and accelerating rate cuts simply does not.\n  Now I will discuss the impact of my suggestion for corporations. The \nHouse-passed stimulus bill and the proposal made by Senator Grassley \nwould repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax. Elimination of this \ntax would cost approximately $25 billion next year.\n  Let's be clear. This is a tax paid by profitable corporations that \nwould otherwise pay no tax at all. By contrast, a payroll tax holiday \nwould benefit all corporations.\n  Under current law, corporations pay a Social Security payroll tax \nequal to 6.2 percent of each employee's income up to $80,400 per year. \nWith a payroll tax holiday for the month of December, these businesses \nwould save $19 billion.\n  This is additional cash infused into virtually all businesses. It \nwould help our small businesses, the true engine of our economy. The \nsize of the tax benefit is linked directly to the wages the company is \npaying to its employees. This tax cut would make it easier for \nbusinesses to keep workers on their payrolls, and that is the whole \ngoal of this stimulus package, to keep America working.\n  Congress ought to act quickly to reinvigorate this country. In order \nto do so, we must be willing to compromise. While I may not think that \na payroll tax holiday is the perfect way to stimulate our economy, I \nunderstand compromise, and I am willing to support Senator Domenici's \nproposal, if it is offered in place of these other tax cuts that are \nunpalatable to me.\n  This is a compromise that makes sense to me. It makes sense to that \nsingle mother who is trying to make ends meet. It makes sense to most \nbusinesses which would not benefit from a repeal of the corporate AMT. \nAnd it makes basic sense, based on the principles that were laid out by \nthe House and Senate Budget Committees at the beginning of this year, \nthat the effects of the stimulus be temporary, immediate, and focused \non those most likely to spend the investment.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this sensible \ncompromise.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, during the last few weeks we have all \nheard about and discussed many ideas and proposals for inclusion in the \neconomic stimulus legislation. In fact, one of our difficulties is we \nhave so many meritorious proposals that we could not possibly fit them \nall in, even if we could all agree on them.\n  One proposal of which I have heard recently, and one I believe may \nhave merit, deals with tax provisions which apply to many families and \nsmall businesses throughout the country. Many were taxed for years \nunder subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code. In recent years, with \nthe liberalization of the rules under subchapter S of the code, many of \nthese businesses have elected a sub S status, which means, in general, \nall corporate income is taxed at the shareholder level, not to the \ncorporation as a separate legal entity.\n  One exception to this rule applies to built-in gains which are taxed \nat the corporate level in full and at the shareholder level in full for \n10 years after a C corporation converts to an S corporation.\n  The original and primary purpose of this tax on built-in gains was to \nprevent C corporation shareholders from converting to subcorporation \nstatus and thereafter immediately being able to liquidate or mix \ncorporate distributions with only the single level of taxation \napplicable to an S corporation as opposed to the double layer taxation \napplicable to a C corporation.\n  Unfortunately, however, this proper purpose also prevents the \nshareholders of an S corporation from selling corporate assets without \nincurring a double tax even if the proceeds are not distributed to \nshareholders but instead are reinvested in the business to help create \nnew jobs and stimulate the U.S. economy.\n  This tax burden makes it difficult, if not impossible, for many \nfamilies and small businesses that have elected S status to access the \ncapital of the business to help stimulate our economy.\n  This proposal would provide for the elimination of the built-in gain \ntax where the entire proceeds of the sale are reinvested in the \nbusiness. In other words, it would permit the business owners to do \nwhat we should want any good business to do as much and as often as \npossible: expand the business and create new jobs. That should be the \nfoundation of our economic stimulus legislation. It will also be the \nfoundation of our national economic recovery.\n  All of us know that small businesses provide most of the jobs in \nAmerica.\n\n[[Page S12128]]\n\n Their abilities to do so have been longstanding concerns of Republican \nand Democratic Members of this Senate body for many years.\n  When I worked as a legislative assistant in 1975 and 1976 for one of \nMinnesota's greatest Senators, Walter Mondale, one of my areas of \nresponsibility was to staff him on the Senate Small Business Committee. \nThe committee operated then, as I understand it does now, largely in \nthe spirit of bipartisan cooperation to help encourage and assist in \nthe creation and growth of as many American businesses as possible.\n  This proposal presents us with an important opportunity to take \nanother step in that direction.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 39 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I also wish to express my strongest possible support \nof the Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001. I \nwould like to thank Senator Baucus and Senator Hatch for offering this \nimportant legislation.\n  My office has received hundreds of calls and letters from current and \nretired railroad employees. From St. Paul to St. Cloud, from Brainerd \nto Duluth--from everywhere in Minnesota--railroad retirees and current \nrailroad employees understand the critical need to pass this \nlegislation now.\n  My very good friend Tom Dwyer, originally from Hibbing, MN, has been \nworking on railroad retirement issues since 1973. He also was a clerk \nfor different railroad companies for 35 years until he retired in 1997. \nTom is now the legislative director for the National Association of \nRetired and Veteran Railway Employees.\n  Advocating for retired railroad workers, widows, and widowers is \nTom's life work. He reminds me that this debate is not over Government \nmoney. This bill is about the pensions that workers have paid into this \nfund. It is their money.\n  Throughout our country, there are 673,000 railroad retirees and \nfamilies and about 245,000 active rail workers. Minnesota's Eighth \nCongressional District, up in the northeastern part of our State, ranks \n10th in the Nation in the number of retired and active railroad \nemployees. Throughout our State there are over 18,000 retirees and \ntheir families depending on railroad retirement benefits.\n  In addition, over 5,500 Minnesotans are presently working for the \nrailroads. They will eventually need pensions for their retirement.\n  All of these fine men and women have worked hard, and they all \ndeserve the best possible retirement program. They know better than we \nwhat kind of retirement program is best for them. They paid in the \nmoney, out of their paychecks, for all their working years, and all \nthey are asking us to do now, by passing this legislation, is to return \nto them their money in a way that is best for them.\n  What could be controversial about that? Which one of us, if we were \nin their shoes, would not want the same and think we deserve it. They \nare right. And they do deserve it.\n  This bipartisan legislation presents a historic opportunity for our \nNation's railroad retirement system. Senator Baucus and Senator Hatch \ndeserve tremendous credit, and they have my gratitude, for bringing \ntogether railroad companies, labor organizations, and retirees to work \ntogether to modernize this system. The result of all that hard work is \nthis legislation, which provides better and more secure benefits, and \nwhich does so at a lower cost. What could be better than that?\n  I say, let's vote on this bill today and pass it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nRhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that, at \nthe conclusion of my remarks, Senator Gregg be recognized for 10 \nminutes, and upon the conclusion of his remarks, the Senate stand in \nrecess under the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am privileged to serve as the vice \nchairman of the Joint Economic Committee. The Democratic staff of the \nJoint Economic Committee issued a very pressing report about America's \neconomy. I would like to read from the first paragraph of the Executive \nSummary.\n\n       New reports from the Bush Administration's Office of \n     Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office \n     confirm that the combination of the large tax cut and the \n     worsened economic situation have essentially eliminated any \n     expected on-budget surplus for the next five years. Indeed, \n     there is a growing possibility that the government's \n     fiscal position could be even worse, with no surplus at \n     all by the end of the decade and with a national debt that \n     might be even higher in ten years than it is now.\n\n  What is particularly prescient about this report is the fact that it \nwas not issued this morning, hours after Mr. Daniels of OMB declared \nthat the fiscal policies of this administration have locked this \nGovernment into deficits for the next several years. This report was \nissued on September 7, 2001.\n  It is also interesting to note that this report suggests very \nstrongly, prior to the attack on America on September 11, that the \nfiscal policies of this administration had headed us down a road to \ndeficit after deficit after deficit.\n  The attack on September 11 was a dreadful assault on this country, \nbut it is not the cause of the current deficit we are staring at over \nthe next several years. It may have accelerated the timing, but the \nfundamental core was the irresponsible tax policies of this \nadministration.\n  If we look across several years, we see a situation where our \ncolleagues on the other side resisted, in 1993, President Clinton's \nplan, which mercifully passed by a very narrow margin, which set the \nfiscal context, together with monetary policy, for the largest \nexpansion of our economy perhaps in our history. Yet when this party \ncame to power, not only in the Senate and the House but in 2001 in the \nPresidency, it took them a scant 9 to 10 months to reverse years of \neconomic progress and prosperity and cast us back again into deficit \nafter deficit after deficit.\n  The consequences are severe. We are approaching critical choices \nabout Social Security and Medicare. Just a year ago, we had surpluses \nwhich we could use to make these difficult choices. Those surpluses are \ngone. But the demographic timebomb of the baby boomers is not gone. It \nwill be here. It is virtually on our doorstep. So we now have to \nrespond to these issues bereft of a surplus that was hard-earned over \nyears of effort during the 1990s.\n  There is something else, obviously, that is one of the direct \nconsequences of September 11. We are at war. This is a war that will \ndemand increased expenditures which we cannot decline to make, not just \nin the military operations, which are expensive inherently, but if we \nare not to repeat the mistakes that were made previously in the area of \nSouthwest Asia. We have to maintain a presence there. We have to be one \nof the international participants to help in the reconstruction of \nAfghanistan. We have to take steps across the globe to eliminate other \nterrorist threats, sometimes more sinister than the dreadful events we \nsaw in New York.\n  We have to recognize there are loose nuclear materials around the \nworld, particularly in Russia, loose biological agents around the \nworld. All of these things will cost money. And the war on terror will \nnot end simply with the defeat of al-Qaida. It will be a constant \nongoing battle, perhaps akin to the Cold War--increased expenditures \nnow, because of this tax cut policy, without the benefit of a surplus.\n  There is something else we must recognize. We are looking at short-\nrun economic consequences of this tax policy. But what is going to \nhappen in the next several months and days and years ahead is that the \nadministration's response will be OK, we can't shun funding defense. We \nwill have to cut back in every other area of effort.\n  The key to our long-run economic prosperity is the productivity of \nAmerica. That productivity is not simply machines and tools and \ncomputers. It is human capital. It is healthy, educated Americans who \ncan use these tools, who can invent new tools, who can continue this \ngrowth. When we cut education and when we refuse to fund special \neducation and when we go ahead and cut back on health care and we do \nall these things, we are harming our long-run productivity.\n\n[[Page S12129]]\n\n  That is the dilemma we are in today. It is a dilemma that was \nentirely avoidable by a more responsible fiscal policy of this \nadministration.\n  There is no surprise about Mr. Daniels' announcement yesterday. \nPerhaps the only shock, if you will, was the timing. It was inevitable \nafter we passed this tax cut. Now as we go forward, we are seeing the \nconsequences. Those consequences will be very difficult to bear. What \nis worse than that, our colleagues are compounding this terrible \nsituation by advancing the same policies in the guise of a stimulus \npackage: Accelerating marginal tax cuts further and proposing corporate \nAMT that is retroactive. That is not going to get this economy moving. \nThat will simply make the hole we are in much, much deeper and the \nclimb out much steeper and longer and harder, particularly for working \nAmericans.\n  Again, there should be no surprise about Mr. Daniels' announcement, \nbut there should be surprise, shock, and perhaps even anger, that \nhaving brought us down this path, they refuse to see the error of their \nways. They refuse to recognize that, yes, we do need a stimulus package \nbut one that would truly stimulate the economy by getting consumers \nback in the marketplace, by ensuring that middle- and low-income \nworking Americans get access to additional dollars that they will spend \nquite quickly. We must in fact protect ourselves through increased \nexpenditures on homeland defense.\n  I hope yesterday's announcement represents not just waking up to the \nreality of their policies but changing the policies, that in working \ncollectively with the leaders in the House and in the Senate to script \nand craft a fiscal package that will move America forward, we will \nbegin our slow climb out of this deficit situation. But there should be \nno confusion about the fundamental cause of our current economic \nsituation--a precipitous collapse from surpluses to deficits. It was an \nunwise, irresponsible tax plan promoted and proposed by the President \nand regrettably accepted by this Congress.\n  I hope the searing news that Mr. Daniels gave us yesterday will \nprovide something more than heat, that will provide a little \nillumination to those who seek to lead this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nHampshire is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/29/senate-section/article/S12129-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12129-S12130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about one of \nthe problems we have had over the last few months, which is a failure \nof the majority party to address the issue of nominations sent up by \nthe President. This failure has been most blatant, of course, in the \narea of judicial nominations where we now have well over 100 openings \nin the judiciary which have not been filled, which is an extraordinary \nnumber, especially when you put it in context of the prior \nadministration. It is almost 100 percent larger than what the prior \nadministration experienced under a Republican Senate.\n  There are also, independent of the judiciary nominations, a number of \nother nominations critical to the operation of the Government which are \nbeing held up by the majority party.\n  I rise to speak to one specifically. That is the nomination of Eugene \nScalia to be the solicitor of the Department of Labor. Most people have \nnever heard of the term or the individual solicitor of the Department \nof Labor. It is, however, a significant position within a significant \ndepartment.\n  It is the fair arbiter of the laws within the Labor Department. It is \nthe place at which the Government represents its cases, the individual \nwho carries forward a great deal of the policy of the Government, as it \nhas been set forth by the Congress and the Executive.\n\n  Why is Mr. Scalia not being brought to the floor? First off, you have \nto understand that it is not because the nomination hasn't been \npending. The nomination has now been pending for 213 days. That is the \nlongest period of time that any nomination has been pending around this \nbody. Ironically, I think the reason it is not being brought forward is \nthat it is tied to something that occurred 351 days ago, and that was \nthe case of Gore v. Bush, or Bush v. Gore--the issue settled in the \nSupreme Court as to how the Florida law would be applied and the prior \nelection, therefore, resolved. You see, Eugene Scalia, through family \nties, appears to be tied to that case by the majority in the Senate.\n  There is a lot of frustration about that case on the other side of \nthe aisle. Many of my colleagues, with great energy, believe it was \ndecided the wrong way. Many have taken it personally, I suspect. \nObviously, they have taken it personally because they are applying it \npersonally in the case of Eugene Scalia, a relative to one of the \ndecisionmakers in that process --of course, Justice Anthony Scalia--and \nwho was one of the majority in the decision of Bush v. Gore. Well, \nEugene Scalia is his son.\n  So we now have a scenario where the son has come up for a nomination \nto serve in the Government. I suppose you can argue, well, maybe he is \nnot being approved because he was sent up quickly. I pointed out it was \n313 days ago. You may argue he is not qualified. Actually, he is \nextraordinarily well qualified. He is one of the finest attorneys in \nthe area of labor law in the country. In fact, five former Solicitors \nGeneral of the Department of Labor have said he is unquestionably an \nextraordinarily qualified individual. To quote them, they say:\n\n       We are unaware of any prior solicitor nominee with his \n     combination of academic accomplishment, prolific writing on \n     labor and employment matters, and many years of practice as a \n     labor and employment lawyer.\n\n  That is five prior Solicitors of the Department. They have said this \nis a great nomination. It is not because he holds views that are \nantithetical or inappropriate to the position. In fact, he strongly is \nsupported by some of the leading civil rights attorneys in this \ncountry; for example, William Coleman, who is one of the leading civil \nrights attorneys in our Nation's history, said that Eugene Scalia would \nbe among the best lawyers who have ever held the important position--\nthe position of Solicitor of the Department of Labor. He went on to \nsay:\n\n       Eugene Scalia is a bright, sophisticated lawyer whose \n     writings are well within the mainstream of ideas.\n\n  So he is not being attacked because he doesn't have the ability. He \nhas all the ability you could possibly want. In fact, it is great that \nwe can attract people of his talent and capability to public service. \nNo, Eugene Scalia--Scalia the younger--is being attacked because of \nScalia the elder. You might say, well, maybe he came up too quickly. We \npointed out that isn't right.\n  Maybe he doesn't qualify. That is not true either.\n  Maybe he holds outrageous opinions. Actually, during the hearing \nprocess, the only significant attack made on his writings was a \ndisagreement over his position on ergonomics. Eugene Scalia committed \nthe ``cardinal sin'' of opposing the ergonomics rule as put forward by \nOSHA, so he was aggressively attacked during the hearings--not \npersonally but on that issue relative to policy.\n\n  Well, that is OK. You can disagree with him on that policy point, but \nyou have to acknowledge that on that policy point he agreed with the \nmajority of the Congress. The Congress found the regulation that was \npromulgated by OSHA to be too officious, bureaucratic, \ncounterproductive, and we--the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives--threw the regulation out.\n  In my experience in the Congress, that has only occurred once or \ntwice. We as a Congress actually rejected the regulation of OSHA on the \nissue of ergonomics, confirming the arguments that the younger Mr. \nScalia had made on that issue.\n  So it is pretty hard to come to the floor with a straight face and \nsay this man should not be confirmed as Solicitor of the Department of \nLabor because he took a position on ergonomics, when that position was \nconsistent with the position taken by the Congress earlier this year.\n  No, regrettably, the younger Scalia is being held hostage because of \nattitudes toward the elder Scalia. That isn't the way we should govern. \nWe should not prejudice an individual because of their race, their \nethnic background, their gender, and we certainly should not prejudice \nan individual because they happen to be the son of an\n\n[[Page S12130]]\n\nindividual who some people do not agree with and who feel antipathy \ntowards.\n  Eugene Scalia's nomination should be brought to the floor of this \nSenate. If people want to vote against him, that is their right. Then \nif he is defeated on the floor of the Senate, so be it. But let's not \nshuttle him off and hold him hostage to try to make a point to his \nfather. That is not right and that is what is being done by the \nleadership of this Senate at this time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/29/senate-section/article/S12130-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues for their \nunderstanding for my State and my city of New York over the last 2 \nmonths. I particularly thank the majority leader, the Senator from \nSouth Dakota; the majority whip, the Senator from Nevada; the Senator \nfrom Montana, Mr. Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee; and the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd; as well as all \nof our Senate colleagues for being there for New York in its greatest \nhour of need.\n  I spoke with the mayor of New York this morning, and we were \ncommenting to one another about what amazing fortitude New Yorkers \nhave. The spirits are high. The desire grows to stay the course and \nrebuild our city and make it greater than ever before. The desire of \nNew Yorkers to stay in New York, if one looks at the poll numbers, is \nhigher than ever before. The number of people when asked if they expect \nto be living in New York 5 years from now increased since September 11.\n  We know all about the bravery of the firefighters and the police \nofficers and the rescue workers, but maybe we do not know enough about \nthe fortitude and the love of the city had by so many in New York City \nand the metropolitan area of New York have. They are brave people.\n  As New Yorkers, we come from all over the globe. New York takes us \nand shapes us and makes us into Americans, and we are proud of that. We \nnow know more than ever that America is proud of that as well.\n  That is the good news. The good news is the fortitude, the strength, \nthe courage, and the good grace of the people of New York. The bad news \nis that despite our confidence that our nightmare will soon end, we are \nin trouble. Two months after the attack, the economic damage to our \ncity is becoming increasingly apparent and has been documented in \npublication after publication. The damage is enormous.\n  Let me give some statistics. Our streets are littered with 37 miles \nof high-voltage electricity lines that are but one prankster away from \nshutting off power to our Nation's financial center. Over 40 percent of \nthe lower Manhattan subway infrastructure has been destroyed, adding \nhours to the daily commute of 375,000 people who work in New York City. \nAll our major river crossings: The Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queensboro \nBridges, the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, have been and continue to be \nsubject to nightmarish traffic jams because of security requirements.\n  Two weeks ago, they were all shut down again because of the crash of \nflight 587. Twenty-five million square feet of commercial office space \nwas destroyed or heavily damaged. The amount destroyed--nearly 20 \nmillion square feet--surpasses the entire office space inventory of \nlarge, important cities, such as Miami and Atlanta. Over 125,000 jobs \nhave at least temporarily vanished from the area and the city estimates \nthat 30,000 of those jobs, at a minimum, are gone for good.\n\n  Noxious fumes continue to emanate from the hole at the World Trade \nCenter, creating great concern among the workers and residents for \ntheir personal health. There is even a possibility that the Hudson \nRiver retaining wall, which is underground and stops the Hudson from \nwashing in, will break and flood the area as the debris is removed.\n  Insurance companies are another problem--problems come from all \nsides--demanding 100 percent increases from companies doing business in \nNew York simply because they are located in a confirmed terrorist \ntarget zone. Those offers are some of the better ones. There are many \ninsurance companies offering no insurance at all.\n  Mayor Guiliani has had to cut $1 billion from the city budget just to \nprevent an immediate fiscal meltdown at a time when the need for city \nservices is at an all-time high, and Mayor-elect Bloomberg will have to \ncut much more than that and begin thinking about it the day he enters \noffice because the city is staring at a $3 billion deficit next year as \na direct result of this crisis.\n  Governor Pataki has it even worse. The State's revenue loss is \nprojected at $9 to $12 billion. The comptroller of the city of New York \nplaces the economic loss to the city and its businesses at $105 billion \nover the next couple of years.\n  We were so proud as our city grew and grew and grew and added over \n800,000 people in the last decade. It was a record. But now we have had \nthe first decline in the city gross product in over 9 years.\n  In short, we have taken a hit for the Nation. None of the problems I \ndescribe was of the making of New Yorkers. None of these problems was \nthe result of a single thing New York did or didn't do. And so we find \nourselves in extremely difficult times.\n  Now, with Chairman Byrd and Senator Daschle at the helm and broad \nsupport of Senate colleagues, I believe we will ultimately get the \ndisaster aid needed to rebuild our damaged and destroyed \ninfrastructure. That is coming through. Some Members would like it to \ncome through more quickly, but it is coming. We don't have much of a \ndispute about that.\n  We thank everybody. Senator Clinton and I are extremely grateful to \nall of our colleagues for the support they have shown New Yorkers.\n  What we are here to talk about today is the need for tax provisions \nfor New York to deal with the kind of economic damage I have mentioned. \nAs we all know, the FEMA dollars go to the Governor, as they have for \ndisaster after disaster. They go to replace the subway lines and \nstreets that were destroyed. They go to pay for the cleaning up of the \nrefuse. They deal with the firefighters and the police officers and \ntheir overtime. But none of that will give one iota of help to keep the \nbusinesses in New York or get the jobs growing to where they were.\n  Senator Clinton and I put together an economic stimulus package. We \nhad great help from the Finance Committee, Chairman Baucus and members \nof the Finance Committee, and help from the staff, led by Russ \nSullivan. We were extremely grateful when it was included in our \nstimulus package that we presented.\n  The reason I take the floor today, it appears there is a good chance \nwe will\n\n[[Page S12131]]\n\nhave a stimulus package. I remind my colleagues how much we need that \npart of the package that went for New York to remain in the package. \nThe provisions in it are designed to counter the uncertainty and fear \nwe believe may lead many companies to walk away from us. We believe if \nwe do not do it now, it will be too late.\n\n  Company after company, the large ones, the small ones, are making \ntheir decisions over the next few months as to whether they stay in \nlower Manhattan and in New York City or whether they leave. Once they \ndecide to leave, we can be as generous as we want, but come next spring \nit won't do any good. Their leases will have been signed, their \ndecisions will have been made.\n  There is urgency to do this now. It is not related to the FEMA \nspending or even the extra help in some of the appropriations measures \nthat we have asked of the Appropriations Committee. Senator Byrd has \nbeen extremely generous to Senator Clinton and myself. We have been in \nconstant conversation with him. But this relates to tax cuts. This \nrelates to keeping the businesses in New York lest the financial \ncenter--not just of New York but of America--dissipates. That would be \na real blow to our country--not just our city but our country--because \nso much of the capital to build the factories and the homes and so much \nof the capital to start new businesses comes from the financial center \nlocated in downtown New York. It is the greatest capital market in the \nworld.\n  Whether you live in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Buffalo, Albany, or even if \nyou live in Omaha, Seattle or Wilmington, you have a real interest in \nseeing that financial center remain as strong as it has been. It has \nhelped create the unprecedented prosperity we have seen.\n  The need to act is now. The amount of money we are asking for in a \nhuge budget is modest. We hear, as we talk about the stimulus package, \nof many other needs. We are aware of them and want to be helpful, too. \nMaybe I am a bit parochial, but I can't think of a better need than \nthis one--a need for New York, a need for America.\n  Let me outline to my colleagues--and I know many are familiar with \nthis--the three complimentary provisions included in the stimulus \npackage. There is $4,800 for an employee tax credit to companies that \nretain jobs and to not abandon New York in the area immediately around \nground zero.\n  There is the creation of special private activity bonds to lower the \ncost of redevelopment projects.\n  There is a provision that would permit companies that replace \nequipment destroyed in the World Trade Center bombing to take a special \ndeduction if they replace that property in New York, minus the \ninsurance costs they will get back. We all know an insurance company \nwill give $500 for a 2-year-old computer and you have to replace the \ncomputer with $1,000 in costs; the difference would be deductible.\n  There is a one-time residential tax credit designed to encourage \nresidents in Lower Manhattan to continue to live there. They are all \nafraid. Many visited Senator Clinton and myself here yesterday. They \nare scared. They are worried. These are their homes. They don't know if \nthey should stay. This will be an incentive for them to stay and \novercome the fear and disruption that has been visited upon their \nlives.\n  And there will be permission for New York municipal bond issuers and \nhospitals to issue advance additional refunding to help enable them to \nrefinance their debt service.\n  Not a single aspect of the provision is designed to take business \nfrom another part of the country. We want to just keep what we had, \nwhat bin Laden and al-Qaida tried to take away from us.\n  The provisions are designed very carefully. We worked closely with \nboth the business and labor communities. They are designed very \ncarefully to do just enough--not more, not overly generous but just \nenough--to keep the businesses in New York.\n  I am making a humble plea. There are many, many needs and many, many \nconflicts embodied in the stimulus package. We need your help. I have \ntried in my few years as Senator to be generous.\n  I have tried in my years here to respond when other areas of the \ncountry needed help. I did not do it thinking New York would. We do not \nhave the kinds of natural disasters we are accustomed to seeing in many \nother parts of the country. But when I heard about and read about the \nearthquake in California, the hurricane in Florida, the floods in North \nDakota and North Carolina, I knew they needed help. Now, unexpectedly \nbut in a devastating way, we were hit by, not a natural disaster but \none very real. We need your help.\n  I thank Chairman Baucus. These provisions for New York he championed, \nnot because of politics but because it was the right thing. He has done \nthe right thing. I believe the Nation, with his stimulus bill which \nwill also extend unemployment and COBRA to hard-working Americans, is \nthe right thing to do. I thank Senator Daschle who has stood with us \nthrough thick and thin. Among all my colleagues I have hardly heard a \nword of dissent. There was tremendous sympathy.\n  At our Thanksgiving table this year, we closed our eyes and had some \nmoments of silence as we thought of the thousands and thousands of New \nYork families who, that same day, were having their Thanksgiving \ndinners--their turkeys and stuffing and corn bread--but at whose tables \nthere was an empty seat. Someone wasn't there who had been there for \nall the previous Thanksgivings. That person will never come back. Those \nfamilies' hearts will remain broken for the rest of their lives.\n  We remember them. We think of them. But when we talk to the families \nwho have survived, they tell us: Rebuild New York. Don't let those \ndeaths be in vain. Don't let Mr. bin Laden and his evil band succeed in \npermanently hurting our country and our city. This is a mission. It is \na mission to rebuild New York. It is a mission to rededicate ourselves, \nin the name of so many in the New York metropolitan area who lost their \nlives. We hope and we pray that all of you will join us in this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/29/senate-section/article/S12131-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12131-S12132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RAILROAD RETIREMENT REFORM\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nRailroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001.\n  For years, our Nation's railroad workers have played a vital role in \nmoving commerce and passengers around this country, and it is my belief \nand hope that America will benefit from their hard work for years to \ncome.\n  This bill is designed to strengthen the Railroad Retirement System \nand ensure that these men and women who have helped build, run, and \nmaintain our railroads, have adequate resources to care for themselves \nand their families when they finally complete their years of hard \nlabor.\n  The current system, which has been around for over 65 years, \ncurrently serves more than 690,000 retirees and their family members, \nand more than 245,00 active employees.\n  Because the Railroad Retirement System, unlike other industry pension \nplans, is funded by payroll taxes on employees, it is easy to see why \nthis program, that pays retirement benefits to almost three times as \nmany people as there are paying for those benefits, is in desperate \nneed of reform.\n  Most Americans are concerned about the future of Social Security for \nsimilar reasons--because the number of retirees in America will greatly \nincrease in the coming years as baby boomers retire. Well, the problem \nfor Railroad Retirement is here and now, and so is the right time for a \ncommonsense solution.\n  Railroad Retirement has always been restricted to investing only in \ngovernment securities, and while this may have been a good policy 65 \nyears ago, it does not make sense in today's economy.\n  Because of this policy, the system's annual average investment return \nhas been far lower than that of private multiemployer pension plans.\n  This bill would solve that problem by allowing Railroad Retirement to \nbe operated more like a private pension plan, by establishing a private \ntrust in which assets of the system can be invested in various ways, \nincluding private securities.\n  Moreover, the legislation would shift greater responsibility to the \nrailroad\n\n[[Page S12132]]\n\nindustry, and away from the government, to ensure adequate funding of \nthe system.\n  Better financing means enhanced returns to provide for an improved \nbenefit structure for Railroad Retirement beneficiaries.\n  These benefits would include a lowering of the incredibly high \npayroll taxes currently paid by railroad workers and employers; a \nlowering of the retirement age for those with 30 years of service to \nage 60; reducing the vesting period in the system from 10 years to 5; \nand improving the benefits paid to widows and widowers.\n  All of these improved benefits are desirable reforms, and they can be \nachieved without compromising the solvency of the system, which the \nRailroad Retirement Board's actuary has projected out to 75 years under \nthis legislation.\n  Because this legislation is the right solution at the right time, it \nhas received overwhelming bipartisan support in both Houses of \nCongress.\n  Last year, when the bill was first introduced, it was approved on the \nfloor of the House by a vote of 391-25, and had the support of 80 \nMembers in the Senate. However, after it was reported favorably by the \nFinance Committee, it never made it to the Senate floor.\n  After its reintroduction in the current Congress, the bill has again \nbeen approved by a landslide on the floor of the House, and now awaits \naction here in the Senate, where it has enjoyed the support of 74 \ncosponsors.\n  I urge your continued support of this legislation, and speedy passage \nof the reform that railroad workers and their families throughout this \ncountry so badly deserve.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are hopefully working down to the end \nof this session. We have completed most of those things that we need to \ndo. We need now to focus on those remaining items that I think are \nimperative for us to complete. Obviously, there are lots of things that \ncould be done. The fact is, we have spent an extraordinary amount of \nmoney. We are going to exceed our budget with the budget activities \nand, of course, about $50 billion in addition to that. I agree that it \nshould indeed be spent for those things. We are in an emergency \nsituation with the terrorists. We are in an emergency situation with \nthe economy.\n  The two things I believe we have to do are, No. 1, finish our \nappropriations. We are moving along. The House passed one of the most \ndifficult bills yesterday. We will now undertake to do Defense \nappropriations. There are about four more with which we need to deal.\n  Then we need to finish a stimulus package. The President has called \nupon the Senate to pass a responsible economic stimulus bill.\n  It is difficult to identify what will have a short-term impact on the \neconomy. Our economy is much lower than we would like. Indeed, as has \nbeen said, we are in a recession. But we need to do something that will \nhave some impact.\n  The President has suggested a package that would extend unemployment \nbenefits for 13 weeks for Americans who lost their jobs as a result of \nthe terrorist attacks; making $11 billion available to low-income \npeople to obtain health insurance in a manner such that the system \nwould not become mandatory in the future; $3 billion in special energy \nemergency grants to help displaced workers. That has to do with health \ncare coverage.\n\n  Then, of course, the other portion has to do with helping create \njobs, which, after all, is really the result we would like. We would \nlike to help people without jobs. Most importantly, we provide \nencouragement to companies and corporations by accelerating \ndepreciation so they will invest in new material; partial expensing to \nencourage the purchasing of new equipment; and also have payments for \nlow-income workers and get the money in their hands so we can see \nincreased purchasing.\n  Those are things on which I hope we focus. I know we are talking \nabout agriculture. We are talking about railroad retirement. They need \nto be completed. But there is a question of whether they need to be \ncompleted now with this emergency. We really need to evaluate the \nmoney. We have already made available $12 billion in new spending for \nmany of the things we talked about. The President and the \nadministration determine where it will go.\n  I am hopeful that we can focus in the relatively short time we have \nleft. I am pleased that we seem to be making progress in terms of the \neconomic stimulus. The bill that came out of the committee was not a \nbipartisan bill. We did not work on it from both sides. Now we have a \nHouse bill that is somewhat different. We have a Democratic bill that \nis somewhat different. The President's bill is somewhat different. Of \ncourse, we need to find a reasonable agreement among those groups to \ncome up with something that works. I certainly encourage that we do \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to make my remarks while seated at my desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for some time I have felt inclined to \ndiscuss in the Senate a matter for the Record and of importance to the \npeople living in the far western counties of North Carolina and in the \nbeautiful mountains adjacent to the Tennessee border.\n  The matter involved is the federal government's finally fulfilling \nafter a fashion a commitment made in 1943 in writing by the U.S. \nGovernment to the citizens of Swain County. The federal government \nproposed to build a road along the north shore of Fontana Lake which \nwas created in World War II to provide power to the TVA. This written \ncommitment was made to citizens who voluntarily gave up their homes to \nsupport the U.S.'s World War II defense efforts.\n  The federal government has not yet fulfilled its commitment, and that \nhas caused a great deal of resentment and mistrust of the government \namong the citizens of Swain County and other surrounding counties on \nthe North Carolina side of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n  These citizens understandably believe that the federal government \nshould now live up to its written commitment made during World War II \nbecause these people gave up their homes in order that Fontana Lake \ncould be built so that power could be generated by TVA.\n  But, there has been a curious development. A small group of citizens \nin Swain County now proposes to ask that the federal government buy \nthem out, thereby voiding that federal government commitment made in \n1943. They presented the proposal that they be bought out to the Swain \nCounty Commissioners, and, praise the Lord, the commissioners rejected \nthis suggestion.\n\n  So as a result of the $16 million appropriation in the fiscal year \n2001 Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations \nBill, this project has at long last begun to move. The National Park \nService and the Federal Highway Administration have restarted this \nprocess to complete that road as promised, in writing, in 1943 to the \ncitizens of Swain County and western North Carolina.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter in hand, along with the text of the \nresolution adopted by the Swain County Commissioners which expresses \ntheir thanks for the $16 million that provided for continued road \nconstruction and improvements that were included in the fiscal year \n2001 Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill.\n\n[[Page S12133]]\n\n  The commissioners of Swain County want that road completed. The \npeople of Swain County want that road completed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned letter \nand resolution be printed in the Record, following which I shall resume \nmy remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 November 9, 2001.\n     Jesse Helms,\n     Dirksen Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Senator Jesse Helms: I again take this opportunity to thank \n     you for the continued support you have showed for projects in \n     Swain County.\n       Attached is a statement, which you should have received \n     earlier, thanking you for the work you have done on behalf of \n     Swain County and the North Shore Road.\n           Sincerely Yours,\n                                                      Jim Douthit,\n     Chairman, Swain County Commissioners.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  Swain County Board of Commissioners\n\n\n Statement regarding the appropriation of $16M for construction of and \n                  improvements to the North Shore Road\n\n       The Swain County Board of Commissioners would like to thank \n     Senator Jesse Helms, Congressman Charles Taylor, and \n     President Bill Clinton for making available from the Highway \n     Trust Fund for Swain County 16 million dollars for \n     construction of and improvements to the North Shore Road in \n     Swain County North Carolina.\n       With the completion of this road, the federal government \n     will have fulfilled their contract with Swain County known as \n     the 1943 Agreement, then trust can be restored between Swain \n     County and the federal government. We feel this appropriation \n     will go a long way in helping Swain County.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, roads in national parks are vital pieces of \neconomic infrastructure that fuel the engines of economic growth. In \nfact, the National Park Service itself recognizes as much on its Web \nsite. Let me quote: ``Recreation travel accounts for 20 percent of \ntravel in the United States. Park roads are a vital part of America's \ntransportation network, providing economic opportunity and growth in \nrural regions of the country. In addition to the park access, motor \ntourism has created viable gateway communities en route. In some areas \nentire economies are based on park road access. Examples include \ncommunities near Yellowstone, Glacier, and Great Smoky Mountains \nNational Parks, and the Blue Ridge Parkway.''\n  Why on Earth, then, are these economic benefits denied to the people \nliving in the counties on the North Carolina side of the Great Smoky \nMountains National Park? I will tell you why. The Department of the \nInterior and the National Park Service have been held hostage by self-\nproclaimed environmentalists and their sympathizers in the Interior \nDepartment who are horrified, obviously, by their pretended \napprehension that environmental Armageddon will somehow result from the \nconstruction of a simple ``two-lane dustless road,'' as specifically \ncalled for in the 1943 agreement, signed by the Federal Government.\n  Mind you, this would be a Blue Ridge Parkway-type road allowing for \ngreater access on the North Carolina side of the park just as long ago \noccurred on the State of Tennessee side a few miles west.\n  Additionally, according to the National Park Service statistics, \nthere are 5,000 miles of paved roads and 3,000 miles of unpaved roads \nin the National Park System of this country. My question is, can \nanybody seriously suggest that 30 more miles will cause an \nenvironmental Armageddon? The thought is laughable. Of course not. But \nthat is the ringing cry of these professional environmentalists.\n  In fact, the Federal Government began building the road back in 1963, \nand did build 2\\1/2\\ miles of it. In 1965, they built another 2.1 \nmiles. Then in 1969, they built an additional mile, plus a 1,200-foot-\nlong tunnel.\n  That was when, Mr. President, the self-appointed environmentalists \ncreated an uproar and forbade the Federal Government from going \nfurther, which has caused, by the way, economic problems for the four \nNorth Carolina counties surrounding the park that I am talking about.\n  Road engineering has improved enormously since that most recent \nsection was built in 1969. Many more improved methods are now available \nto address the concerns thrown up by these self-appointed environmental \nopponents of progress.\n  Let me make it clear, I have no problem with our Tennessee neighbors \nwho are ably represented by Senators Frist and Thompson, but I am \nobliged, as a Senator from North Carolina, to emphasize some meaningful \nand relevant statistics of the National Park Service.\n  In the 2000 report, which has the most recent statistics available, \nthe Park Service stated that 4,477,357 visitors came to the North \nCarolina side of the park, while 5,698,455 visitors came to the \nTennessee side of the park. Of course, for anybody who wants to figure \nit out, it is a difference of 1,221,098 visitors.\n  Additionally, according to the latest available retail sales per \ncapita figures from the U.S. Census Bureau, the four Tennessee counties \nsurrounding the park have averaged $9,431.25, but the average for the \nfour North Carolina counties that need that road for more tourists to \ncome there have averaged $7,964.00, a difference of $1,467.25, if you \nwant to get down to the penny.\n  The North Carolina State average is $9,740.00 per capita, and the \nTennessee State average is $9,448.00 per capita. The four Tennessee \ncounties surrounding the park averaged just $16.75 under the Tennessee \nState average. The four North Carolina counties, on the other hand--the \nfour counties of which we are talking about in terms of building this \nroad along the north shore of Fontana Lake--come in $1,776.00 under the \nNorth Carolina average.\n  Now then, these figures are among countless indications of the \ninequities between the North Carolina side and the Tennessee side of \nthe Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n  Let me assure the Administration of this: I have met with the \ndistinguished Director of the National Park Service, Fran Mianella and \nshe is a very pleasant lady--to let her know that this is a significant \nissue with citizens of western North Carolina who have been neglected.\n  I am hopeful she and Secretary Norton will give this matter their \nhighest priorities and will continue to move this project well away \nfrom those who have for too long been holding it hostage.\n  I will continue my opposition to a Federal buyout of the Federal \nGovernment's commitment in 1943 to the citizens of Swain County and \nwestern North Carolina. I commend the commissioners of Swain County for \nstanding flatfooted against it as well.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have today written a letter to the \nAttorney General and to the head of the Office of Management and Budget \nexpressing my great concern over regulations that should now have been \nin place as a result of a law that was signed by the President last \nDecember. That law would have required regulations to be published by \nthe Justice Department in July. No such regulations have been \npublished.\n  Here is the background of this issue. I, along with my colleague, \nthen-Senator John Ashcroft, authored legislation that became law, when \nsigned by the President, dealing with the transportation of violent \ncriminals around this country. Private companies have been contracted \nby State and local governments to transport prisoners around America \nfrom one prison and one location to another.\n  These private companies were transporting violent criminals, and all \ntoo often those criminals were walking away. We decided the companies \nthat were hauling violent offenders were not adhering to standards or \nregulations and there should be some regulations. The President signed \na bill, authored by myself and then-Senator Ashcroft,\n\n[[Page S12134]]\n\nestablishing regulations with respect to private companies that are \ntransporting violent prisoners.\n  The law is called Gina's bill. It is named for an 11-year-old girl in \nFargo, ND, who was murdered brutally by a man named Kyle Bell. Kyle \nBell was being sent to a prison in Oregon after being convicted of \nfirst-degree murder, being transported by a private company in a bus. \nThey stopped for gas. One guard was asleep; the other apparently went \nin to get a cheeseburger. The other guard was filling the bus with \ngasoline. Kyle Bell slipped out the top vent of the bus, walked in \nstreet clothes into a parking lot of a shopping center and was gone for \n3 months. They found him. He is now in prison.\n\n  This has happened all too often: Violent offenders, including \nconvicted murders, walking away from private companies that are \ntransporting them. There should have been regulations in place in July \nof this year that establish how these private companies are \ntransporting violent criminals. As for me, I don't believe any State or \nlocal government should ever contract with a private company to turn \nover a murderer to be transported somewhere. Law enforcement officials \nought to transport convicted murderers.\n  As long as some State and local governments are using private \ncompanies for that transport, those private companies ought to be \nsubject to regulation as is required by the law signed by the President \nin December, regulations such as what kind of restraints are used, what \ncolor clothing is required to be worn by the violent offender being \ntransported, the training of the guards, and so forth.\n  Since July, when the regulation should have been in effect, in \nWisconsin a private company was hauling a violent criminal and that \nviolent criminal escaped and stabbed a law enforcement officer in the \nneck. Down South, a private company was transporting a violent \noffender. The violent offender escaped and went on a bank robbing \nspree.\n  When we passed the law, I told the story of a retired sheriff and his \nwife showing up at a prison to pick up five convicted murderers with a \nminivan. The warden said: You have to be kidding; you and your wife are \nhere to pick up five convicted murderers to transport them?\n  He was not kidding. They put them in the minivan. Those five \nconvicted murderers escaped, of course. That is why we wrote the law \nand why the President signed it. That is why in July the Justice \nDepartment had a responsibility to put the regulations in place. To \ndate, nearly 5 months later, those regulations do not exist.\n  I have written to the Attorney General and the Office of Management \nand Budget to say lives are at stake. The public safety is at stake. \nGet this done and get it done now.\n  This law, called Gina's bill, named after this wonderful 11-year-old \ngirl who was brutally murdered by Kyle Bell, is a law designed to keep \nviolent offenders behind bars, keep them in the arms of law enforcement \nofficials, and make certain if they are transported by those other than \nlaw enforcement officials, they are transported safely.\n  I don't want any American family to drive to a gas pump somewhere and \nhave a minivan drive up next to them with a retired law enforcement \nofficer and his brother-in-law calling themselves a transport company \nhauling three murderers in the back seat and not having the basic \nsafety standards in place to make sure that transportation is safe. I \ndon't want any family to come up to a gas station and have that \nsituation next to them and put them at risk. That is why we wrote this \nbill. That is why the President signed it into law.\n  I hope my letter to the Attorney General and the Office of Management \nand Budget will stimulate them to do what they should have done in the \nmonth of July. I know there are reasons that bureaucracies act in a \nslow way and drag their feet from time to time. There is no good reason \nfor this to have happened. I ask the Attorney General for his \ncooperation. I ask the head of the Office of Management and Budget to \ncooperate. Get this done. The Congress required you to do it after 180 \ndays. That was July. This is December. It should have been done 5 \nmonths ago.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the recess \nbe postponed for 10 minutes, and that the Senate stand in recess \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/29/senate-section/article/S12134-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12134-S12135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ELECTION REFORM\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor for a \nmoment because I feel the need to talk about a lot of unfinished \nbusiness, as we consider what remains for the balance of the time we \nhave here. We will be going into our caucus shortly.\n  This morning, prior to the opening of our session, I held my daily \nnews conference and made mention of the fact that among those issues \nthat are of greatest importance to us is the issue of election reform. \nI don't know of another bill that is pending in this Congress that has \nthe unanimous support of our caucus. It is rare that one ever sees all \nof the members of our Caucus--51 in this case--as cosponsors of a bill. \nBut election reform has that distinction. All 51 of our caucus members \nhave endorsed the bill introduced by Senator Dodd earlier this year.\n  The reason that they have endorsed that bill unanimously is because \nof the extraordinary degree of concern that exists within our caucus \nabout the need for election reform as quickly as possible. Because of \nthe tragedy of September 11, and the crisis of being at war, we haven't \nhad the opportunity to focus on the many, many problems associated with \nthe last presidential election--not just in Florida, but across the \ncountry.\n  The studies and the reports that have been issued have made the \nproblems quite clear: outdated and unreliable technology, confusing \nballots, language barriers, lack of voter education, lack of poll \nworker training, and inaccurate voting lists that prevented \nlegitimately registered voters from casting ballots. All of those \nconcerns were of such gravity and magnitude that 6 million voters \nacross the country were disenfranchised.\n  So it probably should not surprise anybody that almost immediately \nfollowing the beginning of this session of Congress, Senator Dodd went \nto work as chairman of the Rules Committee. He worked with Members on \nboth sides of the aisle in both the House and the Senate to try to \nrespond to the growing awareness of how serious the situation really \nis: how problematic, how incredibly unfair, how undemocratic were the \nresults reflected in the degree of difficulty with our election \nprocesses--while we should proclaim our democracy with each and every \nelection. So as a result of just a tremendous amount of work, Senator \nDodd and members of the Rules Committee produced a bill that, as I \nsaid, generated 51 cosponsors.\n  I simply wanted to come to the floor this afternoon to say this: If \nbetween now and the end of this session, Senator Dodd is able to reach \nan agreement with our Republican colleagues on a bill that we can bring \nto the floor to address all of these issues, these serious concerns, it \nis my intention to bring it to the floor. If somehow that is not \npossible and the negotiations continue, and we are able to reach an \nagreement prior to the next session of Congress, one of the very first \npieces of legislation I expect to bring up will be election reform. If \nat any time during the coming year that agreement can be reached, my \nintention will be to bring the agreement to the Senate floor very \nquickly. But I will say this: Even absent an agreement, we will come to \nthe floor and we will have a debate about election reform. We will make \na comprehensive proposal to deal with this issue. We have no choice. It \nwill be part of the agenda of the second session of the 107th Congress.\n\n  I simply wanted to come to the floor to emphasize that and relate my \nconcern, and the concern of a lot of members of our caucus, about the \nimportance of this issue, and reiterate our\n\n[[Page S12135]]\n\ndetermination to deal with it in this Congress. We cannot simply sit \nidly by and watch 6 million people--maybe more next time--as they are \ndisenfranchised when they attempt to exercise their constitutional \nright to vote and participate in our political process.\n  I appreciate the attention of my colleagues on this issue, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate the comments of \nthe distinguished majority leader on this issue. From the very \nbeginning, he has been a very strong and vocal advocate of this body \nand the Congress of the United States in fashioning a piece of \nlegislation that would address not just the events of last year. As the \nmajority leader properly points out, this was not a one-time event in \none jurisdiction. In the consistent reports, whether by MIT, CalTech, \nor the General Accounting Office, and surveys done by the media, that \nanalyzed the election last year in Florida, all of these organizations \nthat analyzed it, including the Carter Commission, the story has \nultimately been about who wins or loses. That has been the headline.\n  The real story is about the pathetic and tragic situation of our \nelectoral system of this country. It didn't happen in one event and in \none State. It is in all 50 States--some worse than others--and has been \ngoing on for years.\n  So those of us who have been involved in this issue over the last \nseveral months, my colleague from New York, Senator Schumer, my \ncolleague from New Jersey, Senator Torricelli, members of the Rules \nCommittee, have been stalwarts in this effort going back to the \nearliest days in January, cosponsoring legislation, reaching out, \ntrying to fashion some proposals that would make the Federal Government \na true partner with our States and localities in trying to correct a \nwrong that is in desperate need of being addressed.\n  Senator McConnell of Kentucky is the ranking member of the Rules \nCommittee, as the majority leader knows. He has a deep interest in this \nsubject matter. I want the majority leader to know that Senator \nMcConnell and his staff--Senator Kit Bond of Missouri and his staff--\nbrings a separate set of issues that he is particularly worried about, \nthe issue of fraud. We have been working with Senator Schumer's staff, \nour staff. There have been serious negotiations, I say to the leader, \nover the last number of weeks, actually going back even further than \nthat, but most intensely in the last few weeks. We have not yet arrived \nat a product we can present to this body that is a bipartisan proposal.\n  I will let Senator Schumer speak for himself, but it is my fervent \ndesire, I say to the leader and to my friends on the other side--\nSenator McConnell and Senator Bond, obviously, they do not need me to \nspeak for them, but I know it is their desire as well to fashion \nlegislation of which all of us can be proud.\n  I know the events of September 11 have obviously taken over the \nagenda and debate. It is hard to imagine a year ago what we were in the \nmiddle of. We were in the middle of one of the worst debacles in terms \nof a national election in the history of the United States, and it was \nnot just about Florida. It was in almost every jurisdiction. In my \nState alone, we have not bought a new voting machine in 26 years, and \nthe company that made them no longer exists. We had an election in one \nof my communities in Connecticut a few weeks ago where the incumbent \nofficeholder did not receive a single vote in his own hometown because \nthe machines did not record them, which shows us we can go anywhere we \nwant and we will find this system is in need of work.\n  I say to the leader I appreciate immensely his comments. We are \npretty close to getting an agreement. I hope we can. I also take to \nheart what he has said, that we have been patient in trying to work \nthis out. My hope is we can come to the Senate with a bill that \ninvolves ideas and thoughts that we can all live with that will address \nthe problems. I also appreciate his comments that if that is not \npossible we will come to the Senate with a bill to debate this issue \nand bring people to the table. We cannot go on and not address this \nissue.\n  The majority leader has said it far more eloquently than I can. It \nwould be a travesty of significant proportions if this Congress were to \nconvene and adjourn in the wake of what happened in the election of \n2000 in this country and not step up to the plate and offer the kind of \nassistance our jurisdictions so desperately need. For those reasons, I \nthank the leader for his comments, and I yield to my colleague from New \nYork.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are out of time under the unanimous \nconsent agreement. I ask unanimous consent that we not enter into \nrecess until we have accommodated the remarks of the Senator from New \nYork and the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will be very brief because I know we \nhave other business to do. I thank the majority leader, who I know has \nto get over to the Democratic caucus, for his wonderful leadership on \nso many issues. This is a man who believes strongly in so many things, \nincluding the right to vote. I say to the majority leader, Senator Dodd \nhas done a superb job. He has had the patience of Job and the \npersistence of whatever Biblical character was very persistent.\n  We are all proud of the job he has done. His leadership in bringing \nup this issue as soon as we can come up with a compromise, or next year \nif, God forbid, we cannot, is vital to America.\n  I wish to add one point, aside from my thanks to the Senator from \nConnecticut, our chairman of the Rules Committee, for doing such a \ngreat job on this. I have been proud to be working with him. My point \nis this: He made an excellent point, that we almost have forgotten \nabout, the wrenching agony we all went through, whatever party, a year \nago last November. There is one point that, if anything, September 11 \nshould increase our ardor and our fervor to bring forward a good bill, \nhopefully a bipartisan bill. The terrorists hate our right to vote. \nThey want a group of religious leaders controlling everything and not \nletting people make any determination.\n  The beauty of America is we can vote, and our job as Senators, our \njob as citizens, is to perfect that right so nothing stands in the way. \nUnfortunately, too much stands in the way. Usually not by design but, \nrather, because we have not paid attention. Malfeasance, we are going \nto correct that.\n  The Senator from Connecticut has taken on a great leadership role and \nbrought together Senator McConnell and Senator Bond and myself in hours \nand hours of painstaking meetings. We talked today. We are willing to \nmove in the direction necessary to get a bill. It is heartening to know \nwe will be voting and debating on this issue in this Congress, if not \nthis year, no matter what happens. I just pledge myself to the Senator \nfrom Connecticut to follow his leadership to continue those efforts \nbecause the issue of the right to vote, the ability to vote, the \nenfranchisement of all Americans, no matter how rich, poor, or of \nwhatever race, there is no higher duty.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank our colleague for his remarks. I \nnote again our staffs are working. I want these remarks to be seen as \nconstructive and positive. We appreciate immensely the work being \nconducted by my friend from Kentucky and my friend from Missouri and \ntheir staffs who have spent a lot of time on this issue. It has not \ngone smoothly. It has had its ups and downs. It has been a roller \ncoaster ride. I hope when the process is over, sooner rather than \nlater, we will present the Senate a bill for which they can be proud.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Senator Bond and Senator McConnell are not in the Chamber. \nI know their work with the Senator from Connecticut is dedicated to the \nend we all want to see in reform because there is an obsolescence to \nthe voting system that has to be addressed. I think that is without \nquestion. I guess my only frustration by the majority leader's comments \nwas earlier this week he talked about bringing a farm bill to the \nSenate. We now have a railroad retirement bill. We still have \nappropriations to do, and several conference reports coming out of \nthat, and we hope yet a stimulus package now\n\n[[Page S12136]]\n\nthat we know America truly is in a recession. We have known that for \nsome time, but it is now officially proclaimed.\n  Not in any way to lessen the importance of a debate over election \nreform, and that is important, I cannot yet quite understand how we get \nall of this done in time to get out for Christmas.\n  Before the Thanksgiving recess, I had offered Senator Boxer of \nCalifornia an opportunity to join with me--she from the Democratic \nside, I from the Republican side--to organize Christmas caroling for \nthe Senate so we could join together in unity, as we have for the last \nseveral weeks, and sing Christmas carols on the eve of Christmas.\n  I suggest if we are going to do election reform, if we are going to \ndo a stimulus package, if we are going to do a farm bill, and I add an \nenergy bill because I think right now energy is every bit as important \nto the American consumer as election reform is to the American voter, \nand let us see what else is on that schedule--oh, yes, I forgot, \nrailroad retirement reform--then it is going to be a merry little \nChristmas in Washington for all Senators who cannot make it out the \nnight before to their home States. My State is about 2,500 miles \nfurther away than the Senator from Connecticut. So I say to Senator \nDodd, have yourself a very merry little Christmas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/29/senate-section/article/S12136-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have just completed our caucus. I know \nthe Republicans were caucusing. I am not sure whether they have \ncompleted or not. I want to report to the Senate about our current \ncircumstances and what the schedule might be for the remainder of the \nweek.\n  Senator Lott and I have been discussing the current schedule and our \ncircumstances involving the railroad retirement bill. My hope is that \nwe can move to proceed to the bill sometime within the next hour. If \nthat is the case, it is my intention to file cloture on the bill at \nsome point this evening.\n  It is also my intention that we seek unanimous consent to vote on \ncloture on Monday. We will not be in session on Saturday, but we will \nbe on Monday. We will also entertain amendments. It is my understanding \nthat Senator Lott may be recognized to offer an amendment, and we will \nhave a debate on that amendment tomorrow and on Monday.\n  My expectation is that there will not be any votes tonight or \ntomorrow but that we will have votes on Monday at approximately 5 \no'clock.\n  Senator Murray reports to me that the Transportation conference \nreport has now been completed, and it is my hope that we can vote on \nthe Transportation conference report perhaps as early as Monday. If not \nMonday, then on Tuesday. My hope is that if we can achieve cloture on \nthe railroad retirement bill on Monday, we can bring debate on the bill \nto a close by Wednesday.\n  It is then my intention, as I have said on several occasions, to make \na motion to proceed to the farm bill. That is a must-pass piece of \nlegislation. It is my hope and expectation that we can complete our \nwork on that, maybe even as early as the end of next week.\n  I also note that we have made the decision over the course of the \nlast few hours, and in consultation with Senator Lott as well as our \ncaucus, that we will be in session and voting the week of December 10. \nThat has been an open question until now. But we have now made that \ndecision. Our expectation is we will be voting every day the week after \nnext. Senators ought to be on hand and prepared to vote all week. Of \ncourse, it may be that we will have to vote and be in session the week \nafter that. But clearly, for the next 2 weeks the Senate will be in \nsession and Senators need to be prepared to be on the floor and voting, \nto accommodate the remaining schedule we have for the remainder of this \nsession of Congress.\n  I also presented to the caucus what amounts to an informal agreement \non how we will proceed on the economic stimulus bill. I am pleased to \nreport that our caucus has agreed with the proposal that has been \npresented to me by the Speaker, as we consider how to proceed on the \neconomic stimulus bill. If we can reach a procedural agreement tonight, \nit is my expectation we can move to substantive negotiations on the \neconomic stimulus bill tomorrow morning. It is my hope we can work on \nit through the weekend, if that is possible, in order to try to \nexpedite our work on that bill and our efforts to reach some final \nagreement early next week.\n  The procedural agreement would call for consideration of the Senate \nFinance Committee bill, the House-passed economic stimulus bill, and \nother issues relating to those two bills. We do not exclusively limit \nour consideration of economic stimulus to those two vehicles. There are \na lot of other issues out there.\n  Senator Durbin in particular has expressed to the caucus on numerous \noccasions, and here on the floor, how important it is that we consider \na payroll tax holiday. That is an issue I have indicated I am \nparticularly interested in and intrigued with. I don't know whether or \nnot we have the ability to work it into the agreement. I know Senator \nDomenici has expressed an interest in the proposal, and Senator Lott \nhas noted his support for the proposal.\n  On our side, I don't think there has been any more ardent a \nsupporter, any more articulate an advocate of the so-called payroll tax \nholiday than the distinguished senior Senator from Illinois. I applaud \nhim and appreciate his tutorial to the caucus on the issue. He has been \nable to bring us to a better understanding of how it would work. I must \nsay I am indebted to him for all of his work in advocating that \nparticular issue.\n  But my point is that that, along with other vehicles, is going to be \nconsidered as we debate the issue in the hope that we can bring some \nresolution to our negotiations sometime early next week.\n  I see the Senator standing. I am happy to yield to him.\n  (Ms. STABENOW assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the leader for his kind remarks.\n  I hope that in the course of this economic recovery or economic \nstimulus package we can still stick to our principles that what we do \nwill help the economy, help the right people in the economy, and not do \nany long-term damage to the economy.\n  I think this proposed Federal payroll tax holiday, month-long \nholiday, meets the criteria. Frankly, it will go to workers across \nAmerica who draw a paycheck. They will see it on payday. It will come \nas quickly as we can pass the bill and enact it into law. That is money \nthat families can use for important purchases at the end of the year. \nIt is money that will go right into the economy and spark some growth \nand some activity that we really do need. It is also money that is \ngoing to go to workers, to those making incomes up to $80,000--$80,400 \nis the limit on the Federal payroll tax. So that really gives it to \nworking families.\n  In addition, it is focused to help small businesses because I think \nforgiving this tax for employers will say to small businesses, we are \ngoing to help you meet some of your expenses, whether they are health \ninsurance premiums or security needs, for your business after September \n11.\n  I have spoken to Senator Domenici. I thank my friend and the majority \nleader for his reference. I hope in the course of this conference, \nputting together the stimulus and recovery package, that this can be \nincluded.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Illinois. His comments make my \npoint. He is not only knowledgeable and articulate on the issue, but he \nhas certainly persisted in ensuring that this piece of legislation be \nconsidered along with many others.\n  Madam President, there are several key areas the Democratic caucus--\nand it goes to the point raised by the Senator from Illinois--will be \nadvocating.\n  First and foremost, I want to emphasize again because I feel the need \nevery\n\n[[Page S12137]]\n\ntime we talk about economic stimulus to ensure that people understand \nour real priority. Our priority, first and foremost, is to help the \n7.5, now almost 8 million workers who are unemployed.\n  In the last recession, we extended employment benefits four times. We \nhave to consider the fact that those weeks are running out now, for \nthose who are eligible for unemployment assistance, and we have to \nextend it again this time.\n  But we also have to understand that 54 percent of those who are \nunemployed today are not entitled to unemployment benefits, so we have \nto broaden eligibility. That is certainly going to be a key area for us \nas we attempt to negotiate some successful solution.\n  I would say as well that none of them can afford health benefits.\n  When you are given a few hundred dollars a month in unemployment, it \nis almost impossible--after you have paid the rent, after you have paid \nfor the groceries and the heating bills and other necessities of the \nfamily--to buy health insurance. We have to assist these unemployed \nworkers to pay for their health care during the time they are \nunemployed as well. That would be a priority for us.\n  We also will try to ensure that the issue of rebates is addressed for \nthose who pay a lot of payroll tax but were not entitled to an income-\ntax rebate last year. That ought to be on the table, and we will be \ntalking about that.\n  Business tax relief is also something we care a lot about. The \nexpensing for small business is something for which we are going to \nfight.\n  We are also going to try to assure additional depreciation for all \nbusinesses. The high-tech community said that is one of the most \nimportant issues for them. That will be a priority for us.\n  We have a number of very key issues we hope to present to our House \ncolleagues. But I also remind all of my colleagues that whatever we do \non the finance side--whatever we do on the revenue side--is only half \nof our interest. There is an economic stimulus involved here. It is our \ninterest to pass homeland security as well--Senator Byrd and I have \nbeen meeting all day long--as we consider the Byrd amendment to ensure \nthat homeland security is part of economic stimulus as we take up the \nDefense appropriations bill early next week.\n  Just as soon as that bill comes over to the Senate, we will take it \nup in committee. Senator Byrd will be offering his amendment on \nhomeland security. It is my hope we can get a bipartisan vote on that \nas well.\n  Nothing will stimulate this economy faster than raising people's \nconfidence about their own security. Nothing will help them more in \nthat regard than if we increase law enforcement assistance and provide \nways in which to ensure, on bioterrorism and all the other potential \npossibilities for attacks to our national security, we are more \nprepared than we are today.\n  That, too, is economic stimulus. That, too, is part of our plan. But \nthat will be running on a separate track. I want to emphasize how \ncritical we think that piece is, and how important it is to our long-\nterm resolution. They have to go hand in glove. They are going to run \nin tandem. We are going to be taking both of these sequentially, and \nboth are important to us.\n  I make that point, as we have made it before on the Senate floor.\n  I appreciate very much the interest of all Senators.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the majority leader if \nhe would entertain a question. I would like to inquire further of the \nmajority leader on this subject of the farm bill. I know it was the \nstated intent of the majority leader to attempt to offer a motion to \nproceed to the farm bill this week, perhaps midweek, late in the week, \nyesterday, or today. I know that was thwarted by the filibuster on the \nmotion to proceed to the bill that the Senate was prepared to debate. \nThe majority leader was unable to make the motion to proceed to the \nfarm bill. The filibuster we have had and cloture vote that was \nrequired now puts us into next week.\n  The majority leader indicated it is still his intention to file a \ncloture motion to proceed following the disposition of the bill that is \non the floor.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator is absolutely correct. I have \nnoted on several occasions my intention to move to the farm bill just \nas soon as we complete our work on the railroad retirement bill. It can \nbe next Monday or Tuesday. It can be whenever we finish. But we will \nmove to that bill next. We have to move to it.\n  These are must-pass pieces of legislation that have to be done. We \ncan take them in any order. But it is my intention to follow through \nwith the order that I have already announced, which is to complete our \nwork on the farm bill next.\n  We will have the Defense appropriations bill, the stimulus bill, and \nthe terrorist insurance bill. All of those have to be addressed.\n  But as I noted--I see the chairman of the Agriculture Committee in \nthe Chamber--the farm bill will be the next bill after the railroad \nretirement bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for just another \nmoment, that is a reassuring answer. I know how strongly the majority \nleader feels about the need to write a farm bill.\n  I observe that the House of Representatives has passed a farm bill. \nWe have now passed one out of the committee under the leadership of \nSenator Harkin. We need to get it to the floor of the Senate and then \nto conference.\n  The goal here is to get a bill on the President's desk for signature. \nThis is about family farmers hanging on by their financial fingertips \nand struggling to survive. It is our obligation to get this done.\n  I know it is not the fault of the majority leader. It was his full \nintention to bring that to the floor. It would have been on the floor \ntoday had we not faced the filibuster.\n  I wanted to, once again, ask. And I received the answer that I \nexpected I would. The majority leader is a strong advocate of family \nfarms and the need for a better farm program. I am deeply reassured by \nthat answer. I look forward to being here with the majority leader and \nwith the chairman of the Agriculture Committee fighting hard for a farm \nbill that will give family farmers in this country a decent chance to \nsurvive.\n  I thank the majority leader for his answers.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota and I have \nbeen through a lot of legislative battles over the years on rural \nissues. As he has noted, nothing is more important to rural America \nthan passage of this bill to allow us to go to conference first and to \nallow us to resolve the outstanding issues that remain between the \nHouse and the Senate membership on farm policy so we can get the bill \nto the President in time to provide all the assurance and confidence we \ncan to farmers and ranchers all over this country. We understand their \neconomic plight.\n  I note, as the Senator from North Dakota has on several occasions, \nthat last month--the month of October--we saw the single biggest 1-\nmonth depression in prices that we have seen in all the time the \nDepartment of Agriculture has been keeping records. We have never seen \nthe prices plummet as dramatically in 1 month as we saw them plummet \nlast month.\n  If there is no other reason to move forward on farm legislation than \nthat, it would be enough.\n  I am hopeful that people understand the urgency of the issue--the \nurgency of the issue of completing our work on the bill in time to go \nto conference, resolve our differences, and enact it into the law.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I congratulate the majority leader for \ndefining our schedule. It makes our lives more definite. I think we \nhave the schedule outlined. As I heard the majority leader say, we are \ngoing to be in session starting Monday with votes, perhaps over the \nnext weekend, and the next weekend until we finish.\n  Regarding the Agriculture bill--the farm bill--I think the Senator \nfrom Iowa has done an outstanding job not only in the product that came \nout of the committee but his willingness to take on issues that are so \nimportant. Everybody in America is affected by this farm bill. The \nconservation provisions in this bill are the best we have ever had, and \nthey are getting better.\n\n[[Page S12138]]\n\n  I think this farm bill is so important because of the problems the \nDakotas, Nebraska, and Iowa have. The farm bill is so important. This \nbill affects the whole country. It is not just a farm bill.\n  I also say to the majority leader that I was given a statement by \nSenators as I walked into this Chamber indicating that Alamo and \nNational car rental companies have filed for bankruptcy. This is really \nastounding. These two large rental car companies filed for bankruptcy.\n  I have had a number of conversations and meetings with the \ndistinguished majority leader about companies and individuals who \ndepend on tourism. For 30 States in the United States, their No. 1, No. \n2, or No. 3 most important economic force is tourism.\n  I know the majority leader has stated publicly--and I appreciate it \nvery much--that one of the items we are going to be looking at in an \neconomic stimulus package is how the tourism industry can be helped. It \nis in such desperate shape--helping rental car companies and other \nentities that so depend on tourism.\n  I am very happy that there has been a framework developed. We can \nmove forward. This is not inventing the wheel. In fact, we have done \nthis before on very important issues since September 11. It will go \ndown in history as remarkably good legislation. We have done it on four \noccasions. We did it with the appropriations for New York City, plus \nthe $20 billion for added defense for the country. We did it with \nairport security and antiterrorism. There is one other that I can't \nremember.\n  That sets the framework for doing some good work on the stimulus \npackage.\n  I hope the leader will do something about this. I believe we will be \nvery successful in working it out.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished assistant \nDemocratic leader for his comments. He is absolutely right. The tourism \nindustry has been very hard hit. This is yet another indication of the \ndifficult time they are having. I wasn't aware that these two companies \ndeclared bankruptcy. But it certainly illustrates yet another instance \nof just how difficult a time many of these companies are experiencing.\n  So I appreciate his comment and especially appreciate so much his \nsensitivity to the agricultural situation. He noted he does not have a \nlot of farmers, but he has been extremely supportive and understanding \nabout the farm situation. I appreciate that very much.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the majority leader, we don't have a lot of \nfarmers; we have a lot of people who eat the food.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, just for explanation to all Senators, \nwe have now moved to proceed to the railroad retirement bill. The \ndistinguished Republican leader has offered an amendment for which \nthere will be a cloture vote at 5 o'clock on Monday. Following that \nvote on cloture, there will be a vote on cloture on the bill at \napproximately 5:30 on Monday as well. So under the current arrangement, \nthere will be two votes on Monday at about 5 o'clock.\n  There will be, hopefully, a very good debate tomorrow on the Lott \namendment. There can be debate tonight on the amendment or on the bill. \nBut I hope Senators will use the time that is now allotted for the \ndebate to express themselves and to participate in whatever debate may \nbe required. But those cloture votes will occur at 5 o'clock. And there \nwill be no other votes until that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, if the distinguished majority leader will \nyield to respond to an inquiry, I thought also we would have a vote on \nthe Transportation appropriations conference report at some point in \nthe sequence on Monday.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct. The Senator is right. I appreciate his \nreminding me. If the Senate has been presented with the papers on the \nTransportation conference report by Monday, it is our intention to have \na vote on the Transportation conference report as well.\n  I am told the House is planning to act tomorrow. I know there has \nbeen a little bit of a debate. I don't know if that has been resolved. \nBut if the papers arrive, it is our intent--and I had announced it \nearlier--to bring up the conference report on Transportation as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, if I could be heard with regard to the \nsituation as it now exists for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nactually, what has transpired over the past few minutes procedurally is \nthat Senator Daschle has offered the railroad retirement substitute to \na House bill.\n  That had to be done to get us on the railroad retirement subject \nitself. Then, as is in order, I offered an amendment to the substitute. \nSo that will be the issue that can be debated, along with the railroad \nretirement bill, if Senators so desire.\n  Let me talk about the content of the amendment that was filed on my \nbehalf as well as Senator Murkowski and Senator Brownback and others.\n  Regardless of the merits of the railroad retirement bill, I had hoped \nthat the Senate would stay focused on appropriations conference \nreports, the defense appropriations bill, and the stimulus package that \nwould create economic growth and jobs creation in this country. I am \npleased that now an effort is under way to get a conference negotiation \ngoing on the stimulus package. That movement yesterday afternoon \naffected the decision that was made earlier today not to fight the \nmotion to proceed on the railroad retirement bill.\n  My question is, why we are moving to bills that are not an emergency, \nnot related to appropriations and the stimulus package or even the \nreinsurance issue? It seems to me we should focus on those urgent and \nemergency issues that need to be addressed as a result of the events of \nSeptember 11 and since then, before we go out for the holiday season, \nfor the Christmas period.\n  That has not been the case. Now we are on the railroad retirement \nissue. There are other issues we believe urgent and need to be \naddressed and should be addressed. That is why this amendment is the \nMurkowski energy bill, basically H.R. 4, the House-passed bill, that we \nbelieve and have been believing since June needed to be brought up in \nthe Senate. We need a national energy policy. That needs to be broad-\nbased. It needs to address the need for additional production of oil \nand natural gas. Clean coal technology needs to be moved forward, the \nuse of nuclear power, alternative fuels, transmission line problems, as \nwell as conservation, which is a very important part of this package.\n  We see right now circumstances that really bother me. We are \ndependent on OPEC oil, Russian oil, and Iraqi oil, approaching now well \nover 50 percent of our energy needs. It is imported oil, and that is \nextremely dangerous. Just last week we saw where the OPEC countries \nwere lobbying others, including Russia, to cut their production so that \nthe prices could be driven back up. Unbelievably, or perhaps \ngratefully, we see that the Russians resisted that and said, no, we are \ngoing to continue with our production.\n  Apparently now they have come to some sort of agreement and I guess \nthere will be some reduced production and prices will go up some. But \nwe are on a yo-yo. This past June and the June before that, we saw \nprices shoot up on gasoline inexplicably and probably unjustifiably in \nsome instances. So we don't have a national energy policy. We were told \nwe would do it later. Then there were the September events and October \nhad other things we were working on. Now we are told we will get to it \nin January or February.\n  Every day we lose puts us at risk one more day. We should have a full \ndebate about a national energy policy. We are going to have it. This \namendment is offered to the underlying bill because this is an issue \nthat needs to be voted on by the Senate. We are going to see who \nbelieves energy is something we need to do or whether there is a \npotential threat there.\n  This is not only a national security issue; it is an economic issue. \nIf you want to help the railroads with some of their problems, let's \nhave a reliable energy policy. Let's reduce the cost of what they take \nto run the industry if you want to help farmers in America. Let's deal \nwith the cost of the energy they need all the way from producing \nammonia to diesel. So this is an economic issue.\n\n  Remember this: If the OPEC countries decided to cut us off, we would \nbe on our knees economically in less than 30 days. America doesn't \ndepend on anybody else in the world for anything else for our existence \nbut energy. We can not have that. The simple solution, is to have the \ndebate. Let's have the vote.\n  By the way, this doesn't displace the railroad retirement bill. It \nwould be added to it, and so we would have an opportunity to pass a \nrailroad retirement bill, presumably one that might be amended \nsubstantively as we go forward, with an energy package.\n  The second part of the amendment I offered also puts a 6-month \nmoratorium on cloning. It doesn't say we won't have it for therapeutic \nresearch. It doesn't say what we will do. It says ``time out here.'' We \nhave a lot of serious questions that we need to ask and have answered \nand think about what we want to do. So it is the energy bill and the 6-\nmonth moratorium on cloning. This should make for a good debate. It is \nlong overdue.\n\n[[Page S12140]]\n\n  In the case of energy, in the case of cloning, if we don't do it now, \nwe won't be able to do anything until February or March, and this issue \nwill march forward with uncertainty and concern. Senator Brownback has \nbeen advancing the need for us to take some action to have the \nmoratorium. The House acted months ago, overwhelmingly, in a bipartisan \nmanner. We will have the opportunity to do the same here.\n  I urge my colleagues to take time tonight and tomorrow and Monday. \nLet's talk about these two issues. We should not invoke cloture on this \namendment. We should have a vote. We should not stop the debate. We \nshould have a vote on the substance itself, and then we could move to \nthe underlying bill and could get it done.\n  Instead of taking shots at each other, we could actually address \nthree big issues in one swoop. That is why I offered the amendment. It \nis also to serve notice that if we keep going off track on what we need \nto do to get out of here, other issues will be brought up.\n  This is the Senate. Wonderful place that it is, no one person and no \none party dictates what we can do. Marvelously, any Senator can offer \nany amendment on any subject he or she wishes at any time. Lots of \ntimes it takes 60 votes, but that is the way it works. Therefore, we \nwill have an opportunity now to have a full debate on energy and on \ncloning as well as railroad retirement.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues for the opportunity to briefly \ndescribe what we are doing. I am sure Senator Murkowski and members of \nthe Energy Committee will be here to describe what is in this energy \npackage. Senator Brownback is waiting to describe the details of his \nmoratorium.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I know the Senator from Kansas is on \nthe floor to speak on several important issues, and the Senator from \nAlaska will be addressing the Senate later this evening on the \nimportant issue of energy security for our Nation. I agree with so many \nof the points of the Senator from Alaska, as well as the Senator from \nMississippi, who has been taking with us this evening on that subject.\n  I want to talk about a subject that is actually somewhat related. The \nsubject I want to spend a few minutes on tonight is most certainly \nrelated to the issue of energy security for our Nation. It is related \nto the situation that we find ourselves in, combating this new war \nagainst terrorism in many different ways and in ways very different \nthan our past conflicts would have us be engaged. Let me just try to \nbring this into focus.\n  We have troops in Afghanistan and, luckily and thankfully, and \nbecause we have the best equipped, best led, and bravest and most \ncourageous fighting force in the world, we are making extraordinary \nprogress on our front in Afghanistan. You can see the headlines in all \nof the newspapers that would attest to the great effort that is being \nmade. But we all know, and we are all learning quickly, that this war \non terrorism is something we are going to have to fight on many \ndifferent fronts. One of those fronts is in our own homeland.\n  We hated to see what happened on September 11, and we were all heart \nbroken and angry and justifiably angry at the devastation and the \nhorrific attack on our Nation.\n  As I was saying, we now have to fight this war on many different \nfronts, not just the front in Afghanistan but the front here at home. \nWe were all terribly horrified and righteously angry. We have to turn \nthat righteous anger into concrete steps to protect ourselves in the \nfuture. Many of us in our various capacities and many different \ncommittees are about doing that. We are stepping up airport security. \nWe are trying to step up the security of our cyberinfrastructure in the \nNation. We are looking at ways to set up medical response teams on \nhealth care, our public health system. And all of these efforts, if we \ndo them correctly and come up with good policies and funding streams, \nwill most certainly help to protect our Nation against these attacks \nthat, unfortunately, are going to certainly come. Even if we are \nsuccessful--and we have been--in cornering bin Laden and taking down \nthe Taliban regime and capturing or destroying that particular cell, it \nis likely, based on everything that we know--not to alarm people or \nfrighten people, but we know that it is likely that there will be \nfuture attacks.\n  The point of my short presentation today is to simply say that we are \nnot sure where these attacks will be aimed. We never imagined that a \ngroup of people, with three of our own airplanes filled with fuel, \nwould take down some of the most important buildings in this Nation. So \nwe have to think: What might the next attack be? What could possibly \ncome at us?\n  There are so many things that could happen that we have to be smart \nand strategic about how we spend our resources.\n  One of the issues that I am going to argue for a few minutes on the \nfloor today is some of the critical infrastructure in our Nation--some \nof it is rail, some transportation issues, such as highways and \ntunnels, some of it is critical infrastructure protecting our nuclear \npowerplants, our electric grid, our cyberinfrastructure that we now \nrely on to run so much of our communications, transportation, health \ncare\n\n[[Page S12141]]\n\nsystems, et cetera. We can't do all of it at once, but we can most \ncertainly begin taking some steps.\n\n  I think we need to identify where we can--whether we do it in the \nsupplemental bill or in the energy bill, or whether we do it in the \nstimulus package--some projects that are worth giving some attention to \nin the event that there would be some effort to cut our resources. One \nof those resources is energy.\n  Let me be very clear. In Louisiana, there are many critical highways, \nas there are in many States. There is a highway that is of critical \nimportance not just to our State but to the whole Nation. It doesn't \nlook like much because it is a small highway. Right now, it is a two-\nlane highway. I will show you a picture of it in a moment. It is \nLouisiana 1. I think it is called LA-1. It is rightfully named because \nit is the one highway in Louisiana, and perhaps in the Nation, that we \nrely on so heavily for our oil and gas production in this Nation.\n  Oil and gas production takes place, as you know, primarily off the \nsouthern shore of our Nation, off the coast of Texas and Mississippi \nand Louisiana and Alabama, primarily.\n  We get 18 percent of our imported oil off of the loop facility, which \nis right off the coast of Louisiana and down this highway, which I am \ngoing to show a picture of in a minute. One can see clearly from this \npicture there are a thousand trucks a day on this highway on a regular \nday. This is not a fancy highway. It is a small highway. It runs from \nPort Fourchon all the way up to the 90 loop. There are a thousand \ntrucks a day that bring pipes, supplies, men, women, equipment, and \nengineering services to produce oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico that \nhelp this Nation to be secure every day.\n  So when people walk into this Chamber or they walk into their \nbuilding at Cisco or IBM or eBay or whether they walk into Shaw \nEnterprises or any number of the shipbuilders in Louisiana and they \nturn the lights on, lights come on. When they fire up those plants, \nthat energy runs. This energy comes, in large measure, off the coasts \nof Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. This highway is the highway that \nis the bridge to Port Fourchon, where these trucks and this equipment \nare located.\n  Even in a slight rain this highway goes under water. Imagine if there \nwas any kind of purposeful attack on the infrastructure with some minor \neffort. This highway in the shape that it is in and the condition that \nit is in could cause a major disruption in energy flows to the United \nStates.\n  The Gulf of Mexico has 20,000 miles of the most extensive network of \noffshore oil and gas pipelines in the world. There is only 2,000 miles \nfrom the east coast to the west coast, approximately, as the crow \nflies, in the Nation. Ten times the amount of the length of our country \nare the miles of pipeline that come out of Louisiana to bring oil and \ngas to the rest of the Nation.\n  This highway is the only way one could basically get to the point \nwhere this oil and gas comes off of our shore. The loop facility is the \nonly offshore oil terminal in the country. There are not three. There \nare not four. There is one. It is the loop facility, and it is just a \nfew miles off the shore of Louisiana. The only way to get to the loop \nfacility, other than helicopter or ship, is to come down this highway \nto Port Fourchon, at the end of Louisiana, and to get to the loop \nfacility, where 18 percent of our imported oil comes into the Nation. \nIt comes up through the pipes and again all the supplies for the coast \ncome through this highway.\n  It is time that this highway be designated as a special highway for \nthe Nation, a high priority corridor for this Nation. There are such \ndesignations in the Transportation bill for many of our highways, and I \nam sure every Senator could stand up and claim there are at least one \nor two highways in their States that are particularly important, \nwhether it be for trade or for commerce. We could say that, too, about \nall of our highways, particularly for I-10, that is connecting Houston \nin the southern part of the State; I-49 that is now going to be a trade \nroute hopefully to Canada and down through Louisiana; I-20 that \nconnects our State, of course, east and west to other parts of the \nUnited States. But clearly LA-1, which is primarily responsible to help \nthis Nation keep its oil and gas supply not only operating but in a \nvigorous, robust manner to supply the rest of the Nation, deserves to \nhave a special designation.\n  I am requesting by the amendment I am offering to the Transportation \nbill to get Louisiana-1 designated as a high-impact corridor so we can \nbe in line for appropriations to change this from a two-lane highway to \na four-lane highway to give it some of the protections a highway of \nthis magnitude deserves.\n\n  Let me show what happens when there is a turnover of an 18-wheeler, \none of the thousands that are in this lane. The traffic is backed up \nfor hours. There is no way around it. The services to the rigs out in \nthe gulf are basically shut down for all practical purposes. If one \ncannot get to the port, they cannot basically get service to the rigs \nor the supplies or the pipes that are needed.\n  I hesitate to actually give this speech. Frankly, I hope no terrorist \nis watching because it would be so easy in some ways to disrupt the \nsupply of the oil to this Nation, but one thing September 11 has to \nteach us is putting some of our resources into building up the critical \ninfrastructure in this Nation so we are not so vulnerable. I wanted to \ngive this speech because I would feel terrible if something happened \nand people said: Well, Mary, you did not tell anybody about this \nhighway and, after all, it is not a major interstate and we did not \nknow about it.\n  So I want to give my colleagues fair warning there is a little \nhighway in Louisiana. It only has two lanes, but it has a thousand \ntrucks a day that are bringing supplies and equipment to the offshore \nof this Nation that helps turn on lights in every schoolhouse and \nhospital and office building and run factories from Louisiana to \nIllinois and from Maine to California. If we cannot find a few million \ndollars in these trillions of dollars of budget to help us improve this \nhighway so we can withstand a natural occurrence of a hurricane or a \nman-made attack that we would be better equipped to handle than what we \nhave now, then I do not want to be held responsible for not bringing \nthis into the light.\n  I have been in this Chamber many times talking about all the critical \ninfrastructure around our Nation. I have several bills and amendments \nto try to direct some of our resources to fund those projects, but this \none comes to mind as one of the most important we should address. I \nurge my colleagues to look carefully at our needs for LA-1 to help us \nto direct through any of the bills that are moving forward. I am \nprepared to stay in this Chamber and to come back many times until we \ncan get some relief to get some funding for Highway 1. I should also \nmention I-49 and I-10 which handle the bulk of our domestic production.\n  Production in the United States of America is basically limited to \nthis area of the country. There is virtually no production off the \neastern shore, as the Senator from Alaska will say in his speech later \ntonight. There is virtually no production going off of the eastern \nshore. All of the offshore oil and gas production is coming off of this \npart of the gulf.\n  So the infrastructure, for the Port of New Orleans, for the Port of \nMobile, for the Port of Galveston, for the I-10 corridor that links \nbasically Houston and New Orleans into Florida, is critical for the \ndevelopment and the spreading of the gas and the oil that comes off of \nthe gulf to the different parts of the Nation.\n  Finally, we are not complaining about producing the oil and gas. We \nrecognize it brings jobs and wealth to our State. While others do not \nwant production, we want production that is environmentally \nresponsible. We are happy with the jobs and the wealth that it creates. \nI need to say, though, we are not creating the wealth and the jobs and \nthe energy for our State. We are creating it for the entire Nation. So \nit is only right, it is only fitting, that some of the taxes that are \npaid by the oil companies from this exact production would come back to \nhelp us reinvest in Highway 1, in I-49, in I-10, in I-69, because it is \nthose roads that support the oil and gas drilling.\n\n  I thank my colleague from Alaska for yielding to me. He knows this \nsubject in many ways even better than I know the subject. He has been \nin the Senate longer than I have, but it is so obvious\n\n[[Page S12142]]\n\nto some of us that we have to dedicate some resources to protecting the \ncritical infrastructure of this Nation. This is at least one highway \nthat deserves to be No. 1, as its title would suggest.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I wish to enter a short colloquy with \nmy good friend, the Senator from Louisiana, and ask her if the \nanticipated opening of ANWR would not require construction of 19 double \nhull tankers, some of which would be constructed in her State, from \nMississippi or Alabama, costing about $4 billion? I think we have \nseveral of those ships underway now, creating 5,000 jobs each for 17 \nyears. These are figures that have been released to me by the American \nPetroleum Institute, estimating that 19 new double hull tankers of a \nmillennium class will be needed if ANWR is open. The assumption is that \nANWR will produce 10.3 billion barrels of oil. That is about what has \ncome out of Prudhoe Bay, for a 60-year production life, and the new \ntankers would be needed because the old North Slope tankers are being \nphased out in their entirety by the year 2015. That is when the double \nhull requirements come into effect.\n\n  There would be more jobs created because the Jones Act requires that \nthe American oil be transported in U.S.-flagged vessels, built in U.S. \nshipyards, with U.S. crew, transported within the United States, which \nis from Alaska and the west coast, which he agreed, according to API's \nanalysis, assuming ANWR passes, it will include any ban on ANWR oil \nbeing exported outside the United States. It also assumes that ANWR oil \nwill be transported by tankers to refineries primarily in Washington, \nCalifornia, and Hawaii.\n  I would like the Senator's confirmation on the estimate it would pump \nalmost $4 billion into the economy, create 2000 construction jobs in \nthe U.S. shipbuilding industry, some perhaps in the State of \nWashington, and approximately 3,000 other jobs. They predict this will \ncompute to approximately 90,000 job years by estimating it will take \napproximately 17 years to build all the 19 ships at almost 5,000 jobs \neach year. The prediction is one ship must be built each year in order \nto coincide with the schedule of retired existing tankers.\n  I wish we had the capacity to build the ships in our State of Alaska, \nbut that is not the case and will not be the case. However, Louisiana \nhas been prominent in its shipbuilding and supply of various resources \nfor Alaska's oil development.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator for that inquiry. As he knows, and \nI completely agree, more production in the continental United States \nand Alaska is definitely a step we should take to reduce our dependence \non foreign oil and to increase job opportunities here in our own \ncountry. Particularly at this critical time, not only is it part of our \noverall energy strategy but now it is part of our security strategy for \nhomeland defense and homeland security to reduce our dependence on oil \nand gas, liquefied natural gas that may come from other sources.\n  We are very proud of the shipbuilding we do in Louisiana and the \nengineering and the construction of the landforms and infrastructure \nthat make it possible to drill in extraordinary conditions, in very \ndeep water, leaving a minimal footprint. In days past, there were \nterrible environmental consequences to drilling. We simply did not have \nthe know-how or the technology to handle some of the negative \nenvironmental impacts. That has changed dramatically over the last few \nyears. While there is risk associated with every human activity, we \nhave minimized the risk to the environment in tremendous ways.\n  The Senator knows we build some tremendous ships and off- and onshore \noil and gas equipment in Louisiana. We agree the production numbers \nneed to get up.\n  For the record, the Senator from Alaska should know that one-fifth of \nthe entire Nation's energy supply depends on LA-1 and its connection to \nPort Fourchon. The Department of Interior mineral management identifies \nPort Fourchon as the focal point of deep water activity in the gulf. \nThere is perhaps a deep water or perhaps a focal point in Alaska. I am \nnot familiar with that focal point, but in Louisiana it is Port \nFourchon. Eighty-five percent of the deepwater drilling rigs, working \nin the gulf, are supported by Port Fourchon. We have a highway that is \nnot worth skating down, let alone with the 1,000 18-wheelers a day \ntrying to supply the Nation with the energy it needs to operate.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator as we try to improve and \nincrease production. I see the Senator from Hawaii on the floor. He has \nbeen an outstanding spokesman of conserving where we can. It will be a \ncombination of strong conservation measures and alternative energy and \nmore production in Alaska and all the States, and in many places in the \nlower 48.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator from Louisiana. I have appreciated \nthe good relationship between our two States.\n  Madam President, this is a fairly significant moment from the \nstandpoint of those interested in passing a comprehensive energy bill. \nWe have that bill, finally, on the floor of the Senate this evening. \nProcedurally, Senator Daschle has offered a substitute amendment. \nSenator Lott offered a second-degree that adds the provisions of \nenergy, as well as cloning. At 5 p.m. Monday there will be a vote on \ncloture on the Lott amendment. The significance of this is clear to \nthose who said we never bring up energy for a vote, are never able to \nresolve the merits of whether or not the President's request that we \npass a comprehensive energy policy will become a reality.\n  I rise today to say that that time has come. Today it is a reality. I \nhope in the coming debate we can separate much of the fiction that has \nbeen associated with this issue.\n  I rise today in support of the amendment to the underlying \nlegislation offered by Senator Lott. Division A through G of the \namendment will provide a balanced and comprehensive energy policy to \nguide this Nation into the future.\n  Where does the American public stand? I have the results of a poll \nrecently done by the IPSOS-Reid Corporation, with offices in \nWashington, New York, Toronto, Minneapolis, Vancouver, San Francisco, \nMontreal, Ottowa, Winnipeg, and Calgary. It is a public opinion poll on \nenergy issues. It was not done last year; it was done in November.\n  Let me share, with you the results of this poll. This independent and \nobjective poll, conducted by a highly respected research firm, clearly \nshows that Americans place a high priority of passing an energy bill. \nThe highlights are enlightening because 95 percent of Americans say \nFederal action on energy is important. That doesn't surprise me.\n  Continuing, 72 percent of Americans say passing an energy bill is a \nhigher priority than any other action Congress might take. I hope that \nmessage is loud and clear. Again, 72 percent say energy is a higher \npriority than any other action Congress could take. That includes \ncampaign finance reform, railroad retirement, stimulus.\n  Continuing, 73 percent of Americans say Congress should make the \nenergy bill part of President Bush's stimulus plan. Surprisingly \nenough, 67 percent say exploration of new energy sources in the United \nStates, including Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, is a \nconvincing reason to support passing an energy policy bill.\n  We have a significant portion of America's public saying we should go \nahead and pass an energy bill. That is what is before the Senate, H.R. \n4. That bill passed the House of Representatives. Clearly, the House \nhas done its job. Now it is up to the Senate to do its job.\n  We have heard from our President many times, indicating that:\n\n       We need the energy, we need the jobs, we need a \n     comprehensive energy bill from the Senate. This plan \n     increases our energy independence and therefore our national \n     security.\n\n  The Secretary of Energy:\n\n       We need an energy-security policy and we need it soon.\n\n  Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Anthony Principi:\n\n       We are engaged in mortal combat with an enemy who wants to \n     see us fail in securing an energy policy.\n\n  The Secretary of Labor, Elaine Chao:\n\n       The President's plan will create literally thousands of new \n     jobs that will be needed to\n\n[[Page S12143]]\n\n     dramatically expand America's capacity for energy production.\n\n  Let's look at those who have gone overseas and fought wars over oil--\nthe American Legion:\n\n       The development of America's domestic energy resources is \n     vital to our national security.\n\n  That is what they wrote to Senator Daschle.\n  The Veterans of Foreign Wars:\n\n       Keeping in mind the horrific event of September 11 and \n     mindful of the threats we are facing, we strongly believe \n     that the development of America's domestic energy resources \n     is a vital national security priority.\n\n  That is in a letter to Senator Daschle.\n  The American Veterans Association:\n\n       As you know, our current reliance on foreign oil leaves the \n     United States vulnerable to the whim of individual oil-\n     exporting companies, many existing in the unpredictable and \n     highly dangerous Persian Gulf. . . . [We] firmly believe that \n     we cannot wait for the next crisis before we act.\n\n  A letter to Senator Daschle.\n  The Vietnam Veterans Institute:\n\n       War and international terrorism have again brought into \n     sharp focus the heavy reliance of the U.S. on imported oil. \n     During these times of crises, such reliance threatens our \n     national security and economic well being. . . . It is \n     important that we develop domestic sources of oil.\n\n  Another letter to Senator Daschle.\n  The Catholic War Veterans of America participated.\n  How about organized labor? This issue, our energy security, is \nexpressed first by the Seafarers International Union, from Terry \nTurner, the executive director:\n\n       At a time when the economy is faltering, working men and \n     women all over the country would clearly benefit from the \n     much-needed investment in energy development, storage, and \n     transmission.\n\n  The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Jerry Hood:\n\n       America has gone too long without a solid energy plan. When \n     energy costs rise, working families are the first to feel the \n     pinch. The Senate should follow the example passed by the \n     House and ease their burden by sending the President supply-\n     based energy legislation to sign.\n\n  The Maritime Laborers Union participated in numerous press \nconferences; the Operating Engineers, Plumbers and Pipefitters Union; \nthe Carpenters and Joiners Union.\n  We have a significant group of America's organized labor in support \nof this because this is truly a jobs bill, much of which could be done \nwithout any cost to the taxpayer.\n  We are talking about stimulus. Let me just indicate what opening ANWR \nwould do as a stimulus to the economy. It would create about 250,000 \njobs. Those are direct jobs. The number of secondary jobs--making pipe, \nmaking valves--is anybody's guess. Some have come up with as high as \n700,000 jobs associated with developing it.\n\n  What is the other stimulus? This is Federal land. As a consequence, \nthe Federal Government would lease the land under a bidding process. It \nis estimated to generate about $3 billion in Federal funding coming \ninto the general fund.\n  If one considers the number of jobs, the revenue, and the reality \nthat it will not cost the taxpayer one red cent, it is pretty hard to \nfind a better stimulus. If you or anyone else in this body can identify \na single more beneficial stimulus than opening ANWR, I would like to \nknow what it is.\n  The Hispanic community, the Latin American Management Association, \nhas written:\n\n       As we head into the winter season in a time of war, these \n     worries multiply. The possibility of terrorist attacks on oil \n     fields or transportation in the Mideast are very real. This \n     would force energy prices to skyrocket and immediately impact \n     the most vulnerable families across the country.\n\n  That is by the Latin American Management Association. They fear bin \nLaden will disrupt, perhaps, the refining or pipelines either in Saudi \nArabia or initiate some terrorist action in the Straits of Hormuz, \nwhich would cut off our supply.\n  We have the Latino Coalition:\n\n       The Senate must act on comprehensive energy legislation \n     before adjourning. Not addressing this issue immediately is \n     both irresponsible and dangerous to America as a nation and \n     particularly to Hispanics as a community. America must \n     increase the level of domestic production so we can reduce \n     our dependency on foreign oil.\n\n  It is signed by Robert Despoda, the president of the Latino \nCoalition.\n  The U.S. Mexico Chamber of Commerce:\n\n       We urge the Senate leadership, both Democrats and \n     Republicans, to pass comprehensive energy legislation before \n     adjourning. This is not a partisan issue. Millions of needy \n     Hispanic families need your support now. History would not \n     treat inaction kindly, and neither would Hispanic voters next \n     year around.\n\n  It is signed by Mario Rodriguez, Hispanic Business Roundtable \nPresident.\n  The seniors organizations have spoken out. The group 60 Plus, which I \nmight add I have joined at some time:\n\n       It's time the Senate leadership quit demagoguing and come \n     to grips with the energy legislation they bottled up. Our \n     economy depends in no minor way on the passage of an energy \n     plan. Much more important, our security depends on it.\n\n  It is signed by Roger Zion, chairman, 60 Plus.\n  The Seniors Coalition participated in support--the United Seniors \nAssociation.\n  I ask unanimous consent for another 5 minutes and I am going to yield \nto some of my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Jewish organizations have come aboard. I ask \nunanimous consent that their letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish \n           Organizations,\n                                   New York, NY, November 16, 2001\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n      U.S. Senate, HSOB,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The conference of Presidents of Major \n     American Jewish Organizations at its general meeting on \n     November 14th unanimously supported a resolution calling on \n     Congress to act expeditiously to pass the energy bill that \n     will serve to lessen our dependence on foreign sources of \n     oil. We believe that this important legislation has, in \n     addition, to the economic impact, significant security \n     implications. We hope that Congress will move quickly to pass \n     this vital measure.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with you and your \n     colleagues on this and other matters of importance to our \n     country.\n     Mortimer B. Zuckerman,\n                                                         Chairman.\n     Malcolm Hoenlein,\n                                          Executive Vice Chairman.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish \nOrganizations, in their conference, at a general meeting of November \n14:\n\n       . . .unanimously supported a resolution calling on Congress \n     to act expeditiously to pass the energy bill that will serve \n     to lessen our dependence on foreign sources of oil.\n\n  That was in a letter to Senator Daschle.\n  The Zionist Organizations of America say in their letter:\n\n       At a time when our Nation is at war against international \n     terrorism, it is more important than ever that we work \n     quickly to free ourselves of dependence on oil produced by \n     extremist dictators.\n\n  Further, they say on behalf of that organization, which is the oldest \nand one of the largest Zionist movements in the State:\n\n       We are writing to express our strong support for your \n     efforts to make our country less dependent on foreign oil \n     sources by developing the oil resources in Alaska's national \n     wildlife refuge.\n\n  So there you have a fair segment of Americans represented through \nthese organizations.\n  Then we go to American business, the National Black Chamber of \nCommerce:\n\n       Our growing membership reflects the opinion of more and \n     more Americans all across the political spectrum that we must \n     act now to lessen our dependence on foreign energy sources by \n     addressing the nation's long-neglected energy needs.\n\n  It is signed by Harry Alford, president and CEO.\n  U.S. Chamber of Commerce--Bruce Josten, executive vice president, \nU.S. Chamber:\n\n       The events of the last month lend a new urgency to our \n     efforts to increase domestic energy supplies and modernize \n     our nation's energy infrastructure.\n\n  And the National Association of Manufacturers:\n\n       The House of Representatives has answered the President's \n     call. It has taken our obvious energy needs into account--\n     along with concerns of many interest groups--and produced \n     reasonable and comprehensive legislation that will help \n     provide stable energy prices and long-term confidence in our \n     economy.\n\n[[Page S12144]]\n\n      But the Senate is dragging its feet. Some seem willing to \n     let politics stop the will of the majority that wants to move \n     forward with comprehensive energy legislation this year. In \n     light of current economic conditions and on behalf of NAM's \n     14,000 members, I strongly urge Sen. Daschle to move an \n     energy bill to the floor without further delay. It is high \n     time to put the national interest ahead of parochial \n     political interests.\n\n  It is signed by Michael Baroody, National Association of \nManufacturers.\n  Last, the Alliance for Energy and Economic Growth.\n  They indicate, representing 1,100 businesses, large and small, and \nover 1 million employees:\n\n       All of the members of the Alliance enthusiastically welcome \n     the President's strong appeal for action on a national energy \n     policy. We are also committed to work with Senate Majority \n     Leader Daschle to move forward in a spirit of bipartisanship \n     with comprehensive, national energy legislation.\n\n  The Alliance spokesman is Bruce Josten.\n  That completes my comments to some extent. I will not tax the \nPresiding Officer further at this time. I will take a little break.\n  But I think it is important that we all listen carefully to these \ngroups. They are sending a message to the Senate to get on with its \nobligation to move an energy bill. We have that energy bill here in the \nChamber. It is the pending business for the first time in several \nyears.\n  I think it is very important that we look at the political \nramifications associated. We have elections coming up. We have a great \ndeal of unknown exposures relative to the instability in the Mideast.\n  I remind my colleagues that in about 1973 we had the Arab oil \nembargo, and the gas lines were around the block. The public was \nblaming everybody. They were outraged and inconvenienced. Just one \nterrorist act could bring that situation back.\n  Some say it will take time. In 1995, this body passed a bill. It \nincluded ANWR. The President vetoed it. Had he not vetoed it, we would \nvery possibly have oil flowing from ANWR today and oil coming down in \nnew U.S. ships. But that was the loss of yesterday which is reflected \nin the vulnerability of our country today.\n  I urge my colleagues to think seriously before voting Monday about \nwhat you are voting for. Are you voting to be responsive to America's \nsomewhat extreme environmental community that has used their ANWR issue \nas a cash cow to generate revenue and funding for their organizations? \nWhen this passes, they will move on to something else. You might say I \nam perhaps being overly critical. I have seen their actions. I know \nwhat this issue means to them. It gives them a cause.\n  Members are going to have to determine whether it will be a \nresponsive vote for the environmental groups that oppose this effort or \na responsive vote to do what is right for America at a time when we are \nnot only at war but we are having a recession in this country.\n  Indeed, this energy bill would be a significant economic stimulus and \nwould dramatically help remove our dependence on imported oil--\nparticularly at a time when we are contemplating moves in the Mideast, \nand our dependence on Saddam Hussein's oil is over a million barrels a \nday. Yet at the same time we are enforcing a no-fly zone. In enforcing \nthat no-fly zone, we are probably using his oil in our aircraft to take \nout his targets, and he is using our money to pay his Republican Guards \nand to develop weapons capability. We already lost two U.S. seamen the \nother day when that tanker sunk.\n  My time has expired. I defer to the next Senator seeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I rise to speak in favor of the \npending business, which is the amendment put forward by Senator Lott \ncontaining the energy bill of Senator Murkowski and a number of other \nMembers in a bipartisan fashion.\n  It also contains a 6-month moratorium on the issue of human cloning. \nThat is the pending business. We are in morning business. I want to \nspeak to that particular issue, the pending business itself.\n  I think the Senator from Alaska has adequately and very well \ndescribed the need for an energy bill and what is in that energy \npackage. He has been very aggressive in expressing the need to do that. \nI wholeheartedly agree with what he is saying. We need an energy bill. \nWe need an energy package, and we need less energy dependence.\n  If we move soon to address the issue of mass destruction in Iraq, we \nare going to be in far worse shape if Iraq starts cutting down their \noil and not making it available to the United States. If some other \ncountries follow suit, then that means we are going to feel a great \npinch. Even though we are doing the right things to address the weapons \nof mass destruction, we are going to feel a real pinch if they cut down \non oil supplies when we have such an international dependence on oil \nfrom the Middle East in particularly.\n  I think what the Senator is putting forward for reducing our energy \ndependence abroad--particularly from the Persian Gulf--and having our \nenergy sources here is a valuable thing, a necessary thing, and \nsomething we need to do today. We need to get it addressed today. I \napplaud the Senator from Alaska. That is why I am a cosponsor of the \namendment which is the pending business on the floor.\n\n\n                                Cloning\n\n  The issue I wish to address specifically is another issue of great \nconcern and immediacy. It needs to be addressed. I think the world was \nshocked when they read the papers Sunday about the first human clone. \nIt is something that was theoretical and something that was talked \nabout. It was something in the movies. Now there is a ``Star Wars'' \nmovie coming out this year called ``The Clone Wars.'' It has been \nsomething everybody has been discussing.\n  I think people were shocked when they read this headline about the \nfirst human clone. It isn't something that happened in Europe or South \nAfrica. It was in the United States of America.\n  People were looking at this and saying: I thought this was in a \ntheoretical mode. I didn't realize we were actually at a point of \ncloning humans.\n  The House of Representatives passed a bill to address this issue, \nsaying we should not be cloning humans. The President addressed this \nissue and said: Send me a bill to ban human cloning; I don't think this \nis something we should be doing.\n  The Senate is the only body of the three that has not addressed the \nissue yet.\n  In the underlying amendment today on the issue of cloning is a 6-\nmonth moratorium. It is not a complete ban. It is a 6-month moratorium \non all cloning to say time out. Let's hold up just a little bit while \nwe start catching up philosophically and thoughtfully in this body on \nwhat is taking place on human cloning in the United States of America \ntoday--not tomorrow, not next month--that we need to address this \nbefore we get more stories such as this or we start seeing the face of \na child appearing before this body takes its position on addressing the \nissue of human cloning. Presently, this country has not addressed it.\n\n  You can clone in this country, if you choose to do so, even though I \nhave a list of other countries that have acted on this issue. Twenty-\neight other countries or bodies such as the European Parliament have \nalready acted on the issue of human cloning. We have not. The Senate \nhas not yet acted on this. Twenty-eight other mostly developed \ncountries have already acted on this issue in some way or another.\n  What does the public say about it? I want to read from today's Roll \nCall magazine on page 10 about the issue of cloning. There was a poll \nof the American public. This is in today's Roll Call magazine, November \n29. It says:\n\n       The majority of Americans clearly remain opposed to \n     cloning, with 87 percent telling ABC News interviewers in \n     early August that cloning humans should be illegal. \n     Respondents were told the following about therapeutic \n     cloning:\n\n  There is a debate going on about that. I am opposed to reproductive \ncloning. Some people are saying they want to try to do therapeutic \ncloning, which I think is a misnomer of the highest order. Therapeutic \ncloning is where you create a human clone. You grow it for a period to \ntwo weeks. You kill it. It is certainly not therapeutic to clone. You \nharvest the cells out of that for some supposed research or other \nbenefit for another individual. That is so-called therapeutic cloning. \nI call it destructive cloning. Some call it therapeutic.\n\n[[Page S12145]]\n\n  Let's see what the respondents said. This is how the question was put \nforth:\n\n       Some scientists want to use human cloning for medical \n     treatments. They would produce a fertilized egg, or human \n     embryo, that's an exact genetic copy of a person, and then \n     take cells from this embryo to provide medical treatments for \n     that person. Supporters say this could lead to medical \n     breakthroughs. Opponents say it could lead to the creation of \n     a cloned person because someone could take an embryo that was \n     cloned for medical treatments and use it to produce a child.\n\n  That was the question. That is the way it was phrased on therapeutic \ncloning. It might produce medical breakthroughs but also a reproductive \nclone.\n  How did the people respond to the question?\n  Sixty-three percent said therapeutic cloning should be illegal and 33 \npercent held the opposing view.\n  Even framed on just the issue of therapeutic cloning, 63 percent say: \nNo, I don't want to do that. I don't want us to go there. Yet we \ncontinued to dawdle in this body. We did not take up the issue. We \nwould not hear it or bring it up on the floor until now. It is the \npending business with a 6-month moratorium. It is not a complete ban. \nIt is a complete ban for the 6 months. But after that, this would \nsunset.\n  I think this is a very prudent move that this body should take in \naddressing this highly controversial, highly problematic and monumental \nbioethical issue. Our Nation is currently wrestling with monumental \nbioethical issues. As I mentioned, the House of Representatives has \ndealt with this issue. They have passed a ban on human cloning with a \n100-vote margin. The President keeps calling for it. This body has not \nacted.\n\n  On these bioethical issues, many of which I have raised on the floor \npreviously--and I am going to keep raising in the future--we need to \ndebate all these issues, but we need to act now to have a moratorium on \nhuman cloning so the Senate can properly debate the issue and hopefully \nresolve it in the coming 2 or 3 months. That is what we are asking for \nin the underlying amendment.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to address some of the profound \nmoral issues that this Nation is going to need to wrestle with and the \nSenate is going to need to wrestle with for us to deal with the issue \nof human cloning.\n  Human cloning demands the public's attention, in part, because it \nimplicitly revolves around the meaning of human dignity, around the \nmeaning of human life, and the inalienable rights that belong to every \nperson. Should a clone belong to someone or should a clone not belong \nto someone? I think we ought to resolve that issue before it starts \nbeing forced upon us by private companies creating clones.\n  Some will argue that the issue simply needs to be studied before any \nresearch begins, a notion which does not respect the rights of the \nclone. Some people say: Let's just create a group of clones out there, \nand let's see and let's research and let it evolve.\n  Shouldn't we fundamentally deal with the issue first about what is a \nclone? Is it the property of somebody who created it? Is it a person? \nIt is genetically identical to the person from whom it was created. It \nis physically identical. Is this a person or is this a piece of \nproperty?\n  We should be debating that ahead of them being out there in the \npublic. Should we allow people to create clones of themselves for spare \nbody parts? That would be down the road a longways, but people are \nthinking about those sorts of things now. We now have the creation of \nthe first human clone.\n  I think clearly we should err on the side of caution at this point in \ntime. We should call a timeout. We should have a 6-month moratorium so \nwe can all sit down and think about this.\n  This is not going to kill the research into helpful areas of \nresearch. Some people looking at this are saying: OK. They are \nconfusing it with embryonic stem cell research, which I personally have \na deep problem with because you are destroying an embryo to create that \nresearch. But this moratorium does not apply to embryonic stem cell \nresearch. That is going on. There is even Federal funding for some \nembryonic stem cell research, as the President outlined in an August \nspeech with the NIH, much with which I continue to disagree.\n  I think we ought to focus on the adult stem cell. Be that as it may, \nthe embryonic stem cell work is going on and would not be affected by \nthis moratorium.\n  What this moratorium goes at is saying: Do not create human clones \nfor any purposes. Do not create that. After a period of 6 months it \nexpires.\n  So for those purposes, I think this is an entirely appropriate issue \nfor us to push the pause button. The alternative of this is for us to \ndo nothing. But if we do nothing, if we do not put a pause on this, you \nare going to see a lot more headlines such as the one shown on this \nmagazine. You are going to see a lot more human clones or you are going \nto hear about them being implanted in women once they get to the point \nwhere the technology is such that that can take place. You are going to \nsee all that taking place and this body will not have even spoken. We \nwill not have said, yes, we agree or we disagree. The President has \nspoken and the House has spoken, but we will not have even said, OK, we \nagree we should or we disagree. We will not have done anything.\n\n  That is why I plead with the sponsors of the bill that we should take \nup this particular issue. We would allow this amendment that has the \nimportant energy language in it for energy security that contains the \nimportant moratorium on human cloning. And that would be allowed to be \nvoted on by this body. We would not have a cloture vote that rules out \nthe vote on these two imminently important issues that need to come \nbefore this body at this particular time.\n  So I plead with my colleagues, do not vote on a procedure that knocks \noff these two very important issues. Let us have a vote on these two \nissues.\n  We are going to be in town. We should take up these very important \nissues that are of immediate importance and need to be considered. I \nlook forward to discussing this further with my colleagues as we get a \nchance to bring this amendment up for a vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nOhio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/29/senate-section/article/S12145-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12145-S12147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AN ENERGY POLICY AS STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the amendment to the \nunderlying bill before the Senate.\n  I think the Senator from Kansas has spoken eloquently on the need to \npass a moratorium on human cloning. It is interesting to note that \nabout 80 percent of the people in this great Nation agree with that. It \nis also interesting to note that the other portion of the amendment \ncalling for an energy policy for this country is also supported by \nabout 80 percent of the people in this country. Although I do not \nordinarily pay that much attention to polls, I say, in this case, the \npolls reflect good public policy for the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, with all the debate that has been going on in this \nbody and throughout the Nation as to whether or not we actually need a \nstimulus bill, I reiterate my view that, yes, we do need a stimulus \nbill.\n  It is important that we pass a bill from several points of view.\n  Psychologically, the American people need a stimulus bill. For all \nthe talk over the last couple of months about how much we need a \nstimulus bill, the public has now grown to expect we will pass a \nstimulus bill. I think that has been taken into consideration in the \ndecisions the American public has been making. They see it as a \npositive measure, one that will bring us out of our economic doldrums \nand put things back on track.\n  As my colleagues know, the National Bureau of Economic Research \nreported earlier this week what many of us knew; and that is, our \ncountry is in recession. The people in my State of Ohio have known that \nsince last year.\n  We need to spark our economy by getting businesses to boost \ninvestment. We need a stimulus package to help raise consumer \nconfidence and get the American people spending again. As you know, \nconsumer spending makes up two-thirds of our economy. We have to get \nbuying. That is what we need to do: We have to get buying.\n  We need an economic stimulus bill that will put money in people's \npockets, one that will restore consumer confidence, give businesses the \nmoney\n\n[[Page S12146]]\n\nthey need to survive by letting them recapture taxes they paid in the \npast.\n  We need a bill that will lower people's tax rates by expanding the \namount of earnings that are taxed at the 10-percent marginal rate. We \nneed a stimulus package that provides a ``life preserver'' to the \nunemployed by giving them 13 additional weeks of unemployment benefits \nand one that responds to their health care needs.\n  One proposal that responds to what Americans want is the Centrist \nCoalition package that the Presiding Officer is completely familiar \nwith and that has been sponsored, on a bipartisan basis, by the \nPresiding Officer, Senators John Breaux, Olympia Snowe, Zell Miller, \nand Susan Collins.\n  Regardless of what we do involving a stimulus bill, the American \npeople expect us to work together in a bipartisan fashion. They see \nPresident Bush doing that. He is more worried about protecting the \nNation's interests than in partisan politics.\n  Indeed, some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle have been \ncritical of the President because he has not been partisan enough. In \nfact, he has gone the extra mile, I believe, to be nonpartisan.\n  The American people believe that Congress' motives are the same as \nthe President's. If they become convinced otherwise, that we are \nworking for special interests or succumbing to our past bad habits of \nplaying politics, the consequences are going to be devastating.\n  It will lower their confidence in us and in the economic future of \nour Nation. Things changed on the 11th of September. Those of us in \nCongress should never forget it.\n  There is one other action we need to take to stimulate our economy, \nimprove and enhance public health and the environment, secure our \ncompetitive position in the global marketplace, and secure our homeland \nand national security. That action is the adoption of an energy policy \nfor this Nation.\n  That is why I am so enthusiastic about the amendment to the \nunderlying bill. Given the tragedy of September 11 and the actions that \nhave occurred in the aftermath, enacting an energy plan is much more \nrelevant than ever before.\n  As far as I am concerned, and many others, our adoption of an energy \npackage is, in the long term, more important to this country than the \neconomic stimulus package.\n  Because of the situation in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf and \nSouthwest and Central Asia, we are more vulnerable today than ever \nbefore.\n  You can see from this chart that one-fourth of our crude oil imports, \n27.18 percent, come from the Middle East. Consider the following \nnumbers: Iraq, 6.83 percent; Kuwait, 2.9 percent; Saudi Arabia, 16.79 \npercent; the United Arab Emirates, about three one-hundreths of 1 \npercent; Oman, less than three one-hundreths of 1 percent; Yemen, \nthree-tenths of 1 percent. Given the near constant instability in the \nregion, it should give my colleagues little comfort to know that we are \nso reliant on that part of the world.\n  OPEC, which produces approximately 40 percent of the world's oil \nsupply, has threatened to cut oil production 4 separate times this \nyear, and they cut oil production a total of 3.5 million barrels per \nday or 13 percent this year. I know this is a figure that can be \ndifficult for people to comprehend, but every day, the United States \nreceives 750,000 barrels of oil from Iraq. If we look at the chart, \nover 6.8 percent of the oil we import every day comes from Iraq.\n  In December, the United Nations will be conducting a periodic review \nof Iraq's oil-for-food program. In the past Iraq has suspended exports \nduring the review in order to press their case that the program be \nallowed to continue uninhibited by the United Nations. This could \nhappen again.\n  As many of you know, Iraq could be next on the list of nations that \nwe go after because of their threat to world peace. It would be surreal \nif we were importing oil from Iraq at the same time we were engaging in \nantiterrorist activities against that nation.\n  It was strange enough that when we had the last oil crunch last year, \nwe were providing them with technology to increase their oil production \nwhile at the same time we were conducting air sorties over their no-fly \nzone. We were bombing them on one hand and providing them technology so \nthey could increase their oil production at the same time. It doesn't \nmake sense.\n  The attack on Washington and New York could make things even more \nunpredictable as support for the United States by oil-producing Arab \nnations could bring Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida attacks on them. It is \nimportant to make it clear that Osama bin Laden would dearly like to \nbring down the Saudi government because of its Western influence and \nthe alleged exploitation by the United States of Saudi oil. Remember, \nthe Saudis provide 16.8 percent of our oil imports.\n  On the domestic front, we are also in trouble. The refinery fire in \nIllinois this past August decreased the available supply of gasoline \nwhile our inventory was already low. That caused prices to jump in my \nState of Ohio and other Midwest States. The price of gasoline jumped up \n30 cents per gallon in Ohio over a 2-week period because of a fire at a \nrefinery.\n  We have had no new refineries built in almost 26 years, while the \nnumber of refineries has dropped from 231 in 1983 to 155 today. While \nthe refineries today are more efficient, they are not getting the job \ndone. When a refinery shuts down for repairs or accidents such as \nfires, it creates price spikes that can be felt across the Nation.\n  We should not be lulled into complacency because of the temporary low \ncost of gasoline. If you travel the country, the price is down. We must \ndo more to increase domestic production of oil in the United States.\n  Our transmission system also needs to be improved and opened up. We \ndon't have the infrastructure in place to transmit natural gas and the \npipelines to transmit oil. Last year one of the reasons we had the \nlarge increase in gasoline prices in the Midwest was because of a break \nin an oil pipeline coming up from Texas and another one coming from \nWolverine, MI. Those two events skyrocketed the price of oil in Ohio \nand many other States in the Midwest.\n\n  Because of this, last month I introduced the Environmental \nStreamlining of Energy Facilities Act with Senator Landrieu. Our bill \nwill streamline the siting process for pipelines and transmission \nlines.\n  Utility costs are another major factor in our Nation's competitive \nposition in the global marketplace. Long before the events of September \n11, utility costs were exacerbating the recession in Ohio and the \nMidwest. We need to assure Americans that they can count on reasonable, \nconsistent energy costs if we expect to get their confidence back in \nterms of the economy.\n  As a major manufacturing State, energy is the backbone of my State, \nand Ohio and the Midwest are the backbone of this Nation's economy. \nTwenty-three percent of our Nation's gross State product for \nmanufacturing is concentrated in five States which comprise the \nMidwest; Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin. For example, \nwhen you compare Ohio's manufacturing production with the New England \nStates, Ohio's gross State product for manufacturing is higher than all \nsix of the New England States combined. Energy is the backbone of the \nU.S. economy. And without a reliable supply, we are not competitive in \nthe world marketplace.\n  Congress needs to act on an energy bill as soon as possible. It needs \nto be done on a bipartisan basis.\n  This chart is really very illuminating. It looks at projected demand \nfor energy in this country between now and 2020. The green line is what \nwe are going to need. The red line is based on current production and \nshows what we will have available to meet the demands for energy in \nthis country. As my colleagues can see, there is a large canyon between \nthe lines that needs to be filled. That means that we are going to have \nto produce more oil, more gas, use more coal, produce more nuclear \nenergy, if we are going to take care of this large gap.\n  Many of my colleagues would argue that the solution to our need for \nenergy is the issue of renewables and other alternatives. The fact is, \ntoday, renewables, that includes hydro- and non-hydropower, take care \nof only a fraction of our energy needs in the United States of America. \nThat is surprising, because I have had some colleagues come to the \nfloor and argue\n\n[[Page S12147]]\n\nthat all we need are acres and acres of windmills and acres and acres \nof solar panels and that will take care of our energy problem. The fact \nis, solar and wind power make up only one-tenth of one percent of our \nenergy needs. There is no way that we are going to be able to deal with \nour energy problem with renewables because if you look at the bottom \nline, this purple line, going out to 2020, you can see that it is going \nto represent a very small part of the production we have in America.\n  There is no question, we need more energy. We need more oil. We need \nmore gas. We need more nuclear. We need more coal. While conservation \nhelps, it is not going to meet our estimated consumption without \ndrastically changing America's standard of living. We cannot kid \nourselves and think otherwise.\n  Although it won't get the entire job done, a good beginning in our \ngoal of achieving a solid energy policy is a bill that is currently on \nthe Senate calendar, H.R. 4, and which is part of the amendment to the \nunderlying bill before the Senate that was submitted today by Senator \nLott.\n  It is a good beginning. Those of us who have been on this issue for a \nlong time would like to see amendments dealing with an ethanol \ncomponent which will help decrease our dependence on foreign oil. We \nneed to use more ethanol. We need to have an electricity title to \nimprove nationwide delivery. We need more funding for clean coal \ntechnologies and a nuclear title, including Price-Anderson \nreauthorization.\n  It is a beginning, a big beginning, a bill that passed the House of \nRepresentatives and one that should be passed in the Senate.\n  I hope when Monday comes and this body has an opportunity to vote on \nthe issue of cloture dealing with the amendments to the underlying bill \nthat we will vote to allow those amendments to be debated by the \nSenate. It is important not only to the economic well-being of our \ncountry, but it is important to our national security.\n  We cannot allow ourselves to be lulled into a false sense of \ncomplacency simply because energy prices have stabilized. People say, \n``Natural gas prices are down, George,'' and, ``Oil prices are down, \nGeorge.'' The fact is that they have been down before and we have seen \nthem go up. These prices are like a yo-yo, up and down and I am worried \nthat one day, we are going to end up hanging at the end of the string.\n  It is time for us to act. As sure as the Sun will rise, so too will \nprices. OPEC will make sure it happens. The longer we wait to pass an \nenergy bill, the more vulnerable this Nation will be to supply \ndisruptions, which will, in turn, have a dramatic impact on our \neconomy, our environment, our health and, yes, our national security.\n  The time has come for the Senate to act and adopt an energy policy \nfor the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/29/senate-section/article/S12147-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12147-S12152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Ohio for \noutlining his position on the legislation we are discussing, the energy \nbill, H.R. 4. His presentation certainly summarized the fact that this \nindeed is in the national security interest of our Nation. He pointed \nout that our continued dependence on such unreliable sources as Iraq, \nat a time when we are not sure what our next move will be, puts us in a \nrather embarrassing position. He has certainly highlighted the \nvulnerability of this country, which is growing; there is absolutely no \nquestion about that.\n  The question we have--legitimate question--is just whether or not \nH.R. 4, which has passed the House of Representatives and is before us, \ndoes the job as a comprehensive energy bill. I am going to spend a \nlittle time on that because I think the public deserves to know what is \nin H.R. 4.\n  I will again ask my colleagues to reflect on the vote that is going \nto take place on Monday. This is not a vote on the issue of ANWR; this \nis a vote on the entire bill that passed the House of Representatives. \nA vote will be seen and read strictly as a vote on passing an energy \nbill. I think that is significant. It is a vote for or against passing \nan energy bill that has passed the House of Representatives.\n  With that, of course, is the cloning ban. I support that. The Senator \nfrom Kansas made an excellent presentation on the merits of that. It is \nrather unusual to see such devoid issues brought together, but that \nsometimes happens in this body. It is important to point that out and \nhighlight that Senator Brownback's presentation is simply a 6-month \nban. What we are seeing here on cloning is the scientific and medical \nmovement is so fast that we are not sure where the ethical evaluation \nshould come down. Therefore, a 6-month moratorium on cloning is \ncertainly in order. I certainly support that.\n\n  Here is what H.R. 4 does for the Nation. The amendment is the \nlegislative portion of the President's comprehensive energy policy. It \naims to secure America's energy future with a new national energy \nstrategy that is designed to reduce energy demand, increase energy \nefficiency and supply, and enhance our energy infrastructure and our \nenergy security.\n  I think that should address the issue some have raised that this is \nnothing but a very narrow bill containing ANWR. Let me tell you what we \nhave in here in the sense of reducing demand. This bill reauthorizes \nFederal energy conservation programs and directs the Federal Government \nto take leadership in energy conservation with new energy-saving goals.\n  Secondly, it expands Federal energy savings performance contracting \nauthority. It increases the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, \nLIHEAP. It provides weatherization and State energy program \nauthorization levels to meet the needs of low-income Americans. It \nexpands the EPA and the Department of Energy's so-called energy star \nprogram. It directs the EPA and the Department of Energy to determine \nwhether energy star labels should be extended to additional products. \nWe used to see seals of the Underwriters Laboratories. This is much \nlike that, but these stars are awarded for reduction in energy use. In \nother words, you can get a better, more efficient refrigerator, but you \nprobably won't because your other one is working just fine. But these \nnew ones deserve a particular rating and some identification. That is \nwhat the energy star program is all about. It highlights that this is \nindeed an energy-saving device and technology that has been put on your \niron, refrigerator, or dishwasher.\n  We need to encourage Americans to go out and buy these. But, \nobviously, some are reluctant because theirs is working fine. But they \ncan reduce energy consumption and therefore their energy bill. It \ndirects the DOE to set standards for appliance standby mode energy use. \nIt reduces light truck fuel consumption by 5 billion gallons over 6 \nyears. Now this is the CAFE--people are saying, ``Where are your CAFE \nsavings?'' It directs the DOE, in the sense of light truck fuel \nconsumption, to reduce it by 5 billion gallons over 6 years. It also \nimproves Federal fleet fuel economy and expands the use of hybrid \nvehicles.\n  What do we mean by Federal fleet? We say before we put mandates on \nthe general public, let's put it on the Government fleet and see how it \nworks. That is kind of the old saying that charity begins at home. So \nit will improve the Federal fleet economy. It increases funding for the \nDOE's energy conservation and efficiency R programs designed to \nreduce consumption of energy. It expands HUD programs to promote \nenergy-efficient single and multifamily housing. That should answer \npretty much the concern some have raised, well, you don't have anything \nin your bill to reduce demand. I think we do.\n  On the issue of increased supply, we have provisions for \nenvironmentally sensitive oil and gas exploration on the Arctic Coastal \nPlain. That is ANWR. I will talk about ANWR later. Clearly, the \nreserves are there. It is estimated to be between 5 and 16 billion \nbarrels. We have an average somewhere in between 5 and 16. It will be \nas big as\n\n[[Page S12148]]\n\nPrudhoe Bay, now producing the 13 billionth barrel. We can get 10 out \nin the field--the largest field ever found before. I have a chart here \nthat shows a comparison with our good neighbors from Texas, and I am \nsure my staff can find it in a moment or two. As they look, I will move \ninto the other areas of increased supply.\n  I think we all assimilate in our minds domestic oil reserves coming \nfrom the great State of Texas, and the great State of Texas has been \nproducing a lot of oil for a long time. This says: ANWR, More Oil Than \nTexas. This is from the Energy Information Administration which reports \nthat Texas proven crude oil reserves are 5.3 billion barrels.\n  In 1998, the USGS estimated there is a 95-percent chance of more than \n5.7 billion barrels from ANWR, a 50/50 chance of more than 10 billion \nbarrels of oil and a 5-percent chance of more than 16 billion barrels \nof oil. So if we want to use the average, ANWR has more potential than \nTexas.\n  I have heard my friend, the junior Senator from Massachusetts, speak \nin generalities about why this should not be open. I have never heard a \ngood explanation as to whether or not he believes there is evidence to \nsuggest it cannot be opened safely, but he does generalize that it is \ninsignificant.\n  If the oil in ANWR were to be the average of 10 billion barrels, ANWR \nwould supply 321,428 barrels per day to the State of Massachusetts. \nThat would last the State of Massachusetts 85.2 years. The State of \nConnecticut uses 216,000 barrels per day. It would last Connecticut 126 \nyears. South Dakota uses 59,000 barrels a day. It would provide South \nDakota with 460.3 years for their petroleum needs. I throw that out \nsimply as a matter of comparison when individuals say the increased \nsupply is insignificant. It is not insignificant.\n  Further, increased supply authorizes new oil and gas R for \nunconventional and ultra-deep-water production. We are seeing that in \nthe Gulf of Mexico. That is where our new finds are, in deep water. The \nindustry has done an extraordinary job of advanced technology, and they \nhave been very fortunate. They have had very few accidents. It provides \nroyalty relief incentives for deepwater leases in the central and \nwestern Gulf of Mexico. It streamlines the administration of oil and \ngas leases on Federal land. It authorizes the Department of Energy to \ndevelop accelerated clean coal power initiatives. So it recognizes the \nsignificant role of coal, which makes up nearly 50 percent of our power \ngeneration in this country.\n  It establishes alternative fuel vehicles and green school bus \ndemonstration programs. That should appeal to many Members. It reduces \nthe royalty rate for development of biothermal energy and expedites \nleases. It provides for regular assessment of renewable energy \nresources and impediments to their use. It streamlines the licensing \nprocess for hydroelectric dams and encourages increased output. It \nprovides new authorization for fossil, nuclear, hydrogen, biomass, and \nrenewable R\n  These things are included to increase the supply, but they are not \nonly in ANWR. There is authorization for new technology, hydrogen, \nbiomass, renewable R, because we want to remove our dependence even \ngreater on imported oil. The difficulty many people fail to recognize \nis America and the world move on oil because we do not have any other \nalternative. We wish we did. We can generate electricity from coal, \nfrom gas, from nuclear, from wind, but we cannot move America and we \ncannot move the world. That is why we are becoming so dependent on \nMideast sources.\n  If this bill passes this House and this Senate, two things are going \nto happen. We are going to send a message to OPEC. The message is going \nto be loud and clear that the United States is committed to reduce its \ndependence on OPEC. OPEC, I think, will read that and decide, all \nthings being equal, they had better be careful how they operate that \ncartel because if they move it up too high, why, obviously it is not \ngoing to be in their interest. So I think it will be a curb on prices \nbecause the more we produce domestically, the less we will import. As \nwe know, those countries need those gas fuels, particularly the Saudis.\n\n  Finally, in the area of enhanced infrastructure and energy security, \nit sets goals for reduction of United States dependence on foreign oil \nand Iraqi imports. It initiates the review of existing rights of way on \nFederal lands for energy potential. It directs the Department of Energy \nto implement R and demonstrate use of distributed energy resources. \nIt invests in a new transmission infrastructure R program to ensure \nreliable electricity.\n  It requires a study of boutique fuels and issues to minimize refinery \nbottlenecks and supply shortages because, as we remember, it was not so \nvery long ago under the previous administration, when we had a shortage \nof heating oil in the Northeast in the wintertime, the decision was \nmade to open up SPR. We took 30 million barrels out of SPR. Suddenly we \nfound we did not have the refining capacity because we had not built \nnew refineries in this country in 20, 25 years, so all we did was \ndisplace what we were importing. That is kind of the situation. So this \ndoes provide some relief.\n  It initiates supply potential for renewable transportation of fuels \nto displaced oil imports, it offers scholarships to train the next \ngeneration of energy workers, and it prohibits pipelines from being \nplaced on national registers of historic places. That is what the bill \ndoes.\n  Last night the majority whip, Senator Reid, my good friend, came to \nthe Chamber, and I do not know whether he was ill informed or not, but \nin any event I will comment a little bit on his statement. I assume it \nwas an attempt to support the majority leader's priorities from the \nstandpoint of the remaining time we have in this session and what those \npriorities should be. I know many of my friends on both sides of the \naisle feel very strongly about the railroad retirement legislation, but \nthe majority leader stated he thinks it is more important this body \nconsider the railroad retirement legislation than comprehensive energy \nlegislation. That is contrary to polling information I just presented. \nThat polling information, as I said, indicated that 95 percent of \nAmericans say Federal action on an energy bill is important. That is \nnot enough because 72 percent of the Americans say passing an energy \nbill is a higher priority than other actions Congress might take.\n  We have seen polls from time to time. We take them or leave them, but \nthis was an IPSOS-Reid poll done in November. So clearly there is a \nlittle bit of difference expressed by the polling information on what \nthe priorities should be.\n  Now, evidently, the leader thinks it is more important that we \nconsider a farm bill. It is kind of interesting about how we set \npriorities because the farm bill does not expire until the end of next \nyear. Does it have the same prioritization as the exposure we are \nseeing in the Persian Gulf, the danger of terrorism to Saudi Arabia in \nbringing down the Royal Family, a couple of tankers colliding in a \nterrorist attack in the Straits of Hormuz, terrorizing oil fields? \nThese are the crises that would come about, and clearly with our \nincreased dependence on Iraqi oil and the fact we are looking to \nfinalize things over there against those who sponsor terrorism, it is \nbeyond me how the leader would consider the farm bill as being more \nimportant, particularly when it is not due to expire until the end of \nnext year.\n  I know what good soldiers are about. I have been in the majority and \nI have been in the minority, and sometimes we are asked to defend the \nindefensible. That is politics. I think the whip is doing a good job as \nwe have come to understand he always does in the Senate. However, I \nreally cannot stand by and watch the facts simply evaporate. As I \nindicated, we simply cannot stand by and watch the facts simply \nevaporate. I emphasize ``facts.''\n\n  During his comments, the majority whip stated that the overall \nbenefits to the country for developing a small area of the Arctic \nCoastal Plain were ``nonexistent.'' I find it rather ironic that he \nwould make that blatant statement. Nonexistent? Did the majority whip \nreally say the overall benefit to the country would be nonexistent when \nwe have seen the Teamsters, the unions, the veterans, the minority \ngroups in this country say they think this is the most important thing \nfor the Senate to take up, and the fact that the House has passed it \nsends a strong message. We have some work to do.\n\n[[Page S12149]]\n\n  When he said that would be nonexistent, I asked myself, can he really \nbelieve that? Does he really think the facts support his assertion? \nKnowing that the majority whip would never deliberately mislead other \nSenators, I only conclude he doesn't know all the facts. He, as well as \nthe majority leader, have never taken the time to visit the area. We \nhave made repeated offers. I have taken many Members there.\n  It is ironic we only have to justify on the side of the proponents \nthe merits of the issue based on our personal experience, the \nexperience of my senior colleague, Senator Stevens, and Representative \nDon Young. The administration has seen the area, physically gone up \nthere. The Secretary of Interior has been up there twice. I took her up \nlast February. We took off with a wind chill factor of 72 degrees below \nzero. It is tough country.\n  One chart shows the bleakness of the Arctic in the wintertime. I am \nalso convinced the only way the Senator might learn those facts, if he \ndoesn't visit the area, would be if I were to share more and more facts \nwith him in the hopes he will understand. I am here to make the Nation \naware of the significance of what this could mean to our energy \nsecurity. I will also make the Nation aware of the benefits to the \ncountry in opening a small sliver of the Arctic Coastal Plain for \ndevelopment.\n  Today, I will share with the Senate what the Clinton administration \nsaid about ANWR. I think my colleagues should know what the previous \nadministration said about ANWR, as related by the Energy Information \nAgency in May of 2000, an agency created by Congress to give unbiased \nenergy information. I will come back to this in a moment.\n  ANWR is the area on this chart to the right on the map of Alaska. \nAlso shown is the State of South Carolina for a size comparison. There \nare 19 million acres in ANWR. We have 365 in the whole State. ANWR, on \nthe big chart, the 19 million acres, is already predestined by Congress \nfor specific designation. The darker yellow is part of the refuge. The \nlighter yellow is in a wilderness in perpetuity. That is about 8 \nmillion acres. The green at the top is the 1002 area, or the ANWR \ncoastal plain. The geologists say this is a very productive area. It is \n60 miles from Prudhoe Bay. Prudhoe Bay, of course, is the field that \nhas been producing for some 27 years.\n  The TAPS pipeline is an 800-mile pipeline traversing the length of \nAlaska. Interestingly enough, when that was built 27 years ago, we had \narguments in the Senate whether that could be built safely. What would \nhappen to the animals? What would happen to a hot pipeline in \npermafrost. Would it break? All the same arguments are being used \ntoday. There was a tie in the Senate, and the Vice President came in \nand broke the tie. I cannot recall how many hundreds of billions of \nbarrels we have received, but for an extended period of time that was \nflowing at 2 million barrels a day. It is a little over 1 million \nbarrels at this time.\n  This map shows another area worthy of some consideration. That is the \nred dot. That is the footprint associated with the development. In the \nHouse bill that is 2,000 acres. I know the occupant of the chair knows \nwhat 2,000 acres is. Robert Redford has a farm in Utah of 5,000 acres. \nKeep in mind this authorization is for 2,000 acres, a permanent \nfootprint, out of 19 million acres. Is that unreasonable? I don't think \nit is.\n  Some are under the impression this is a pristine area that has not \nbeen subject to any development or any population. Of course, a village \nis at the top of the map. Real people live there. They have hopes and \naspirations for a better lifestyle and better working conditions, jobs, \nhealth conditions, schools. There is a picture of some of the Eskimo \nkids going to school and nobody there to shovel the walks. There is \nalso a picture of the public buildings, in front of the community hall, \nwith pictures of the Eskimo's two modes of transportation: One is a \nsnow machine and the other is a bicycle. That should take care of the \nmyth that nobody is up there. Real people live there.\n  The Coastal Plain comprises approximately 8 percent of the 19 million \nacres. ANWR is along the geological trend that is productive in the \nsense that the oil flows in the same general area. This is the largest \nunexplored potential production onshore base in the entire United \nStates, according to the Energy Information Agency.\n  I return now to the statement of the Clinton administration: This is \nthe largest unexplored potential onshore base in the United States. The \nEnergy Information Agency, under the Clinton administration, did not \nthink the benefits of ANWR would be nonexistent on our Nation's energy \nsupplies. That is why I am amused that the majority whip would use the \nterm ``nonexistent.''\n\n  The Department of Interior says if the Energy Information \nAdministration isn't good enough, how about the Department of the \nInterior under Bruce Babbitt?\n\n  I am wondering if that argument isn't enough to convince the majority \nwhip that the benefits of ANWR are not nonexistent on energy supplies.\n  According to a 1998 Department of the Interior study under the \nprevious administration, there is a 95-percent probability--that is 19 \nin 20 chances--that at least 5.7 billion barrels of oil in ANWR is \nrecoverable. That is about half what we would recover initially from \nPrudhoe Bay. There is a 50-50 chance that there is 10.3 billion barrels \nof recoverable oil. And there is a 5-percent chance at least 16 billion \nbarrels are recoverable.\n  These are not my numbers. These are not coming from Frank Murkowski \nor Don Young or Ted Stevens. These aren't the environmental fundraiser \ngroups' numbers. These are Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's \nscientific numbers.\n  I fail to recognize how the majority whip can add these up and \nsuggest that it is nonexistent, as was stated by the whip. How much oil \nis there reason to believe is there? We don't know. We won't know until \nwe get in there. Senators might wonder how much these numbers add up \nto. How much impact would oil from ANWR have on our Nation's energy \nsecurity, our economy, our jobs?\n  Let me try to put that in perspective. According to the Independent \nEnergy Information Administration, at the end of 2000, Texas had 5.27 \nbillion barrels of proven reserves. That means there is a 95-percent \nchance that ANWR has more oil than all of Texas. Think of the jobs \nassociated with the oil industry in Texas.\n  California has 3.8 billion barrels of proven reserves. There is a 95-\npercent chance that ANWR has more oil than all of California.\n\n  New Mexico has 718 million barrels of proven reserve. There is a 95-\npercent chance that ANWR can recover almost 8 times as much oil as is \nproven to exist in New Mexico.\n  Louisiana has 529 million barrels of proven reserves. Oklahoma, 610 \nmillion; Michigan, 56 million; Pennsylvania, 15 million; Nevada, \nMassachusetts, and Connecticut had no proven reserves.\n  In fact, the Energy Information Agency states that the lower 48 \nStates have total proven reserves of 17,184,000,000 barrels of oil. \nThat's it, 17 billion. This could come in at the high end. If we are \nlucky enough to hit Secretary Babbitt's high number of 16 billion \nbarrels, ANWR would almost double U.S. reserves.\n  These are not my figures. They are figures of the previous Secretary \nof the Interior. Are these benefits nonexistent, as the whip has \nindicated last evening?\n  I hope this will clarify the issue for the majority whip, and any \nother Senators who might wonder whether ANWR would have an impact on \nour energy security, economy, or our jobs. To repeat, ANWR could \npotentially double our reserves overnight. Do I know it will? No. Does \nanyone else? No. But I will certainly take the word of the Clinton \nadministration scientists over the word of the environmental \nfundraising groups. They have never wanted this issue resolved because \nthey would no longer have their best fundraising issue to lie their way \ninto well-intentioned American wallets. It is easy to understand how \npeople might be misled. These groups have simply not been telling the \ntruth, period.\n  I am happy to debate any and all, at any time, on the merits of this \nissue. If there are those who do not believe me, or the Clinton \nadministration, how about organized labor? Teamsters, maritime, \nconstruction trade unions,\n\n[[Page S12150]]\n\nthe AFL/CIO, operating engineers, and many other unions have joined us \nin support of this legislation. They think it will have a great impact \non the economy, on our national security, on our jobs. They estimate \nbetween 250,000 and 750,000 jobs will be created here at home by \nopening ANWR.\n  They do not believe the benefits to our Nation are nonexistent, as \nthe majority whip has indicated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent I may have another 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to take a note here, \nrelative to the number of ships that would have to be built if, indeed, \nANWR were opened. A lot of people overlook the reality that Alaskan oil \nis unique. It has to move in U.S.-flagged vessels because the Jones Act \nrequires that. Any movement of goods and material between two U.S. \nports has to be moved in a U.S.-flagged vessel. So all the oil from \nAlaska moves down in ships built in U.S. yards, with U.S. crews, and \nflying the American flag.\n  This is the largest concentration of U.S.-flagged tankers in \nexistence in our country, in this particular trade. They would require, \nif ANWR opens, 19 double-hulled tankers which would add about $4 \nbillion to the economy and create 5,000 jobs each for 17 years because \nthese new ships will come on as replacements for others.\n  I do not know if those benefits are nonexistent, but to the States--\nMaine, where they are likely to build some of these ships; Alabama, \nMississippi, Texas, Washington, California--these are jobs. These are \ngood jobs, good jobs in U.S. shipyards.\n\n  What about these other ships that bring in oil, the 56 percent that \nare coming from overseas? They bring their oil in foreign-flagged \nvessels. They don't have the deep pockets of an Exxon.\n  I will conclude because I see other Senators are here waiting for \nrecognition. But I want to ask again, the benefits are nonexistent? I \nhope this will clarify the issue for the majority whip and any other \nSenators who might wonder whether ANWR would have any impact on our \nenergy security, the economy, and jobs.\n  To repeat, ANWR could almost double our reserves overnight. Do I know \nit will? Does anyone? No. But I, again, would take the word of the \nClinton administration scientists over the word of the environmental \nfundraising groups. They have never wanted this issue resolved because, \nas I indicated, they would no longer have the best fundraising issue to \nlie their way into well-intentioned American wallets.\n  It would be easy to understand how they might be misled but, as I \nhave indicated, they pulled the wool over the public's eyes. This is an \nissue that involves our national energy security. It is a very \nfundamental issue.\n  I will conclude by, again, referring to the other organizations--the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion, Vietnam Veterans \nInstitute--which think it is good for the national security. They do \nnot believe the benefits to our Nation are nonexistent, and they ought \nto know. They fought the wars.\n  The House acted on national energy security legislation before \nSeptember 11. Frankly, they have shown up the Senate. In that body, \ncommittees were allowed to advance energy legislation, debate it, and \npass it to the floor for further consideration.\n  Here, the majority leader seized the bill from the committee of \njurisdiction, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, of which I am \na ranking member. I used to be chairman. He has seized the bill from \nthe committee of jurisdiction and has substituted his will for the will \nof the committee. He has bypassed the committee process entirely.\n  I am very disappointed that we were not able to bring around the \nmajority to recognize this matter should go to the committee of \nauthorization and not be taken away from it, but I am not chairman of \nthat committee anymore.\n  Finally, I offer up this question to the Senate: If, indeed, the \nbenefits to this country were nonexistent, there was so little oil \nthere, then why is there such a huge campaign to deny Americans that \noil? We can all ask ourselves why--16 billion barrels of oil, times $30 \na barrel, is almost one-half trillion dollars.\n  It is about $480 billion; $480 billion is nonexistent? If that is the \nprice about the time ANWR comes on line, that means $480 billion stays \nat home rather than being spent abroad for oil. With that kind of \nmoney, we can better provide for our schools, our security, our health \ncare system, our elderly.\n  Here we are today rising before this body at last to take up an \nenergy bill. The amendment offered by Senator Lott is the underlying \nlegislation. Divisions A through G of the amendment will provide us \nwith the remainder of a comprehensive energy policy to guide this \nNation into the future.\n  As I have indicated specifically, these provisions provide ways to do \nthe following: Reduce our demand for energy, increase our domestic \nsupply of energy, invest in our energy infrastructure, and enhance \nenergy security.\n  I will go into more detail at a later time.\n  But for the past decade, America has lacked a comprehensive energy \nstrategy. We are aware of that. Without such a guidebook, our record of \neconomic expansion and resulting growth in demand has outpaced our \nenergy production. We saw a similar situation last year in the sense of \na perfect storm, if you will. All the parts of our energy supply were \nstretched, and there were limits on output. We actually saw that occur.\n  As we know, when supply doesn't meet demand, prices go up. When you \nhave a cartel such as OPEC, they are able to do things that antitrust \nlaws in the United States simply prohibit. They are able to set prices \nby reducing supply. As we all know, when supply doesn't meet demand, \nthe price rises.\n  Rising energy prices have already been blamed by many economists for \nputting us into the recession we now face. It is a matter of particular \nimportance that we develop a comprehensive national energy strategy for \nour economic and our national security.\n  Under previous control of this body by the Republicans, the Senate \nhad a very aggressive timetable. That timetable was to get a \ncomprehensive energy bill passed by the Fourth of July. We were working \non this bill and introduced it shortly after we came in last year in \nlate January. We had a change. And the GOP left a legacy to the other \nside. We have done our part.\n  When I was chairman, our committee had 24 hearings. We heard from 160 \nwitnesses, and we introduced the Murkowski-Breaux bipartisan bill and \nwere ready to move. The President's national energy policy framed the \ndebate.\n  I can see no reason why the Democrats should not have kept this \nschedule. But since they took control, we have had a few hearings and \nheard from some of the same witnesses. We started a markup on the bill \nof the new chairman in August. We engaged in good-faith discussions to \ncome to a consensus only to find our committee stripped of its \njurisdiction by the majority leader because he pulled the plug on the \nEnergy Committee's deliberations and simply took over the process \nbypassing the authorizing committee and bypassing Senator Bingaman, who \nis the chairman. I can only guess why.\n  We had the votes in committee to pass out an energy bill. We asked \nthe majority leader, Senator Daschle, for a date certain. We asked the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Bingaman, for a date certain. The \nstatement from our Senate leadership is there will be no new energy \nbill this year. That statement has been made.\n  At least we are in the Chamber tonight. We have an energy bill up for \nconsideration. I thank all my colleagues who played a role in assuring \nthis would come about, because I made a commitment that we were going \nto bring this matter up before we go out on recess. Now we are in it.\n  In recent weeks, there has been considerable talk of the need to \naddress the Nation's problems in the old spirit in a bipartisan manner. \nI wish we could. We have seen this with respect to an antiterrorist \npackage, the airline security measure, and several other pieces of \nlegislation. Sadly, this air of ``bipartisanship'' has broken down with \nrespect to energy policy. We now find ourselves in a partisan standoff.\n  I think, though, we all agree we need an energy policy. We have one \nwhich\n\n[[Page S12151]]\n\npassed the House. That is before us. It is up to us to address whether \nwe are going to simply walk out of here without an energy policy or \ntake this up seriously, vote it out, get it to conference, and respond \nto the request of our President.\n  We have seen threats of filibusters, suspension of committee \nactivities, and a failure to give the American people a fair, open, and \nhonest debate on this issue.\n  I do not think, and I refuse to accept, that meeting the energy needs \nof this Nation is a partisan issue.\n  At the beginning of the session, I sought out my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle for their ideas and suggestions. And as \ncommittee chairman, I delayed introducing any legislation until a \nmeasure could be developed that reflected their interests. We worked \nhard on that.\n  S. 389, while not perfect, met that requirement and remains the only \nbipartisan comprehensive energy measure introduced in the Senate.\n  At a time when the country is seeking unity and bipartisanship, we \nshould be moving forward with a bipartisan energy bill. Just as we did \nlast year with respect to electricity, we should put the contentious \nissues to a fair and open debate, and vote on them.\n  Repeatedly, the President has called on Congress to pass energy \nlegislation as a part of our efforts to enhance national security.\n  With H.R. 4, the bill now sitting on the Senate calendar, the House \nof Representatives has done its job. Now it's the Senate's turn. The \nbest thing we can do to ensure this Nation's energy security is to act \nnow: take up the House bill, amend it, and go to conference.\n  Make no mistake about it. That is what we should do. This energy \npolicy proposal will create new jobs in domestic production and new \nenergy technologies. This will be a significant economic stimulus that \ncouldn't come any sooner--when the economy needs thousands of new jobs.\n  At stake are billions of dollars in construction spending, hundreds \nof thousands of jobs, and billions of dollars that won't go overseas in \nfuture energy spending.\n  Our increasing dependence on foreign oil helps to support the very \nterrorists we now fight in the Middle East and elsewhere. We import \nnearly a million barrels per day of oil from Iraq, and some of our oil \npayments to Saudi Arabia may have been used against us in the events of \nSeptember 11.\n  As a matter of national importance, we cannot allow our energy \nsecurity to get bogged down in partisanship and procedural maneuvers. \nOne of the purposes of committees is to test various proposals and to \nprovide the Senate with a considered recommendation. A majority of the \nmembers of the Energy Committee have been willing to provide this \nadvice--and report out a bill. Yet the majority leader and the \ncommittee chairman have seen fit to ``short-circuit'' the regular order \nto avoid votes on certain issues. These votes would prevail if we could \nget the matter up in the committee.\n  The American people deserve better than this. They deserve more than \njust partisan sniping on energy issues. We certainly need to provide \nfor the security of our energy supply. We need to deal with our \ninfrastructure and our domestic capacity for development, refining and \ntransportation and transmission. And we should take those steps that we \ncan all agree on to promote the energy technologies of the next decade \nand beyond.\n  Our Nation deserves a fair, honest, and open debate on all aspects of \nthe important energy issues, including ANWR. This is a debate that a \nmajority of members were ready to have in committee, but that \nopportunity was denied us. We are ready to have that debate and let the \nvotes fall where they may on all the contentious issues that remain.\n  So let us now finally--since we are on the bill--have this debate so \nwe can look the American people--our constituents--in the eye when we \ngo home for the holidays and say that, yes, we have passed, in the \nnational interest, an energy bill, H.R. 4, which passed the House \noverwhelmingly; and then tell them we are going to do our part to \nprovide safe, secure, and affordable energy supplies now and into the \nfuture.\n  At this critical point in our Nation's history, we clearly need a \nnational energy strategy to ensure a stable, reliable, and affordable \nenergy supply.\n  While many choices have been forced upon us in the aftermath of \nSeptember 11, we now have the chance to choose our energy future. The \nother alternative is simply to dodge the issue. Will we have the \ncourage to act? Will we have the courage to make the difficult \ndecisions we avoided some 10 years ago?\n  In 1995, ANWR was in the omnibus bill. It was an energy bill. It \npassed this body. It was vetoed by the President. Had he signed that \norder, we would know what was in ANWR. We could be producing from ANWR. \nThe question is, When are we going to start?\n  As the President said, there was a good bill passed out of the House \nof Representatives. Now it is the job of the Senate. The Senate can and \nmust act.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in voting for this amendment to \nensure the security of our energy supply, our economy, and our Nation \nfor years to come.\n  I thank the Chair for being patient. We are going to be back on this \ntomorrow. I thank the majority whip for his indulgence as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Before my friend, the distinguished Senator from Alaska, \nleaves the Chamber, I did want to say that I was a little disappointed, \nwhen he went over the reserves in various States, that he said Nevada \nhad nothing.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I think the terminology is ``inexistent.''\n  Mr. REID. Inexistent? The reason I mention that is for 6 years Nevada \nhad the largest single producing oil well in the United States in a \nplace called Railroad Valley. The well went dry about 8 or 9 years ago. \nBut for 6 years it was the best in the country.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I was talking about current reserves, so there very \nwell may have been a well in Nevada, but there isn't anymore.\n  Mr. REID. That we have found yet.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Railroad \nRetirement and Survivor's Improvement Act of 2001. As a Senator from \nWyoming, I represent a State that bears the undeniable mark of the \nrailroads. Many of the towns across the southern corridor of my State \nwere established on the sites of old railroad shanty towns. These \nshanty towns were constructed to house the workers that built the \nrailroads. The railroad workers brought diversity to Wyoming. Many of \nmy constituents with Chinese, Irish and Italian heritages call Wyoming \nhome because their ancestors moved there with the railroad.\n  The railroad is still an integral part of Wyoming today. It \ntransports one of our greatest energy resources, low-sulfur coal, to \nStates that lack our power supply. And today's railroad workers are \nstill an important part of the Wyoming population. I support this bill \nbecause I support providing the survivors of railroad employees with \nthe benefits they require to live out their days in my State and other \nStates. I support this bill for another reason; it is a viable option \nto provide solvency to the railroad retirement fund and increase \nretirement benefits and while lowering employer taxes.\n  These two results may sound mutually exclusive, but I assure you that \nthey are not. The bill authorizes the newly created Railroad Retirement \nTrust Fund to invest the current Railroad Retirement Account in \nsecurities, including stocks and bonds. Even a conservative estimate \nplaces the rate of return on these investments as greater than the \ncurrent rate of return in government accounts. This is the mechanism \nthat allows retirement benefits to increase while taxes decrease.\n  As an accountant, I refrained from sponsoring the bill until I \nreviewed the actuarial report. After examining the report, I determined \nthat the Railroad Retirement Trust Fund would remain well-capitalized \nand able to pay benefits under this legislation far into the future. \nThe actuarial report indicated that this would occur even during \nmediocre economic conditions.\n  This bill would directly benefit Wyoming railroaders and their \nspouses by allowing 100 percent benefits for survivors of eligible \nretirees. It would lower the retirement age from 62 to 60\n\n[[Page S12152]]\n\nyears for employees that have worked at least 30 years for the \nrailroad. Some of my colleagues have asked why we should lower the \nrailroad retirement age when the Social Security retirement age is \nincreasing from 65 to 67. It is important to make a distinction between \nTier I and Tier II benefits in this plan. Tier I benefits are \ncomparable to Social Security benefits, and they do not start paying \nuntil the equivalent Social Security benefits are payed. Currently, \nthat is at age 65. Tier II benefits, which are funded by taxes to the \nrailroad employers and employees, pay the early retirement benefits for \neligible workers. This is very similar to the ``bridge plan'' offered \nby private pension plans. This is important because railroading is a \nphysically rigorous profession that ages a body prematurely and is \nstill considered hazardous.\n  This legislation includes an automatic tax trigger that initiates an \nincrease or decrease of the employer's taxes if the trust fund's amount \nmoves outside of preset barriers. The barriers would ensure that a \ncushion of 4 to 6 years' worth of benefits payable remain in the \naccount. A number of my colleagues have been presenting graphs that \nshow benefit levels falling and employer taxes increasing 20 years \nafter the program is initiated. I do not dispute this. In fact, it \nshows the fund's ability to manage itself and respond to decreases in \nits cushion.\n  As a Wyoming Senator and an accountant, I support the Railroad \nRetirement and Survivor's Improvement Act. I support it as a \nresponsible way to manage the funds entrusted to us by the railroad \nworkers. I support it as a way to fully care for the individuals that \nhave contributed so much to our nation's infrastructure. I ask that my \ncolleagues do the same and pass this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/29/senate-section/article/S12152-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SERVICE MEMBERS OPPORTUNITY COLLEGES\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise to \nbring to the attention of the Senate a true national asset, the Service \nMembers Opportunity Colleges, (SOC). The SOC is a consortium of over \n1500 Colleges and Universities across the Nation that have taken on the \nprivilege of educating our Nation's men and women in uniform.\n  Founded in 1972 the SOC was created to ``provide educational \nopportunities to service members, who, because they frequently moved \nfrom place to place, had trouble completing college degrees.''\n  In fulfilling this primary role the SOC and their member institutions \ncurrently serve hundreds of thousands of service members. They work \nvery hard to provide opportunities for our brave young men and women to \neducate themselves while serving our Nation. Consequently the SOC is \nhelping prepare the future leaders of our military and our country. For \nthis I salute them.\n  However, in addition to their stated mission the SOC, and their \ndirector Dr. Steven Kime, have dedicated themselves to ensuring that \nour men and women in the Guard and Reserve are taken care of when our \nNation calls upon them and they are forced to leave school. The SOC \ndoes this by using their extensive network to ensure that students \ncalled to service are either refunded their tuition or receive credits \nfor later education. Through their hard work SOC has helped create a \nsense of duty among their member institutions who regularly prove their \ndevotion to this Nation by providing help and assistance to their \nstudents called upon to serve.\n  Consequently SOC has ensured that our brave young men and women \ncalled to active duty have one less worry on their already heavy \nshoulders. In these trying times it is this type of duty and leadership \nthat proves our Nation and the American people are without equal.\n  Again, I would like to offer my thanks and admiration to the \nServicemembers Opportunity Colleges and their men and women working so \nhard to make life better for our men and women in uniform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/29/senate-section/article/S12152-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ANOTHER REASON TO CLOSE THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to enter into the Record some \nimportant information about guns and terrorists. Currently, shoppers at \ngun shows may choose to buy firearms from federally licensed firearms \ndealers--or from unlicensed dealers. Since unlicensed sellers are not \nrequired to run Brady background checks, which involves an instant \nbackground check for among other things, criminal history, outstanding \nwarrants and illegal immigration status, gun shows are an important \nsource of guns for criminals and terrorists who would not be able to \nbuy weapons in a store. In fact, several cases have linked the purchase \nof guns at gun shows to terrorists. For example, in Florida, a man \naccused of having ties to the Irish Republican Army testified that he \npurchased thousands of dollars worth of machine guns, rifles, and high-\npowered ammunition at gun shows and proceeded to smuggle them to \nIreland. Now more than ever, we must close the gun show loophole. I \nurge my fellow Senators to support bringing to the floor legislation \nthat will close the gun show loophole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/29/senate-section/article/S12152-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12152-S12153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MAJOR GENERAL PAUL A. WEAVER, JR.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize one of the finest officers in our Armed Forces, Major General \nPaul A. Weaver, Jr., the Director of the Air National Guard. Well known \nand respected by many Members in this chamber, General Weaver will soon \nretire after almost 35 years of selfless service to our country. Today, \nI am honored to acknowledge some of General Weaver's distinguished \naccomplishments and to commend the superb service he has provided to \nthe Air National Guard, the Air Force, and our great Nation.\n  After completing his Bachelor of Science degree in Communicative Arts \nat Ithaca College, New York, Paul Weaver entered the Air Force in 1967 \nand was commissioned through Officer Training School. After earning his \npilot wings, he had flying assignments in the F-4E and O-2A, and \ncompleted overseas tours in Germany and Korea. In 1975, he joined the \nNew York Air National Guard with which he served in increasing levels \nof responsibility. This culminated when he took command of the 105th \nAirlift Group at Stewart Air National Guard Base, New York, in 1985. \nFollowing his nine years as commander, General Weaver served as the Air \nNational Guard's Deputy Director for four years and was appointed the \nDirector of the Air Guard in 1998.\n  General Weaver is a command pilot with more than 2,800 flying hours \nin five different aircraft. He is a veteran of Operations Desert \nShield, Desert Storm, and Just Cause. General Weaver's decorations \ninclude the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, \nMeritorious Service Medal, Aerial Achievement Medal, Air Force \nCommendation Medal with two oak leaf clusters, Combat Readiness Medal \nwith Service Star, and Southwest Asia Service Medal with two oak leaf \nclusters.\n  While serving as Commander of the 105th Airlift Wing, Paul Weaver was \nresponsible for the largest conversion in the history of the Air \nNational Guard. Under his command, the wing converted from the Air \nForce's smallest aircraft, the O-2 Skymaster, to its largest, the C-5 \nGalaxy. During this conversion, he oversaw the largest military \nconstruction program in the history of the reserve forces as he \nliterally rebuilt Stewart Air National Guard Base.\n  As the Air National Guard's Director, General Weaver's \naccomplishments are also noteworthy. He had dedicated each year of his \nterm to a different theme--transition, the enlisted force, the family, \nand employers, thereby providing focus and enhancements to these four \ncrucial areas. In addition, Paul Weaver's modernization, readiness, \npeople, and infrastructure initiatives have enabled a fuller \npartnership role in the Air Force's Expeditionary Aerospace Force. The \nAir Guard achieved all its domestic and global takings and requirements \nwith a force that is also smaller in size. Under General Weaver's \nleadership, the Air National Guard is even more relevant, ready, \nresponsive, and accessible than it has ever been.\n  I would be remiss if I also did not mention that the Air National \nGuard is also fortunate to have another Weaver contributing to its \nsuccess. Besides\n\n[[Page S12153]]\n\nfully supporting his chosen profession, Paul's wife, Cathylee Weaver \nhas had a major impact on the Air Guard's Family Enrichment programs. \nWith dignity and grace, she dedicated time and attention to Air \nNational Guard families, which led to her recently being voted as \nVolunteer of the Year of Family Programs. Clearly, the Air National \nGuard will lose not one, but two, exceptional people.\n  Let me close by saying that as both its Deputy and Director, General \nWeaver has made the Air National Guard a stronger and more capable \npartner for the Air Force. His distinguished and faithful service has \nprovided significant and lasting contributions to our Nation's \nsecurity. I know the members of the Senate will join me in paying \ntribute to this outstanding citizen-airmen and true patriot upon his \nretirement from the Air National Guard. We thank General Weaver, and \nwish him, Cathylee, and the entire Weaver family much health, \nhappiness, and Godspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/29/senate-section/article/S12153-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            KIDS TO KIDS: WARM CLOTHING FOR AFGHAN CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to draw my Colleagues' \nattention to an important initiative that is taking shape in Vermont. \nOn Monday of this week, I attended a very special ceremony at Lawrence \nBarnes School in Burlington to kick off a program called Kids to Kids. \nThe event was organized by Vermont Boy and Girl Scouts and its goal is \nsimple--a drive to collect and send warm clothing to Afghan children. \nMy wife, Liz, and I wholeheartedly agreed to be honorary co-chairs of \nthis program and we are pleased to be part of a mission that involves \nthe Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, the Islamic Society of Vermont, the \nNational Guard and the business community.\n  We in Vermont know the importance of being well-prepared for the \nfrigid winter months, and we are fortunate to be in a position to help. \nBut I am particularly pleased that the impetus for this clothing drive \nhas come from the children. Vermonters have always stood eager and \nready to lend a hand to those in need, and it fascinates me to see how \nthis tradition passes from one generation to the next. It is the Boy \nScouts, Girl Scouts, and school children of Vermont who will make this \ncampaign a success, and the importance of their role cannot be stressed \nenough.\n  This campaign is so much more than simply a gesture of good will. It \nis a matter of saving lives. Thousands of children have fled \nAfghanistan with nothing more than the clothing on their backs. The \nflood of Afghan refugees started many years ago, and now there are many \nthousands of displaced children living in refugee camps.\n  Many of these children are suffering under conditions that no child \nshould have to bear. They are hungry and they are cold. With winter \nsetting in, something like a warm winter sweater, which so many of us \ntake for granted, is a luxury item that is far beyond their reach.\n  From our small State to Afghan refugee camps, the boys and girls of \nVermont are proving that they can make a difference. I am certain their \n``good turn'' will be as rewarding for them as it is for the children \nof Afghanistan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/29/senate-section/article/S12153-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12153-S12154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    NATIVE AMERICAN BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER TREATMENT TECHNICAL \n                         AMENDMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, last evening, the Senate passed by \nunanimous consent S. 1741, the Native American Breast and Cervical \nCancer Treatment Technical Amendment Act of 2001, which I had \nintroduced with Senator McCain and 23 other bipartisan cosponsors.\n  S. 1741 is identical to S. 535 and was introduced as a freestanding \nbill to address a jurisdictional concern raised with the committee \nreferral of the initial bill. Due to the importance of the legislation, \nI am pleased that the entire Senate saw fit to allow this bill to be \nreintroduced and passed by unanimous consent yesterday.\n  The legislation makes a simple, yet important, technical change to \nthe Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment and Prevention Act of 2000 by \nclarifying that American Indian and Alaska Native women should not be \nexcluded from receiving coverage through Medicaid for breast and \ncervical cancer treatment.\n  The Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act of 2000 \ngives States the option to extend coverage for the treatment of breast \nand cervical cancer through the Medicaid program to certain women who \nhave been screened through the National Breast and Cervical Cancer \nEarly Detection Program, or Title XV of the Public Health Service Act, \nand who do not have what is called ``creditable coverage,'' as defined \nby the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or \nHIPPA.\n  In referencing the HIPPA definition of ``creditable coverage,'' the \nbill language inadvertently precludes coverage to Native American women \nwho have access to medical care under the Indian Health Service, or \nIHS. HIPPA included a reference to IHS or tribal care as ``creditable \ncoverage'' so that members of Indian Tribes eligible for IHS would not \nbe treated as having a break in coverage, and thus subject to pre-\nexisting exclusions and waiting periods when seeking health insurance, \nsimply because they had received care through Indian health programs, \nrather than through a conventional health insurance program. Thus, in \nHIPPA, the inclusion of the IHS or tribal provision was intended to \nbenefit American Indians and Alaska Natives, not penalize them.\n  However, use of the HIPPA definition in the recent Breast and \nCervical Cancer Treatment and Prevention Act has the exact opposite \neffect. In fact, the many Indian women, who rely on IHS or tribal \nprograms for basic health care, are specifically excluded from the \nlaw's new eligibility under Medicaid. Clearly it was not the intent of \nCongress to specifically discriminate against low-income Native \nAmerican women and to deny them much needed health treatment to combat \nbreast or cervical cancer.\n  The legislation resolves these problems by clarifying that, for \npurposes of the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment \nAct, the term ``creditable coverage'' shall not include IHS-funded care \nso that American Indian and Alaska Native women can be covered by \nMedicaid for breast and cervical cancer treatment, as they are for all \nother Medicaid services. Since a number of States are currently moving \nforward to provide Medicaid coverage under the State option, the need \nfor this legislation is immediate to ensure that some American Indian \nand Alaska Native women are not denied received life-saving breast and \ncervical cancer treatment due to a Congressional drafting error.\n  In addition, this bill would also reduce the administrative burdens \nthis language places on states. Under administrative guidance, some \nNative American women can be enrolled on the program depending on a \ndetermination of their ``access'' to IHS services, which depends on \ncertain documentation obtained by Native American women seeking breast \nand cervical cancer treatment from IHS. In order to determine the \nMedicaid eligibility of Native American women who are screened as \nhaving breast or cervical cancer through the Title XV program each \nyear, states are having to put together a whole set of regulations and \nrules to make these special ``access'' determinations.\n  During this year, almost 50,000 women are expected to die from breast \nor cervical cancer in the United States despite the fact that early \ndetection and treatment of these diseases could substantially decrease \nthis mortality. While passage of last year's bill makes significant \nstrides to address this problem, it fails to do so for certain Native \nAmerican women and that must be changed as soon as possible.\n  In support of Native American women across this country that are \nbeing diagnosed through CDC screening activities as having breast or \ncervical cancer, this legislation will assure that they can also access \nmuch needed treatment through the Medicaid program while also reducing \nthe unnecessary paperwork and administrative burdens on states.\n  I would like to thank all Senators for their support and specifically \nthank\n\n[[Page S12154]]\n\nChairman Inouye and Senator Campbell of the Committee on Indian Affairs \nand Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley of the Finance Committee for \nagreeing to move the bill. In addition, I would like to thank the \nbill's cosponsors, which include Senators McCain, Daschle, Baucus, \nClinton, Domenici, Feingold, Kennedy, Johnson, Murray, Stabenow, \nWellstone, Harkin, Miller, Snowe, Inouye, Smith of Oregon, Cantwell, \nInhofe, Landrieu, Cochran, Boxer, Murkowski, Mikulski, and Grassley for \ntheir help in getting the bill passed.\n  I would also like to thank Sara Rosenbaum at George Washington \nUniversity for bringing this problem to our attention and for her vast \nknowledge on this issue and Andy Schneider for his technical advice and \ncounsel on correcting the problem.\n  In addition, this bill would never have passed without the \noutstanding support and efforts by Fran Visco, Jennifer Katz, Wendy \nArends, Alana Wexler, Joanne Huff, and Vicki Tosher at the National \nBreast Cancer Coalition, Wendy Selig, Licy Docanto, Brian Lee, and \nJanet Thomas of the American Cancer Society, Dawn McKinney and Laura \nHessburg of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \nLeigh Ann McGee of the Cherokee Nation, Jacqueline Johnson of the \nNational Congress of American Indians, and the many Indian health \norganizations that have helped with the passage of this legislation as \nwell.\n  I urge the House to immediately take up and pass this legislation and \nfor the President to sign it into law to ensure that Native American \nwomen are not inappropriately denied treatment for their breast and \ncervical cancer. As states proceed with the implementation of last \nyear's bill, any further delay and failure to act could unnecessarily \nthreaten the lives of Native American women across this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/29/senate-section/article/S12154-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Two women, one lesbian and one bisexual, \nallegedly were beaten by a man who yelled anti-gay slurs. The \nassailant, Gilberto Arrendondo, 44, was charged with four counts of \nviolating the State hate crime law and four counts of assault.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate.

Mr. President, since the terrible tragedies of \nSeptember 11, many Americans, both adults and children, have been \nforced to deal with a level of pain and anxiety that most people have \nnever had to endure before. Art therapy--the process of using art \ntherapeutically to treat victims of trauma, illness, physical \ndisability or other personal challenges--has historically been under \nrecognized as a treatment. However, since September 11, many of us have \nwitnessed its enormous benefits in helping both children and adults \nalike express their emotions in a very personal, touching way.\n  While nearly every person in our country has been irrevocably changed \nby that day's events, we know that children are particularly vulnerable \nto the long-term emotional consequences that often accompany exposure \nto trauma. One of the ways in which children have coped with the \naftermath of September 11 is by reaching for their crayons, pencils, \nand paintbrushes to express some of what they are feeling. Children all \nover the country have created images of World Trade Center towers and \nthe Pentagon decorated with hearts, tears, rainbows, and angels. These \nsimple, yet heartfelt, drawings, which do such a wonderful job of \nexpressing the complex emotional terrain that these children are \nnavigating, have moved us all.\n  Adults, too, have used creativity to help cope with the difficult \nemotions that so many are experiencing. I heard the story of a woman \nwho was one of the last people to be rescued from the World Trade \nCenter rubble after being trapped for more than a day. She drew a \npicture while in intensive care of herself under the rubble with angels \nand God hovering above her. Another victim of the disaster drew \npictures of flowers and spoke about how grateful she was to be alive.\n  Last June, I had the pleasure of viewing an art exhibit here on \nCapitol Hill in which all of the art was created by patients who were \nbeing treated by art therapists. It was a remarkable feat for people \ncoping with such immense personal pain to be able to produce such works \nof passion and beauty. Although sometimes the healing qualities of art \nmay be less tangible or obvious than its aesthetic qualities, they may \nbe even more important.\n  I want to thank art therapists, in New York and every community in \nAmerica, who are assisting survivors, rescuers, and the bereaved. \nThroughout the country, there are almost 5,000 trained and credentialed \nart therapists working in hospitals, nursing homes, schools and \nshelters. They are among the army of mental health professionals who \nsupport those suffering from psychological trauma from the attacks, and \nundoubtedly will continue to serve the needs of individuals coping with \nsubsequent stress disorders.\n  And that is why I rise today to encourage my colleagues in Congress \nto support the field of art therapy and expand awareness about this \ncreative form of treatment. At this time of heightened awareness about \nthe importance of maintaining mental health, we should recognize art \ntherapy as a way to treat those among us who have experienced trauma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/29/senate-section/article/S12154-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RAILROAD RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, we in Delaware, and especially those \nof us associated with the University of Delaware, engaged in a very \nproud celebration this fall, when on November 10, Harold ``Tubby'' \nRaymond won his 300th game as head coach of the University's Fightin' \nBlue Hens football team.\n  The win put Coach Raymond into some very elite company, as he became \nthe ninth ranked college coach in all-time wins, fifth among active \ncoaches, second among division I-AA coaches, and one of only four \ncoaches in the 300-wins club to have won all of his games at one \nschool.\n  Coach Raymond came to the University of Delaware in 1954; to put that \nin perspective, it means that he had already been coaching at Delaware, \nas an assistant in football and head coach in baseball, for six years \nwhen I arrived on campus as a college freshman. With apologies to my \nNew England colleagues, we stole Tubby from the University of Maine, \nwhere he had coached\n\n[[Page S12155]]\n\nwith his fellow University of Michigan alumnus and later College \nFootball Hall of Famer, Dave Nelson. If you've ever seen the University \nof Delaware football helmets, you know that Coaches Nelson and Raymond \nnever forgot their Michigan roots.\n  After serving as Dave Nelson's backfield coach for 12 years, Tubby \nRaymond took over the head coaching job in 1966, leading that first \nteam to a 6-3 record and the first of three Middle Atlantic Conference \nUniversity Division championships. In his 36-year career as Delaware's \nhead coach, Tubby has gone on to win three national championships, \nincluding back-to-back titles in 1971 and '72, and has led Delaware to \nthe national playoffs a total of 16 times, five in Division II and 11 \nin Division I-AA. His teams have earned 14 Lambert Cup eastern college \nchampionships, and have won six Atlantic 10/Yankee Conference titles, \nfive Boardwalk Bowls and nine ECAC ``Team of the Year'' Awards.\n  Tubby Raymond's career record stands at 300-119-3, a winning \npercentage of .714. He is one of only two college division coaches ever \nto win consecutive American Coaches Association Coach of the Year \nAwards. He was named NCAA Division II Coach of the Year by ABC Sports \nand Chevrolet in 1979, following his third national championship \nseason. He is all told, a seven-time honoree as AFCA College Division \nDistrict II, now I-AA Region I, Coach of the Year; and he has been \ntwice named as the New York Writers Association ECAC I-AA Coach of the \nYear. In 1998, Coach Raymond received the Vince Lombardi Foundation \nLifetime Achievement Award, and in 2000, he was recognized by Sports \nIllustrated as one of Delaware's top 10 sports figures of the 20th \nCentury.\n  Most incredibly of all, all the records and championships and \nstatistics, as phenomenal as they are, don't tell the full story of \nTubby Raymond's stature and influence on his players, the University, \nhis sport or our State as a whole. Coach Raymond is a leader far beyond \nthe walls of Delaware Stadium; he is respected, admired and beloved by \nhis fellow Delawareans, even those who like to call their own plays \nfrom the stands, and even by rival coaches and opposing players. He is \nan institution, in a word, a legend; in fact, I would say that Tubby \nRaymond defines the standard of ``living legend'' in my State.\n  To top it off, Tubby is a good golfer, though like most of us not as \ngood as he would like to be, and he is also an artist of considerable \nrenown. One of the many ways Tubby expresses his bond to his players \nhas been by painting a portrait of a senior member of the team each \nweek of the season through most of his career. Other Raymond originals \nhave benefited charity auctions and decorated Delaware football media \nguides. In fact, Tubby's artistic talents have attracted only slightly \nless national attention than his coaching skills; his paintings have \nbeen featured on Good Morning America, NBC Nightly News, Sports \nIllustrated, CNN and Fox Sports.\n  To save the best for last, Tubby Raymond is a family man. He lives \nwith his wife, Diane, and daughter, Michelle, and is also the proud \nfather of three grown children from his first marriage to Sue Raymond, \nwho died in 1990. His son, Chris, is a former coach made good as an \nofficer with J.P. Morgan; his daughter, Debbie, is a psychologist; and \nhis son, David, became well known himself to sports fans as the Phillie \nPhanatic, mascot of the Philadelphia Phillies, and now owns Raymond \nEntertainment.\n  It is my privilege to share Delaware's pride in Harold ``Tubby'' \nRaymond with the Senate and with the Nation today. He is a legendary \ncoach, an inspiring leader, a good friend and a remarkable human being, \nand to put it simply, we love him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/29/senate-section/article/S12155-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING POLICE OFFICER DANNY FAULKNER\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on Sunday, December 9, 2001, at 12 \nNoon, a commemorative plaque will be cemented into the sidewalk at the \nsoutheast corner of 13th and Locust Streets in Philadelphia, PA to mark \nthe 20th anniversary of the murder of Police Officer Danny Faulkner at \nthat site.\n  Officer Faulkner lost his life protecting the people of Philadelphia \nfrom the scourge of violent crime. Our society owes a great debt of \ngratitude to the Thin Blue Line, the police officers of America who \nfight criminal violence on the streets of our Nation 24 hours a day, 7 \ndays a week and 52 weeks of the year.\n  From my experience as District Attorney of Philadelphia, I know the \nextraordinary risks faced by law enforcement officers. One of the most \ndifficult aspects of my District Attorney's duties was the attendance \nat the funerals of police officers who were killed in the line of duty.\n  Following the terrorist attack on September 11, America has been \nfocused on the courage and bravery of the police and firefighters. \nThere is now a better understanding of the risks and performance of \nfirefighters and police for their heroic efforts on September 11.\n  The commemoration of the 20th anniversary of Officer Faulkner's \nmurder should inspire us to redouble our efforts to fight all forms of \ncriminal violence, including terrorism, and to pay tribute to the \nmemory of Officer Faulkner and all the police and firefighters of \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/29/senate-section/article/S12155-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT SUZANNE R. DePRIZIO\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in my years in the Senate, I have \nhad the opportunity to meet and get to know many of our men and women \nin uniform. I have always been struck by their enthusiasm, \ndetermination, patriotism, and professionalism. Yet sometimes, even in \nsuch impressive company, you run across an individual who stands out \nabove the rest. Lt. Suzy DePrizio is one of those standouts.\n  Lt. DePrizio serves today as the legislative affairs officer for the \nUnited States Pacific Command, located in my home State of Hawaii. I've \ngotten to know Lt. DePrizio on my many trips to visit the command. Lt. \nDePrizio has constantly provided my staff and me timely, valuable and \naccurate information on the critical issues of the day. Her energetic \ndetermination and competence inspire all those who work with her. I \nknow first hand from my discussions with Admiral Blair, the commander \nof the Pacific Command, what a high regard the entire staff of PACOM \nhas for this tremendously talented young officer. No matter how \ndifficult the challenge, Suzy was always up to the task. Her behind-\nthe-scenes efforts to prepare for congressional testimony were \nrecognized by those of us in this business as exemplary. The CINC was \nalways well prepared because of her efforts.\n  I also know from many of my colleagues that traveled into the Pacific \nregion how smoothly their travel went because of her coordination and \nattention to detail. I would always tell them, ``ask for Suzy, she'll \nget the job done right.'' Of course, she always did.\n  As Lt. Deprizio prepares to leave active duty in the Navy for a \ncivilian career, I salute her for a job well done. On behalf of the \nentire U.S. Congress, I want to thank America for sending us proud and \npatriotic professionals such as Lt. Deprizio. She is certainly among \nour Nations's finest, and she gave tenfold compared to what she \nreceived.\n  In Hawaii, we have many traditions and blessings, one of which is the \nspirit of Aloha,--not just hello or goodbye or love, but the spirit of \ngiving. When you put it together with the word `aina, it becomes the \nHawaiian phrase for patriotism. And, if there ever was an officer who \nhad the spirit of aloha' aina for the Congress, the Armed forces and \nfor America, it is Lt. Suzy DePrizio. In that spirit, we send her on \nher way, wishing her fair winds and following seas in everything she \ndoes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/29/senate-section/article/S12155-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/29/senate-section/article/S12155-4", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/29/senate-section/article/S12156-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12156]]\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:33 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3338.

A bill to prevent the crime of identity theft, mitigate the \nharm to individuals victimized by identity theft, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will help victims of identity theft recover from the injuries to \ntheir good name and good credit, the Reclaim Your Identity Act of 2001. \nEarlier this year, Washington State enacted a law to provide needed \nhelp to victims of identity theft that I believe serves as a good model \nfor federal legislation. It gives victims of identity theft the tools \nthey need to restore their good credit rating, requires businesses to \nmake available records relevant to a victim's ability to restore his or \nher credit, and enables a victim to have fraudulent charges blocked \nfrom reporting in their consumer credit report. Currently, Federal law \naddresses the crime of identity theft, providing penalties for the \nperpetrator, but no specific assistance to the victim trying to recover \ntheir identity. Today I am introducing legislation modeled on the state \nof Washington law that will do just that, help the victim restore their \ncredit rating and their good name.\n  We need to do more to fight identity theft, a crime the Federal Trade \nCommission has described as the Nation's fastest growing. Last year \nthere were over 500,000 new victims of identity theft and, according to \nthe Department of Treasury, reports of identity theft to perpetrate \nfraud against financial institutions grew by 50 percent from 1999 to \n2000. From March 2001 to June 2001, the number of ID theft victims \ncontacting the FTC jumped from 45,500 to 69,400--a 50 percent increase \nin just three months. One in five Americans or a member of their \nfamilies has been a victim of identity theft. Those numbers underscore \nwhy I am introducing this legislation today. The problem is \nparticularly apparent in my State of Washington, which ranks in the top \n10 for identity theft per capita.\n  Identity theft is not a violent crime, but its victims suffer real \nharm and need help to recover their good credit and good name. On \naverage, it takes 12 months for a victim to learn that he or she has \nbeen a victim of identity theft. It takes another 175 hours and $808 of \nout-of-pocket expenses to clear their names. Today, victims of identity \ntheft are forced to become their own sleuths to clear their names, and \nall too often they do so without the help or support of the businesses \nthat allowed the identity theft to take place. Believe it or not, when \nyour identity is stolen, many businesses won't give you the records you \nneed to reclaim your identity. My bill puts people first by requiring \nbusinesses to cooperate with victims.\n  We already require this in Washington State, thanks to the hard work \nof Attorney General Chris Gregoire and others. Now we need to take this \ngood idea to the national level and make it work on behalf of many \nothers. When your TV is stolen, you know it was taken from your living \nroom. But when your identity is stolen, it could be stolen from \nanywhere, and businesses from every State could be involved. That's why \nwe need a Federal solution to this problem.\n  The Reclaim Your Identity Act empowers consumers by establishing a \ntransparent process victims can use to\n\n[[Page S12163]]\n\nreclaim their identity. Under this bill, a victim of identity theft \nwill have the right to request records related to a fraud based on an \nidentity theft from businesses after proving their identity with a copy \nof the police report or the Federal Trade Commission standardized \nIdentity Theft Affidavit or any other affidavit of fact of the \nbusiness' choosing. The business must then provide, at no charge, \ncopies of those business records to the victim or a law enforcement \nagency or officer designated by the victim within 10 days of the \nvictim's request. This will make sure that the victims, or law \nenforcement investigating an identity theft on behalf of a victim, will \nbe able to obtain the credit applications and other records a business \nmay have that is evidence of the fraud. As a protective measure, the \nbill gives businesses the option to decline to disclose records where \nit believes the request is based on a misrepresentation of facts. \nFurther, a business is exempt from liability for any disclosure \nundertaken in good faith to further a prosecution of identity theft or \nassist the victim.\n  In addition, this bill reinstates consumers' right to sue credit-\nreporting agencies that allow identity theft to harm their good name. \nOn November 12, the Supreme Court ruled that a California woman \ncouldn't sue a credit reporting agency because she filed her claim more \nthan two years after her identity had been stolen and that the two-year \nstatute of limitations ran from the time of the crime. The woman didn't \neven know her identity had been stolen until two years after the crime \nhad been committed. In the wake of the court decision, Congress must \nrevise the statute of limitations so that common sense prevails and \nthat the clock doesn't begin ticking until victims know that they have \nbeen harmed.\n  The Reclaim Your Identity Act also amends the Internet False \nIdentification Prevention Act to expand the jurisdiction and membership \nof the coordinating committee currently studying enforcement of Federal \nidentity theft law to examine State and local enforcement problems and \nidentify ways the federal government can assist state and local law \nenforcement in addressing identity theft and related crimes. In the \nwake of the September 11 attacks we are painfully aware that identity \ntheft can threaten more than our pocket books. This legislation also \nrequires the Federal coordinating committee to look at how the Federal \nGovernment can improve the sharing of information on terrorists and \nterrorist activity as it relates to identity theft. Further, by giving \nconsumers and law enforcement additional tools to fight identity theft, \nthis bill will make it harder for terrorists to steal identities to \nhide their true identity.\n  Importantly, this bill also requires credit-reporting agencies to \nprotect a consumers' good name from bad credit generated by fraud. The \nReclaim Your Identity Act amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to \nrequire consumer credit reporting agencies to block information that \nappears on a victim's credit report as a result of identity theft \nprovided the victim did not knowingly obtain goods, services or money \nas a result of the blocked transaction.\n  Businesses too are victims of the fraud perpetrated in conjunction \nwith identity theft. This legislation also provides businesses with new \ntools to pursue identity thieves by amending Title 18 to make identity \ntheft under State law a predicate for federal RICO violation. This will \nallow individuals and businesses pursuing a perpetrator of identity \ntheft to seek treble damages and help prosecutors recover stolen assets \nfor businesses victimized by identity theft.\n  The Reclaim Your Identity Act also gives States additional legal \ntools by providing that State Attorneys General may bring a suit in \nFederal court on behalf of State citizens for violation of the Act.\n  Identity theft and the fraud that can result is on the rise. We have \nthe laws to discourage identity theft, but it is difficult behavior to \nattack. We have to give the tools to the victims to regain control of \ntheir financial life. The Consumers Union, Identity Theft Resource \nCenter, and Privacy Rights Clearinghouse all support this legislation. \nThe Reclaim Your Identity Act of 2001 will help victims of identity \ntheft recover their identity and restore their good credit. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to promptly enact this bill into \nlaw.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1743. A bill to create a temporary reinsurance mechanism to \nenhance the availability of terrorism insurance; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in light of the need to provide \nadditional capacity and reassurance to the insurance industry for \nterrorism risks without burdening the taxpayer, balanced with the need \nto protect consumers from excessive increased in commercial insurance \nrates, I rise today to introduce the National Terrorism Reinsurance \nFund Act.\n  This legislation will create a fund from assessments on the \ncommercial insurance industry as a whole to for the purpose of \nproviding a temporary backstop for terrorism losses for primary \ninsurance companies doing business in the U.S. The Fund and assessment \nmechanisms would provide the first $50 billion of protection for the \ninsurance industry. In addition to this fund, the bill provides a \nprogram to provide direct Federal aid on a temporary basis for losses \nover $50 billion, in order to increase insurance market capacity and \nensure the availability of reinsurance in relation to acts of \nterrorism. The overall program is to last for 3 years only and is to be \nadministered by the Secretary of Commerce.\n  All terrorism-related events causing losses beyond $50 billion will \nbe governed by a direct Federal grant program. Once a company has \nincurred losses of more than 10 percent of its premiums from the \nprevious year, it can apply for assistance from the Fund and the \nFederal Government. For the first year, the government will cover up to \n90 percent of a company's losses. For the second and third years, the \ngovernment will cover up to 80 percent of that company's losses. This \naid will be applicable up to losses of $100 billion. For events casing \nlosses beyond this amount, the Secretary is required to seek guidance \nfrom Congress. Additionally, provisions have been included to ensure \nthe industry shoulders the appropriate financial responsibility and to \nprevent unreasonable increases in insurance rates.\n  Simply put the legislation accomplishes the following goals: 1. it \nprovides insurance companies the assistance they need to continue \nwriting terrorism coverage; 2. it ensures the availability of insurance \ncoverage for American businesses and consumers; 3. it avoids an \nunnecessary and potentially massive bailout of an insurance industry by \nforcing them to use their own resources to ensure the availability of \nterrorism reinsurance while setting direct Federal aid at levels \nsufficient to account for the industry's current positive \ncapitalization; and 4. it strikes the right balance regarding the \ninterests of industry, taxpayers and the consumers of insurance and the \nmarketplace in general.\n  I look forward to working with other Senators to obtain swift passage \nof this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1743\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to ensure the continued financial capacity of \ninsurers to provide coverage for risks from terrorism; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, while there are few people in the Senate \nmore skeptical than I of providing Federal assistance to corporations \nor involving the Federal Government in private industry, the proposed \nwholesale cancellation of terrorism insurance coverage following the \ndevastating events of September 11, dictates that Congress act before \nthe end of this session to ensure that this coverage continues to be \navailable and affordable. Since 1945 when Congress delegated the \nresponsibility of regulating insurance to the States, the Federal \nGovernment has honored this delegation and, with the encouragement of \nstate regulators, kept out of the business of insurance.\n  In a recent letter to Treasury Secretary O'Neill, however, the \nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners, NAIC, implored the \nFederal Government for help. ``What has not been widely reported is \nthat insurers are now issuing notices of non-renewal and filing across-\nthe-board property and casualty exclusions for terrorist risk with \nstate insurance regulators,'' the NAIC wrote. ``[W]e need the Federal \nGovernment to act soon to give certainty to this situation * * * \nfurther delay inadvertently could cause greater market disruption, thus \nmaking the need for quick action imperative.'' I agree.\n  The bill I am introducing today draws from the many good ideas \nproposed by members of Congress and by the Administration to deal with \nthe imminent cancellation of terrorism insurance coverage, and attempts \nalso to address concerns raised with each of these proposals. It is by \nno means a perfect bill and I look forward to working with the \nAdministration, my colleagues, state insurance commissioners, and other \ninterested parties to improve it. While rough, the bill does reflect, \nhowever, what I believe to be the core principles that should be \nincluded in any legislation designed to keep terrorism insurance \naffordable and available. These principles include making Federal \nintervention short-term; deferring to states on questions of rate \nregulation; requiring insurance companies and the insurance industry to \nbear enough risk to promote responsible claims handling and to ensure \nthat incentives to protect against acts of terrorism are in place; \nfairly allocating the costs of a terrorist event among insurance \ncompanies, and between policy holders and taxpayers; and generally \nprohibiting the award of punitive damages in claims arising from acts \nof terrorism.\n  There has been much debate about whether the taxpayers should bear \nthe cost in the short-term of another terrorist event, or whether this \ncost should be borne by policy holders. The answer, perhaps, is that \nthe cost should be shared. I propose in this bill that federal \nassistance up to $50 billion be paid back by commercial property and\n\n[[Page S12167]]\n\ncasualty policy holders through a capped surcharge on their premiums. \nFor Federal assistance between $50 billion and $100 billion, which \nwould be required only in the case of a truly catastrophic, perhaps \ncataclysmic event, however, the bill does not require repayment.\n  The following is a summary of the major provision of this bill. I \nlook forward to working to improve it and to passage of needed \nlegislation on terrorism insurance before the end of this session.\n  The bill provides a Federal backstop for certain insured losses due \nto acts of terrorism up to $100 billion per year in 2002 and 2003. The \nFederal Government would get involved, however, only if there is an act \nof terrorism during these years that exceeded individual company \nretentions. If a commercial insurer reaches these retention levels, the \nfederal government would provide assistance for 80 percent of the \ncompanies' losses above the retention.\n  To provide uniformity, the bill preempts state definitions of \n``terrorism'' and delegates to the Secretary of Commerce the \nresponsibility of determining whether or not an act of terrorism has \noccurred.\n  Federal assistance is available only to companies whose annual \nterrorism-related losses in certain lines of commercial property and \ncasualty insurance exceed the greater of $10 million or 5 percent of \ngross direct written premium in the previous year.\n  Only companies that meet the company retention trigger can obtain \nassistance from the Federal Government. Outlays for losses up to $50 \nbillion are repaid by insurance policy holders through a surcharge \nimposed by the Secretary of Commerce on covered lines and collected by \ncommercial insurers. These surcharges cannot exceed 6 percent of annual \npremiums, and the Secretary has the discretion to adjust the surcharge \nto reflect different risks in urban and rural areas.\n  Federal outlays up to $50 billion are paid back over time by \ncommercial property and casualty policy holders. Federal outlays for \nlosses over $50 billion are not recoverable.\n  Rate regulation is left to the states.\n  Except with respect to claims against terrorists and their \nconspirators, punitive damages cannot be recovered in claims arising \nout of acts of terrorism.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Lieberman and Mr. \n        Jeffords):\n  S. 1746. A bill to amend the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the Energy \nReorganization Act of 1974 to strengthen security at sensitive nuclear \nfacilities; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to discuss an issue of great \nimportance to our Nation, the safety of our Nation's nuclear power \nplants.\n  The tragedy of September 11 taught us many things: It taught us the \nimportance of our first responders. It taught us the vulnerability of \nour Nation's buildings and the strength of our Nation's resolve. \nFinally, it taught us that we must be prepared for today's threats \nbecause they could become tomorrow's attacks.\n  We must not fail to take what we have learned and apply it to the \nvulnerabilities of our Nation's energy and transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  Less than 1 week ago, the President signed a new law to increase the \nsafety at our Nation's airports.\n  That act turned the first page in a long struggle to secure our \nNation's infrastructure.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation with Senator Clinton, Senator \nLieberman, and Senator Jeffords to write the next chapter, which covers \ncommercial nuclear facilities.\n  I am pleased that Congressman Markey and Congresswoman Lowey will \nintroduce a companion bill in the House of Representatives.\n  Nuclear facilities provide us with needed electricity, but, in light \nof the events of September 11, they also present a security risk that \nwe simply must address.\n  When plants are failing nearly half their security evaluations, we \nneed to do more than update the curriculum. We need a whole new system.\n  There are some plants that do a good job, but it is not enough to \nhave peaks of success, we need a new high plateau that secures all \nplants. We can accomplish that by establishing a new nuclear security \nforce.\n  Our bill also requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to take a \nnew look at the threats posed by terrorists.\n  This is the foundation that will support the efforts of the nuclear \nsecurity force and overall plant security.\n  Our bill also establishes a rigorous training and evaluation program \nfor the nuclear security force.\n  A new office will be established within the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission with a dedicated team of mock terrorists whose only jobs is \nto perfect their skills in challenging the security guards.\n  When professional sports teams practice, the don't do it against \namateur athletes playing in the park. They train against other \nprofessionals. Nuclear Security personnel should also.\n  Our bill will honor the sacrifice of our Nation's emergency \nresponders by ensuring that emergency response plans are in place and \nwork as we expect them to.\n  Finally, we will require stockpiles of medicine to help out in the \nevent of a release of radioactive material from a nuclear facility.\n  These potassium iodide tablets block the absorption of harmful iodine \nin the thyroid gland.\n  The American people told us how they wanted their airlines and \nairports protected. The Congress and the President listened and acted.\n  We will work to make sure their questions about the safety of all our \nNation's nuclear power plants are also answered.\n  This bill starts that process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1746\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Comprehensive Energy \n     Research and Technology Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2002. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Nation's prosperity and way of life are sustained \n     by energy use;\n       (2) the growing imbalance between domestic energy \n     production and consumption means that the Nation is becoming \n     increasingly reliant on imported energy, which has the \n     potential to undermine the Nation's economy, standard of \n     living, and national security;\n       (3) energy conservation and energy efficiency help maximize \n     the use of available energy resources, reduce energy \n     shortages, lower the Nation's reliance on energy imports, \n     mitigate the impacts of high energy prices, and help protect \n     the environment and public health;\n       (4) development of a balanced portfolio of domestic energy \n     supplies will ensure that future generations of Americans \n     will have access to the energy they need;\n       (5) energy efficiency technologies, renewable and \n     alternative energy technologies, and advanced energy systems \n     technologies will help diversify the Nation's energy \n     portfolio with few adverse environmental impacts and are \n     vital to delivering clean energy to fuel the Nation's \n     economic growth;\n       (6) development of reliable, affordable, and \n     environmentally sound energy efficiency technologies, \n     renewable and alternative energy technologies, and advanced \n     energy systems technologies will require maintenance of a \n     vibrant fundamental scientific knowledge base and continued \n     scientific and technological innovations that can be \n     accelerated by Federal funding, whereas commercial deployment \n     of such systems and technologies are the responsibility of \n     the private sector;\n       (7) Federal funding should focus on those programs, \n     projects, and activities that are long-term, high-risk, \n     noncommercial, and well-managed, and that provide the \n     potential for scientific and technological advances; and\n       (8) public-private partnerships should be encouraged to \n     leverage scarce taxpayer dollars.\n\n     SEC. 2003. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this division are to--\n       (1) protect and strengthen the Nation's economy, standard \n     of living, and national security by reducing dependence on \n     imported energy;\n       (2) meet future needs for energy services at the lowest \n     total cost to the Nation, including environmental costs, \n     giving balanced and comprehensive consideration to \n     technologies that improve the efficiency of energy end uses \n     and that enhance energy supply;\n       (3) reduce the air, water, and other environmental impacts \n     (including emissions of greenhouse gases) of energy \n     production, distribution, transportation, and use through the \n     development of environmentally sustainable energy systems;\n       (4) consider the comparative environmental impacts of the \n     energy saved or produced by specific programs, projects, or \n     activities;\n       (5) maintain the technological competitiveness of the \n     United States and stimulate economic growth through the \n     development of advanced energy systems and technologies;\n       (6) foster international cooperation by developing \n     international markets for domestically produced sustainable \n     energy technologies, and by transferring environmentally \n     sound, advanced energy systems and technologies to developing \n     countries to promote sustainable development;\n       (7) provide sufficient funding of programs, projects, and \n     activities that are performance-based and modeled as public-\n     private partnerships, as appropriate; and\n       (8) enhance the contribution of a given program, project, \n     or activity to fundamental scientific knowledge.\n\n     SEC. 2004. GOALS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), in order to \n     achieve the purposes of this division under section 2003, the \n     Secretary should conduct a balanced energy research, \n     development, demonstration, and commercial application \n     portfolio of programs guided by the following goals to meet \n     the purposes of this division under section 2003.\n       (1) Energy conservation and energy efficiency.--\n       (A) For the Building Technology, State and Community \n     Sector, the program should develop technologies, housing \n     components, designs, and production methods that will, by \n     2010--\n       (i) reduce the monthly energy cost of new housing by 20 \n     percent, compared to the cost as of the date of the enactment \n     of this Act;\n       (ii) cut the environmental impact and energy use of new \n     housing by 50 percent, compared to the impact and use as of \n     the date of the enactment of this Act; and\n       (iii) improve durability and reduce maintenance costs by 50 \n     percent compared to the durability and costs as of the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n       (B) For the Industry Sector, the program should, in \n     cooperation with the affected industries, improve the energy \n     intensity of the major energy-consuming industries by at \n     least 25 percent by 2010, compared to the energy intensity as \n     of the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (C) For Power Technologies, the program should, in \n     cooperation with the affected industries--\n\n[[Page S12187]]\n\n       (i) develop a microturbine (40 to 300 kilowatt) that is \n     more than 40 percent more efficient by 2006, and more than 50 \n     percent more efficient by 2010, compared to the efficiency as \n     of the date of the enactment of this Act; and\n       (ii) develop advanced materials for combustion systems that \n     reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides by 30 to 50 percent while \n     increasing efficiency 5 to 10 percent by 2007, compared to \n     such emissions as of the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (D) For the Transportation Sector, the program should, in \n     cooperation with affected industries--\n       (i) develop a production prototype passenger automobile \n     that has fuel economy equivalent to 80 miles per gallon of \n     gasoline by 2004;\n       (ii) develop class 7 and 8 heavy duty trucks and buses with \n     ultra low emissions and the ability to use an alternative \n     fuel that has an average fuel economy equivalent to--\n\n       (I) 10 miles per gallon of gasoline by 2007; and\n       (II) 13 miles per gallon of gasoline by 2010;\n\n       (iii) develop a production prototype of a passenger \n     automobile with zero equivalent emissions that has an average \n     fuel economy of 100 miles per gallon of gasoline by 2010; and\n       (iv) improve, by 2010, the average fuel economy of trucks--\n\n       (I) in classes 1 and 2 by 300 percent; and\n       (II) in classes 3 through 6 by 200 percent,\n\n     compared to the fuel economy as of the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (2) Renewable energy.--\n       (A) For Hydrogen Research, to carry out the Spark M. \n     Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration \n     Act of 1990, as amended by subtitle A of title II of this \n     division.\n       (B) For bioenergy:\n       (i) The program should reduce the cost of bioenergy \n     relative to other energy sources to enable the United States \n     to triple bioenergy use by 2010.\n       (ii) For biopower systems, the program should reduce the \n     cost of such systems to enable commercialization of \n     integrated power-generating technologies that employ gas \n     turbines and fuel cells integrated with bioenergy gasifiers \n     within 5 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (iii) For biofuels, the program should accelerate research, \n     development, and demonstration on advanced enzymatic \n     hydrolysis technology for making ethanol from cellulosic \n     feedstock, with the goal that between 2010 and 2015 ethanol \n     produced from energy crops would be fully competitive in \n     terms of price with gasoline as a neat fuel, in either \n     internal combustion engines or fuel cell vehicles.\n       (C) For Geothermal Technology Development, the program \n     should focus on advanced concepts for the long term. The \n     first priority should be high-grade enhanced geothermal \n     systems; the second priority should be lower grade, hot dry \n     rock, and geopressured systems; and the third priority should \n     be support of field demonstrations of enhanced geothermal \n     systems technology, including sites in lower grade areas to \n     demonstrate the benefits of reservoir concepts to different \n     conditions.\n       (D) For Hydropower, the program should provide a new \n     generation of turbine technologies that will increase \n     generating capacity and will be less damaging to fish and \n     aquatic ecosystems.\n       (E) For Concentrating Solar Power, the program should \n     strengthen ongoing research, development, and demonstration \n     combining high-efficiency and high-temperature receivers with \n     advanced thermal storage and power cycles, with the goal of \n     making solar-only power (including baseload solar power) \n     widely competitive with fossil fuel power by 2015. The \n     program should limit or halt its research and development on \n     power-tower and power-trough technologies because further \n     refinements to these concepts will not further their \n     deployment, and should assess the market prospects for solar \n     dish/engine technologies to determine whether continued \n     research and development is warranted.\n       (F) For Photovoltaic Energy Systems, the program should \n     pursue research, development, and demonstration that will, by \n     2005, increase the efficiency of thin film modules from the \n     current 7 percent to 11 percent in multi-million watt \n     production; reduce the direct manufacturing cost of \n     photovoltaic modules by 30 percent from the current $2.50 per \n     watt to $1.75 per watt by 2005; and establish greater than a \n     20-year lifetime of photovoltaic systems by improving the \n     reliability and lifetime of balance-of-system components and \n     reducing recurring cost by 40 percent. The program's top \n     priority should be the development of sound manufacturing \n     technologies for thin-film modules, and the program should \n     make a concerted effort to integrate fundamental research and \n     basic engineering research.\n       (G) For Solar Building Technology Research, the program \n     should complete research and development on new polymers and \n     manufacturing processes to reduce the cost of solar water \n     heating by 50 percent by 2004, compared to the cost as of the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (H) For Wind Energy Systems, the program should reduce the \n     cost of wind energy to three cents per kilowatt-hour at Class \n     6 (15 miles-per-hour annual average) wind sites by 2004, and \n     4 cents per kilowatt-hour in Class 4 (13 miles-per-hour \n     annual average) wind sites by 2015, and further if required \n     so that wind power can be widely competitive with fossil-\n     fuel-based electricity in a restructured electric industry. \n     Program research on advanced wind turbine technology should \n     focus on turbulent flow studies, durable materials to extend \n     turbine life, blade efficiency, and higher efficiency \n     operation in low quality wind regimes.\n       (I) For Electric Energy Systems and Storage, including High \n     Temperature Superconducting Research and Development, Energy \n     Storage Systems, and Transmission Reliability, the program \n     should develop high capacity superconducting transmission \n     lines and generators, highly reliable energy storage systems, \n     and distributed generating systems to accommodate multiple \n     types of energy sources under common interconnect standards.\n       (J) For the International Renewable Energy and Renewable \n     Energy Production Incentive programs, and Renewable Program \n     Support, the program should encourage the commercial \n     application of renewable energy technologies by developed and \n     developing countries, State and local governmental entities \n     and nonprofit electric cooperatives, and by the competitive \n     domestic market.\n       (3) Nuclear energy.--\n       (A) For university nuclear science and engineering, the \n     program should carry out the provisions of subtitle A of \n     title III of this division.\n       (B) For fuel cycle research, development, and \n     demonstration, the program should carry out the provisions of \n     subtitle B of title III of this division.\n       (C) For the Nuclear Energy Research Initiative, the program \n     should accomplish the objectives of section 2341(b) of this \n     Act.\n       (D) For the Nuclear Energy Plant Optimization Program, the \n     program should accomplish the objectives of section 2342(b) \n     of this Act.\n       (E) For Nuclear Energy Technologies, the program should \n     carry out the provisions of section 2343 of this Act.\n       (F) For Advanced Radioisotope Power Systems, the program \n     should ensure that the United States has adequate capability \n     to power future satellite and space missions.\n       (4) Fossil energy.--\n       (A) For core fossil energy research and development, the \n     program should achieve the goals outlined by the Department's \n     Vision 21 Program.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Fusion Energy Sciences \n     Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2502. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) economic prosperity is closely linked to an affordable \n     and ample energy supply;\n       (2) environmental quality is closely linked to energy \n     production and use;\n       (3) population, worldwide economic development, energy \n     consumption, and stress on the environment are all expected \n     to increase substantially in the coming decades;\n       (4) the few energy options with the potential to meet \n     economic and environmental needs for the long-term future \n     should be pursued as part of a balanced national energy plan;\n       (5) fusion energy is an attractive long-term energy source \n     because of the virtually inexhaustible supply of fuel, and \n     the promise of minimal adverse environmental impact and \n     inherent safety;\n       (6) the National Research Council, the President's \n     Committee of Advisers on Science and Technology, and the \n     Secretary of Energy Advisory Board have each recently \n     reviewed the Fusion Energy Sciences Program and each strongly \n     supports the fundamental science and creative innovation of \n     the program, and has confirmed that progress toward the goal \n     of producing practical fusion energy has been excellent, \n     although much scientific and engineering work remains to be \n     done;\n       (7) each of these reviews stressed the need for a magnetic \n     fusion burning plasma experiment to address key scientific \n     issues and as a necessary step in the development of fusion \n     energy;\n       (8) the National Research Council has also called for a \n     broadening of the Fusion Energy Sciences Program research \n     base as a means to more fully integrate the fusion science \n     community into the broader scientific community; and\n       (9) the Fusion Energy Sciences Program budget is inadequate \n     to support the necessary science and innovation for the \n     present generation of experiments, and cannot accommodate the \n     cost of a burning plasma experiment constructed by the United \n     States, or even the cost of key participation by the United \n     States in an international effort.\n\n     SEC. 2503. PLAN FOR FUSION EXPERIMENT.\n\n       (a) Plan for United States Fusion Experiment.--The \n     Secretary, on the basis of full consultation with the Fusion \n     Energy Sciences Advisory Committee and the Secretary of \n     Energy Advisory Board, as appropriate, shall develop a plan \n     for United States construction of a magnetic fusion burning \n     plasma experiment for the purpose of accelerating scientific \n     understanding of fusion plasmas. The Secretary shall request \n     a review of the plan by the National Academy of Sciences, and \n     shall transmit the plan and the review to the Congress by \n     July 1, 2004.\n       (b) Requirements of Plan.--The plan described in subsection \n     (a) shall--\n       (1) address key burning plasma physics issues; and\n       (2) include specific information on the scientific \n     capabilities of the proposed experiment, the relevance of \n     these capabilities to the goal of practical fusion energy, \n     and the overall design of the experiment including its \n     estimated cost and potential construction sites.\n       (c) United States Participation in an International \n     Experiment.--In addition to the plan described in subsection \n     (a), the Secretary, on the basis of full consultation with \n     the Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee and the \n     Secretary of Energy Advisory Board, as appropriate, may also \n     develop a plan for United States participation in an \n     international burning plasma experiment for the same purpose, \n     whose construction is found by the Secretary to be highly \n     likely and where United States participation is cost \n     effective relative to the cost and scientific benefits of a \n     domestic experiment described in subsection (a). If the \n     Secretary elects to develop a plan under this subsection, he \n     shall include the information described in subsection (b), \n     and an estimate of the cost of United States participation in \n     such an international experiment.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Clean Coal Power \n     Initiative Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 5001. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) reliable, affordable, increasingly clean electricity \n     will continue to power the growing United States economy;\n       (2) an increasing use of electrotechnologies, the desire \n     for continuous environmental improvement, a more competitive \n     electricity market, and concerns about rising energy prices \n     add importance to the need for reliable, affordable, \n     increasingly clean electricity;\n       (3) coal, which, as of the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, accounts for more than \\1/2\\ of all electricity \n     generated in the United States, is the most abundant fossil \n     energy resource of the United States;\n       (4) coal comprises more than 85 percent of all fossil \n     resources in the United States and exists in quantities \n     sufficient to supply the United States for 250 years at \n     current usage rates;\n       (5) investments in electricity generating facility \n     emissions control technology over the past 30 years have \n     reduced the aggregate emissions of pollutants from coal-based \n     generating facilities by 21 percent, even as coal use for \n     electricity generation has nearly tripled;\n       (6) continuous improvement in efficiency and environmental \n     performance from electricity generating facilities would \n     allow continued use of coal and preserve less abundant energy \n     resources for other energy uses;\n       (7) new ways to convert coal into electricity can \n     effectively eliminate health-threatening emissions and \n     improve efficiency by as much as 50 percent, but initial \n     deployment of new coal generation methods and equipment \n     entails significant risk that generators may be unable to \n     accept in a newly competitive electricity market; and\n       (8) continued environmental improvement in coal-based \n     generation and increasing the production and supply of power \n     generation facilities with less air emissions, with the \n     ultimate goal of near-zero emissions, is important and \n     desirable.\n\n     SEC. 5002. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this division:\n       (1) Cost and performance goals.--The term ``cost and \n     performance goals'' means the cost and performance goals \n     established under section 5004.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Energy.\n\n     SEC. 5003.
