Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business until 10 a.m. At 10 this morning, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 1, the education bill. Senators should \nexpect rollcalls throughout the day with respect to amendments to the \neducation bill.\n  Also, as a reminder, the tax reconciliation bill was reported out of \nthe Finance Committee last night. It is expected that the Senate will \nbegin consideration of that measure on Thursday. The majority leader \nhopes that significant progress can be made on the bill on Thursday \nwith the expectation of completing the reconciliation bill on Monday.\n  In addition, the majority leader is expecting that the Senate will \ncomplete action on the education bill next week prior to the Memorial \nDay recess. I thank my colleagues for their attention.\n  I just mention that both of these bills, the reconciliation bill and \nthe education bill, are two of the more important issues we will be \ntaking up this entire session. It is our intention to complete both of \nthem by the end of next week. That will take a lot of cooperation and \nattentiveness by all Members. I encourage Members if they have their \namendments to bring them forward. Let us not spend a lot of time on \nthem, complete the amendments on the education bill and on the \nreconciliation bill so we can give some good news to taxpayers and to \neveryone who is interested in improving education.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their attention.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my colleague leaves the floor, we on \nthis side understand the importance of the education bill. We are doing \nour best to work through it. I think we have made good progress. We \nhave had some short days which has interfered a little bit, but I think \nwe are down to the end of that and we should be able to wrap it up next \nweek. I would say to my friend--and I hope the majority understands \nthis--we understand the importance of reconciliation. The American \npeople deserve a tax cut. They are going to get one. The only thing I \nwould add is that we have to make sure we are able to read the \ndocuments; we have a little bit of time to look at\n\n[[Page S4970]]\n\nthem. My suggestion, to avoid problems that some would call dilatory, \nothers would call necessity, would be that we take this matter up as \nearly on Monday morning as possible and finish it on Tuesday. Maybe we \ncould even finish it Monday night with a long day. I hope we are not \nforced to do this bill by not having an opportunity to look at it. As \nyou know, with the budget, we had some problems because we didn't have \na chance to see it. Our problems over here were very minimal. On the \nHouse side, they had a lot of problems because they tried to jam that \nbill through.\n  So I say to my friend that I hope we have time to look at it. We \nunderstand there is a timeframe that we must work under. We have 20 \nhours. In addition to that, we have the break coming up. The leaders on \nthe majority side want to finish this most important legislation prior \nto that time. I accept that. All I am saying is let us have enough time \nthat we can tell people over here, with some degree of certainty, how \nbig it is; that they will have an opportunity to look at parts they are \ninterested in and have the staff review the whole bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend and colleague's \nsuggestion. I will just mention a couple of things. One, the bill that \npassed the Finance Committee last night passed by a vote of 14-6, a \nbipartisan bill by every definition. The bill that passed last night in \nthe Finance Committee is the same one introduced by Chairman Grassley \nand ranking member Baucus last Friday. It hasn't really changed. The \ninformation from the Joint Tax Committee is available. The analysis of \nthe bill is available. The bill itself has now been reported, but it \nhasn't changed. We did not change one provision. Not one amendment was \nadopted, so people don't have to worry about all the things that are \ndifferent. It is a pretty simple bill. The rate reductions are pretty \nsimple. They are there. They are not quite as good as I think they \nshould be. I will be happy to explain the entire bill; I can do that. \nBut the rate reductions are very timid, in my opinion. It takes 7 years \nto get the rate reductions enacted--6 years, I guess--2007 before they \nare finally enacted, with only a 1 point reduction for all the rates \nbeginning in 2002. But we do have an immediate 10-percent rate.\n  So, anyway, those things are there. It is pretty easily understood. I \nhope we go to the bill tomorrow and have as much time as necessary on \nThursday, on Friday, and a final vote on Monday with Senators able to \noffer amendments and to consider them.\n  The only thing that is complicated is that when you see the bill it \nwill be thicker because the IRA pension provision that passed with over \n400 votes in the House was included and that is very extensive, with \nmultiple provisions, several little pieces involved, some of it \nsomewhat complicated, but it does have overwhelming support in both the \nHouse and the Senate. So that will cause the bill to be thicker. You \ntake that provision out, or leave that provision alone, and the rest of \nthe bill is not all that complicated.\n  I urge our colleagues to talk to other members of the Finance \nCommittee. We will get information out today. I hope we begin \nconsideration on it tomorrow and finish it no later than Monday so we \ncan have a chance to have a conference with our colleagues in the House \nand actually pass it prior to adjourning for the Memorial Day break. \nThat means we have a lot of work to do both on the education bill and \non the tax bill in the next week and a half. I think these next 9 days \nwill be very productive for the American taxpayer and for the American \npublic. I appreciate my colleague's question.\n\n  Mr. REID. If the assistant majority leader will yield, he is a member \nof the Finance Committee and has been working on this issue for a long \nperiod of time, along with 19 other Senators. Some of us are not on the \ncommittee and we do not have the knowledge of the tax provisions in \nthat bill that many of you do. I think the Senator has done a good job \nof outlining how some of the facts are now available to us. I think \nthat is a good suggestion and we can go to work on that, but even that \nhaving been done, I hope the majority will understand some of the \nfeelings of the people over on this side who are not familiar with the \nlegislation. We want to make sure we do not get into some kind of vote-\nathon at the end of the process, that we not be faced with that.\n  We will do our best to work, as we try to do all the time, with the \nmajority, but I want to indicate that there are people over here \nconcerned that they have not had the opportunity to know what is in the \nbill and have not had a chance to see the bill. We hope people will be \nunderstanding of some Members on this side.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate my colleague's suggestion. I will work to \nmake sure everyone has available from the Finance Committee a short \ndescription of the bill so at least they will understand the major \ndetails of it.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, after speaking with the Republican and \nDemocratic sides, I understand there is room for 10 minutes for any \nSenator to proceed in morning business, and/or if I need to go over \nthat 10 minutes, my Republican colleague indicated I may have some \ntime. I will proceed and hopefully finish in 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Biden and Mr. Reid pertaining to the introduction \nof S. 899 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BIDEN. I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know we have had a healthy debate on \neducation and on the need for our educational infrastructure around the \ncountry. What we can all agree on is that many schools in the country \nare in desperate need of repair and improvement. Just because we can \nagree on a problem, however, doesn't mean we agree on the appropriate \nsolution. I think the proposal of the distinguished Senator from Iowa \nto create a new school construction program provides an illustration of \nthis point. We have a big difference on how we ought to approach the \nsolution.\n  The bill before us maximizes the impact of limited Federal dollars by \nfocusing them on programs for which there is a clear and historical \nFederal role. Creating a new facilities grant program in the Department \nof Education, I believe, will raise false hopes and divert our energy \naway from the urgent task of securing more funding for programs such as \nIDEA for which there is a clear and unequivocal established Federal \nresponsibility.\n  The Finance Committee earlier--a few weeks ago--agreed to some \nmeasures to provide relief in the area of school construction in the \nAffordable Education Act. This was bipartisan. This came from the \nFinance Committee with broad support. It addresses this issue of school \nconstruction in a far more constructive and advantageous way. I want to \noffer, in my amendment, the provisions of that Affordable Education Act \ndealing with school construction to S. 1.\n\n[[Page S4972]]\n\n  The first provision is directed at innovative financing for school \ndistricts. It expands the tax-exempt bond rules for public-private \nscholarships set up for construction, renovation, or restoration of \npublic school facilities in these districts. In general, it allows \nStates to issue tax-exempt bonds equal to $10 per State resident.\n  Each State would be guaranteed, under this provision, a minimum \nallocation of at least $5 million of these tax-exempt bonds. In total, \nup to $600 million per year in new tax-exempt bonds would be issued for \nthese innovative school construction projects. This provision is \nimportant because it retains State and local flexibility. It does not \nimpose a new bureaucracy on the States, and it does not force the \nFederal Government to micromanage school construction.\n  I cannot think of a more counterproductive step for us to take than \nfor the Federal Government to get into the business of school \nconstruction and to assume an unprecedented role in that which has been \nhistorically, traditionally left to States and local governments.\n  The provision also is important because it promotes the use of \npublic-private partnerships. Many high-growth school districts may be \ntoo poor or too overwhelmed to take on a school construction project \nthemselves. With these bonds, those districts can partner with a \nprivate entity and still enjoy the benefits of tax-exempt financing.\n  It is worth noting that there already is a significant Federal \nsubsidy for school construction. Under current law, States and \nlocalities can issue debt that is exempt from Federal taxation. This \nbenefit allows them to finance school construction by issuing long-term \nbonds at a lower cost than they otherwise could. Moreover, the evidence \nshows that States and localities are taking advantage of this \nprovision, this benefit, in the current tax law. In the first 6 months \nof 1996, voters approved $13.3 billion in school bonds, an increase of \nmore than $4 billion over the first 6 months of 1995.\n  The bottom line is that many States and localities are doing their \nhomework, passing bonds, building and renovating schools, and enjoying \nfavorable treatment under the existing Tax Code. They are doing all \nthis without significant Federal involvement.\n  I do not have to remind my colleagues that school construction has \nalways been the province of State and local governments. It is \nimportant that we preserve that prerogative. It is important that we \nensure that the Federal Government not preempt this traditional role of \nState and local government.\n  President Clinton stated in 1994, ``The construction and renovation \nof school facilities has traditionally been the responsibility of State \nand local governments financed primarily by local taxpayers.'' In that \nrespect, at least, I agree with former President Clinton.\n  There is a second bond provision in this bill.\n  That provision is designed to simplify the issuance of bonds for \nschool construction. Under current law, arbitrage profits earned on \ninvestments unrelated to the purpose of borrowing must be rebated to \nthe Federal Government. However, there is an exception generally \nreferred to as the small issuer exception which allows governments to \nissue up to $5 million of bonds without being subject to the arbitrage \nrebate requirement.\n  We recently increased this limit to $10 million for governments that \nissue at least $5 million of public school bonds during the year.\n  The provision in the Finance Committee bill which I offer now as an \namendment increases the small issuer exception to $15 million provided \nthat at least $10 million of the bonds are issued to finance public \nschools. This measure will assist localities in meeting school \nconstruction needs by simplifying their use of tax-exempt financing.\n  At the same time, it will not create incentives to issue such debt \nearlier or in larger amounts than is necessary. It is a type of \ntargeted provision that makes good sense.\n  I reaffirm there is consensus that there is a problem in the area of \ndilapidated schools, but there is a huge diversion on how we ought to \naddress that problem. There are those who want to start a new \ncategorical Federal grant program involving the Federal Government in a \nrole that has always been left to State and local governments, a \nprogram that will, as all Federal programs, mushroom in the years \nahead, a path we need not nor should we go down.\n  The provision I am offering is a better way. It addresses the issue \nof school construction in an appropriate way for the Federal Government \nand a provision that has broad bipartisan support in that it passed the \nFinance Committee on March 13 by a 20-0 vote. This is a better approach \nas we seek to assist local schools and State governments in their \ntraditional role of building school facilities.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Hutchinson \namendment. This tax amendment is not appropriate at this time. The \npending underlying legislation is not a revenue bill.\n  If this amendment passes, this important bill will be potentially \nsubject to a ``blue slip'' by the House. A ``blue slip'' would in \neffect kill this bill and the Senate would have to start anew.\n  Therefore, a tax amendment at this time would unnecessarily \njeopardize the good work of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  I would note that this provision regarding private activity bonds for \nschool construction is contained in the Finance Committee bill passed \nyesterday, and that bill will be taken up tomorrow for consideration.\n  I have had a very long history on this matter of encouraging school \nconstruction, and specifically this very language that is contained in \nthe amendment. I am very pleased that I was able to include this school \nconstruction bond language in the tax bill and look to hopefully having \nit signed into law.\n  For these reasons, while I know that the Senator has offered this \namendment with the best of intentions, unfortunately, I must \nrespectfully oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay this \namendment aside at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator, under the order, is authorized to \noffer her amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair for being such a strong supporter of \nafterschool programs for children. I ask unanimous consent that \nSenators Ensign and Dodd be added as original cosponsors of this \namendment on afterschool programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 563, As Modified, To Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there is a typing error in the amendment \nthat deals with the sense-of-the-Senate part that called ``billion'' \n``million.'' I received concurrence that I may ask for that to be \nmodified, and I so ask.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is modified, and the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mr. \n     Ensign, and Mr. Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 563, as \n     modified, to amendment No. 358.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding, and authorize \n appropriations for, part F of title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n                         Education Act of 1965)\n\n       At the end of title IX, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 902. SENSE OF THE SENATE; AUTHORIZATION OF \n                   APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Congress should continue toward the goal of providing \n     the necessary funding for afterschool programs by \n     appropriating the authorized level of $1,500,000,000 for FY \n     2002\n\n[[Page S4973]]\n\n     to carry out part F title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965.\n       (2) This funding should be the benchmark for future years \n     in order to reach the goal of providing academically enriched \n     activities during after school hours for the 7,000,000 \n     children in need.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out part F of Title I of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965--\n       (1) $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;\n       (2) $2,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;\n       (3) $3,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2005;\n       (4) $3,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;\n       (5) $4,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2007; and\n       (6) $4,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2008.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to be offering this amendment which \ndeals with afterschool programs in our country. The purpose of this \namendment is very clear. It is to ensure that every child who needs an \nafterschool program in our Nation will have that opportunity. This \namendment does that by authorizing sufficient funds over the next 6 \nyears so that no child has to be a latchkey child.\n  What do I mean by a latchkey child? That is a child who comes home \nafter school, both parents are working, no one is in the home, and \nthey, in some cases, can get into trouble.\n  How do we know this? We know this because the FBI tells us that most \ncrime occurs among juveniles right after school. One can see on this \nchart that the juvenile crime rate peaks at the hour of 3 p.m. and \ncontinues and finally starts to go down in the evening hours. We know \nthat juvenile crime occurs after school; that latchkey children do get \ninto trouble after school. It is very clear. That is why we have so \nmany police officers all over this Nation supporting our amendment and \nsupporting afterschool programs in general.\n  If one looks at this chart, one can see all of the various law \nenforcement organizations that support the amendment of Senator Ensign \nand myself: The National Association of Police Athletic and Activity \nLeagues, Fight Crime, Invest in Kids, National Sheriffs Association, \nMajor Cities Police Chiefs, Police Executive Research Forum, National \nDistrict Attorneys Association, California District Attorneys \nAssociation, Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police, Texas Police \nChiefs Association, Arizona Sheriffs and Prosecutors Association, Maine \nChiefs and Sheriffs Associations, Rhode Island Police Chiefs' \nAssociation.\n  This is a partial list of police organizations across the country \nthat support this amendment. They understand that once a crime is \ncommitted and they are called in, it is very late in the game. I have \ntalked with police officers who look me in the eye and say there used \nto be a divide between the social workers and the police officers when \nit came to juvenile crime. There is no longer a divide.\n  The police officers understand, because they are on the street, that \nif kids are kept busy and they are kept happy, we see a lessening of \nthe crime rate, and that is why quality afterschool programs are so \nimportant.\n  I am very pleased that with Senator Jeffords' leadership, along with \nSenator Kennedy, we have sufficient funding in this year's bill of $1.5 \nbillion for the year 2002. If we play that out, which is what we do in \nour legislation, and we continue the increase just to meet the need, we \nwill be able to cover 7 million children in afterschool programs by the \nyear 2008.\n  This bill is about reform, and I am for reform, but clearly if we \nreform our schools during the day, but then kids are left to fend for \nthemselves after school, all the benefits of that reform and testing \ncould well be lost. That is why it is so important that we add this \nafterschool component, not just for this year as we have in this bill \nbut we play it out for the 6-year authorization.\n  We need places that are safe for our children, protected places, \nproductive places for them to go.\n  Let me show a couple pictures because pictures tell a story and are \nworth a thousand words.\n  This is a photo from our Sacramento afterschool program where they \nhave called in special people. This gentleman is an expert with \nanimals. He brought in this crocodile. The kids are so taken with it. \nOne can see the look on their faces. These kids are happy, they are \nexcited, they are happy to be in school, they are learning about \nnature, and they are not getting into trouble.\n  I have another photograph. This one is also from Sacramento. One can \nsee the young people are engaged in a board game, and there is an older \nmentor sitting with them. Again, they are productive and happy. It is \nanother way of showing what afterschool programs can do.\n  It is instructive to hear what the kids themselves say about \nafterschool programs. There is a great program in Los Angeles called \nLA's Best. I have visited it. It is a shining example of what we can do \nright for our children. This is a student at 68th Street Elementary \nSchool:\n\n       LA's Best is the best place to be after school. I like the \n     games and the work. I like going to the computer lab . . . I \n     like going to the library, but most of all I like the people.\n\n  And then we have another student from Hillcrest Drive Elementary \nSchool:\n\n       If we didn't have LA's Best, I would probably still be \n     going home to an empty house.\n\n  No child should have to go home to an empty house. No child should \nhave to be tempted to get into trouble after school. We can do this.\n  I often say that it was Dwight Eisenhower who really started the \nFederal role in education. It is true the States do the majority of it, \nbut what he pointed out was that when there is a void, we have an \nobligation to move in to assist the schools--not tell them what to do \nbut to offer them the resources.\n  That is what this amendment is all about. We are taking your $1.5 \nbillion, Mr. President, that you have put in this bill and we are \nextending it out so we can make sure every schoolchild in this country \ngets afterschool supervision.\n  At this time, it is my pleasure to yield 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Nevada, Mr. Ensign, who is the original cosponsor of my amendment.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in support of \nthe sense of the Senate being offered by the junior Senator from \nCalifornia on the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program.\n  The 21st Century Community Learning Centers provide a safe-haven for \nchildren during the after-school hours. They provide students in rural \nand inner-city public schools with access to homework centers, tutors, \nmentors, and drug and alcohol prevention counseling, as well as \ncultural and recreational activities. Nationwide, these centers serve \nover 615,000 children per year in over 3,600 public schools.\n  There are an estimated 8 million ``latch-key kids'' who go home every \nday to an empty house after school. Approximately 35 percent of 12 \nyear-olds are regularly left alone while their parents are at work. \nParents need a viable alternative to leaving their children alone.\n  According to the Department of Education, children who regularly \nattend high-quality after-school programs have better peer relations \nand emotional adjustment, better grades and conduct in school, more \nacademic and enrichment opportunities, spend less time watching \ntelevision, and have lower incidences of drug-use, violence, and \npregnancy. This makes sense considering that studies by the FBI have \nfound that the peak hours for juvenile crime and victimization are from \n2 p.m. to 8 p.m.\n  My home State of Nevada receives four grants from this program, which \nserve numerous elementary, middle, and high schools across the state. \nRecently a news crew was visiting one of the 21st Century Community \nLearning Center sites in Las Vegas and asked the children why they \nliked coming to the program. The children responded more \nenthusiastically than the reporter had anticipated, stating that the \nprogram had helped them improve their grades from D's and F's to A's \nand B's, and was a safe and fun place for them to go after school.\n  I am committed to ensuring that our schools have the assistance they \nneed to ensure that our children leave the public education system as \nwell-rounded individuals. Children attending public schools should not \nonly be proficient in reading, writing, and arithmetic, but should also \nbe skillful in music, art, and athletics.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this amendment to prove that \nCongress is willing to provide the 21st Century Community Learning \nCenters\n\n[[Page S4974]]\n\nprogram with the much-needed support that it deserves.\n  Mr. President, on a personal note, when I was growing up with a \nsingle mother--my mom worked--at times she wasn't home for us latchkey \nkids and we did not have these types of programs after school. I will \ntell you that I was on my road to a life of crime because of the \nsituation. I was very fortunate that later in life my mom got remarried \nand was able to quit her job and stay home with us; but a lot of \nparents are not in that kind of a situation. There is no question that \ndirect supervision helped me turn away from a life of juvenile \ndelinquency into now what, obviously, has become a productive life. At \nleast I like to think of it that way.\n  I think of many children, though, in the same situation that I was \nin, go home after school with nothing to do. Back then, my friends and \nI would say: What are we going to do today? We would think of numerous \nways to get in trouble.\n  Now, the things that we did back then, which we don't want to mention \ntoday, were not exactly good things to do but are mild compared to what \na lot of the kids are into today because of the influences we have in \nour society. So for us to use programs such as this, programs that are \nworking to make a difference and giving children positive things to do, \nI think these programs should be applauded and supported. We should \nwork to eliminate wasteful Government spending, but when Government \nprograms such as this are working, we should all be getting behind them \nand say: Let us fund these programs; let us make sure that they are \nworking effectively. Hold them accountable for their results. But as \nlong as they are providing the results they have been, I think we \nshould continue to support them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank the junior Senator from \nCalifornia for allowing me to participate in her amendment.\n  (Mr. ENSIGN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I hope our colleagues in their offices and \ndoing their work heard the remarks of my colleague from Nevada. I think \nhe was eloquent because he spoke from the heart and from his own life \nexperience. His own life experience underscores the need for this \namendment and what we are trying to do. You can take the best kid in \nthe world, but if they are home alone after school and they are very \nlonely and they do not have guidance, bad things can happen, and bad \nthings do happen.\n  I want to show, again, the chart by the FBI which underscores exactly \nwhat my friend was saying as far as when crime occurs. If you look at \nthe chart, it is very clear. Juvenile crime starts climbing right after \nschool and it peaks right after school, and eventually, as the parents \ncome home, the crime rate goes down. So it is not, as we say, rocket \nscience to understand that we can do a tremendous amount for our \nchildren.\n  The other point my friend made which I thought was important was that \nhe has heard stories from his own State, where they use some of these \nfunds, that the academic performance of the children is also improving.\n  I have seen programs in Richmond, CA, where the local Police Athletic \nLeague serves over 400 students and the juvenile crime rate has \ndecreased by 36 percent as a result of the afterschool program. It is \ndocumented. The scores are going up.\n  In Hemet, CA, we have, again, the police athletic and activities \nleague serving over 2,500 students in that afterschool program. There \nhas been a 29-percent decrease in juvenile crime and the scores are \ngetting better.\n  In Highland Park, MI, the 21st Century Learning Center reports a 40-\npercent drop in juvenile crime after the implementation of their \nprograms and the scores are getting better.\n  In Brooklyn, at the Cyprus Hills Center, it was reported that 72 \npercent of the program participants improved their grades by 35 \npercentage points in one or more of their classes. This is a proven \nwinner.\n  In Chatanooga, TN, absentee days dropped from 568 days to 135 days. \nThat is an amazing drop. Why is it? Because the children are doing \ntheir homework after school. They are getting support after school. \nThey are getting mentoring after school, and it works.\n  In Plainview, AR, the 21st Century Learning Center implemented an \nabstinance program that resulted in no pregnancies in their high school \ngraduating class for the first time in years. Before this program, \nthere were 16 pregnancies in 1998. I did not mention that. I showed you \nthe crime rate. What I did not tell you is the teen pregnancy situation \nis traced back to afterschool hours.\n  So, Mr. President, what you said is so, so true. We know it from our \nown experience when we were children growing up. We know it as we watch \nthe new afterschool programs take hold.\n  I have been in public office for 25 years now and I have worked hard \nin a number of areas, but I have to say one of my proudest moments was \nbringing the first afterschool amendment down to the floor of the \nSenate many years ago where we were then spending $40 million a year on \nafterschool programs. And working together across party lines, and at \nthat time working with the President, we were able to see this program \ngo up to $800 million and is now serving many children.\n  But still, we have 7 million children to go and we will not rest, all \nof us here, across party lines, who care about kids, until we make sure \nthat every child has an alternative, every child has an option.\n  In closing, I would like to say our children are good kids. \nUnfortunately, we always seem to spotlight the bad kids, the kids who \nget in trouble. I have to say, I believe all children are gifts from \nGod and all children deserve to be honored. They all come on this Earth \nand they deserve to be honored. We do not honor our children if we do \nnot invest in them.\n  These are not huge investments, these are really quite small \ninvestments. When we invest in a child in a way that is positive, where \nwe give that child that Head Start, that Early Start, that Jump Start, \nwhere we then send them to quality public schools where we then have \nquality afterschool programs, we are going to see the vast majority of \nsocial problems in our Nation will be resolved. This is what I believe. \nAre you going to miss the boat on a few kids? Of course. Are you going \nto have a kid who simply will not respond? Of course. But that is a \nrarity.\n  So I think this amendment, as it was spoken to by Senator Ensign in \nsuch an eloquent way, where he traced back his childhood, where he \nremembered what it was like to be alone, without supervision, to be \nfloundering and perhaps to be steered into a life from which you can \nnever really come back--that kind of situation should not be present \nfor any of our children in this Nation.\n  I hope very much we will have bipartisan support, that we will be \nable to pass this overwhelmingly and send a clear signal to our \nchildren that they are important before school, during school, and \nafter school.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I wonder if the Senator will be good enough to yield me \n5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am delighted to yield Senator Kennedy as much time as \nhe may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Boxer and Senator Ensign \nfor this amendment. I think this amendment is enormously important. In \nthis whole debate on elementary and secondary education we are now \nmaking a commitment to the families and to the country that we are \ngoing to have the funding for these reforms which are in this \nlegislation, which I support; also, that we are not going to leave \nchildren who have limited-English-speaking ability behind. We had a \ngood debate on that. We are only reaching 25 percent of those children.\n  As a result of the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas--we had a \ngood debate on this--a decision was made that we were not going to be \nsatisfied to leave behind any children who had those challenges.\n  Now with this amendment we are saying we are not going to leave \nbehind any of the children who need afterschool services. That is what \nthis amendment is really all about. We are making our commitment to the \nchildren in the classroom with supplementary services, with good \nteachers,\n\n[[Page S4975]]\n\nand we have made a commitment to make sure we are going to have good \nteachers. We are making sure we are going to have the bilingual support \nchildren are going to need. We are not leaving anyone behind. This \namendment is saying the same with regard to afterschool programs.\n  As the Senator from California understands, this program, the \nafterschool program, was the most oversubscribed program of any in the \nClinton administration, with quality programs. There were not any other \nprograms that could come close to it. That is a reflection of the \ndemand in the local communities. That is a reflection of what is \nhappening out there in communities all across this country.\n  As has been pointed out, there are 7 million children going to be \nhome alone. Under the existing legislation, we cover a little more than \na million of them. But the importance of this program is that we are \nmoving in a glidepath to reach out to these children, all 7 million. It \nwill take some time, but that is the best we can do at this time.\n  What we are saying to those children about their afterschool \nsituation is, we as a country believe this time for you is important. \nFor many of us who have seen these afterschool programs, we know what \nan extraordinary difference they make in enhancing the child's not only \nacademic ability but confidence. Also, the children work with other \nchildren. In many of the centers in Massachusetts you have older \nchildren working with younger children. That has made a big difference \nin the older children's attitude about the program. It has made a big \ndifference in the private sector.\n  I can take you to places in Boston where many companies are coming in \nand talking about graphic arts and photography, which are not being \ntaught in the schools. It just clicked children's minds open. Children \nwho were indifferent in school are tying into photography or graphic \narts in ways they could not have imagined and are now interested in \ngoing to school.\n  It can also provide pathways for children in sports and athletics, \nwith all the lessons in life that come from competing and participating \nin sports.\n  This makes sense. It is of key importance. These afterschool \nsituations can be enormously important and significant for the \nsupplementary services that are necessary and needed for children. We \nhave seen that particularly in the Boys Clubs and Girls Clubs in \nBoston, how they are working providing all these supplementary \nservices.\n  If we are really going to do the job for children in this country, \nwhich I believe this President wants to do, and we are committed to do \nin this legislation, this amendment is enormously important, far beyond \nthe resources that are being talked about here, making a real \ndifference in quality education and investment in the children.\n  I commend the Senator. I certainly hope this amendment will be \nadopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from California \nfor what she is doing with this very wonderful program. I introduced \nthe original legislation which resulted in this program. It was modeled \nafter a school I found in Vermont which had the foresight to understand \nthe need to extend the child's time in school, or on the school \ngrounds, and to give them constructive things to do, something \neducational during the period of time before they can go home and find \nsomeone there to greet them.\n  Actually, it came further in the past than that. When I had the \nopportunity to visit the former Soviet Union, not too long after the \nend of the Soviet Union in that sense, I visited what were called \nPioneer Palaces. They were spread throughout the Soviet Union. I \nvisited them. I found what they did. From the time school ended, from 3 \nin the afternoon until 6 at night, every child was required to do \nsomething that was constructive and hopefully leading towards some \noccupation or whatever. As you walked around, you found people learning \nhow to be cosmonauts, 8- or 9-year-olds. Then as you went further, you \nsaw people very intensely working on musical instruments and all sorts \nof things. Every child was required to find something to do that was \nconstructive during that period.\n  As we know, as the Senator from Nevada pointed out, the studies show \nhow important it is, in the time from the midafternoon until \nsuppertime, to keep young people fully occupied. Crime, pregnancies--\nalmost all of that results from behavior during that period of time.\n  So I have a certain feeling of thankfulness for the way this program \nhas grown. President Clinton grabbed onto a program which had a little \nbit of funding and had the foresight to make it into a really well \nfunded program.\n  I thank the former President for doing that, but right now it is up \nto us to do all we can to make sure this kind of a program is available \nas far across this land as possible and in such numbers that at least \nevery young person ought to have an opportunity to have a fulfilling \nfull day rather than just the hours at school.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Has all my time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feingold be given 6 \nminutes to speak on another topic since no one else is in the Chamber \nto speak against my amendment. We can take the rest of the time or \nwhatever the Presiding Officer wishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK. I yield 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator very much for her amendment and for \nher help in getting me time to speak.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Feingold are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I, again, thank the ranking member, the \nchairman, and the Senator from California for their generosity in \ngiving me this time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand, there is a half hour in opposition, \nwhich is not being used at this time. For the benefit of the \nmembership, the time has been established to vote. We are prepared to \ndo that. I think the leadership has stated a time for the convenience \nof the Members. If there is no objection, I will talk a little bit \nabout what the afterschool programs have meant to children, and as soon \nas any Member comes to speak in opposition to the amendment, I will be \nglad to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will proceed on that basis.\n  Mr. President, I will mention some success stories. I regret I missed \nthe splendid presentation by the present Presiding Officer earlier \ntoday, but I look forward to reading it in the Record. I have been told \nby a number of my colleagues what a moving story it was. I thank the \nSenator for sharing that with this body.\n  I will mention a few of the individual success stories that we have \nseen in Boston. We have a program called From 2 To 6. It is available \nto all children up to the age of 13 in Boston. Let me mention some of \nthe experiences which we have seen in that program.\n\n  There is a young student named Natalia. When Natalia started in the \nGardner Extended Services School in Allston in the middle of the 1999 \nschool year, she could not read, write, or perform basic arithmetic. \nThey suggested that Natalia enroll in its afterschool program to \nreceive extra support in both her academics and her study skills. With \nthe help of a certified teacher, a teacher's aide, and several Boston \nCollege tutors, Natalia showed significant progress.\n  Currently, Natalia is in the second grade and is performing at grade \nlevel\n\n[[Page S4976]]\n\nin all academic areas of the classroom. She is maintaining a solid B \naverage. Natalia is also now participating in many extracurricular \nactivities, such as the African Dance Club and swimming lessons at the \nYMCA.\n  Michael: In 1999, 11-year-old Michael spent afterschool time playing \nNintendo, and as the end of the school year approached, he began to \nhang around with a group of kids who were affiliated with a local gang. \nHis mother grew concerned and enrolled Michael in the summer camp \nprogram run by the East Boston YMCA Program Center.\n  At first Michael was not very responsive. However, as the summer \nprogressed, he learned how to swim and became more confident in his \nathletic abilities. By the end of the summer, he made a lot of friends \nand also started to mentor the 5- and 6-year-olds. He also continued to \nattend the afterschool program when school started again. He got sort \nof hooked on it through the course of the summer. Many of his new \nfriends were going to the afterschool program, too. Since being \ninvolved in the program, all of his teachers have commented about the \nprogress he has made. He now receives A's and B's on his report card \nAnd enjoys outdoor activities.\n  Edgar from Roxbury first came to the B.E.L.L. Foundation's BASICs \nprogram at the Jackson/Mann Elementary School in Allston in the fall of \n1998 as a second grader. He was a friendly, outgoing, energetic \nstudent, but he couldn't read and didn't know the alphabet. Edgar was \nembarrassed to work on academics with other students his age because he \nwas well below grade level in literacy. They paired him with a one-on-\none tutor, and he worked hard to improve but became frustrated when he \ndidn't see immediate results.\n  Seeing that Edgar might need more support, his tutor encouraged him \nto get to know a fifth grader name Jesus. They both had many things in \ncommon. Both were recent immigrants from Brazil. They loved wrestling, \nmaking people laugh. One day a tutor overheard Jesus say to Edgar: I \nknow you're having a hard time reading. I did, too, when I first came \nhere, and I promise you that it will get easier.\n  A year later, Edgar is now completing grade level work in school and \ngetting good grades. He also helps his peers who are having a hard time \nreading. It was the afterschool program that has made the difference.\n  We have example after example of these programs. The 2-6 program, as \nI mentioned, is primarily for children 12 or younger. We know that this \nparticular program will reach the children in middle school and high \nschool, and that is something which is very much in need and is one of \nthe principal reasons we are working now to see its support.\n  I mentioned the Institute for Student Achievement in six New York \nschool districts which is a school-based afterschool program that \nprovides counseling and academic assistance to middle and high school \nstudents who are struggling in school. The programs, STAR, Success \nThrough Academic Readiness, and COMET, Children of Many Educational \nTalents, provide tutoring, academic enrichment activities, and \ncomputer-assisted instruction. Community service and family involvement \nare also key components of the afterschool programs. Every STAR student \nhas graduated from high school, and 96 percent have gone on to college. \nTest scores at Hempstead High School on Long Island have improved \ndramatically since the afterschool program began.\n\n  This is the tie-in between the core program that we are talking about \nin terms of the classroom. What goes on in the classroom is the key: \nobviously, a well-trained teacher, good curriculum, accountability, the \nrange of different challenges that exist in the classroom. We see these \nafterschool programs and what has happened. When you have effective \nafterschool programs associated with schools in terms of providing \nthose supplementary services, the children improve academically \nsignificantly.\n  I mentioned this excellent series of afterschool programs in six New \nYork districts that the students have been attending, and 96 percent \nhave gone on to college. The test scores of the Hempstead High School \non Long Island, which is sort of the major high school in the center of \nthese activities, have improved dramatically since the afterschool \nprogram began. The State removed the school from its list of low-\nperforming schools 1 year ahead of schedule.\n  Here was a school that was in trouble. With the development of the \nafterschool programs and the supplementary services that were provided, \nwe see the very positive impact that had on the academic achievement in \nthe school. This is the point which has been made by the two sponsors \nof this legislation.\n  In Pennsylvania, the Rand Corporation, when evaluating afterschool \nprograms supported by Foundations, Inc. in the Philadelphia area, found \nfourth graders in the program outperformed comparison students in \nreading, language arts, and math. The Rand Corporation is a tough, \nindependent organization that does evaluations of various programs. \nTheir own evaluation of afterschool programs, in this case in \nPhiladelphia, which is very much challenged in terms of their school \nsystems, has shown some results.\n  In Ohio, the University of Cincinnati, when evaluating the Ohio \nHunger Task Force urban afterschool initiative, found fourth graders in \nthe program exceeding the statewide percentage of students meeting \nproficient standards in math, writing, reading, citizenship, and in \nscience.\n  In Texas, the Lighted Schools Project, in Waco, TX, provides over 650 \nmiddle school students with a safe, supervised environment during after \nhours. The program targets at-risk youth, although all middle school \nstudents can participate in free activities, including sports, crafts, \nspecial events, and institutions. Students have access to primary \nhealth care and programs to enhance self-confidence, violence \nprevention, the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse, conflict resolution, \nand to receive tutoring and homework assistance.\n  These programs also have a very positive effect in terms of reducing \nthe violence in school and, in this particular case, the dangers of \nalcohol abuse and also the conflict resolution, important initiatives \nwhich are taking place in schools.\n  We have some enormously impressive ones in Massachusetts started by \nthe former Attorney General Harshbarger and continued and expanded by \nAttorney General Reilly on conflict resolutions. And we have had as \nwell in many of our schools the AmeriCorps students involved with the \nstudents in what they call Peace Games. It is a rather interesting \nconcept where they just do it for an hour once a week. And what it is, \nthey take large popcorn cans, jars, and they take extended rubber \nbands. Then they all pick up the popcorn cans and pile them on top of \neach other to make a design.\n\n  The fact is, they all have to work together because if one loosens \nthe end of the rubber bands, the popcorn can will fall. And as they \nbuild it, they will work it out so they will have 10 students working \ntogether in order to construct it. They play games with it about what \npart of the class can do it. Then they have classes against each other, \njust 1 hour a week. It is supervised by the AmeriCorps children. It has \nhad an incredible impact in terms of reducing conflict and violence \namong the students in that school. It is called Peace Games.\n  These are the range of activities. These are the kinds of hands-on \nlocal initiatives that are taking place in these afterschool programs \nthat are helping. They have demonstrated a positive impact in terms of \nacademic achievement.\n  I know time is running out now. I could give the example in the \nreduction in terms of teenage pregnancies. The interesting sad effect \nis about 80 percent of teenage pregnancies happen during the \nafterschool time, between 3 in the afternoon and 7 o'clock at night.\n  The fact that we have these afterschool programs has had a positive \nimpact in reducing teenage pregnancies, in many instances, more \neffectively than some of the other programs that have been tried. \nReducing violence, academic achievement, bringing children who may have \nfallen somewhat further behind because of the fact maybe they didn't \nget into the Head Start program, maybe they didn't get the early \ninterventions in terms of help in literacy as they were starting\n\n[[Page S4977]]\n\nthrough school, all these kinds of initiatives have helped.\n  This amendment is really an outreach. It is going to bring up all of \nthese children that perhaps have fallen through the cracks at one place \nor another and help to bring them on into hopefully the academic \nsetting, and then, with the other parts of the legislation working, if \nthey are funded--they are not funded, but they have to be funded--can \nreally make a difference.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am taken with my colleague's analysis because there are \nvery few things we do that have such a beneficial effect in so many \nways. As my colleague said: We are looking at a program, after school, \nthat helps kids improve their scores; that is, the academic \nachievement.\n  We are seeing a program that keeps kids out of trouble. That is why \nall the police organizations support after school, and the PAL group \nsupports it. We are talking about a reduction in teen pregnancy, which \nis absolutely documented because of these programs. We are talking \nabout the ability of kids to learn to work together. There is one other \nthing, I say to my friend, he didn't mention directly, but he hinted at \nit. If there is a child who falls through the cracks who may have an \nemotional problem--and we all looked at this when we looked at the \nColumbine tragedy and other places where kids have acted out in \nhorrible ways. It is a chance for a professional to see a child who \nreally needs help. It gives a chance for that one-on-one.\n  My colleague from Nevada pointed out that there is a chance for kids \nto learn better English, make sure their skills in the language are \nimproved. It is very rare that you see a program that does so many \nthings. Of course, someone is going to slip through the cracks. But \nthis is one that I think is so crucial. I am proud to have the support \nof my colleague from Massachusetts and the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. One final point. This is the Milwaukee project. Public \nschools, law enforcement, community-based organizations, and residents \nprovide safe havens at neighborhood sites for children. There were \n8,400 youth participating. The Milwaukee project provides homework \ntutoring assistance, recreational games, arts and crafts. The program \nhelped reduce the crime rate in neighborhoods participating in the \nproject by providing youth with alternative activities during \nafterschool hours.\n  In the 15 months following the inception of the program, the crime \nrate dropped 21 percent in the neighborhoods that had these afterschool \nprograms--law enforcement, teenage pregnancy, substance abuse, \nviolence, academic achievement, and accomplishment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. May I interrupt for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe Boxer amendment occur at 11:15 a.m.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I say to my \nfriend, the manager of the bill for the majority, we have been waiting \nfor I don't know how many days to conclude the Harkin amendment. We are \nwaiting for a second-degree amendment to be filed by the majority. This \nis one of the most important amendments in this whole legislation. I \nsuggest we should move on and just vote on Harkin if a second-degree \namendment is not going to be offered.\n  I will just alert everybody that I hope perhaps after this vote it \nwill be ready because each hour we are told it is almost ready. It must \nbe a doozy if it is taking this long to prepare.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. My understanding is there will be a second-degree \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. We know that, and we are waiting. We have tried to be \ncooperative. We could have filled the tree ourselves. We want to have \ngood feelings on both sides about the way this legislation moves. We \nhope that maybe it can be filed when we finish the vote on the Boxer \namendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I will meet with the Senator. I hope we can go forward \nwith this vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The question is on agreeing to \nthe amendment of the Senator from California.\n  The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Missouri (Mrs. Carnahan) \nis absent attending a funeral.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMissouri (Mrs. Carnahan) would vote ``aye.''\n  The result was announced--yeas 60, nays 39, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 105 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--60\n\n     Akaka\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--39\n\n     Allard\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Carnahan\n       \n  The Amendment (No. 358) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe the manager of the legislation is \ngoing to offer a unanimous consent request we have worked out that will \nallow us to have some morning business for Senators who wish to speak \nfor a brief period of time and for Senator Akaka to offer his amendment \nand also to get to a vote this afternoon on a Reed of Rhode Island \namendment.\n  Let me plead with the Members, though, if we could avoid \ninterruptions as much as we could today. Senators Kennedy and Jeffords \nand others working on the legislation are trying very hard to make \nprogress on the education bill. When we have interruptions for other \nissues, Senators tend to get away from the floor, and it slows us down. \nWe want to try to finish this legislation at a reasonable time next \nweek. I thank Senators Jeffords and Kennedy and Reid for trying to make \nthat happen.\n  At this point, we thought the fair thing was to work out an agreement \nwhere we could have a brief period of morning business and then return \nto the bill. Senator Jeffords has an agreement we are ready to offer.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I have one which will be here momentarily.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could inquire while we are waiting, is it correct then \nthat Senator Akaka will have an amendment right after morning business?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. As I understand, it will take 2 \nto 3 minutes for Senator Akaka to raise this amendment, and hopefully \nit will be accepted. If not, we will accept it at a later time. Then we \nput into effect the understanding that the Senator\n\n[[Page S4978]]\n\nfrom Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, would offer his libraries amendment and to \nvote at a quarter of 2. Then we would have the time, as the leader has \nannounced, so there would be a brief period for morning business so \nthat from three to four Senators would be able to address the Senate.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Would Senator Reed be ready to go immediately after this \nsequence is lined up?\n  Mr. REED. There is a modification of my amendment which is being \nreviewed by your staff and Senator Jeffords' staff. If that is in \norder, then I believe we will have to wait until I get word.\n  Mr. LOTT. Does the Senator have a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. LOTT. Go ahead then.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nAkaka now be recognized to call up amendment No. 407 and there be up to \n5 minutes under his control. I further ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators be recognized as in morning business for the \nfollowing times: Senator Helms, up to 15 minutes; Senator Kerry, 10 \nminutes; Senators Baucus and Jeffords, 5 minutes each. I further ask \nunanimous consent that following the morning business, Senator Reed of \nRhode Island be recognized to call up and modify his amendment No. 425 \nand the time between then and 1:45 be equally divided, with no second-\ndegree amendments in order, and that the vote occur in relationship to \nthe amendment at 1:45 today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, reserving my right to object, the \nmodification is critical, whether or not the modification is accepted \nby your side. I wanted to clarify, the modification has been accepted \nin your unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. It is in the UC.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I regret I \nwas not present on the floor when the leader and the chairman and \nranking member of the committee were proposing a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 407 To Amendment No. 358\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, amendment \nNo. 407. I ask that it be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 407.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To strike the provision requiring recognition by the Governor \n of Hawaii of certain organizations primarily serving and representing \n                           Native Hawaiians)\n\n       On page 548, lines 2 and 3, strike ``which are recognized \n     by the Governor of the State of Hawaii''.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, this amendment makes a technical change to \nsection 4118 of S. 1, and would allow organizations that primarily \nserve Native Hawaiians to compete for grants under this section. The \ncurrent language in the bill requires the Governor to recognize the \nNative Hawaiian institution as a condition for consideration for the \ngrant. This amendment would remove this requirement, thereby \nstreamlining this process and allowing more organizations to apply for \nthese grants. I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment of \nthe Senator from Hawaii?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I don't intend to debate it, but Senator \nKennedy indicated he would be right back. I don't know if he intends to \nspeak. I wanted to protect his right to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 407.\n  The amendment (No. 407) was agreed to.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to deliver my remarks seated at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Helms pertaining to the introduction of S. 894 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, with respect to my previously agreed upon \namendment No. 407, I ask unanimous consent that the instruction line \nconform to the Jeffords substitute amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kerry and Mr. Frist pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 895 are located in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 425, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, pursuant to the unanimous consent under \nconsideration there will be a vote scheduled on my amendment at 1:45. \nAt this time I ask unanimous consent to make a modification to \namendment No. 425.

Mr. President, this modification deals with my underlying \namendment which would authorize funding for the acquisition of library \nbooks and library materials for our school libraries across the \ncountry. This original amendment I offered on behalf of myself and \nSenator Snowe, Senator Chafee, Senator Kennedy, and others.\n  While I was debating the amendment initially, there was some concern \nraised by my colleague and friend, Senator Collins from Maine, that my \namendment would in some way detract from the President's Reading First \nInitiative. I support that initiative and compliment both him and \nSenator Collins. It is focused on raising the literacy of our children \nacross the country. It is an effort that has to be undertaken and I am \npleased it is being undertaken.\n  I want to make it clear that my proposed amendment to restore funding \nfor school libraries is a complement to the President's program and not \na subtraction from that program. The modification to the amendment does \njust that. It clarifies that what I am attempting to do is add to the \nReading First Initiative and not subtract from it.\n  My amendment will complement the President's initiative and Senator \nCollins' correcting amendment that were unanimously adopted last week \nin this Chamber. It will do that by providing an essential part of any \nliteracy program, and that is high-quality reading material.\n  The President's focus and Senator Collins' focus is improving the \ninstruction with respect to reading skills and literacy in this \ncountry, which is an important goal. But it cannot be fully \naccomplished, the goal of having literate American students, without \nalso having high-quality reading material. Most people understand this \nintuitively. It is one thing to teach the techniques of reading; it is \nsomething else to open up to children a realm of discovery and wonder \nand opportunity by having good, high-quality school libraries--we hope \nin every school in this country.\n  I see my proposal as a very important component of the overall \nstrategy of the Reading First Initiative. This is a proposal that would \nessentially allow local communities to receive Federal resources to \nacquire library materials: books and the materials necessary for a \nmodern, up-to-date school library.\n  It would give extraordinary flexibility and discretion to local \ncommunities because it would allow them to make the choice of what is \nthe most appropriate material. It responds to an obvious need \nthroughout this country and the need is chronic, and that is to provide \nfor good school libraries.\n  Unfortunately, if you travel throughout this country, if you go back \nto your home State, and you visit school libraries, most of those \ncollections are out of date; most of those collections have not been \nrenewed and have not been improved over many years. This is not because \nof the intentions or the wishes of local authorities. The reality is, \nlibrary acquisitions are the type of program that can be put off year \nto year to deal with more pressing needs, and year 1 becomes year 2, \nwhich becomes year 3, and you find yourself, as we find ourselves in so \nmany schools across this country, in a situation where the library is \ndeplorable.\n  We know that good libraries are connected to good literacy skills \nand, for the purpose of this legislation, good results on tests--both \nstandardized tests and nonstandardized tests. The latest results in the \nNational Assessment of Educational Progress show that from 1992 to the \nyear 2000, reading scores have remained flat for fourth graders. One \naspect of that finding is the fact that there are too many schools in \nthis country where the library books are out of date and inadequate, in \naddition to problems with teaching the mechanics of reading. We have to \nsolve both problems if we really want to see test results take off.\n  As you find throughout the country, in looking at different studies, \nthere is a clear indication that well-stocked, modern, up-to-date \nschool libraries contribute directly to success on achievement tests. \nAnd that seems obvious to most people because libraries are the places \nwhich will have the information, but are also attractive to young \npeople. They will want to go to the library because it is modern, up to \ndate, interesting, exciting--all the things we want education to be in \nthis country.\n  One of the reasons why school libraries are in such poor condition is \nthe lack of dedicated funding. In the beginning of our efforts to \nimprove elementary and secondary education in 1965, in the confines of \nthe first Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we provided for \nspecific funding for school libraries. However, several years later, we \nrolled all of this funding into one block grant, title VI. As a result, \nthe commitment to libraries, because of local pressures to spend on \nother endeavors, has resulted in a situation across the country of very \npoor school libraries. We can do better. When we improve school \nlibraries, as I indicated before, we improve the performance of \nstudents.\n  It has been found in one study that for every school, in every grade \nlevel, in which there was a strong school library and strong school \nlibrary services, there were improvements in test\n\n[[Page S4980]]\n\nscores regardless of social and economic factors in the particular \ncommunity. This study was conducted in States such as Colorado, \nPennsylvania, and Alaska. So it is not a regional effect; it is not an \nurban effect versus a rural effect; it is the effect of good libraries \nin the schools. These findings echo earlier findings which found that \nstudents in schools with well-equipped libraries and staff performed \nbetter on achievement tests for reading comprehension and basic \nresearch skills.\n  Interestingly enough, the President has appointed, as his nominee for \nAssistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education at the U.S. \nDepartment of Education, Dr. Susan Neuman. Dr. Neuman, a professor at \nTemple University, is a nationally renowned expert in early literacy \ndevelopment. She has written about the importance of books in \ndeveloping and enhancing the literacy skills of children.\n\n  Dr. Neuman wrote an article in the Reading Research Quarterly \nentitled ``Books Make A Difference: A Study of Access to Literacy.'' \nShe talked about a literacy program in Pennsylvania childcare centers \nand concluded that access to books matters and is critical for early \nliteracy; children exposed to books outperformed a control group on \nevery measure of early literacy abilities.\n  That is the distinguished individual who has been nominated by \nPresident Bush to be the key individual with respect to elementary and \nsecondary education. Through her academic research, she has concluded \nthat access to high-quality library material--books and other \nmaterials--is critical to literacy. I think that is a compelling \nargument that my initiative today will complement the President's \napproach to literacy training through our schools in this country.\n  As I said, if you go through the school libraries of America today, \nthe books are terribly out of date. I could rattle off another litany \nof arcane books that are inaccurate, politically incorrect, \nstereotypical, out of date, that talk about the fact that someday we \nmight land on the Moon. But I believe most people at this point \nunderstand that because you have been in your communities; you have \nlooked at your schools; you have been in schools where the library is \nan old closet or it is at the end of a hallway that is not being used. \nYou have been in schools where you can take books off the shelves and \nthe copyright is 1967. In fact, some of them are still stamped: \n``Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965,'' indicating from \nwhere they originally came.\n  So we can do better. We have to particularly do better when it comes \nto disadvantaged students because we know this is one of the particular \nburdens urban school systems and poorer rural school systems bear. That \nis where the resources do not filter down into the library.\n  If what we are asking and demanding is that these young, low-income, \ndisadvantaged children do well on tests, then we have to give them the \ntools to do that job--not just training in literacy but give them the \nbooks that will allow them to practice what they have been taught and \nopen up worlds of excitement and information and knowledge to them. \nThat is what I hope my bill can do.\n  We are going to, I hope and believe, train these teachers because of \nthe President's initiative. But without the books to complement that \ntraining, I do not know if in fact we are going to make the progress we \nneed to make.\n  We also understand this is a burden that is increasingly more \ndifficult for local communities to bear. The price of an average school \nlibrary book today is about $16. Yet it has been estimated that across \nthe country the average amount of money expended per pupil on library \nmaterial is $6.75 in elementary schools, $7.30 in middle schools, and \n$6.25 in high schools. And that is an average. I think you can \nunderstand there are some wealthy communities that are spending more, \nbut there are a lot of very poor communities. So we can help. It is \nimportant, I believe, to help.\n  We want to go ahead and ensure that our children have excellent \ninstruction in literacy but also excellent access to books so that they \ncan in fact be literate, not just during the schoolday but throughout \nthe day, not just as students but we hope as lifelong learners. My \namendment will, I hope, do that.\n\n  It would provide $500 million in funding support for school \nlibraries. It would not take away any resources from the President's \nReading First Initiative. It also would target the funding to the \npoorest schools because we know that is the greatest need. We know that \nis where the library budget is usually close to zero. We know there we \ncan make a difference--and we should make a difference.\n  It would provide great flexibility to these schools. There would be \nno standardized issue of books from Washington or elsewhere. It would \nallow local communities to make decisions about what they purchase. It \nwould allow them to use these resources to train library specialists. \nAnd it would also establish, we hope, or inspire resource-sharing \ninitiatives as exist in Ohio and Rhode Island, so that school libraries \ncould be linked to academic libraries and to public libraries, to \nbroaden the reach of the library program in each school.\n  It would also allocate funding on a formula basis to school \ndistricts, so that all needy districts and schools get the assistance \nthey need to improve their libraries.\n  I believe it is very important to adopt this amendment in the context \nof this reauthorization. This bipartisan amendment is cosponsored by \nSenators Snowe, Kennedy, Chafee, Bingaman, Wellstone, Murray, Clinton, \nSarbanes, Johnson, Baucus, Levin, Reid of Nevada, Rockefeller, Durbin, \nDayton, and Schumer. It is supported by the American Library \nAssociation, the Association of American Publishers, and a wide array \nof educational organizations. It is a bipartisan amendment.\n  Let me again, for the record, reiterate several points.\n  My proposal does not create a separate standalone program. It \nincorporates school library acquisition funding as a component of the \nReading First Program. This approach is as old as the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act reauthorization. In 1965, when we first \ncommitted ourselves at the national level to help elementary and \nsecondary schools, an important part of that commitment was helping \nschool libraries directly to acquire books and library material.\n  I know there is a desire to consolidate many programs, but we have \nseen, at least in the case of the library program, where this \nconsolidation has led to a diminution of resources for school \nlibraries. If we are serious about literacy, we have to enhance the \nresources for school libraries.\n  So I urge that this amendment be adopted. I urge that we get on with \nthe great task before us of ensuring that every child has access to \nexcellent instruction in reading and also excellent books to read.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I believe I have time allotted as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is affirmative.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Jeffords pertaining to the introduction of S. 897 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator from Rhode Island will be \ngood enough to yield 5 minutes, I would like to rise to express my \ngreat appreciation to my good friend from Rhode Island for pursuing \nthis issue regarding quality libraries in our schools across this \ncountry.\n  Among many other education issues, the Senator from Rhode Island has \ndevoted an enormous amount of time, attention, efforts, and energy, to \nthe issue of school libraries. Today, he has put before the Senate an \nextremely thoughtful amendment and one that is extraordinarily \ncompelling. He has thought a great deal about the state of libraries in \nthe nation's schools, and has consulted with many who have\n\n[[Page S4981]]\n\nworked on this issue throughout the course of their lives.\n  I was disappointed that, at the time of our markup of this \nlegislation, we were unable to embrace Senator Reed's proposal. \nHistorically, we have made a major national commitment to reading. We \nhave supported outstanding programs that promote literacy in young \nchildren, such as the Reading Is Fundamental Program, and the Everyone \nWins Program, which was shepherded by the chairman of our committee, \nSenator Jeffords. Our efforts to promote and increase literacy have \ntargeted all ages, from early literacy programs to those that serve \nadults later in life.\n  President Bush has also placed a tremendous emphasis on the \nimportance of reading. He has furthered our commitment made last year \nin the Reading Excellence Act, through his Reading First and Early \nReading First proposals in ESEA.\n  However, the idea of launching a major national literacy program \nwithout a commitment to the nation's libraries defies rational thought. \nWe all understand the importance of reading, and we all recognize that \nschools--especially low-performing schools--which devote greater \nattention to reading early in the school day, for 60 or 90 minutes, \nwill have greater success in ensuring that all students are strong \nreaders. Prince George's County in Maryland has increased their results \non statewide assessments of student performance, and reading was a key \nelement of that increase. If we plan to make a commitment in terms of \nreading as a matter of national purpose, that commitment must be \naccompanied by a commitment to the libraries in our children's schools.\n  The idea that we do not have an effective, comprehensive library \nprogram is just missing the most basic, fundamental recognition of the \nrelationship between a reading program and libraries. It defies \nunderstanding and explanation.\n  The Senator has reminded us that we have failed in the past to devote \nthe proper attention to libraries and their impact on literacy. The \nSenator from Rhode Island now offers an amendment which is a \nresponsible one, as well as one that I am very hopeful will be \naccepted.\n  I would like to take the opportunity to mention some comments from \ngroups that have lent their support to this amendment. The Association \nof American Publishers states:\n\n       It is a national disgrace that we live in the most \n     technologically advanced nation in the world, yet our K-12 \n     school libraries are packed with outdated books and \n     materials. For our children to succeed in today's digital \n     world, they first must learn to read and read well, and \n     therefore need access to school libraries containing up-to-\n     date information.\n\n  The American Library Association asserts:\n\n       Many of the nation's school libraries have collections that \n     are old, inaccurate, and out of date. How can we encourage \n     children to read, continue their education in college and \n     become life-long learners if the material we have available \n     for them is inadequate?\n\n  We must give adequate attention to reading. Any that fail to support \nthis amendment really fail to appreciate the relationship between \nliteracy and libraries. This amendment is a very responsible one that \nmakes a great deal of sense. I commend the Senator from Rhode Island \nfor bringing this amendment forward. We have all been dilatory in \nunderstanding this very important and major hole in our educational \nsystem. The good Senator is going to help us to address it with his \namendment. I am very hopeful that it will have overwhelming support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy for those insightful \nwords and also for his leadership on this legislation. He, along with \nChairman Jeffords, has been battling and moving along to try to bring, \nultimately, a bill that will improve education in the United States.\n  I believe, as evidenced by this amendment, that one very pragmatic, \npractical way to do this is to help local communities acquire library \nmaterials for their schools. In fact, I am always amazed that there is \nany controversy about this issue. It seems to me to be the most obvious \ncomplement to the President's program for literacy and also one of \nthose programs which doesn't raise issues of curriculum, doesn't raise \nissues of local control, doesn't raise issues of any seriousness.\n  Frankly, I hope that each of my colleagues will recognize that \nallowing local communities, local school systems to buy books is \nsomething we should be doing and not rejecting.\n  I hope that at 1:45, when the roll is called, we will have the \nstrongest possible support. This is a bipartisan initiative, \ncosponsored, along with many Senators, by Senators Snowe and Chafee. I \nhope we can get a good, solid vote for school libraries when this roll \nis called.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED.

Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 476, as modified.\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I understand my colleague from Rhode Island \nhas requested 5 minutes. I intend to do this briefly. But I think it is \nvery important that we consider this issue. I believe the amendment can \nbe accepted on both sides to make sure that we deal properly with early \nchildhood education.\n  I have come to this Chamber many times to state that research has now \nverified what parents have known instinctively for generations, and \nteachers will tell us time after time that the first years of life are \nabsolutely crucial development periods for children. How well the \nparent handles that early time with the child will determine how well \nthat child performs in school later on. Infant brain development occurs \nvery rapidly. The sensations and experiences of this time go a long way \ntoward shaping the baby's mind in a way that has long-lasting effects \non all aspects of the child's life.\n  We have learned in Missouri from a program called Parents As Teachers \nthat we can assist parents and families to be better in playing this \nrole that is key to the child's development. Early positive interaction \nbetween parents and guardians plays a critical role.\n  A child's education and mental development begin very early in life. \nThrough this amendment, we seek to ensure the continued support of \nfamilies with the youngest children to find the early childhood parent \neducation programs that can help those families and parents provide \nsupportive, stimulating environments we know all children need.\n  We must focus on the earliest years before formal schooling. We know \nthat half of the child's mature intelligence develops in those first \ncritical 3 years.\n  This amendment provides no new money. All the amendment does is \nclarify that the early childhood and early childhood parent education \nis to be a key focus of title VI, Part A.\n\n  I have talked about the Parents As Teachers Program that really was \ndeveloped in Missouri. I managed to carry it statewide when I was \nGovernor. One of the great successes is that it now has over 150,000 \nfamilies in Missouri, with 200,000 children benefiting from it. If you \nwant to find out whether it is working, I just ask that you go and talk \nto the parents who have been in the program. They are the ones who can \ntell you it works. We have scientific assessments that show it works.\n  The PAT, the Parents As Teachers, is an early childhood-parent \neducation program that empowers all parents--regardless of income \nlevel, regardless of social condition--to give their children the best \npossible start in life.\n  We have programs now in all 50 States and in 6 foreign countries.\n  It provides information to parents on child development from birth to \nage 5. It has voluntary participation. It is tailored to meet the needs \nof each parent, and it is often included as part of Even Start and \nother title I programs. We have found it works very well with Head \nStart.\n  The PAT Program benefits the children, but it also helps the parents \ndevelop the confidence to take an active role in their children's \neducation.\n  Earlier this year, I received a report from the Missouri Department \nof Elementary and Secondary Education: The School Entry Assessment \nProject. The findings throughout are that the highest performing \nchildren in schools are the ones whose parents have participated in \nParents As Teachers. It further shows that special needs children who \nparticipate in Parents As Teachers in preschool, in addition to an \nearly childhood special education, are rated by teachers as being \nsimilar in preparation to the average child.\n  These findings sum it all up. Parents As Teachers works. It works for \nchildren raised in households of all income levels. It works for \nchildren who are home schooled. It works for children with special \nneeds.\n  My amendment makes certain that priority is given to these programs, \nsuch as Parents As Teachers, HIPPY, and others. For any of my \ncolleagues who would like a fuller description of it, I happen to have \na few pamphlets available. You can contact my office, and I will \nprovide you with that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a 2-page summary of the \nevaluation of Parents As Teachers be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Evaluations of Parents as Teachers\n\n\n                             a partial list\n\n       In 1985, an independent evaluation of the Parents as \n     Teachers (PAT) pilot project was conducted. Evaluators \n     randomly selected 75 project families from a group of 380 \n     first-time parents representing Missouri's urban, rural and \n     suburban communities, and, from the same communities, 75 \n     comparison families who had not received PAT services. \n     Posttest assessments of children's abilities and parents' \n     knowledge and perceptions showed that PAT children at age \n     three were significantly more advanced in language, problem-\n     solving and other intellectual abilities, and social \n     development than comparison children. PAT parents were more \n     knowledgeable about child rearing practices and child \n     development.\n       (Pfannenstiel, J., and Seltzer, D. Evaluation report: New \n     Parents as Teachers project. Overland Park, KS: Research & \n     Training Associates, 1985.)\n\n       A follow-up study of the pilot project showed PAT children \n     scored significantly higher on standardized measures of \n     reading and math at the end of first grade than did \n     comparison children. In all behavorial areas assessed by \n     their teachers, the PAT participant children received higher \n     ratings than the comparison group children. A significantly \n     higher proportion of PAT parents initiated contacts with \n     teachers and took an active role in their child's schooling.\n       (Pfannenstiel, J. New Parents as Teachers project follow-up \n     study. Overland Park, KS: Research & Training Associates, \n     1989.)\n\n       Results of the 1991 Second Wave evaluation of the PAT \n     program's impact on 400 randomly selected families enrolled \n     in 37 diverse school districts across Missouri indicated both \n     children and parents benefited. At age three, PAT children \n     performed significantly higher than national norms on \n     measures of language and intellectual abilities, despite the \n     fact that the Second Wave sample was over-represented on all \n     traditional characteristics of risk. More than one-half of \n     the children with observed developmental delays overcame them \n     by age three. Parent knowledge of child development and \n     parenting practices significantly increased for all types of \n     families. There were only two documented cases of abuse and \n     neglect among the 400 families over a three-year period.\n       (Pfannenstiel, J., and Lambson, T., and Yarnell, V. Second \n     wave study of the parents as teachers program. Overland Park, \n     KS: Research & Training Associates, 1991.)\n\n       A follow-up study of the Second Wave sample was initiated \n     in 1993 to assess the longer-term impacts of program \n     participation. This study focused on the early school \n     experiences and peformance of the PAT children, and their \n     parents' involvement in their children's school and in \n     activities to support learning in the home. PAT children \n     scored high on measures of complex and challenging tasks. \n     Overall, the relative level of achievement children \n     demonstrated at age three on completion of the PAT program \n     was maintained in the first (or in some cases second) grade. \n     This held true despite broad diversity in children's \n     experiences with preschool, child care, kindergarten and \n     primary grades. PAT parents demonstrated high levels of \n     school involvement, which they frequently initiated.\n       (Pfannenstiel, J. Follow-up to the second wave study of the \n     Parents as Teachers program. Overland Park, KS: Research & \n     Training Associates, 1995.)\n\n       A series of studies of PAT program participation and school \n     readiness has been carried out in the Binghamton, New York \n     School District. Children enrolled in kindergarten in \n     Binghamton in 1992 were tested in pre-kindergarten and again \n     in kindergarten. PAT children had significantly higher \n     cognitive, language, motor, and social skills than non-\n     participants. These advanced skills led to higher grades in \n     kindergarten and lower remedial and special education costs \n     in first grade. PAT families also had substantially reduced \n     welfare dependence and half the number of suspected child \n     abuse and neglect cases compared to comparison groups. When \n     assessed again in second grade, PAT children continued to \n     perform better on standardized tests and required fewer \n     remedial and special education placements.\n       (Drazen, S., and Haust, M.

Binghamton, NY: \n     community Resource Center, 1996.)\n\n       A study demonstrating the effectiveness of PAT was \n     conducted by the Parkway School District, a large suburban \n     district in St. Louis County. Third graders who had received \n     PAT with screening services from birth to age three scored \n     significantly higher on standardized measures of achievement \n     than non-participating counterparts. PAT children had a \n     national percentile rank of 81, while non-participating \n     students had a rank of 63 on the Stanford Achievement Test, \n     with a significant difference in scores on all subtests. The \n     study also reported PAT graduates were less likely to receive \n     remedial\n\n[[Page S4983]]\n\n     reading assistance or to be held back a grade in school. PAT \n     ``graduates'' continued to significantly outperform non-PAT \n     children on the Standard Achievement test in fourth grade.\n       (Coates, D. Early childhood evaluation. Missouri: A report \n     to the Parkway Board of Education, 1994. Coates, D. Memo on \n     one-year update on Stanford scores of students--early \n     childhood evaluation study group. St. Louis County, MO: \n     Parkway School District, Dec. 26, 1996.)\n\n       Researchers in North Carolina have followed 97 families who \n     were involved in the Rutherford County PAT program beginning \n     in 1991. The PAT children were compared to 61 children whose \n     families did not receive PAT services, and another 61 whose \n     families received a quarterly educational newsletter from \n     PAT, but no direct services. Children were assessed upon \n     entry into kindergarten. the PAT children outperformed \n     children from both comparison groups on measures of \n     cognitive, language, motor, and self-help skills, with \n     significant differences on the language and self-help \n     measures. Also, PAT parents talked to their children \n     significantly more often about their daily activities.\n       (Coleman, M., Rowland, B., and Hutchins, B. Parents as \n     Teachers: policy implications for early school intervention. \n     Paper presented at the 1997 annual meeting of the National \n     Council on Family Relations, Crystal City, VA: November 9, \n     1997; Parents as Teachers: Kindergarten screening final \n     report. Rutherford County, VA: Rutherford County Schools, \n     May, 1998.)\n\n       A 1999 study of kindergarten readiness involved 3,500 \n     kindergartners from randomly selected districts and schools \n     across Missouri. Results showed that children who \n     participated in PAT had significantly higher readiness scores \n     than children who did not, as rated by both kindergarten \n     teachers trained in the evaluation process and by parents. \n     The study also showed that PAT in combination with other \n     kinds of preschool experiences (home child care, center-based \n     child care, preschool, Head Start) resulted in higher \n     kindergarten readiness scores for children.\n       (Pfannenstiel, J. and Barr, S. School entry assessment; the \n     power of PAT participation. Paper presented at the Parents as \n     Teachers Annual International Conference. St. Louis, Mo. June \n     1999.)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, studies and reports have shown that PAT \nchildren at age 3 are found to be significantly more advanced than \ncomparison children in language, problem solving, and social \ndevelopment. Often, through participation in PAT, learning problems or \ndevelopment delays are identified and treated early.\n  PAT parents are more confident in their parenting abilities and \nknowledge. The great thing is, PAT hooks parents early on which means \nthat they are more likely to stay involved in their children's \nschooling.\n  We all know that we can have all the programs in the world and can \nprovide all the funding possible, but one of the main ingredients to a \nchild's success in school is the involvement of the child's parents in \nthe child's education.\n  As I said, earlier this year I received a copy of a report from the \nMissouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. The report \nwas the ``School Entry Assessment Project''. The summary of findings \nreinforced my interest, support, and commitment to PAT. The findings of \nthe report are as follows:\n\n       1. When Parents as Teachers is combined with any other pre-\n     kindergarten experience for high-poverty children, the \n     children score above average on all scales when they enter \n     kindergarten.\n       2. The highest performing children participate in PAT and \n     preschool or center care. Among children who participate in \n     PAT and attend preschool, both minority and non-minority \n     children score above average. Children in both high-poverty \n     and low-poverty schools who participate in PAT and attend \n     preschool score above average when they enter kindergarten.\n       3. Among children whose care and education are sole home-\n     based, those whose families participate in PAT score \n     significantly higher.\n       4. Special needs children who participate in PAT and \n     preschool in addition to an early childhood special education \n     program are rated by teachers as being similar in preparation \n     to the average child.\n       5. Head Start children who also participate in PAT and \n     another preschool score at average or above when they enter \n     kindergarten.\n\n  This findings sum it all up. PAT works. PAT works for children raised \nin household of all income levels. PAT works for children who are home-\nschooled. PAT works for our special needs children.\n  My amendment makes certain that priority is given to programs such as \nPAT and other early childhood parent education programs.\n  With that, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 425, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes of debate remaining under \nthe control of the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I will reiterate the importance of this \namendment and summarize it. But I also understand that the Senator from \nMaine is here, and I am delighted and honored to yield 1 minute to her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Rhode Island \nfor his work on this issue. He has been a long-time, strong advocate \nfor improving libraries in our Nation's schools. I was pleased to work \nwith him in refining parts of this amendment to make sure that it did \nnot take funds away from the important reading programs.\n  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his efforts and pledge my \nsupport for the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from Maine not only for her gracious \nstatement and her support but also for her leadership on the Reading \nFirst Literacy Program, the President's program. As we all know, last \nweek unanimously we adopted her amendment which focused and refined the \nPresident's proposal. I believe, as Senator Collins believes, that a \ncomplement to that program is the program that I am supporting today, \nwhich would allow local communities to acquire library materials for \ntheir school libraries. I thank her very much for her cooperation, her \nleadership, and her collaboration on this effort.\n  Mr. President, let me just emphasize what my amendment, as modified--\nworking closely with Senator Collins--would do.\n  It is designed to complement the President's approach to literacy, to \nimprove reading so that those improvements in reading can be translated \nto better academic performance and better performance throughout a \nperson's entire life.\n  It gives flexibility to the States. It authorizes $500 million. It is \na targeted program going to the poorest schools because that is where \nthe greatest need is. It allows local communities the flexibility to \ndecide what library materials they need for their school libraries.\n  It is a bipartisan effort. I am so delighted to have been joined at \nthis point by Senator Collins, along with Senator Snowe and Senator \nChafee, and many colleagues.\n  It is an amendment that is supported by the American Library \nAssociation and the Association of American Publishers.\n  It is important to note, as was suggested by my colleague, Senator \nCollins, what the amendment does not do. It does not preempt or distort \nthe President's program, the Reading First Initiative. It is not a new \nprogram or a separate program. It is part of America First, and is as \nold as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  In 1965, the first time this Congress spoke out decisively to help \nlocal schools, a large part of that was direct funding for school \nlibraries. In fact, those books, in some cases, are still on the \nshelves today.\n  Interestingly, the President has appointed Dr. Susan Neuman as his \nnominee to be Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary \nEducation. Her research shows that books are important. In fact, she \npublished an article in ``Reading Research Quarterly,'' the title of \nwhich is, ``Books Make A Difference: A Study of Access to Literacy.'' \nMy amendment could properly be subtitled: ``Books Make A Difference.''\n  We have a strong program for reading instruction, for literacy, \nchampioned by Senator Collins, but books make a difference. We can make \nthat difference by supporting the Reed amendment.\n  Again, the President has entrusted Dr. Neuman with the implementation \nof this literacy program. I hope that she would echo today my comments \nhere and say: Once again, books do make a difference.\n\n[[Page S4984]]\n\n  I hope that when the roll is called in just a few moments we will \nhave strong bipartisan support for this amendment which will allow \nlocal communities to acquire the materials they need so their \nchildren--every child in this country--can succeed.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve whatever time \nI have.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  All time having expired, under the previous order, the pending \namendment is laid aside, and the question occurs on agreeing to Reed \namendment No. 425, as modified.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague for permitting me to \ngo before him.\n  I ask that my amendment, which is at the desk, amendment No. 524, \nwhich is cosponsored by my friend from New Jersey, Senator Corzine, be \ncalled up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka], for himself and Mr. \n     Corzine, proposes an amendment numbered 524 to amendment No. \n     358.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is located in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, this amendment is similar to the economic \neducation legislation which I introduced during the 106th Congress. \nThat legislation received considerable bipartisan support from my \ncolleagues, Senators Bayh, Breaux, Cleland, Cochran, Collins, Crapo, \nDaschle, Dodd, Durbin, Enzi, Hagel, Johnson, Bob Kerrey, John Kerry, \nLandrieu, Lincoln, Lugar, Moynihan, Snowe, and Wellstone.\n  With each passing day, the need for increased economic literacy \nbecomes more and more apparent. Our nation's economy is undergoing \nenormous changes. When I first introduced economic education \nlegislation, we were in the midst of unprecedented economic growth and \nthe longest peacetime economic expansion in our nation's history. More \nrecently, however, the stock market experienced serious volatility and \nthe NASDAQ suffered a sharp downturn. A number of employers, especially \nin the technology sector, have released a substantial number of their \nemployees. The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates five times this \nyear, the most recent cut occurring yesterday, in an effort to prevent \nour nation from sliding into an economic recession.\n  Economic changes such as these highlight the importance of economic \nand financial literacy. I am convinced that increased education about \nbasic economic principles such as money management, personal finance, \ninterest rates, and inflation will assist all Americans in making \ninformed decisions about their financial situations. Beginning this \neducation at a young age will better equip future generations to manage \ntheir financial affairs in our rapidly and constantly fluctuating \neconomy. It is critical that today's students learn that there are \nconsequences for every fiscal decision they make because the fiscal \nhabits they learn now are likely to be the habits that remain as \nadults.\n  We must also assist today's students in becoming productive and well-\ninformed citizens. Studies have shown that a lack of individual \nknowledge about fundamental economic principles can lead to negative \neffects on our national economy. Economic education, or the lack of it, \nhas profound long-term effects on us all. In an April 6, 2001, speech, \nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan concurred with this assessment. \nIn that speech, Chairman Greenspan articulated his belief that our \nnation's schools need to improve their ability to teach young people \nbasic financial education. He also stated that this financial education \nshould begin as early as possible.\n  I would like to share some of the results of a national test on basic \neconomic principles conducted by the National Council on Economic \nEducation in 1998 and 1999, which provide further evidence of the need \nfor increased economic education. These results are based on responses \nfrom 1010 adults and 1085 high school students. Both the students and \nadults alike lacked a basic understanding about the fundamental \nconcepts of money, inflation, and scarcity of resources. One-half of \nthe adults and two-thirds of the students tested did not know that the \nstock market brings people who want to buy stocks together with those \nwho want to sell them. Thirty-five percent of the students taking the \ntest admitted that they do not know what the effect of an increase in \ninterest rates would be. Only a little more than half of the adults and \nless than a quarter of the students tested knew that a budget deficit \noccurs when the Federal Government's expenditures exceed its revenues \nfor that year. Amid these disappointing results, the study found that \n96 percent of Americans believe that basic economics should be taught \nin high school. Yet, few States require students to take an economics \ncourse in order to graduate, or have adopted guidelines for teaching \neconomics in their schools, or, alarmingly, even require schools within \ntheir State to offer a course on economics to be made available.\n  This amendment aims to increase student knowledge of, and achievement\n\n[[Page S4985]]\n\nin, finance and economics by strengthening our nation's teachers' \nunderstanding of, and ability to teach economics. It provides resources \nto incorporate economics into K through 12 curricula. It encourages \neconomics-related research and development, dissemination of \ninstructional materials, and replication of best practices and \nprograms. And it also increases private and public support for economic \neducation partnerships between schools and local businesses. The need \nfor economic literacy should be no different from, or less important \nthan, reading literacy, writing aptitude, or math and science \ncomprehension.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Senator Corzine, for joining me in this \neffort to improve our nation's financial literacy. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support our amendment and ensure that our nation's youth \nare sufficiently prepared for their financial futures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think we are ready to accept the \namendment. We know of no other speakers. I hope we can at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 524) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Cleland] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 430 to amendment No. 358.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To add, for funding under the program of grants for State and \n local instructional activities for language minority students, other \n   activities that provide enhanced instructional opportunities and \n         related services for such students and their parents)\n\n       On page 480, line 12, strike the period at the end and \n     insert a semicolon and the following:\n       ``(6) other instructional services that are designed to \n     assist immigrant students to achieve in elementary and \n     secondary schools in the United States, such as literacy \n     programs, programs of introduction to the educational system, \n     and civics education; and\n       ``(7) activities, coordinated with community-based \n     organizations, institutions of higher education, private \n     sector entities, or other entities with expertise in working \n     with immigrants, to assist parents of immigrant students by \n     offering comprehensive community social services, such as \n     English as a second language courses, health care, job \n     training, child care, and transportation services.''.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, let me first say that there was a \nprinting error regarding amendment number 430 when it was printed in \nthe May 9th Congressional Record. The amendment was correctly printed \nin its entirety in the May 14th Record.\n  Mr. President, this amendment addresses the explosion of immigrants \ncoming to this country over the past decade. Information from the 2000 \nCensus shows that the impact from this wave of immigration is \ntransforming the nation. The Latino population, for example, is up 60 \npercent since 1990 and now, for the first time ever, it is roughly \nequal to the population of African Americans in the U.S. New York's \npopulation now tops 8 million, a record number which is a direct result \nof its rising numbers of Asians and Hispanics.\n  These changes are summed up in one astounding fact from the Census \nBureau: recently arrived immigrants and refugees will account for 75 \npercent of the U.S. population growth over the next 50 years. And let \nme add that these changing demographics are impacting not just \ncommunities accustomed to large immigrant populations like New York, \nLos Angeles and Miami, but also non-traditional immigrant communities \nin states like Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Georgia, Alabama, \nand the Carolinas.\n  Like our communities, our schools are feeling the impact of this new \nwave of immigration. A record number of children with diverse \nlinguistic and cultural backgrounds are enrolling in America's \nclassrooms. In Wayne County, MI, for example, 34 percent of the student \npopulation are Arabic-speaking and receive special help. The Waterloo, \nIA school system is being challenged to teach hundreds of Bosnian \nrefugee children, who came to America without knowing our language, \nculture or customs. In Dalton, GA, public school enrollment of Hispanic \nstudents is now 51 percent, up from just 4 percent ten years ago. This \nis an incredible increase--from just 4 percent a decade ago to over \nhalf of the student body population today.\n  This surge in immigration is increasingly challenging U.S. schools \nand communities from Florida to Washington State. We need to provide \nresources to these communities to help ensure that these children--and \ntheir families--are served appropriately. We know from national studies \nthat where quality educational programs are joined with community-based \nservices, immigrants have an increased opportunity to become an \nintegral part of their community and their children are better prepared \nto achieve success in school.\n  This amendment is based on legislation Senator Coverdell and I \nintroduced in the last Congress. It would provide support to schools \nand communities experiencing an influx of recently arrived immigrant \nfamilies. Specifically, it would expand the use of funds under the \nEmergency Immigrant Education set-aside to include activities which, \nNo. 1, provide enhanced instructional opportunities to assist \nculturally and linguistically diverse children achieve success in \nAmerica's schools; and which, No. 2, allow local educational agencies \nto partner with community-based organizations to provide the families \nof immigrant children access to comprehensive community services, \nincluding English as a second language courses, health care, child \ncare, job training and transportation. This amendment is endorsed by \nthe U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association for Bilingual \nEducation, the Hispanic Education Coalition, the League of United Latin \nAmerican Citizens, and the National Council of La Raza.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily lay the \namendment aside.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, I would like to just say \na quick word on that amendment. I think we are prepared actually to \naccept it if the Senator wants to press it. I would like to take just 1 \nminute on this amendment.\n  I thank the Senator for raising this issue.\n  Today there are approximately 800,000 migrant children in the nation. \nThey are all going to become citizens of our country. By and large, \nthey have placed an enormous burden on local communities.\n  Years ago, the Federal Government provided help and assistance to \nfamilies when they resettled in a local community for up to 18 months. \nThere were resources available to schools. All of that has been cut \nback. We are back to about 4 months now.\n  So basically, the Federal Government has abdicated its support for \nlocal communities. There are a number of people, for example, the \nCambodians, who came to this country and were settled by religious \ngroups in different parts of the country. We found--which was their \nchoice--there were major groupings of Cambodians in Lowell, MA.\n  We have a higher Cambodian population in Lowell, MA, than in Phnom \nPenh. They placed an enormous initial burden on the school community \nbecause of the destruction by Pol Pot of all of the information, all of \nthe books. They did not have any training. The burden fell on a blue-\ncollar community to try to respond to the kinds of challenges which, \nfor these children, were\n\n[[Page S4986]]\n\noverwhelming. But they did it. And they deserve great credit for it.\n  Now, if you look at the various schools up in Lowell, half of the \nvaledictorians from the high school will be the sons and daughters of \nthese extraordinary, resourceful people. I think the Senator has put \nhis finger on an important need.\n  Finally, last year, when we were considering the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, there was no additional assistance included in \nthat legislation for migrant, homeless, or immigrant students. There is \nadditional assistance in this legislation. I would not support this \nbill if it did not provide for these students because they number over \n1.5 million children. It would have been a great mistake not to \nincrease support for these students in this bill.\n  The Senator has recognized a very important need. He is presenting \nthis so there will be local options. Communities will be able to use \nthese resources.\n  I thank him for raising it. I am very hopeful we can accept the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I join in the accolades by the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and say that this amendment is an excellent \namendment. Even in little old Vermont, we have schools with 20, 22 \nstudents who have English as their second language. There have been \nproblems that we never imagined we would have. We believe this bill--\nall over this Nation--will be very helpful.\n  As far as I am concerned, we can accept the amendment to ensure its \npassage.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the distinguished Senator from Vermont and the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts and ask that my amendment be \nadopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 430.\n  The amendment (No. 430) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would now like to ask unanimous consent \nto call up amendment No. 449 for its immediate consideration and ask \nunanimous consent Senator Jack Reed be added as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Reserving the right to object, we have an order, I \nthink in place, an amendment by Senator Enzi. I believe that it would \nbe right to take that amendment up first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 649 To Amendment No. 358\n\n    (Purpose: To modify provisions relating to school construction)\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, under the previous agreement, I send an \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi] for himself, Ms. Snowe, \n     Mr. Hagel, and Mr. DeWine, proposes an amendment numbered 649 \n     to amendment No. 358.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is located in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted and Proposed.'')\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be on the floor today to \ndiscuss an amendment that deals with the area of school construction \nthat Senator Harkin has been talking about. I bring forward a proposal \nalong with Senator Snowe, Senator Hagel, and Senator DeWine. I would \nlike to take this opportunity to thank them for their hard work, as \nwell as the hard work of their staffs.\n  I know that we can all agree that there are schools across the Nation \nthat are in need of repairs and renovation. Just because we can agree \non the problem, however, does not mean that we can agree on a solution \nSenator Harkin's proposal to create a new Federal program to fund \nschool construction is a good example. While I understand that a need \nexists in many of our Nation's schools, I do not believe there is a \nFederal responsibility to address that need, especially if States and \nlocal school districts have not made every effort to address the issue \non their own. I also believe that it is extremely important that we do \nnot ignore pre-existing Federal school construction obligations in \nfavor of new school construction programs.\n  It is for these reasons that I have drafted this amendment, which \nwill target all Federal school construction funds toward existing \nobligations to fund the construction and renovation needs of schools on \nIndian reservations and schools impacted by Federal land holdings. This \namendment would also make construction and maintenance of high-poverty \nschools a priority and create a revolving loan fund that States could \nuse to help schools make interest payments on school construction \nbonds.\n  I would also like to emphasize the importance of appropriately \ntargeting limited resources where they are needed most. That is why my \namendment requires that any grant funds available after existing \nFederal obligations are met should be highly targeted to the schools \nmost in need. In addition to identifying the truly neediest schools, \nthe local districts and States must demonstrate that they are already \ndoing all they can to meet the needs of those schools.\n  I believe that a tier of schools does exist where traditional school \nconstruction financing is extremely difficult for a local community. \nThe capacity of the local tax base, particularly in rural communities, \nis not as flexible or far-reaching as urban or suburban districts. In \nhigh poverty districts, the bonding capacity may fall dramatically \nshort of the cost to renovate or construct a school. In those cases, \nthe States should be doing more. And, in providing direct Federal \nsupport for school construction, we should never extend that reach \nbeyond such schools.\n  Some of my colleagues have cited several studies that claim that our \nNation's school construction needs range from $112 billion--according \nto the Government Accounting Office--to $125 billion--according to the \nNational Center for Education Statistics. We all view these numbers as \na national disgrace, but for very different reasons. My colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle would suggest that these numbers indicate \nthat the Federal Government has failed to fulfill its duty to fund \nschool construction. I, on the other hand, believe that these numbers \nsuggest that State and local communities have abandoned their \nresponsibilities and allowed our schools to fall into disrepair.\n  As a former member of both houses of the Wyoming State Legislature, I \nunderstand that school construction has always been the responsibility \nof State and local governments. I also understand how hard some States, \nsuch as Wyoming, are working to make sure that they are fulfilling \ntheir responsibility to equitably distribute school construction funds.\n  I have been troubled to see some of the data that indicates that \nStates and local governments have the capacity to do more to fulfill \ntheir own construction needs. During the last session of Congress, \nmembers of the Congressional Research Service testified before the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, that I serve on, that \nbetween 1990 and 1998 State and local budget surpluses grew from $80.1 \nbillion $148.7 billion. A December 2000 press release from the National \nGovernors' Association revealed that States cut taxes and fees by $5.8 \nbillion in fiscal year 2001. This is the seventh consecutive year \nStates have reduced taxes and fees. That is from a National Governors' \nAssociation press release from December 12, 2000.\n\n  According to the American School & University's 24th Annual \nConstruction Study, school districts allocated 9.4 percent of their net \ncurrent expenditure for maintenance in 1997, a substantial drop from \nthe 12.75 percent allocated 10 years earlier. You can see from this \ndata that if the current level of expenditures on school construction \nby States and local governments are deemed to be inadequate it is not \nbecause of a lack of capacity to do more.\n  I also think it is important to inform my colleagues who try to \nassert that the Federal Government is doing nothing to deal with the \nissue of the declining quality of our Nation's schools that according \nto the Congressional Research Service the overall estimated\n\n[[Page S4987]]\n\ncost or revenue loss for the total of tax-exempt bonds--that is taxes \nthe Federal Government does not get--in 1999 was $25 billion. The most \nrecent data for bonds that specifically support school construction \ncomes from 1996, with an estimated cost/revenue loss at $3.7 billion. \nIn other words, albeit indirect, there is clearly currently Federal \nsupport of school construction through the tax exemption we provide on \nconstruction bonds.\n  In addition to having very strong reservations about introducing a \nnew Federal education responsibility in the face of calls to prioritize \nexisting Federal obligations, I am very concerned about creating \ninequities among States. As I have said, I firmly believe that funding \nschool construction is a State and local responsibility. To that end, \nthere are some States that are making tough decisions and dedicating \nthe resources needed to fulfil their obligation to children in public \nschools.\n  Wyoming is not alone in having experienced years of legislation and \nlitigation in an effort to ensure that all children are provided an \neducation in safe, appropriate classrooms. The State will soon dedicate \nsignificant new resources towards school construction. A lot of time \nand money has already been spent assessing every school in the State to \ndetermine which communities are the neediest. The State of Ohio has \nundertaken a similar effort.\n  For those States that are not as far along in prioritizing school \nconstruction, why should they get a better deal under a Federal grant \nprogram? The proponents of the Harkin amendment may argue that there is \na provision requiring the funds to be a supplement to existing \nresources. However, if a State is not already dedicating meaningful \nresources, and doesn't have a plan or initiative which calls for \nadditional resources, it looks to me like they would be eligible for \nfunds under this new program. That is simply not fair. If they are not \ndoing something, they get money. If they are, they do not. It is not an \nappropriate use of Federal tax dollars. And it forever lets the \nentities responsible for school construction off too easily. That bring \nme to my most important point. The neediest schools are not being \ntargeted enough by States. They will not be targeted sufficiently under \nthe proposal by the Senator from Iowa.\n\n  It is imperative that any additional Federal support we provide be \nstrictly linked to the highest need schools. There will never be enough \nmoney to address the estimated $127 billion in construction needs, even \nif we did all agree that Federal funds should be expended. In fact, in \n2000, almost $26 billion was spent on public K-12 construction, with \nnearly $27 billion in spending forecast for this year. A similar amount \nis also forecast to be spent each year through 2004.\n  All of this data is available through the National Clearinghouse for \nEducational Facilities, which Congress established after the General \nAccounting Office released a series of studies on school construction \nover the last few Congresses.\n  In addition to providing basic data on facilities financing, the \nclearinghouse is intended to serve as a resource for schools and public \nofficials on how to properly assess their construction needs, how to \ndevelop a model school construction proposal, and how to meet the \nunique needs of their community. We should not be embarking on a path \nthat either displaces this effort or discourages States and locales \nfrom meeting the school construction needs of their communities.\n  This is vitally important in rural communities. Those communities \nface hardships in meeting their construction needs as it is, but we \ncannot set them up with the false hope of erasing their need to pass \nbond initiatives or to pressure the State for more help. There are \nroughly 80,000 public schools in this country. Half are in rural areas \nor small towns.\n  As we consider the Enzi-Snowe-Hagel-DeWine amendment and the Harkin \namendment as a whole, I should like to remind my colleagues that we do \nnot serve any of our Nation's children by ignoring the commitments we \nhave already made while making new promises that we can't keep. We owe \nour children more than that, and I hope as we move forward with the \nlegislation we will keep that in mind.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, time \nwill be charged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Senator from \nWyoming, are we through with his presentation?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is my understanding that other Senators \nwill be down shortly to make a presentation--the Senator from Iowa and \nthe Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \ncharged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I listened as best I could to the \npresentation made by my friend from Wyoming on his amendment. Let's \nrecap a little bit.\n  As I said yesterday, we have been trying for some time to get money \nfor school construction and repair to help beleaguered schools around \nthe country. We did that last year in an agreement. I ask my friend \nfrom Wyoming if he knows this. But in last year's appropriations bill, \nthere was an agreement hammered out on a bipartisan basis and a \nbicameral basis. It was signed off on the House side. We worked with \nCongressman Goodling, Congressman Porter, Congressman Obey; on the \nSenate side, Senator Specter and I, Senator Jeffords, and Senator \nKennedy were all involved in the negotiations--and the White House.\n  We came up with a program that provided $1.2 billion this year that \nwould go out to States under broad guidelines to help them meet the \nneeds of their poorest school districts in terms of meeting fire and \nsafety code, renovation for technology, and 25 percent of the money was \nset aside to meet the needs of disabled students under IDEA.\n  I didn't know this until I just read the Enzi amendment, but the Enzi \namendment wipes out that $1.2 billion. This is a list of all the States \nthat are going to get this money 2 months from now of the $1.2 billion \nthat was appropriated for this year. The Enzi amendment is not \nprospective. It takes the $1.2 billion this year and reneges on what \nthe Senate, the House, and the White House signed off on last year.\n  That is eminently unfair. A lot of these school districts in the \nStates already know the amount of money that they have applied for and \nthat has been approved. The money hasn't gone out yet. It is going out \nthe first of July. But they have applied for it, and they know what \nthey are going to get. Now the Enzi amendment just wipes it out. You \ncan see how much money some of the States will lose.\n  The Enzi amendment will take a lot of this money and put it in the \nDepartment of Defense. I don't know if that makes any sense at all. \nThen there are all these hurdles that a State has to jump through \nbefore it can get any of the renovation money. I thought we Democrats \nwere the ones always being accused of tying the hands of the States and \ntelling them exactly what they had to do. Read the Enzi amendment. \nThere are more hoops and more barriers and more hurdles and more \npaperwork the States will have to confront than anything I have seen \noffered in the Senate in a long time.\n  For example, he says--just to illustrate how unfair the amendment \nwill be--that before a school can qualify, 50 percent of the enrollment \nwill have to come from families whose income does not exceed the \npoverty level. That is a public school. He says before a public school \nfacility can get any of this construction or renovation money, 50 \npercent of the enrollment will have to be\n\n[[Page S4988]]\n\nfrom families whose income does not exceed the poverty level.\n  I ask the Senator from Wyoming how is he going to determine that. \nThere is no way to determine that. I ask the Senator from Wyoming to \nplease tell us how he is going to determine if a public school has 50 \npercent of enrollment from families whose income is below the poverty \nlevel.\n  The only measure we have right now is from a school district and \nschools based upon free and reduced-priced lunches. That is based on \n185 percent of poverty. It is based on school districts. I ask the \nSenator from Wyoming, how is a public school in your State, my State, \nMinnesota, Vermont, or any other State, going to show that 50 percent \nof its enrollment is from families whose income does not exceed the \npoverty level? As you say, ``as determined by annual census data \npublished by the Department of Labor.'' The Department of Labor does \nnot publish census data by schools.\n  So this is a very poorly drafted amendment. I don't know what the \nauthor was trying to get at. I say to my friend from Wyoming that you \ncannot in any way determine how you are going to have 50-percent \npoverty from a school.\n  That is the first hurdle that is impossible. Think of the paperwork. \nThink of what a school would have to go through to find out whether or \nnot 50 percent of its enrollment are kids from families who do not \nexceed the poverty level.\n  First of all, I think that would be impossible. Secondly--and here is \nsomething that is unfair--Mr. Enzi says the other hoop is that the \nschool has to be located in a district in which the district's bonded \nindebtedness basically has reached or exceeded 90 percent of the debt \nlimitation imposed upon school districts pursuant to State law.\n  Well, what about a school district in a rural State in which there \nare a lot of elderly people who may not be able to bear the burden of \nproperty taxes, or they have property tax exemptions because of their \nage, and let's say they have 30 percent of their kids getting free and \nreduced-priced school lunches but their bonded indebtedness is only 15 \npercent. You are going to go out to that district with a heavily \nweighted population that is elderly, maybe rural, and you are going to \nsay you have to raise your property taxes before you can qualify?\n  How unfair is that, I ask you. Again, what kind of paperwork, what \nkind of State requirements are going to have to be set up to do that?\n  So, again, I don't know what the Senator is trying to get at, but if \nhe is trying to target it, it is not doing it. There is no way this can \nbe done. The paperwork and the burden on the States in accounting for \nall this would be incredible.\n  Again, he also says the Federal share of the cost of any project \nshall not exceed 50 percent. Well, again, why don't you leave that up \nto the States? In my amendment, I didn't tie the hands of the States \nand say here is exactly what you have to do. The Enzi amendment \nbasically says: State, here is A, B, C, D--exactly what you have to \ndo--and you can't do anything else. There may be some projects of an \nemergency nature. We have had them in Iowa, such as meeting fire and \nsafety codes--things that may need to be done right away. Maybe they \ncan't come up with a 50-percent match right away. But the Enzi \namendment says, tough luck; you don't get any help.\n  I understand there is a revolving loan fund also set up--a loan \nauthority for loans to be made. Again, there are all kinds of hoops and \npaperwork requirements and findings that a State would have to face. \nThe more I look at this amendment, the more I don't want to hear any \nmore arguments from that side of the aisle about how Democrats are \ntrying to tie the hands of States by specifying exactly what has to be \ndone. If you want to learn about specifications, read the Enzi \namendment.\n  It is in here that for revolving loans it says--listen to this: With \nrespect to a fiscal year, any State, to receive assistance on the \nrevolving fund loan in this part of the bill, has to have four-tenths \nof a percent--in other words, they have to have less than four-tenths \nof a percent of the total amount available in the United States for all \ntitle I.\n\n  So for a State to qualify for this revolving loan fund, that State \nhas to get less than four-tenths of a percent of the entire amount in \nthe United States. So I ask, why was it four-tenths? Why wasn't it \nfive-tenths? Why wasn't it three-tenths? Why wasn't it 5.5? Why was \nfour-tenths a magic number? I would like to know the answer to that \nquestion. I don't know why.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have only had this amendment for a brief period of \ntime. However, in reviewing this amendment, I have noticed that on page \n13 it refers to the set-aside of Federal funds. This is the only \nreference in the amendment to the authorization of funds. If the \nSenator has a copy----\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't seem to have page 13 for some reason.\n  I have it now.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It says ``set-aside of Federal funds.''\n  It reads:\n\n       In General--Notwithstanding any other provisions of law. . \n     .there shall be made available to carry out this section for \n     each fiscal year, an amount equal to 20 percent of the total \n     amount of Federal funds appropriated for such fiscal year for \n     Federal programs to provide assistance for school \n     construction, renovation, or repair.\n\n  The Harkin amendment, of course, expires this year. As such, the only \nfunds that I am aware of will be the DOD and the BIA funds and impact \naid.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Impact aid, yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. For school construction. We are talking about an amount \nthat is less than $100 million. And here we have a proposal to \nauthorize 20 percent of that amount. That totals approximately $20 \nmillion. Do we understand that? I respect my colleague from Wyoming, \nand he knows he is my friend, but it is a hoax to suggest that this is \na program to help local schools. We are only talking about $20 million; \n$10 million for grants, and $10 million for loans. This is the amount \nthat would be available under the restrictions that the Senator from \nWyoming has outlined. We are calling this a construction program.\n  I ask my colleague and friend, does he believe that when Senators \nvote for the Enzi amendment, they will be able to claim that their vote \nis a vote for school construction? They will have voted against the \nHarkin amendment that helps local communities in the neediest areas of \nthe nation, both rural and urban, repair and renovate crumbling \nschools. Instead, they will say, ``oh, no, we prefer the Enzi amendment \nthat provides $20 million--$10 million in grants, and $10 million in \nloans.''\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa whether he reads this amendment the same \nway?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is correct. In fact, I will add one thing to \nthat. What the Enzi amendment does this year is it takes away the $1.2 \nbillion going out to States. That has already been appropriated. He \nwipes that out. Then on the revolving loan fund the Senator talked \nabout, he says ``shall be made available to carry out this section for \neach fiscal year amounting to 20 percent of the total amount of the \nFederal budget.''\n  What all that means is that after this year we impact the money for \nimpact aid and Indian schools. They are going to take 20 percent of \nthat money and put it in the revolving loan fund. So here the Senator \nfrom Wyoming purports in his amendment that he wants to help Indian \nschools and he wants to help impact aid, but in the second part of the \namendment he takes money out of those programs to put it into a \nrevolving loan fund.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I don't know whether the Senator from Wyoming can tell \nus whether we have interpreted the amendment correctly. I invite him to \ncorrect us if we are incorrect. As I understand it, this amendment \nwould equal only 20 percent of the total amount of funds that will be \nappropriated for such fiscal year. We anticipate that next year, \noutside of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, impact aid and military \nschools, that such an amount is less than a million dollars. And this \namendment proposes 20 percent of that amount for school construction. \nAm I correct, I inquire of the Senator?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, answering on their time, of course, as I \nhave said throughout this whole process on the authorization bill, this \nis an authorizing process, and we have an appropriations process that \ncomes up later. The amount of dollars allocated would\n\n[[Page S4989]]\n\nbe allocated as part of the appropriations process. There is money that \ncan be done on this.\n  We are getting into a brand new program. This isn't something that \nhas been a continuing program. We are getting into something new. Since \nit is new, I was hoping we would handle that through the appropriations \nprocess. Whatever money is allocated in the process, 20 percent would \ngo to that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I agree with the Senator that the appropriations process \nwill determine the amount we will have for resources. If it is not \nauthorizing, a point of order is made.\n\n  As I understand it, this amendment authorizes 20 percent of existing \nFederal funds. The only construction funds of which I am aware are \nfunds made available through BIA, impact aid, and defense. If we are \nreferring to 20 percent of those funds--that is what it says in here--\nequal to 20 percent, then 20 percent is the authorization level. That \namount equals $20 million. That is the authorization. I understand \nfurther that half of that goes to loans and grants.\n  I withhold further comment. I think this is a pale, pale substitute \nfor the Harkin amendment. At an appropriate time after the Senator from \nIowa makes a comment about it, I would like to have 4 or 5 minutes to \nadd my support for the Harkin amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. I still have the floor. I ask my \nfriend from Wyoming, I just heard the Senator say this is the \nauthorization process and he did not want to interfere with the \nappropriations process.\n  Again I ask the Senator, does not your amendment wipe out the \nappropriations we made last year? Does it not invade the appropriations \nprocess? We appropriated this money last year. If I am not mistaken, \nthe Senator's amendment wipes that out. The Senator just said this was \nauthorization, not appropriations, but if you read the amendment, it \nwipes out our appropriations.\n  Am I reading it wrong? I yield to the Senator for a response. It says \n``notwithstanding any other provision of law.'' I ask the Senator, does \nnot this invade the $1.2 billion we already appropriated? I will be \nglad to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, if I can use their time, under this bill, \nthe $1.2 billion that was appropriated last year would come under the \nformula for this, which would become the current school foundation \nconstruction program. So, yes, the $1.2 billion the Senator from Iowa \nis talking about would be included in this particular amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the forthrightness of my friend from \nWyoming. That is exactly what I have been saying. That is the way it is \nwritten. The $1.2 billion that will be going out to the States this \nsummer will not be going out.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is my understanding that school districts all across \nthis country that have relied on these funds, and have planned \naccordingly under the assumption that they would receive these funds, \nbut will now not receive such funds. Is the Senator from Wyoming saying \nthese funds will be snatched back from local communities all over the \nNation that have budgeted for it, that have received assurances of it? \nIs the Senator proposing to grab that money back to re-allocate its sum \nthrough a new formula?\n  Is the Senator prepared to tell every school district planning to \nreceive these funds in the next few weeks that their planning is for \nnought? Is that the purpose of the Senator's amendment? Because it \nseems that this would be the effect.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think Senator Harkin has the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to the Senator from Wyoming for a response. I \nwill be glad to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. The purpose of this amendment is to place some constraints \non Federal school construction so we are not opening up a brand new \nprogram that will fund any school that needs to be constructed or \nrenovated in this country without any requirements. That is why the \nprovision is included, for the 90-percent bonding capacity in a \ndistrict to make sure the local district is participating to the level \nit can.\n\n  My colleagues will find that there are school districts across this \ncountry that are already perhaps at 200-percent bonding. They are doing \na maximum effort. Ninety percent would be considered a maximum effort. \nIt requires a match by the State. The other amendment does not require \nany participation by the State. There is some wording in there about \nsupplanting some State funds, but it does not have any requirements.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to show there needs to be some \nconstraint on how fast the Federal Government gets into a school \nfunding program. We are not there yet. We are on our way there, and \nthere needs to be some local recognition that they need to have some \nparticipation and States need to be a part of it. We cannot wipe out \nthat obligation under a new program.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I thank the Senator for his forthrightness. His \nanswer is correct because that is what the Senator is doing.\n  I point out to the Senator that the American Society of Civil \nEngineers has said that we need about $121 billion just to repair and \nmodernize the schools we have right now. We will need $187 billion over \nthe next 10 years. This is a $1.6 billion authorization. We do not know \nhow much we can appropriate. We appropriated $1.2 billion last year. I \ndo not know how much we can appropriate this next year.\n  Certainly, we are not rushing headlong into repairing and modernizing \nschools at $1.2 billion. With the Senator's amendment, it is less than \na snail's pace. We might get there in about 200 years. We cannot wait \nthat long.\n  Let us be clear about the Enzi amendment. There are some fatal flaws \nthere. No. 1, the Enzi amendment takes away money already going out to \nthe States, make no mistake about it. If Senators want to vote to take \nmoney away from State school construction--I have the list right here. \nMy colleagues can look at it. This is what their States are going to \nreceive this year, and the Enzi amendment takes it away.\n  No. 2, the Senator is right; in my amendment, I do not handcuff the \nStates. He is right. I do not prescribe every jot and tittle of exactly \nwhat they have to do. I trust them. We gave broad outlines. We said put \nthis out under competitive grants to go to the lowest income, poorest \ndistricts that need the help the most. Then we reserve some funds for \nthe highest poverty districts. That is it. We trust the States to make \nthat decision.\n  We had $28 million in my State of Iowa. The State department of \neducation put it out for competitive grants. I have not heard one \ncomplaint, not one because the State believes it went through a very \nfair process and the neediest school districts got that money.\n  No. 3, the Enzi amendment shifts money from education to the \nDepartment of Defense. Why would we want to do that?\n  No. 4, the paperwork burden on local school districts, I submit, \nunder the Enzi amendment will be more than anything they have ever \nfilled out for title I or for anything else. How are you going to \ndetermine that 50 percent of your kids are below the poverty level? \nThere is no census data, and yet you have to do that before you \nqualify.\n  Next, it shifts the power from States and local governments to the \nFederal Government. I know the Senator does not intend to do that, but \nthat is what really happens in this amendment. If you read the \nrevolving loan fund part of the Senator's amendment, it takes money out \nof Indian schools in the future and puts it into the revolving fund. We \ndo not need to be taking any more money out of Indian schools.\n\n  I sum up by saying the Enzi amendment guts our commitment to school \nmodernization which we made last year. If my colleagues vote for it, \nthey are voting to strip education funds from their States. I will \nleave this list up during the vote and Senators can check how much \nmoney is going out to their States.\n  There are poor school districts in every one of these States that \nneed that money this year for fire and safety code violations. They \nneed it this year.\n\n[[Page S4990]]\n\n  If you do not trust the States, if you can say, well, if we give \nmoney to the States, they will give it to the richest school districts, \nI do not think that is going to happen. I tend to trust the State \ndepartments of education.\n  Under our guidelines, we say it has to go to the poorest schools and \nput out in competitive grants. Make no mistake about it; if any one of \nmy colleagues votes for the Enzi amendment, they are voting to strip \nthis money.\n  With those fatal flaws, and with the fact we made an agreement last \nyear--it was a bipartisan agreement; it was bicameral; it was hammered \nout with the White House; and we reached an agreement on how to do it \nand the money is going to be going out--I do not think we ought to stop \nthat money from going out. It is $1.2 billion. We are not rushing \nheadlong into something.\n  I bet my colleagues will see, when this money goes out to the States \nthis year, they are going to have a lot of support from their States, \nthanking you for helping fix up the poorest schools they have.\n  I hope the Enzi amendment is not approved because we made this \nagreement last year, and we ought to stick by it for this year.\n  In closing I want to share some comments from the officials with the \nKeokuk, IA, school district. This district has received two $100,000 \ngrants to remedy fire code violations.\n  The funds are being used to install fire alarms, replace doors with \nnew fire-rated doors and make other repairs at an elementary school and \nat the high school so they meet fire and safety codes. The renovations \nare planned for this summer and next year.\n  In a letter from Board President Dr. Wilson Davis, Jr., \nSuperintendent Jane Babcock and Business Manager Kate Baldwin wrote; \n``Completion of these building renovations will bring both of these \nstudent attendance centers into full compliance with all fire-safety \ncodes. The availability of these funds have made this district goal a \nreality.''\n  Without the modest Federal investment, students in these two schools \nwould continue to attend classes in buildings that do not meet State \nand local fire codes. Permitting such situations to continue is simply \nunacceptable.\n  The schools in Keokuk are safer today because of a modest Federal \ninvestment. Our amendment will make it possible to make many more \nschools across the country safer for our children. So if you want safe \nschools for our kids, if you want them to attend modern, well-equipped \nschools, if you want schools that meet fire and safety codes, you \nshould support this commonsense amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record letters of support.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Keokuk Community School District,\n\n                                       Keokuk, IA, April 10, 2001.\n     Senator Tom Harkin,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: The Koekuk Community School District \n     is very excited to be selected to receive a federal grant of \n     $100,000 for Fire (Life) Safety facility building \n     renovations. Responding to specific neds as outlined on our \n     annual building safety inspections, the district is focusing \n     the funds to provide necessary egress compliance in eight \n     classrooms and replacing interior and exterior doors with \n     new, fire-rated doors. The necessary building renovations \n     will be during the summer of 2001 at one of our elementary \n     sites and during 2002 at our high school site. Completion of \n     these building renovations will bring both of these student \n     attendance centers into full compliance with all fire-safety \n     codes. The availability of these funds have made this \n     district goal a reality.\n       This is the second year Keokuk Schools has received a \n     $100,000 Fire (Life) Safety grant. Funds awarded last year \n     were targeted at installing a new fire alarm system in our \n     high school building. The district began installation during \n     July 2000 and will have this project completed in June 2001.\n       The citizens of Keokuk are proud of our school. We \n     sincerely appreciate the efforts you have made to provide \n     additional funding to help meet the increasing costs of \n     maintaining school facilities. Thank you for working for the \n     students, parents, and citizens of Iowa.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Wilson Davis, Jr., MD.\n       President Board of Directors.\n     Jane Babcock,\n       Superintendent.\n     Kate Baldwin,\n       Business Manager.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2001.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Education \n     Association's (NEA) 2.6 million members, we urge your support \n     for an amendment to be offered this week by Senator Harkin \n     (D-IA) to the Better Education for Students and Teachers \n     (BEST) Act (S. 1) that would restore the critical school \n     repair program. Votes associated with this issue may be \n     included in the NEA Legislative Report Card for the 107th \n     Congress.\n       Too many of our nation's students attend schools in \n     crumbling and unsafe facilities. According to the American \n     Institute of Architects, one in every three public schools in \n     America needs major repair. The American Society of Civil \n     Engineers found school facilities to be in worse condition \n     than any other part of our nation's infrastructure.\n       The problem is particularly acute in some high-poverty \n     schools, where inadequate roofs, electrical systems, and \n     plumbing place students and school employees at risk. Yet, \n     many high-need schools and communities simply cannot meet the \n     costs of these urgent repairs absent federal assistance.\n       Last year, Congress agreed on a bipartisan basis to provide \n     grants for urgent repairs in high-need schools. In FY 2001, \n     this important program will help repair some 3,500 schools \n     across the country. The Harkin amendment would help ensure \n     every student a safe learning environment by continuing this \n     critical grant program.\n       We urge your support for the Harkin school repair program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Mary Elizabeth Teasley,\n     Director of Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Rebuild America's Schools\n\n\n                                                    Coalition,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: The Rebuild America's School Coalition \n     supports your amendment to S. 1, the Better Education for \n     Students and Teachers (BEST) Act, to restore the emergency \n     school repair program.\n       The need for school repairs exists in all communities \n     across the county. According to the American Society of Civil \n     Engineers recently released annual report card on America's \n     infrastructure, the condition of our nation's public schools \n     received the lowest rating.\n       Our coalition supported your bipartisan efforts in the last \n     Congress to establish a new program to help schools make \n     emergency school repairs. The emergency school repair program \n     will provide $1.3 billion to states and school districts \n     through competitive grants to make emergency school repairs \n     and to fund IDEA and technology renovations. Your amendment \n     will reauthorize this critically needed program for emergency \n     school repairs.\n       Rebuild America's Schools is fighting for these and other \n     programs in this Congress. Rebuild America's Schools is \n     working with Congresswoman Nancy Johnson (R-CT) and \n     Congressman Charles Rangel (D-NY) and other Members of \n     Congress to pass the ``America's Better Classrooms Act.'' \n     With a federal investment of $5 billion, this bill generates \n     $25 billion in bonds to help school districts finance \n     programs to build new schools and to modernize existing \n     schools.\n       Communities struggling to find the resources to provide our \n     nation's school children with safe and modern schools ask how \n     can Congress consider more than $1 trillion in tax cuts \n     without investing in safe school buildings.\n       Coalition members appreciate the leadership you have \n     provided for this critical issue. We urge your colleagues to \n     support your amendment for the school repair program.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Robert P. Canavan.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Council of the\n\n\n                                           Great City Schools,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: The Council of the Great City Schools, \n     a coalition representing over fifty of the largest urban \n     public school systems in the country, appreciates your work \n     to improve our nation's school infrastructure, and to \n     highlight school modernization as a Senate priority during \n     reauthorization of ESEA. We support authorization of the \n     School Renovation Program, and will work with you to ensure \n     that the Harkin School Renovation Amendment is included in S. \n     1, the Better Education for Students and Teachers (BEST) Act.\n       Last year, a bipartisan Congress agreed that the federal \n     government must not ignore the physical deterioration of our \n     nation's school buildings, and appropriated $1.2 billion for \n     emergency repair and renovation for FY 2001. The School \n     Renovation Program provides these funds to States to assist \n     school districts with infrastructure needs, and represented \n     the most significant federal assistance for school \n     construction in over a decade.\n       By authorizing a $1.6 billion School Renovation program in \n     ESEA, your amendment will help to reverse school \n     infrastructure deterioration in urban schools, where the \n     country's oldest buildings have long suffered from\n\n[[Page S4991]]\n\n     overcrowding, as well as scarce funds for maintenance and \n     repair. The School Renovation Program will also help \n     crumbling schools nationwide, which received a grade of ``D'' \n     from the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2001, citing \n     a 75% inadequacy level in facilities across the country.\n       The Council of the Great City Schools appreciates your work \n     to end the physical deterioration of our nation's schools. \n     Preserving the bipartisan School Renovation Program is a \n     decision that would help school districts continue to address \n     the emergency repairs and renovation needs of aging and \n     overcrowded schools. The Harkin Amendment assists districts \n     with the support they need to improve the learning \n     environment for all students, and has the full support of the \n     Council of the Great City Schools.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Michael D. Casserly,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Board of Education of the\n\n\n                                             City of New York,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 13, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of Chancellor Harold O. Levy \n     and the New York City Public Schools system, I write to thank \n     you for your commitment to improving our nation's school \n     infrastructure. The Chancellor is very supportive of your \n     current efforts to authorize the School Renovation Program as \n     part of S. 1, the Better Education for Students and Teachers \n     (BEST) Act.\n       As you know, the BEST Act repeals current Title XII of \n     ESEA, the School Facilities Infrastructure Improvements Act. \n     This step takes us backwards from last year's bipartisan \n     agreement that provided funds for the School Renovation \n     Program as part of PL 106-544, the Omnibus Consolidated \n     Appropriations Act of 2000. Thanks to your leadership, this \n     legislation provided approximately $1.2 billion to help \n     communities make emergency school repairs and renovations. \n     This urgently needed initiative will help local schools fix \n     leaky roofs, correct faulty plumbing, heating, and electrical \n     systems, and address other dangerous health and safety \n     concerns in our schools, such as the presence of lead paint \n     and asbestos in the classroom. It provided a solid framework \n     for targeting limited federal resources to those districts \n     most in need of assistance, as it reserves funds for high \n     need school districts based on concentrations of poverty, \n     fiscal capacity, safety, and condition of buildings. The \n     agreement also reflected a reasonable and fair balance \n     between competing priorities as it allows a portion of these \n     funds to be used by states and localities for special \n     education and technology upgrades related to school \n     renovation.\n       Most importantly, last year's budget agreement recognized \n     that New York City and other school systems around the nation \n     cannot do it alone. Even though the City recently adopted a \n     five-year, $7.1 billion capital plan for our schools--the \n     largest school construction plan in the City's history--it is \n     not sufficient to meet the needs of the system, which are \n     conservatively estimated at $15 billion. Clearly,the \n     infrastructure needs of public schools have outpaced the \n     ability of local governments to meet these demands by \n     themselves. The need for school repair and modernization \n     funds has reached critical proportions and necessitates \n     partnerships among local, state and federal governments.\n       ESEA reauthorization presents an excellent opportunity to \n     enhance current law in this area. Specifically, New York City \n     supports your amendment, authorizing $1.6 billion annually \n     for grants and loans to high poverty school districts for \n     emergency school repairs and renovations. It would also \n     provide funds to enhance special education services, and \n     upgrade technology infrastructure.\n       Thank you for your consideration of Chancellor Levy's views \n     on this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Kristor W. Cowan,\n\n                                                  Director, NYCBOE\n                                                Washington Office.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Harkin \namendment on school construction, renovation, and repair. I am \nconcerned by what I have heard from Senator Harkin as to his analysis \nof the----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator should be advised the Democratic \ntime has just expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we be given \nan additional 5 minutes to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is granted 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Chair. I thank my distinguished colleagues \nfrom Wyoming and Iowa.\n  I am concerned, as Senator Harkin has pointed out, that dollars that \nare already committed to construction projects, to State planning for \nschool repair and renovation, under the second-degree amendment, will \nbe diverted to other worthy causes. I happen to agree with the Senator \nfrom Wyoming that the dollars we need as the Federal Government to \nspend to upgrade, repair, and construct BIA schools and DOD schools and \nImpact Aid schools is an obligation we should step up to and fulfill. \nBut I do not think we should be robbing Peter to pay Paul, when we have \nso many schools that are in need of the kind of assistance that can be \nprovided with Senator Harkin's amendment.\n\n  What I hope is that as we debate the second-degree amendment, we look \nfor ways to deal with the very real problem that the Senator from \nWyoming has pointed out without upsetting and undermining the \ncommitments that have already been made. These are commitments for this \n$1.2 billion that my State of New York is counting on, that the cities \nin my State are counting on. As the chart that Senator Harkin has shown \npoints out clearly, we have plans for that money. About $105 million of \nit has been allocated to New York. We have a backlog of many hundreds \nof millions of dollars more of repair and renovation.\n  I hope that the Senator from Wyoming's amendment as currently written \nwill not pass, but that we take the good ideas the Senator from Wyoming \nhas brought to the floor with respect to the BIA schools and other \nschools that are particularly part of the Federal responsibility and \nlook for additional ways to provide the funds they need.\n  Let me also reiterate something I have said on this floor before, and \nthen I will yield for final comments to our Democratic leader on this \nissue, Senator Harkin. This bill does not remove State or local \nresponsibility for school construction, repair, and renovation. What it \ndoes is provide necessary funds where we as a nation have gotten so far \nbehind in providing decent facilities for our teachers and students. It \nis a partnership. I thought the whole idea behind this reauthorization \nwas that we were going to have a partnership. The Federal Government \nwas going to step in with the funds it provides and assist the States \nand localities in providing the best possible education for our \nchildren; that we were going to marry accountability and resources. I \ndo not think the $105 million currently in line to come to New York to \nhelp us with our backlog of construction, repair, and renovation is in \nany way an interference with State or local control over education. It \nis a recognition that we as a nation have fallen woefully behind.\n  I am reminded of how many of the schools that children in New York \nattend--some were built 100 years ago, many were built 50 or 60 years \nago. We have not invested in our children to provide the kind of \nresources they need.\n  I stood on the floor and told true stories about what happens in some \nof our schools. The Senator from Iowa may have heard me talk about a \nteacher standing in a classroom in Mechanicville, NY, who had a piece \nof concrete fall on her head. I showed pictures of classrooms that were \nso overcrowded there was literally no place for the children to sit.\n  We have schools where we have 100 different languages being spoken, \nwhere we are in hallways and bathrooms, where we have not a single \nsquare foot of space left and where the condition of what is there is \ndeteriorating.\n  This bill that Senator Harkin is promoting, to me, is the right kind \nof partnership. We are not interfering. We are not forcing any money on \nanybody. This is a voluntary program. It adds to, it does not take away \nfrom, the resources our States and localities are using. But it \nrecognizes the fact that States that have made a commitment to using \nthese dollars would, under Senator Enzi's amendment, lose money.\n  New York will lose at least $22 million off the top because 20 \npercent of the funds would first be diverted to smaller states, but in \nall likelihood New York would never see any of the $105 million already \nset aside for Emergency School Renovation and Repair. We have a million \nchildren in the New York City school district. We have the oldest \nschool buildings in America in Buffalo, NY. We want to do the best job \nwe can for our children, as every other State represented here does. \nAll we need is a little bit of help. I urge we vote for Senator \nHarkin's amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, first I would like to thank Senator Enzi \nfor\n\n[[Page S4992]]\n\noffering an amendment to S.1 concerning the existing obligations the \nFederal Government has to Bureau of Indian Affairs', DOD and Impact aid \nschool systems. Through numerous treaties, statutes, and court \ndecisions, the Federal Government has assumed a trust responsibility to \nprovide a quality education to Indian children.\n  This duty includes providing school facilities that have such basic \namenities as 4 walls, heat and healthy air to breathe. Adequate \nfacilities and such essential necessities are not being provided to \nmany Indian children attending Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA, funded \nschools.\n  Unlike communities that have a tax base to fund school construction, \nmilitary reservations and Indian reservations are dependent on Federal \nresources. Nearly 4,500 facilities serve the Bureau's education \nprogram, consisting of over 20 million square feet of space, including \ndormitories, employee housing, and other buildings providing education \nopportunities to more than 50,000 students. These facilities serve more \nthan 330 Federally recognized Indian tribes located in 23 States \nthrough Self-Determination contracts, compacts and education grants.\n  We are not dealing here with ``the unknown.'' The GAO and other \nentities have produced countless studies and surveys showing us that \nhalf of the school facilities in the inventory have exceeded their \nuseful lives of 30 years, and more than 20 percent are over 50 years \nold. Numerous deficiencies in the areas of health, safety, access for \ndisabled students, classroom size, ability to integrate computer and \ntelecommunications technology, and administrative space have been \nreported by the Bureau.\n  As a former teacher myself, I am appalled when I visit reservations \nand see first hand the many schools with leaking roofs, peeling paint, \novercrowded classrooms, and inadequate heating and cooling systems. The \nstudies have shown that such deficiencies have adverse effects on \nstudent learning. By not providing secure educational facilities, we \nare paralyzing these children and putting them at a disadvantage that \nthey may never overcome.\n  The Federal Government has responded to the problem in piecemeal \nfashion, often using temporary solutions instead of working on a \npermanent plan of action. For instance, in fiscal year 2001 President \nClinton's budget requested $2 million for ``portables'' or trailer \nclassrooms that have been used since 1993. To date, the BIA has \npurchased 472 portables and 20 percent of the BIA's total education \nbuildings are now portable classrooms. The request states these \ntrailers are needed due to overcrowding and unhealthy and unsafe \nbuildings. It states that portables are used to replace buildings or \nparts of buildings that have ``poor air quality'' that result in what \nthe BIA calls ``sick building syndrome.''\n  New funds for Indian school construction is one of the major focuses \nof the President Bush's fiscal year 2002 budget request with $292.5 \nmillion slated for such purposes. Of the overall education construction \nbudget, $127.8 million has been requested for the construction of six \nschools: Wingate Elementary, NM; Polacca Day School, AZ; Holbrook \nDormitory, AZ; Santa Fe Indian School, NM; Ojibwa Indian School, ND; \nand Paschal Sherman School, WA.\n  As of January 2001, the repair and rehabilitation, and renovation \nbacklog for Indian education facilities and quarters stood at $1.1 \nbillion and is even greater today.\n  I understand the underlying notion of the Harkin amendment, but I \nthink this body should affirm our existing obligations to this Nation's \nDOD, Indian, and Impact Aid schools before we undertake even greater \nobligations.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Enzi/Snowe \nschool construction amendment. I want to thank my colleague from \nWyoming, Senator Enzi for working with me to provide some much federal \nassistance to states to address serious school construction need. And I \nappreciate his interest in including a part of my bill, the ``Building, \nRenovating, Improving, and Constructing Kids' Schools, BRICKS, Act'' in \nthis amendment.\n  The amendment before us would provide funding for Impact Aid schools, \nprovide a direct grant to states to provide for the construction needs \nof their poorest schools and creates a revolving loan fund for school \nconstruction.\n  The condition of many of our Nation's existing public schools is \nabysmal even as the need for additional schools and classroom space \ngrows. Specifically, according to reports issued by the General \nAccounting Office, GAO, in 1995 and 1996, fully one-third of all public \nschools needing extensive repair or replacement.\n  As further evidence of this problem, an issue brief prepared by the \nNational Center for Education Statistics, NCES, in 1999 stated that the \naverage public school in America is 42 years old, with school buildings \nbeginning rapid deterioration after 40 years. In addition, the NCES \nbrief found that 29 percent of all public schools are in the ``oldest \ncondition,'' which means that they were built prior to 1970 and have \neither never been renovated or were renovated prior to 1980.\n  Not only are our nation's schools in need of repair and renovation, \nbut there is a growing demand for additional schools and classrooms due \nto an ongoing surge in student enrollment. Specifically, according to \nthe NCES, at least 2,400 new public schools will need to be built by \nthe year 2003 to accommodate our nation's burgeoning school rolls, \nwhich will grow from a record 52.7 million children today to 54.3 \nmillion by 2008.\n  Needless to say, the cost of addressing our nation's need for school \nrenovations and construction is enormous. In fact, according to the \nGeneral Accounting Office, GAO, it will cost $112 billion just to bring \nour nation's schools into good overall condition, and a recent report \nby the NEA identified $322 billion in unmet school modernization needs. \nNowhere is this cost better understood than in my home state of Maine, \nwhere a 1996 study by the Maine Department of Education and the State \nBoard of Education determined that the cost of addressing the state's \nschool building and construction needs stood at $637 million.\n  We simply cannot allow our Nation's schools to fall into utter \ndisrepair and obsolescence with children sitting in classrooms that \nhave leaky ceilings or rotting walls. We cannot ignore the need for new \nschools as the record number of children enrolled in K-12 schools \ncontinues to grow.\n  Accordingly, because the cost of repairing and building these \nfacilities may prove to be more than many state and local governments \ncan bear in a short period of time, I believe the Federal Government \ncan and should assist Maine and other State and local governments in \naddressing this growing national crisis.\n  Admittedly, not all members support strong Federal intervention in \nwhat has been historically a state and local responsibility. In fact, \nmany argue with merit that the best form of federal assistance for \nschool construction or other local educational needs would be for the \nfederal government to fulfill its commitment to fund 40 percent of the \ncost of special education. This long-standing commitment was made when \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education, IDEA, Act was signed into \nlaw more than 20 years ago, but the Federal Government has fallen \nwoefully short in upholding its end of the bargain, only recently \nincreasing its share above 10 percent.\n  Needless to say, I strongly agree with those who argue that the \nFederal Government's failure to fulfill this mandate represents nothing \nless than a raid on the pocketbook of every state and local government. \nThat is why I am a cosponsor of legislation introduced by Senators \nHagel and Jeffords to fully fund IDEA, and I support ongoing efforts to \nachieve the 40 percent federal commitment in the near future.\n  Yet, even as we work to fulfill this long-standing commitment and \nthereby free-up local resources to address local needs, I believe the \nFederal Government can and should provide some assistance to state and \nlocal governments in addressing their school construction needs without \ninfringing on local control.\n  And that is why our amendment is narrowly drawn. First, our \nlegislation will ensure that we meet the federal commitment to Impact \nAid schools, which provide education to communities serving our \nmilitary families and those where the Federal Government\n\n[[Page S4993]]\n\nowns a substantial share of the property, thereby depriving the \ncommunity of local revenue. The amendment also provides a direct grant \nto states to assist in building or rehabilitating the lowest income \nschools.\n  In addition, there is a provision based on my school construction \nbill, BRICKS, that would set aside 20 percent of the Federal money \nappropriated for school construction for a Federal revolving loan fund \nfor states that meet the Title I small State minimum allocation. These \n14 States, which receive a de minimus amount of money under the Title I \nprogram, would be eligible for funding that could be used to fund their \nstate revolving loan funds, pay interest owed on construction bonds and \nfor other state authorized school construction activities.\n  Of importance, these loan monies, which will be distributed on an \nannual basis using the Title I distribution formula, will become \navailable to each state at the request of a Governor. While the Federal \nloans can only be used to support bond issues that will supplement, and \nnot supplant, the amount of school construction that would have \noccurred in the absence of the loans.\n  And to encourage the Federal Government to meet its funding \ncommitment for IDEA, and to compensate states for the fact that every \ndollar in foregone IDEA funding is a dollar less that they have for \nschool construction or other local needs, our amendment would impose no \ninterest on BRICKS loans during the first five years provided the 40 \npercent funding commitment is not met.\n  Thereafter, the interest rate is pegged to the federal share of IDEA: \nzero in any year that the federal government fails to fund at least 20 \npercent of the cost of IDEA; 2.5 percent, the long-term projected \ninflation rate, in years that the Federal share falls between 20 and 30 \npercent; 3.5 percent in years the Federal share is 30 to 40 percent; \nand 4.5 percent in years the full 40 percent share is achieved.\n  Combined, these provisions will minimize the cost of these loans to \nthe states, and maximize the utilization of these loans for school \nconstruction, renovation, and repair.\n  This afternoon the choice we have on school construction is \nphilosophical. We can provide assistance to states to address the needs \nof their poorest schools, which is what the Enzi/Snowe amendment does. \nMy colleague Senator Harkin's approach seeks to provide a piece of the \nproverbial pie to all schools. But the size of the problem and the \npiece of the pie, I think they would be so thinly cut that a mere \nmouthful would be all that was offered. Better to consolidate our \nefforts on the very neediest so that the Federal assistance will make a \ndifference.\n  By providing assistance to states to address their most pressing \nschool construction needs, I believe our amendment provides important \nassistance to help address a national problem. Our children need a \nsafe, clean and healthy environment in which to learn.\n  I urge that my colleagues support the Enzi/Snowe amendment \nlegislation that will make a tangible difference in the condition of \nAmerica's schools without turning it into a partisan or ideological \nbattle that is better suited to sound bites than actual solutions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from \nOhio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to make it very clear to \nmy colleagues that I do not oppose constructing new schools. In fact, I \nfirmly believe that more schools should be built, replaced, repaired, \nand renovated in the United States of America. I suspect there are few \npeople in this country who have done as much as I have to make that \nhappen.\n  Earlier this month, I was in Cleveland, OH, to campaign for a $380 \nmillion local school construction bond and levy initiative. That money \nwould be used to leverage $500 million from the State of Ohio.\n  Last week, the voters of Cleveland passed that bond and levy by a \nmargin of 3 to 2. They voted to tax themselves in order to help build, \nreplace, and repair over 100 schools throughout the Cleveland School \nDistrict.\n  The citizens of Cleveland know that school construction is a State \nand local responsibility.\n  But I am concerned about the Federal Government telling State and \nlocal officials they have to spend Federal resources on school \nconstruction instead of spending it on education priorities they have \ndetermined. Localities should have the freedom to invest their dollars \nin the greatest needs, whether it is teachers, computers, or textbooks, \nand not be locked in.\n  We also need to consider the fairness factor. Many of our States have \ncommitted themselves in a very major way to school construction \nprograms. I am concerned that as the Federal Government becomes more \ninvolved in school construction, the less inclined the States will be \nto invest their own funds in school construction. There will be an \nincredible temptation for States to simply sit back and let the Federal \nGovernment take care of things. That is something we see too much of in \nthis body.\n  All we would be doing in passing the Harkin amendment or any \namendment is giving those States that refuse to step up to the plate \nand provide for their schoolchildren, a free pass from meeting their \nobligations. In my State, we have stepped up to the plate. Under Ohio's \nClassroom Facilities Assistance Program we have appropriated more than \n$2.7 billion to repair and rebuild our schools. By the end of this \nmonth, 23 schools will have been built or renovated by our program, and \nby the end of the year, 50 schools will be completed by the program.\n  For example, in Canton, OH, the State is paying $129 million out of a \n$176 million schools project. In the Springfield City schools, the \nState is paying $135 million out of a $165 million project. In \nYoungstown, the State is picking up $130 million out of $163 million.\n  In other words, the lower the wealth in the district, the less they \nhave to pay for rebuilding their schools. We are going to get the job \ndone in Ohio.\n  In fact, a GAO report pointed out that in terms of investing in \nschool construction, our State ranks ninth in the Nation in percentage \nterms and the eighth greatest in dollar amount.\n  I think it is important for my colleagues to understand that last \nyear, the National Governors' Association Center for Best Practices \nlooked into the prevalence of State involvement in school construction. \nHere is what they had to report:\n\n       The Center discovered Governors are focusing more attention \n     on school construction and modernization than ever before.\n\n  The report goes on to cite several examples: 11 States subsidize, \nreimburse, or match local funding for construction projects; 10 States \nhave an established formula for determining the amount of State funding \neach school district will receive; six States have established a new \nagency to oversee school construction with the State; five States \nprovide low-interest loans for low-income school districts to help \nsupport their school construction efforts; and four States require the \nGovernor and State legislature to approve school construction projects \nprior to State funding being made available.\n\n  The States are getting it done, which prompts me to ask my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle, why should the taxpayers of Wyoming, \nFlorida, or New Hampshire have to pay to build schools in Ohio? And, \nconversely, why should the taxpayers of Ohio, who are meeting their \nresponsibility, pay for those who have not yet done so? What kind of a \nmessage are we sending to these people? They have done the right thing, \nbut we are saying: Tough luck, we are going to take your tax money, the \ntax money we should spend on true Federal responsibilities, and totally \nignore them so we can do something that is politically popular. That is \njust wrong.\n  Mark my words, once the Federal Government gets involved in providing \ndirect grants to build schools, there will be pressure like you would \nnot believe to ramp-up the funding.\n  We just heard from the Senator from New York saying they have already \ncommitted schools for the money that has been made available to New \nYork State. I tell you this, they are lining up in New York and every \nother place. They are letting their Governors and their legislatures \nand their local officials off the hook. The passage of the\n\n[[Page S4994]]\n\namendment of the Senator from Iowa will do more to discourage States \nfrom stepping up to the plate and doing what they are supposed to be \ndoing than anything I can think of today.\n  As chairman of the National Governors' Association, we worked very \nhard to make a real difference in this area.\n  I started on this effort back in 1991 when I became Governor of the \nState of Ohio, and we are getting it done. But there is one more thing \nwe need to remember: When we spend Federal money on things like this, \nwe give up what you could have purchased with the money for other \nFederal responsibilities. Economists call that concept ``opportunity \ncost.'' When the Senate thinks about spending money on one thing, we \nneed to recognize we are giving up the ability to use money for other \nworthy causes. When figuring opportunity costs, we need to remember the \nfact that we have a number of unmet Federal needs, needs that are a \nFederal responsibility, and which we should address as part of our full \nand balanced approach to the Federal budget.\n  I am going to be talking more about that in this Chamber with my \ncolleagues later on this year. I have asked the General Accounting \nOffice to do a study on unmet infrastructure needs in our Nation--needs \nthat are the responsibility of the Federal Government, not State \ngovernment, not local government, but the Federal Government.\n  That GAO study is going to include highways, mass transit, airports, \ndrinking water supply, wastewater treatment, public buildings, and \nwater resources projects.\n  I believe the GAO's final report will give us a better sense of \nexactly how formidable our unmet needs really are.\n  We cannot do everything for everyone. Before we start down the road \nto spend billions upon billions of dollars, we need to remember that \nschool construction, like the vast majority of education programs, is a \nresponsibility best left to our State and local officials. They are the \nones who are on the front lines. They are the ones who know best the \nneeds of their respective communities in their States.\n  I think it is time for this body to stop acting like a national \nschool board. We are not a national school board. Many States elect \ntheir school board members. Many States elect their superintendents. \nThey are the ones who are charged with the responsibility under the \nConstitution. Under the 10th amendment, that is a responsibility of \nlocal and State government.\n  Let them do the job they are elected to do. And let us allocate our \nresources in those areas where we do have the Federal responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Do we have time left? Zero? OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, while I am awaiting the arrival of the \nSenator from Arkansas, I will take a couple more minutes on this \namendment.\n  What we are doing today, through one of the three amendments--or \nmaybe all of the three amendments--is setting up a new school \nrenovation and construction program. The question is, Do you want to \njust give the money to the States or do you believe there ought to be \nsome constrictions on the money?\n  Under the amendment I have offered, there is a first priority. That \nfirst priority is that the Federal Government shall first meet its \nexisting obligation to fund the construction and renovation needs of \nIndian schools and federally impacted schools before any other \nconstruction needs are addressed. That is an area that we have \nunderfunded in the past. It is an obligation we already have. That \nobligation stands at $2 billion.\n  There is a second priority; that is, once we have assured the funding \nof the Indian schools and the federally impacted schools, which is \nalready a Federal obligation, then we would have two mechanisms for \nfunding schools, both of which would require that they be targeted \ntoward the neediest districts in the States. Those would be determined \nby the States, but they have to be the neediest schools in the States.\n  There are two ways of funding that. One of them is Senator Snowe's \n``bricks'' approach, which is a revolving loan fund that is set up to \npay the interest on the school bonds that are done to build the \nschools. The other one is the proposal that I have put forth that \ntargets the 10 percent for the neediest schools and requires that there \nbe a 90-percent effort at the local level.\n\n  We keep talking about the local level. There are no provisions for \nfunding to get to the local level for an obligation. A needy area has \nvery little capability to raise money through bonds. States have \nrequirements. Bonding companies have requirements on how much money \nthey will allow a district to bond. Some of those districts have \nalready reached their entire capacity.\n  As I mentioned before, some have exceeded their capacity. How does \nthat happen? If the value of the property in the district goes down, \nand they already have existing obligations, then they exceed the \ncapacity they are allowed. There is no penalty for exceeding the \ncapacity. The bonds are not as valuable and they won't sell with any \nkind of premium. They will probably sell with a discount, but it is a \nmechanism that is out there for local school districts to provide \nfunding for their schools. And one of the things I have been concerned \nabout through the whole process is how we make sure there is money \navailable for the neediest schools, for those districts that do not \nhave a very high bonding capacity but still to make sure they do some \nlocal effort.\n  There is a tremendous difference in the kind of a school that is \nbuilt if you get to use somebody else's money as opposed to your own \nmoney. So we need to make sure there is still that local obligation \ninvolved.\n  The other part of it is that States have always had an obligation to \ndo this. In fact, the Federal Government, outside the two areas I \nmentioned, which are the Indian schools and the Federally impacted \nschools, has not had a role in school construction and renovation. We \nhave made that a requirement of the States.\n  As a result, in order to make sure there is still some State \nparticipation, there is a 50-percent match requirement. I do not think \nwe ought to pass any bill out of this Chamber that does not assure we \nhave the local participation and State participation before we do a \nbrand new Federal spending program that assures we are going to build \nschools for all of the school districts in the United States.\n  I can see the cash register ringing up out there as the wish list for \nnew schools goes up. I can tell you that in Wyoming, we have been \nworking under an equalization process so that the rich school \ndistricts, those districts that have a higher property valuation, and \nother resources, help to pay for the schools in poorer areas of the \nState.\n  That is always under some court review to make sure that there is \nsome equalization. There is a rating system for the school. There are \nsome requirements on how big of a school, the fact that it has to go to \nclassrooms, that it cannot go to athletic facilities. Athletic \nfacilities have to be provided by outside sources in that district--100 \npercent by the district. So they have gone through a lot of difficulty \nto arrive at a formula.\n  We are talking about launching a new Federal program with no \nconstraints. Once you do it with no constraints, it is pretty hard to \ngo back and say: Whoops, we bit off a bigger chunk than we can ever \nafford. After everybody in the country is figuring that their school \ncan be replaced by Federal dollars, how do we back off of that kind of \na position?\n  I am suggesting that if we get into this kind of a position at all, \nwe be sure that we nail down some of the requirements. Something that I \ndid not even address is, what size school do you build? If they are \ngoing to have 16 students, do you allow them to build for 1,000 \nstudents on the possibility that it might be a growth area? No, you \ncannot do that either. You cannot afford unlimited schools.\n\n  I heard someone say that the amendment of the Senator from Iowa does \nnot force money on anybody. That certainly is true; It does not force \nmoney on anybody. It passes it out by the bushel basket, with no \nconstraints whatsoever. Can you imagine some school district saying: \nNo, no, we would rather take care of the problem ourselves; don't give \nus any money? No. What they are all going to say is: You started a \nprogram. You said you\n\n[[Page S4995]]\n\nwould fix schools. It is underfunded. It is not funded.\n  Whatever you want to say, there will never be enough funds to take \ncare of the kinds of schools that everybody will be able to envision. \nArchitects will be staying up late dreaming of new ways they can build \nlogos for schools, let alone the schools, because there are no \nconstraints in the Harkin bill.\n  This amendment puts in some modest constraints, constraints that say \nthey have to have 90 percent bonding capacity in their area; they have \nto be making a local effort. They just have to have the local folks, \neven though it is not much, participating in their own program. Then \nthe States have to make sure that 50 percent of it comes either from \nthe local districts or the State, in any combination the State chooses, \nbefore any Federal dollars kick in.\n  We have the other solution that provides a revolving fund for States. \nThat would provide the money to cover construction bonds. It is another \nalternative, another way that we can do the process.\n  I hope people will look at this amendment as being one that is a \nlogical way to start the process. I ask that my colleagues consider the \namendment carefully, and then support the amendment that I have \noffered.\n  Another amendment that takes another approach that can have an impact \non schools is one that the Senator from Arkansas is proposing. So at \nthis point, I yield the floor, and I yield the remainder of my time to \nthe Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 550\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for \nyielding time. I will only take a minute to briefly explain why I ask \nmy colleagues to support the amendment I have offered.\n  There are, frankly, three amendments that deal with the issue of \nschool construction. I believe Senator Harkin and Senator Enzi are \nsincere. They have worked very hard. They understand there is a severe \nproblem out there. In fact, there is one area of agreement that we all \nhave, and that is that there is a serious need in this country for \nresources for school construction.\n  There is a different approach. There are three votes. There are three \namendments. There is only one that does not create a new Federal \nprogram addressing school construction. So while there are merits and \ndemerits to the various approaches, the other two amendments create a \nnew program--both create new programs--for school construction. I \nbelieve that is wrong. There is only one amendment that preserves the \nprerogative of State and local governments to control the school \nconstruction issue.\n  So my amendment offers a helping hand through the Tax Code for local \nschool districts, low-income, poor school districts to better be able \nto address the school construction needs they have. This is an approach \nthat passed 20-0 out of the Finance Committee and has been supported \npreviously in this body. I believe it is the right approach and \nexpresses our concern about this issue and gives help to the local \ngoverning bodies who need the assistance but preserves that very \nimportant prerogative of the local school districts to control school \nconstruction issues.\n  So this preserves the whole principle of this bill; that is, local \nflexibility and local control, and does not take us down the road of a \nnew Federal program involving us in a brand new area of building \nschools across this country.\n  So I ask my colleagues to support my amendment. I believe it is \nconsistent with what we are trying to do in this bill with greater \nflexibility and greater local control.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 649 offered by the \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 649. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered.

How long did that vote take, Mr. President?\n  May we have order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be order in the Senate.\n  The question is on the Harkin amendment.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \nvotes in the series be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Massachusetts asked how long the last vote \ntook. Did he get an answer to his question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-two minutes.\n  Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That the next vote be a 10-minute vote.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not know how serious this request is. I \nwould like to know first. I will reserve an objection. I know the \nSenator wants to have a 10-minute vote. I know that.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I know he is serious.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Right.\n  Mr. BYRD. But just how much do we mean this in the Chamber? I am not \nmaking little of the Senator's request. I would like to see a 10-minute \nvote.\n  May I ask this question of the leader. I ask unanimous consent that I \nmay speak for 1 minute on this reservation.\n\n[[Page S4996]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I ask the distinguished majority leader a question. \nThere is a request before the Senate to limit this next vote to 10 \nminutes, and the only way that can happen is if the majority leader \nsteps in at the end of the 10 minutes and closes this vote. Having been \nthe majority leader, I do not think it is unfair for me to ask the \nmajority leader if he intends to enforce this request if it is agreed \nto, and only the leader can enforce it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if Senator Byrd will yield, Senator Byrd has \nmade this point before, and I certainly understand how he feels, and \nothers, as a matter of fact, about the need to cut these votes off in a \nreasonable period of time.\n  I would be perfectly happy, and I am sure the managers would be \nhappy, to see us limit these to 10 or, I believe, 10 minutes plus 5 \nminutes over the time, which has been allowed, for a total of 15 \nminutes. I will be glad to do that.\n  What happens, of course, is Senator Daschle and I will receive a call \nfrom a Senator who is on the way. We had last week a mistake where the \nSenator from West Virginia had not been recorded when, in fact, he had \nvoted, and we, thinking he had not voted said: No, wait until he gets \nhere. We know he wants to be recorded.\n  We make a mistake by bending over backwards too much trying to \naccommodate all 100 Senators. But the Senator's point is well taken. \nSince we are all here and listening attentively, this vote will be cut \noff in the prescribed time, as was suggested by the Senator from \nVermont, if in fact that request is honored.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I remove my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe sequenced votes and any cleared amendments, the Senate then resume \nconsideration of the Dayton amendment No. 622 and the Voinovich \namendment No. 443. I further ask unanimous consent that there then be a \ntotal of 30 minutes equally divided for closing remarks with respect to \nboth amendments.\n  Further, I ask unanimous consent that following that time, the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relation to amendment No. 622 to be followed by a \nvote in relation to amendment No. 443, with no amendments in order to \nthe amendments prior to the vote. I ask unanimous consent that there be \n2 minutes equally divided prior to the second vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I inquire of the Senator from Vermont, about \nwhat time, then, would the next two votes occur? Would that be roughly \nin 1 hour--1 hour 10 minutes, excuse me?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The elapsed time would be about an hour.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I regret I was sitting immediately behind the distinguished \nSenator and I did not understand his request. Would he mind repeating \nthe request.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that following the sequenced \nvotes and any cleared amendments, the Senate then resume consideration \nof the Dayton amendment No. 622 and the Voinovich amendment No. 443. I \nfurther ask consent that there then be a total of 30 minutes equally \ndivided for closing remarks with respect to both amendments.\n  Further, I ask consent that following that time, the Senate proceed \nto a vote in relation to amendment No. 622, to be followed by a vote in \nrelation to amendment No. 443, with no amendment being in order to \namendments prior to the vote. I ask that there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to the second vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like to speak for 30 minutes on the \nmatter of reconciliation. Is it expected in the morning we will have an \nopportunity to speak before that bill is taken up?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say if the Senator will yield, I \nwould like to have a chance to talk to the managers of the legislation \nabout the possibility of yielding some time tonight or we will work \nwith you to make sure you have time in the morning. We know you want to \nspeak on this matter, and we will work with you to find a time that is \nagreeable with you to do so, either after these votes or in the \nmorning. If you will allow us to talk to the managers and get with you, \nwe will find a way you can do that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not want to speak to an empty Chamber \non the matter of reconciliation. So I would like to speak immediately \nafter the next two votes, which I understand are already scheduled. Am \nI correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are two votes that are scheduled at this \npoint.\n  Mr. BYRD. I would like to speak immediately after those votes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am not sure; does Senator Byrd still have \nthe floor?\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not have the floor. I was reserving the right to \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator from Vermont will yield, as we try to get \nthe unanimous consent agreement worked out, I believe we have requests \nthat would allow us to have this sequence and then have two votes in \nabout an hour. I think maybe then there would be a time where Senators \nwill be in the Chamber and perhaps we could do it after the two votes \nthat are supposed to occur in an hour. Would that be agreeable to \nSenator Byrd?\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator from Vermont yield?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. As I understand it, two votes are locked in already.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I would like to speak following those two votes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know the Senator would like to have an \nopportunity to speak when there would be the maximum opportunity to \nhave the arguments heard, but I do not think Senators are going to stay \nafter these two stacked votes. We were hoping we could stay on the \neducation issue and get through this agreement that has been worked \nout, the final two. Then while we are working on the next amendment we \nthought it would be a good time for Senator Byrd to make his statement.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I object to the request.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we have two votes that are already \nordered and we can go to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have an explanation of the amendment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We ask for 2 minutes for the proponent, the author of \nthe amendment to be able to address the Senate prior to the vote. I ask \nfor 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the author of the \namendment explaining it for 2 minutes? One minute?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I object. If it is only going to be 1 \nminute, I object. I want an explanation on this. We will have it or we \nwill have a quorum call and that will take far longer than an \nexplanation would require. I want to know what this amendment is about.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could I renew my request he be given 2 minutes?\n  That is too short a time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Let's make that 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4997]]\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued the call of the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this legislation and \nall those who have been involved in continuing to try to move it \nforward. It is not easy to accommodate the wishes of all Senators in \nterms of time for final debate before amendments or those who would \nlike to speak on other issues, but we try very hard to accommodate all \nof those wishes.\n  We have come up with an agreement that I think will allow us to make \nprogress on the education bill, move to the reconciliation bill, and \nmake progress there. So to put it in layman's language, we have two \nvotes on amendments back to back that are already ordered. What we \nwould do then would be to go to the debate on the next amendments. \nThose two votes would occur in the morning, beginning at 9 o'clock, \npreceded by 3 minutes of time before each vote. Then at 9:30 or so, as \nthe votes are completed, we would go to reconciliation, and Senator \nByrd would be recognized for up to 30 minutes as the first speaker on \nreconciliation. So that is how it would work out.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the votes that \nare ordered, and any cleared amendments, the Senate then resume \nconsideration of the Dayton amendment No. 622 and the Voinovich \namendment No. 443. I further ask consent that there then be a total of \n20 minutes, equally divided, for closing remarks with respect to both \namendments. Further, I ask consent that following that time, the Senate \nproceed to a period of morning business. I ask consent that these votes \noccur beginning at 9 a.m., with 3 minutes prior to each vote for \nexplanation.\n  I further ask consent that Senator Byrd be recognized immediately \nfollowing the two stacked votes for up to 30 minutes immediately \nfollowing the reporting of the bill by the clerk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not expect to object, but I want to be clear on two \nthings. No. 1, when we have a quorum call here, we should be able to \nhear the clerk call the names. No. 2, the 30 minutes that are reserved \nfor me to speak----\n  Mr. REID. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. No. I did not say 20 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. For Senator Byrd?\n  Mr. REID. I am talking about the two votes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not talking about the two votes. My 30 minutes I do \nnot want taken out of the 20 hours tomorrow. I wanted to make it today. \nI wanted to make it today between the votes so that it would not----\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield, I think we could probably spend \nmore time working through this. Let's make that accommodation. We will \nhave two votes in the morning, but Senator Byrd will speak for 30 \nminutes. Then we will go to the reconciliation bill, which would be at \napproximately 10 o'clock or 10 after, whatever it would be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, it is our understanding \nthat the remarks by the Senator from West Virginia would not come out \nof the reconciliation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Because of his objection, perhaps others, it would not \ncount against that time. But we are going to have to use about 12 hours \nor more tomorrow. So I was thinking that since it was relevant to that \nissue those 30 minutes could count against the 12 or 14 hours we need \nto use tomorrow. But if there is objection to that, it is more \nimportant we get the agreement, hear what he has to say, and get \nstarted with the reconciliation bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 525\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Harkin \namendment No. 525.\n  The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Missouri (Mrs. Carnahan) \nis absent attending a funeral.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMissouri (Mrs. Carnahan) would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen).

LIMITATIONS ON FUNDS.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, a local educational agency shall use funds received \n     under this subpart only to provide academic instruction and \n     services directly related to the instruction of students in \n     preschool through grade 12 to assist eligible children to \n     improve their academic achievement and to meet achievement \n     standards established by the State.\n       ``(b) Permissible and Prohibited Activities.--In this \n     section, the term `academic instruction'--\n       ``(1) includes--\n       ``(A) the implementation of instructional interventions and \n     corrective actions to improve student achievement;\n       ``(B) the extension of academic instruction beyond the \n     normal school day and year, including during summer school;\n       ``(C) the employment of teachers and other instructional \n     personnel, including providing teachers and instructional \n     personnel with employee benefits;\n       ``(D) professional development for instructional personnel;\n       ``(E) the provision of instructional services to pre-\n     kindergarten children to prepare such children for the \n     transition to kindergarten;\n       ``(F) the purchase of instructional resources, such as \n     books, materials, computers, other instructional equipment, \n     and wiring to support instructional equipment;\n       ``(G) the development and administration of curricula, \n     educational materials, and assessments; and\n       ``(H) the transportation of students to assist the students \n     in improving academic achievement; and\n       ``(2) does not include--\n       ``(A) the purchase or lease of privately owned facilities;\n       ``(B) the purchase or provision of facilities maintenance, \n     gardening, landscaping, or janitorial services, or the \n     payment of utility costs;\n       ``(C) the construction of facilities;\n       ``(D) the acquisition of real property;\n       ``(E) the payment of costs for food and refreshments;\n       ``(F) the payment of travel and attendance costs at \n     conferences or other meetings other than travel and \n     attendance necessary for professional development; or\n       ``(G) the purchase or lease of vehicles.''.\n       ``(3) the chief administrative officer may make exceptions \n     to the prohibitions that are reasonable and necessary to \n     carry out the purposes of the program.''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment directs that Title I \nfunds be used only for academic instruction. It is true that for the \nmost part title I funds are used for academic instruction. It is also \ntrue, though, that money often goes for other purposes, and this \namendment would clarify the purposes for which Title I funds can be \nused by school districts.\n  The amendment states that the funds be used to improve academic \nachievement, to help students meet State achievement standards. \nPermitted uses would include corrective actions to improve student \nachievement, extending academic instruction beyond the normal school \nday and school year, including summer school, employing teachers and \ninstructional personnel, providing instructional services to pre-\nkindergarten children to help them transition to kindergarten, \npurchasing instructional resources, conducting or obtaining \nprofessional development, and developing curriculum, for example.\n  What is explicitly not permitted is the purchasing or leasing of \nfacilities or vehicles with Title I funds, purchasing or providing \nfacilities maintenance, janitorial, gardening, or landscaping services, \npaying for utilities, constructing facilities, acquiring real \nproperties, buying food or refreshments, or travel to and attendances \nat conferences except for travel and attendance necessary for \nprofessional development.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to take these critical funds and see \nthat they go where they should go, which is toward the core curriculum \nand the teaching of and learning by youngsters. I believe the amendment \nwill be accepted.\n  Current law on Title I is much too vague.\n  It says,\n\n       A State or local educational agency shall use funds \n     received under this part only to supplement the amount of \n     funds that would, in the absence of such Federal funds, be \n     made available from non-Federal sources for the education of \n     pupils participating in programs assisted under this part, \n     and not to supplant such funds.\n\n  Basically, it says that Title I funds are to be used for the \n``education of pupils.'' That is just too nebulous.\n  The U.S. Department of Education has given states a guidance document \nthat explains how Title I funds can be used. Permitted uses are for the \nfollowing: instructional practices; counseling; mentoring; developing \ncurricula; salaries; employee benefits; renting privately-owned \nfacilities; janitorial services; utilities; mobile vans; training and \nprofessional development; equipment; interest on lease purchase \nagreements; travel and conferences; food and refreshments; insurance \nfor vehicles; and parent involvement activities.\n  Under this guidance document, only two uses are specifically \nprohibited: construction or acquisition of real property; and payment \nto parents to attend a meeting or training session or to reimburse a \nparent for salary lost due to attendance at ``parental involvement'' \nmeeting.\n  I believe we should give the Department, states and districts clearer \nguidance in law. My reason for introducing this amendment is this: Our \nstudents are not learning; our schools are failing our children. We \nmust use our limited federal dollars for the fundamental purpose of \neducation: to help students learn.\n  A January 2001 study by Education Weekly, titled ``Quality Counts \n2001: A Better Balance,'' brought more bad news about California's \nstudents. Here's what the report found:\n  In fourth grade reading, 20 percent of students are proficient and 52 \npercent are below the basic standard.\n  In eighth grade reading, 22 percent of students are proficient and 36 \npercent are below the basic standard.\n  Comparing California to other states, in how well fourth grade \nstudents read, California ranks 36 out of 39 states. In eighth grade \nreading, California ranks 32 out of 36 states.\n  Nationally, the news is similarly distressing:\n  U.S. eighth graders are out-performed by their counterparts in math \nand science from Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, Australia, and \nCanada.\n  American twelfth graders performed in mathematics better than student \nin\n\n[[Page S4999]]\n\nonly two countries, Cyprus and South Africa.\n  In writing, 75 percent of U.S. school children cannot compose a well-\norganized, coherent essay, according to the National Assessment for \nEducation Progress in September 1999.\n  We have to put a stop to this bad news. Fortunately, the bill before \nus takes some strong steps and with this amendment, it will take even \nmore.\n  While it is difficult to ascertain how Title I funds are always being \nused, we do know of a few examples that raise questions in my mind:\n  In Alabama, according to the Citizens' Commission on Civil Rights, \n``dipped into Title 1 to pay the electric bill and for janitorial \nservices.''\n  While most of Title I's $8 billion appear to be spent on instruction, \nthe Los Angeles Times, in a March 12, 2000 editorial, said, ``About \nhalf that amount is wasted on unskilled though well-meaning teacher \naides, who are often more babysitter than instructor.''\n  Title I has been used ``to pay for everything from playground \nsupervisors and field trips to more time for nurses and counselors,'' \naccording to the San Diego Union-Tribune, March 16, 2000.\n  California school officials have told my staff that Title I has been \nused for pay for clerical assistants in school administrative offices, \npayroll staff, truant officers, schoolyard duty personnel, school bus \nloading assistants, ``curriculum coordinators,'' ``compliance,'' \nattending conferences, and home visits.\n  By offering this amendment, I am not suggesting that Title I funds \nare being wasted across the board.\n  In fact, an August 2000 report by the Department of Education says, \n``Most--77 percent--of Title I funds were used for instructional \nresources,'' for example, to hire teachers and to provide instructional \nmaterials. That is good.\n  But that report also says, that 12 percent of funds or $835 million \nin 1998, were used for ``program administration.'' Since this report \ndoes not provide more specificity, it is difficult to tell exactly what \nthese funds were used for, but I do think we have to question whether \nwe want $835 million spent on administration of this program.\n  Another report, a draft by the Citizen Commission on Civil Rights, \nfound that in the Fresco, California, school districts, ``15 percent \n[of Title I funds remains in the district office.'' It goes on to say \nthat funds are also used for ``supplies, two case workers, Saturday \nschools, and breakfast and lunch programs for about 800 homeless \nstudents.'' This is just one example and while these uses probably most \ncertainly contribute to a child's education, it is my view that Title I \ncannot do everything.\n  That is why I am trying to better focus Title I funds on academic \ninstruction, teaching the fundamentals and helping disadvantaged \nchildren achieve.\n  Federal funding is only seven percent of total funding for elementary \nand secondary education and Title I is even a smaller percentage of \ntotal support for public schools. We must get the most that we can \neducationally for our limited dollars. It is time to better direct \nTitle I funds to the true goal of education: to help students learn. \nThis is one step toward that goals.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow I believe Vice President Cheney \nwill be releasing details of an energy plan he has worked on for some \nlong while. All of us anxiously await release of that plan, so we can \nbegin discussing what kind of an energy policy this country needs.\n  I think it is the case that with respect to both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations, for many years this country has not had a \nsatisfactory energy plan. We have become more and more reliant on \nforeign sources of energy. We seem not to have a consistent plan that \ntracks over a long period of time relating to production and \nconservation and renewables.\n  So I think it is quite clear we need a new plan. We need a new \nstrategy, one that works for this country. We have Americans today who \ndiscover, when they drive up to the gasoline pumps, that the price of \ngas has increased dramatically. In some parts of the country, people \nare now paying over $2 a gallon for gasoline. In other parts of the \ncountry, the price of gasoline, they say, will probably move to $3 a \ngallon at some point. Lord only knows what the new projections will be.\n  Those who are trying to heat their homes with natural gas, or family \nfarmers who are going into the field with anhydrous ammonia fertilizer, \n80 percent of which is natural gas, are discovering the price of \nnatural gas has spiked and skyrocketed. In many parts of the country, \nthe price of natural gas is double what it used to be, and in some \ncases is much more than that.\n  If you happen to live in California at the moment, you discover that \nthe price of electricity has dramatically increased. We know that 2 \nyears ago, the price of power in California cost consumers $7 billion. \nTwo years later, it is $70 billion in California, which is nearly a \ntenfold increase. Those price increases have spread to other parts of \nthe west, as well.\n  We know that in California the use of natural gas to produce power in \nelectric generating plants, in a deregulated wholesale market, has \ncreated, in my judgment, a broken market, one in which unregulated \nsellers sell into a regulated market in California, and in 24 hours the \nprice of an MCF of natural gas can double, triple, or quadruple--in \njust a 24-hour period. And all of it is non-transparent. No one can see \nwhat the pricing is, who made the money, how much money was made. That \nis what is happening in California today.\n  I have been very critical of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nthat is supposed to be regulating some of these activities, but instead \nhas done its best imitation of a potted plant for a couple years. They \nhave essentially done nothing because they apparently view markets as \nsome sort of sacrosanct device which will be fair to all.\n  In fact, the market in California is broken. The market for power in \nCalifornia does not work. This is a failed experiment in deregulation. \nAny lesson we should take from this for the rest of the country--and, I \nwould say, for my home State of North Dakota, is: let us not follow \nthis example of deregulation. They call it restructuring. That is just \na fancy name of saying deregulation.\n  In North Dakota, we have been deregulated with airlines, deregulated \nwith railroads, and now they talk about the deregulation of \nelectricity. Every time we have been deregulated, we have been hurt \nbadly. The California experience of deregulation and restructuring \nought to send shivers down the backs of the rest of the people in this \ncountry who have not yet had this experience.\n  My point is, we have an energy situation that is in chaos in this \ncountry: it is at the gasoline pumps in the eastern part of the \ncountry, and all the rest of the country; it is in electricity prices \nin California; natural gas prices for farmers who are about to go into \nthe field; and for people trying to heat their homes.\n\n[[Page S5000]]\n\n  What do we do about all that? First, I happen to think we ought to \ninvestigate pricing policies. When you have concentration of power in \nthe hands of a few--I would say, in the oil industry, with the kinds of \nmergers we have had in recent years--we have larger and larger \nenterprises that have the capability, that have the economic power and \nthe muscle to impose high prices and to manipulate supply. I do not \nallege they do it in all cases. I do allege the possibility exists. And \nwe would do the public and this country some good by shining light on \npricing policies in many of these energy streams. I suggest we do that \nby creating a select committee--a joint House and Senate committee--to \ninvestigate energy prices.\n\n  Let me be quick to say, there also are other reasons for the spike in \nsome energy prices. When the price of oil went to $10 a barrel, \nfrankly, there was very little incentive for the energy industry to \nlook for oil and natural gas. I understand that. I accept that.\n  Then the price of oil spiked to $35 a barrel, and we began to see \nmore drilling rigs; more people are looking for oil. We will have more \nsupply coming on line. I accept the fact that there is an imbalance in \nsupply and demand. That is not permanent. That is temporary. I also \naccept the fact we would be better off as a country not having that \nkind of roller coaster ride on energy prices.\n  We would be much better, in my judgment, having a more stable pricing \nstructure that would provide incentives for people to search for coal, \noil and natural gas, not just sometimes, but all of the time.\n  So I accept that as part of the reason for some of the pricing \ndisparities that exist in this country. But I do not accept that that \nrepresents the entire answer for what is happening in this country.\n  I believe there is evidence of price manipulation and supply \nmanipulation, and I think this Congress, which seems to be willing to \ninvestigate almost anything in the last 10 years or so, would do the \nAmerican public a service by creating a select committee of the House \nand the Senate to investigate energy prices. If there is nothing there, \nwe will not find anything. If we find something, we will do the \nAmerican public a service by shining light on it, and finding it, and \nstopping it, with respect to price manipulation.\n  Having said all that, let me say that we welcome the submission by \nVice President Cheney tomorrow. It is time--high past the time--that \nthis Congress begin deliberating on a new energy policy.\n  What should that policy be? In my judgment, that policy needs to have \nincentives and the kinds of mechanisms that will encourage production. \nYes, we need more production; no question about it. We need to find \nmore coal, more oil, and more natural gas. So production is a part of \nit.\n  In fact, there is a substantial amount of production opportunity \naround this country. The are 32 trillion cubic feet of natural gas up \nin Alaska that we know is there. It is leased. That could be brought \ndown here, if we could only build a pipeline. So in terms of \nproduction, we need pipelines. And, we also need facilities to transmit \nelectricity.\n  There are a whole series of infrastructure issues, in addition to the \nproduction incentives, that ought to be in a good, sound energy plan. \nBut let me say, with respect to the news report about energy policy \nthat we are likely to get tomorrow, when they say production is the \noverwhelming urge in this new energy plan, production is an important \npart of it, but it is not the only part of it. A balanced energy plan \nthat is good for this country will include production. There is no \nquestion about that. But a balanced energy plan will especially also \ninclude conservation.\n  This country needs to be more conservation-minded. We can conserve \nmuch more energy than we do, if we have the kind of leadership that we \nought to have, and if we have the incentives for conservation that we \nought to put in place.\n\n  In addition to conservation, we need efficiency. There is no reason \nthat we ought not require more efficiency in appliances and a range of \nother activities in this country. We know from experience that \nrequiring greater efficiency works, that the manufacturers can develop \nproducts to be more efficient and produce these products for our \nconsumers in this country. Efficiency must be a part of a balanced \nenergy plan.\n  Then, finally, a balanced energy plan must--and I emphasize must--\ninclude renewable sources of energy. I know the oil companies have \nnever liked some of them. The oil industry has never liked the \nproduction of ethanol. What is ethanol? Taking a kernel of corn, \nextracting a drop of alcohol from that kernel of corn, and using that \nalcohol to extend our energy supply makes great sense to me. It is \nrenewable. You can produce that corn over and over again. Once you take \nthe drop of alcohol from the kernel of corn, you have protein feed \nstock left that you can use to feed animals. What a terrific bargain \nfor this country: Extend your energy supply by using a renewable source \nof energy and have the protein from the feed stock left for animals.\n  But the oil companies have never much liked ethanol, and I understand \nwhy. Because it is a competitor, albeit a small competitor, but it \nought to be a much bigger competitor. We ought to develop renewable \nresources. Ethanol is one renewable source. Another is biomass; still \nanother is wind power.\n  It may surprise some to know that the Department of Energy says the \nwind power capital of the world is North Dakota. We do not have any \nwind devices in North Dakota to collect this power and distribute it. \nThe new wind energy turbines are very efficient. They are wonderful \ndevices that can take the wind and create from that wind, and from the \nspinning of the propeller into a turbine, electricity.\n  North Dakota, they say, is the ``Saudi Arabia'' of wind. Some \nlistening to me from time to time on the floor of the Senate might \nunderstand I contribute to that. But if North Dakota is the ``Saudi \nArabia'' of wind--and the Department of Energy says it is--then we \nought to, not just in North Dakota, but around the country, use this \nnew wind energy, which itself is renewable.\n  We have a substantial amount of new wind energy activity in Iowa, in \nMinnesota, and, of course, there has been a substantial amount in \nCalifornia. But the new turbines for wind energy are highly efficient. \nWe owe it to this country to use these new renewable sources of energy \nto extend our country's energy supply.\n  So the point I am trying to make tonight is this: If we get an energy \npolicy from the administration tomorrow that says, look, this is a \nsimple solution, all we have to do is go find more oil and natural gas, \nand maybe crank up another nuclear plant or two, I say that is an \nanswer that would have come 20 years ago or 40 years ago or 60 years \nago. We need to do a lot of things, and a lot of things well, in order \nto resolve this country's energy problems.\n  Let me just digress for a moment to say, one of the interesting \nthings about this country, and about energy, is this: Almost everything \nin the world has changed in the last century--almost everything. You \nname an area, and you will find a significant change--except, we still \nuse gasoline in automobile engines.\n  I was a very young boy when I got my first car. My father actually \nfound it in an elevator out on an abandoned farm. He knew who owned the \nabandoned farm, and he said: Why don't you write to him in Milwaukee \nand see if you can buy this car? I was a young boy.\n\n  My dad said: It is a 1924 Model T Ford. You can buy it and restore \nit. What a great project for a young fellow; and I did.\n  I wrote to the guy in Milwaukee. He wrote back and said: Gosh, I \nwould love to let you have that car. It's sitting there in this little \nelevator on the farm that is abandoned. Send me $25.\n  I sent him $25, and he sent me the owners manual that he saved all \nthose years and the key that he had saved all those years, as well. I \npulled the Model T Ford into my father's service station. I worked on \nit for a year and restored the little old Model T Ford. It was a 1924 \nantique automobile.\n  Do you know something? You provided energy for that car--that 1924 \ncar--exactly the same way you provide energy for a car produced in \n2001. You stick a gas hose in the tank, and pump a little gas in. \nNothing has changed.\n\n[[Page S5001]]\n\n Nothing has changed in all of these intervening years. Isn't that \ninteresting? Almost everything else has changed, but we still stick a \ngas pump in a gas tank of a car--80 years ago, or today, you pump the \nsame gasoline. Quite remarkable.\n  We can do better in this country. I am not suggesting we wean \nourselves off gasoline in a short period of time, but there is a car \nsitting out in front of this Capitol from time to time, owned by our \nfriend from Utah, Senator Bennett, that runs on both gasoline and \nelectricity. It is one of the new hybrid cars. I think that is kind of \ninteresting. I would like to see a whole fleet of them in this country. \nI would like to see that kind of technology. Perhaps this is just the \nfirst step toward the fuel cell, and taking the hydrogen out of water \nand using it as a fuel, as some say will happen with the new fuel \ncells.\n  The point is this, we can do a lot of things. This country has the \ntechnological capability to do a lot of wonderful things. But here we \nare, sitting on the edge of this spin in this energy crisis, with the \nprice of natural gas doubling, the price of gasoline $2 at the pump and \ngoing north, and the price of electricity in California going through \nthe roof, and blackouts occurring at a time when California is only at \nabout two-thirds of its ultimate power needs for the hot weather.\n  We have a mess on our hands. In order to get out of this mess, all of \nus, Republicans and Democrats, need to figure out how we construct a \nstrategy on energy that is balanced--that includes production, \nconservation, efficiency, and renewables. A good energy policy that has \nall of those elements, that represents the best of all of the ideas \nbrought to the table in this Chamber, will serve this country well.\n  Feuding and fussing with an energy strategy, then coming up with the \nsame tired old strategy we have had in the past, just simply street-\ncorner chanting ``production, production, production''--thinking that \nsomehow that will solve this country's problem, is, in my judgment, a \nroad to nowhere.\n  I am anxious to see, and interested in seeing, what the Vice \nPresident has produced. Most of us in this Chamber should be ready and \nwilling to begin working immediately with the Vice President, the \nadministration, and all others, to both construct and demand a balanced \nenergy policy for this country.\n  The American consumers have long deserved it and have never received \nit. Americans don't deserve to be held hostage by foreign energy \nsupplies over which we have little control. They don't deserve to be \nheld hostage with respect to electric costs we can't control and, \ntherefore, have rolling blackouts in one of our largest States. They \ndon't deserve to have been held hostage by gas pump prices over which \nthey have no control and very little understanding.\n  Tomorrow will be an interesting day. I hope it is the first step on a \njourney to begin constructing between Republicans and Democrats an \nenergy policy that will really serve this country well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the disclosure late \nlast week that the Government had failed to share thousands of pages of \nevidence with defense attorneys in the case of Timothy McVeigh.\n  Let me first say that my thoughts and prayers are with the victims \nand families who lost loved ones as a result of this horrific, cowardly \nact. My heart goes out to them. For them, this cannot help but be a \nvery difficult time.\n  Sadly, their ordeal has only been aggravated by the national \nspectacle surrounding McVeigh's planned execution and now this latest \nrevelation of the mishandling of his case. This latest unforeseen turn \nmust only add to their anger, their pain, and their grief.\n  There is no question that McVeigh should be punished severely for \nthis heinous crime. On that, there can be no disagreement.\n  But the FBI's belated release of these thousands of documents \nhighlights the fact that the Federal Government's administration of the \ndeath penalty, even in the most highly scrutinized of cases, is \nfallible.\n  At his press conference Friday, President Bush said:\n\n       Any time we're preparing to carry out the death penalty, we \n     have a solemn obligation to make sure that the case has been \n     handled in full accordance with all the guarantees of our \n     Constitution. The very foundations of our democracy depend on \n     our ability to assure our citizens that in all criminal \n     cases, and especially in the death penalty, defendants have \n     been treated fairly.\n\n  I agree with President Bush.\n  But if this kind of gross failure can occur in a case managed by the \nmost competent, professional law enforcement agency of which we know, \ndoubts must arise with regard to the Government's ability in every \ncapital case ``to assure . . . that defendants have been treated \nfairly.''\n  And if this kind of dereliction occurs in a case vigilantly observed \nunder the television klieg lights, doubts must arise that this Nation \nhas made sure that other capital defendants' cases have ``been handled \nin full accordance with all the guarantees of our Constitution.''\n  And if this kind of deficiency can take place when dedicated and \nwell-trained counsel have labored and diligently applied themselves to \nensure fairness for this defendant, doubts must arise that this Nation \nis in all death penalty cases delivering the justice on which ``[t]he \nvery foundations of our democracy depend.''\n  To honor ``the guarantees of our Constitution,'' we must ensure the \nfairness of the entire process by which the Government applies the \ndeath penalty--from arraignment, to trial, to sentencing.\n  And to ensure that ``defendants have been treated fairly,'' we must \nensure equity in treatment for all defendants, regardless of where in \nthe Nation they live or what the color of their skin.\n  In these respects, the case of Timothy McVeigh does not present the \nBush administration its most difficult test. For the McVeigh case lacks \nthe questions of innocence, regional disparity, and discrimination that \nhaunt so much of death row.\n  After McVeigh's, the next scheduled Federal execution is that of Juan \nRaul Garza. Because of questions raised about regional and racial \ndisparities in the Federal death penalty system, his execution was \nstayed until June 19. When he stayed the execution, President Clinton \ninstructed the Justice Department to conduct a study to determine the \ncauses of those regional and racial disparities.\n  Observers of justice in America will await how the Justice Department \nand the President review these questions. Until these questions are \nresolved, and until we are certain of the fairness of the process, the \nGovernment should not execute Juan Raul Garza. These questions may \nprovide the weightiest test of Attorney General Ashcroft and President \nBush in the weeks to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/16/senate-section/article/S5001-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5001-S5002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TAX CREDITS FOR HYBRID VEHICLES\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, tomorrow the administration will unveil its \nenergy plan. From the early reports we have been given, I am concerned \nthat the proposals are too heavily weighted on the production side and \nfail to adequately address the need for conservation. One bright note \nthat I have found is a general support for hybrid vehicles, the topic \nthat I wish to address briefly today.\n  Specifically, I want to voice my support for legislation creating a \nhybrid vehicle tax credit. A hybrid vehicle combines an electric motor \nand battery pack with an internal combustion engine. The engine and the \nelectric motor work in tandem, with either system providing primary or \nsecondary power depending on driving conditions. For example, when \nstopped at a light, the vehicle shifts from an internal combustion \nengine to electric power and then back again upon acceleration. In \naddition, the batteries are re-charged during operation, eliminating \nthe need for an external charger. This is new technology and the result \nof years of hard work.\n  I would like to see my colleagues join me in passing legislation to \ncreate a tax credit that would encourage consumers to purchase hybrid \nvehicles. I\n\n[[Page S5002]]\n\nhave known for years that this technology would become available and I \nhave been looking for the right opportunity to draft legislation that \nwould help put hybrid vehicles on our roads. I think that there are two \ncomponents that must be addressed in a tax credit bill. To begin, I \nfirmly believe that we must reward the integration of the technology \ninto the vehicle with a base credit. In addition, however, I feel \nstrongly that an important goal that must be achieved through \nlegislation is to reward a vehicle that significantly decreases the \namount of fuel consumed. I have proposed a plan that provides both a \nbase credit of up to $2000 for the use of the technology, as well as a \nbonus credit, up to $1000, calculated based upon the lifetime fuel \nsavings of the vehicle.\n  I think that this approach is a sound one. Placing the emphasis on \ngallons saved speaks directly to the importance of conservation and \nwith our country facing an energy crisis is critical. And I also know \nthat the biggest improvements in the reduction of fuel consumption will \ncome from getting larger volumes of hybrid vehicles into the hands of \nconsumers.\n  But in crafting this legislation, there are certain realities that we \nmust accept. Today, there is a significant portion of the population \nthat wants to drive a larger vehicle. This is America and people are \nentitled to personal choice. It is for this reason that I applaud the \nefforts of car manufacturers who have chosen to place hybrid technology \nin larger vehicles and SUV's. For example, DaimlerChrysler has \ncommitted to hybridizing the popular Dodge Durango with the vehicle \nscheduled to come on like in 2003 and this will bring a 20 percent \nimprovement in fuel consumption.\n  I am also aware that others have advocated different approaches to \ncrafting legislation that creates a tax credit for hybrid vehicles. My \ncolleague Senator Hatch has introduced a bill, S. 760, that would \nprovide a tax credit for hybrid vehicles as well as other advanced \nmotor vehicle technologies. While his bill provides a base credit, up \nto $1,000, for the inclusion of hybrid technology, the bonus credit in \nthis bill, up to $3,000, is calculated depending upon the fuel economy \nperformance of the vehicle.\n\n  In addition to the Hatch bill and the administration's general \nstatements, members of the automobile industry as well as \nenvironmentalists are also engaged in discussions to draft language \nthat will create an incentive for consumers to purchase a hybrid \nvehicle. In the next few weeks, we need to have a thorough discussion \namong members of the automobile industry and environmentalists so that \nwe can reach consensus on the language of this important legislation \nand move forward to passage of a bill. There is not just one approach \nthat solves the problem and I am prepared to listen to all views. I \nhope that the other stakeholders are also ready to work for a \ncompromise. While we may differ on our approach to drafting the \nlegislation, I am sure that we can all agree that the goal should be \npassage of legislation that creates a tax credit for hybrid vehicles \nand provides the necessary encouragement to bring this important \ntechnology into the marketplace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/16/senate-section/article/S5002-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy last month. The \nLocal Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current \nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a heinous crime that occurred December 12, \n1999 in Washington County, PA. Three men who went to an adult bookstore \nto rob a gay man now face charges of kidnapping, robbery, aggravated \nassault, murder, tampering with evidence, and one count of conspiring \nto commit those crimes in the disappearance of Ira Swearingen, 49, a \nmedical consultant from Stout, NV. The gruesome details of the \nabduction, beating, and murder of Swearingen were revealed in court. \nAfter being abducted, Swearingen was stuffed inside the trunk of his \nrental car, during which time, one of the perpetrators said ``Did ya \nhear it? I broke his jaw.'' Another perpetrator heard gurgling of blood \nand heard the victim screaming. They yelled ``Shut up faggot! Shutup, \npickle.'' Later, the victim was driven to an isolated area, forced to \nstrip and marched into the woods as he pleaded for his life at which \npoint, one perpetrator testified, he shot the victim between the eyes \nat close range.\n  I believe the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/16/senate-section/article/S5002-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nendeavors of the citizens and Town Council of Westerly, RI, in \nestablishing and promoting Neighbor Day. Neighbor Day is an opportunity \nto learn more about others in our communities. It is also a celebration \nof friendship, civility, peace and cooperation. Since 1993, when a \ndispute between two teenagers left one youth dead and another charged \nwith murder, Westerly has celebrated Neighbor Day in an effort to \nprevent similar tragedies at home and throughout the world.\n  Westerly's tradition has been adopted throughout my state. The Rhode \nIsland\n\n[[Page S5003]]\n\nGeneral Assembly in 1999 designated the Sunday before Memorial Day as \nNeighbor Day for annual statewide observance. It is the hope of the \ncitizens of Westerly that Neighbor Day will gain nationwide and \nworldwide recognition, and that its ideals--community, tolerance, and \nnonviolence--will one day become a reality for all.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with me in recognizing Westerly's \nachievement in encouraging friendship and respect among all people.\n  I ask that following this statement the resolution of the Rhode \nIsland General Assembly, declaring statewide recognition of Neighbor \nDay, be printed in the Record.\n\n Senate Resolution Declaring May 19, 1996 To Be Neighbor Day in Rhode \n                                 Island\n\n       Whereas, Go out of your way to get in touch with your \n     neighbors. Ring doorbells and say ``Hello.'' These are but \n     some of the things we each can do to learn more about the \n     people in our communities; and\n       Whereas, In 1993, Westerly became the first town in the \n     Ocean State to declare the Sunday before Memorial Day to be \n     Neighbor Day, and the State of Rhode Island swiftly followed \n     its splendid example. Hopefully national and international \n     recognition of this special day will make its ideals a \n     reality for all; and\n       Whereas, While respect and justice for all is often upon \n     our lips, it will take a strong personal commitment by each \n     and every one of us to actualize this dream; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island and \n     Providence Plantations hereby declares May 19, 1996 to be \n     Neighbor Day in Rhode Island.

A bill to authorize increased support to the democratic \nopposition and other oppressed people of Cuba to help them regain their \nfreedom and prepare themselves for a democratic future, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it is an honor to be joined today by \nSenator Lieberman and eight other distinguished Senators in the \nsponsorship of the Cuban Solidarity Act which is intended to be a \nblueprint for a more vigorous U.S. policy to liberate the now enslaved \nisland of Cuba.\n  This measure, S. 894, is the companion to House bill No. 1271 \nsponsored by Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart and 95 other Members of \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Whether one supports the current embargo on the Castro regime or not, \nwe should all agree that we can and must do more to help those \nstruggling for freedom today in Cuba. That is the aim of the Cuban \nSolidarity Act, and that is why I ask Senators on both sides of the \nembargo issue to consider supporting this bill on its merits.\n  The embargo is not a policy, it is merely a policy tool, and the U.S. \npolicy should be to put an end to Fidel Castro's stranglehold on the \nCuban people and end his brutal dictatorship--and the sooner the \nbetter.\n  The Cuban Solidarity Act will authorize $100 million in U.S. \nassistance to the Cuban people over 4 years. It also will mandate a \nproactive U.S. policy to support the internal opposition to Castro in \nCuba. This strategy, by the way, is modeled after the decisive U.S. \nsupport for the Polish Solidarity movement back in the 1980s.\n  With the enactment of the legislation, the U.S. Government will move \nbeyond merely isolating the Fidel Castro regime. Indeed, we can \nundermine Castro's isolation and oppression of the Cuban people by \nfinding bold, proactive, and creative programs to help those who are \nworking for change on the island of Cuba. This can be achieved by \ngiving the President a mandate to increase all forms of U.S. support \nfor prodemocracy and human rights activists in Cuba.\n  This support may include food, medicines, office supplies, books, \neducational materials, telephones, FAX machines, or other material or \nfinancial support. And recipients may include political prisoners or \ntheir families, persecuted dissidents, labor rights activists, \neconomists, journalists, and others working for peaceful change.\n  Such support will encourage independent libraries, independent \nagricultural cooperatives, so-called microenterprises run by self-\nemployed Cubans, or U.S.-based exchange and scholarship programs. In \naddition, this measure will support nongovernmental charitable \nprograms, such as senior citizen centers, free clinics, or soup \nkitchens.\n  For Senators who are not fans of foreign aid--and I am among them--I \nam obliged nevertheless to acknowledge that the investment the United \nStates made in the liberation of Eastern Europe has yielded \nimmeasurable benefits. That is precisely what we propose to do with and \nto Cuba. Our businesses and our farmers stand to benefit once the Cuban \npeople can begin to reconstruct their economy. This, of course, cannot \nhappen until the Cuban people can shed themselves of the Marxist regime \nnow in power in Cuba that is bankrupt in every sense of the word.\n  While the pending bill neither tightens nor loosens the embargo on \nthe Cuban regime--that is to say, the Fidel Castro regime--it will \nallow President Bush to license private donations from Americans to \nindependent Cuban groups and to independent self-employed Cubans. The \nPresident can license the importation into the United States of goods \nmade by independent, self-employed Cubans. These potential \nbeneficiaries and activities have in common the intent and purpose to \npromote freedom and independence from the ruthless Fidel Castro regime \nthat now uses hunger and fear to keep the people of Cuba under control.\n  Critics of this bill may contend that this high-profile support will \ngive Castro an excuse to harass and jail dissidents for receiving \nforeign support. But the sad truth is that Fidel Castro is already \ntormenting his own people, systematically and relentlessly.\n\n  Furthermore, if courageous Cuban dissidents choose to stand up for \ntheir God-given rights and look to us for moral or material support, \ncertainly we should not turn our backs on them. Let Castro do his \nworst. Let us do our best. Let others waste their energy trying to \nengage the wornout, cruel dictator, Fidel Castro. The United States \nwill be engaging the other 11 million souls on the island of Cuba who \nhave suffered persecution for too long already.\n  President Bush already has broad authority to initiate many of the \nprograms prescribed by this bill, and I anticipate that he may do so. \nHe should begin by instructing all relevant U.S. agencies to increase \nsupport to democratic opposition groups on the island of Cuba.\n  For example, the U.S. Agency for International Development has been \nproviding support to U.S. groups promoting democracy and human rights \nin Cuba. Under the Clinton administration, this program amounted to \nlittle more than ``window dressing.'' Hardly anything was done about \nit. Under President Bush, it must have more personnel, more money, and \nmore room to maneuver around the Fidel Castro regime.\n  Now other steps are prescribed by this proposed legislation, and they \nare steps that President Bush can take this day, right now. For \nexample, the proposed act also urges multilateral diplomacy calling on \nthe Cuban Government to respect human rights, free political prisoners, \nlegalize political parties, allow independent trade unions, and submit \nto internationally monitored free elections, none of which Fidel Castro \nhas permitted since he took over the island of Cuba.\n  The pending legislation urges the ``freedom broadcasting\" stations, \nknown as Radio and Television Marti and the Voice of America, to take \nsteps to overcome Castro's jamming of the power of those stations so \nthat their excellent programming will be available throughout the \nisland.\n  The act also urges the President of the United States to instruct the \nAttorney General to bring to justice those Cubans involved in the \nFebruary 1996 shoot-down of four innocent pilots on a humanitarian \nmission over international waters.\n  Pending indictments also tell us that Castro and his cronies are up \nto their\n\n[[Page S5008]]\n\nnoses in cocaine smuggling. It is high time for Fidel Castro to be held \naccountable for that crime and his many other crimes.\n  The act also mandates an international campaign to remind the world \nevery day of Castro's abuse of human rights, workers' rights, the \nindependent press, and religious freedom of the Cuban people.\n  The act also requires an indepth review of all of Fidel Castro's \nthreats to U.S. security posed by his espionage and his relentless \nquest for unconventional weaponry.\n  This coming Sunday, May 20, will mark Cuba's independence day. Few \nAmericans know that the United States played a pivotal role in helping \nCubans win their independence from Spain back in 1902. Today, our \nNation is called upon to keep faith with those Cuban mothers who want \nto raise their children with the best values, and with Cuban fathers \nwho want to see their families thrive and prosper, and for little Cuban \nchildren who deserve a better future than they now have.\n  The Cuban Solidarity Act is a blueprint for a principled, proactive \npolicy aimed at liberating Cuba. We will be keeping faith with the \nCuban people.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Frist):\n  S. 895. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit against income tax for research related to developing vaccines \nagainst widespread diseases and ensure that such vaccines are \naffordable and widely distributed; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last month at the African Summit on AIDS in \nNigeria, the Secretary General of the U.N., Kofi Annan, called upon the \ninternational community to establish a new multibillion-dollar global \nfund to combat AIDS and other infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis \nand malaria. He estimates that $7 billion to $10 billion annually will \nbe needed to fight the global pandemic of HIV/AIDS on all fronts--\nprevention, care, and treatment. This call reflects the magnitude of \nthe challenge before all of us.\n  The AIDS crisis has never been so devastating or so urgent as it is \ntoday. In less than two decades, AIDS has become a global epidemic, \nendangering the lives of millions of people, the majority of them in \ndeveloping countries. It has proved more devastating than wars. In \n1998, in Africa, 200,000 people died in armed conflict, but in the same \ntime, 2.2 million people died from AIDS.\n  It is destroying the economies of many developing countries at a \ncritical juncture, unacceptable as that level of death would be at any \ntime, and it is reversing half a century of developmental gains.\n  Even more importantly, AIDS has emerged as an international security \nthreat with the ability to destroy communities, whole generations, and \neven nations. Just recently, the Bush administration continued what the \nClinton administration had done, which is recognizing it as a security \nthreat to the United States of America.\n  The statistics are chilling. Over 36.1 million people are living with \nHIV/AIDS around the world. According to the United Nations, every 60 \nseconds, 11 people contract HIV due mostly to unprotected sex, but also \nto intravenous drugs. At the end of the day today, 14,500 more men, \nwomen, and children will be infected with HIV. Over 13 million children \nhave been orphaned by AIDS.\n  Africa is hardest hit by this epidemic today. Eight African countries \nare struggling under the weight of a disease that has infected 15 \npercent of their adult populations. Three African countries--South \nAfrica, Botswana, and Zimbabwe--are threatened with negative population \ngrowth in the next few years, and if a cure is not found, that will \nhappen.\n  I know it is difficult for any of us to imagine the enormity of the \nhuman suffering that goes along with these statistics, but it is \nimportant that we as policymakers do not shy away from understanding \nthe terrible impact AIDS is having on a global basis.\n  In South Africa, which is at the epicenter of this global epidemic, \n25 percent of adults, one in every nine South Africans, are now living \nwith HIV. U.N. officials estimate that if the epidemic continues to \nspread at its current pace, close to one-half of the country's 15-year-\nolds will die of AIDS-related illnesses in the coming years--one-half \nof all the 15-year-olds. This represents an entire generation of South \nAfricans.\n  While Africa is bearing the brunt of the epidemic today, there are \nstrong signs that Asia will soon fall under the same inconceivable \nburden. Infection rates are climbing in Asia with countries such as \nIndia on the brink of a large-scale expansion of the epidemic. \nCurrently, almost 4 million people in India are infected--second only \nto South Africa in total number of infections.\n  In a country with one-sixth the world's population, the AIDS pandemic \nin India is of particular concern to us. According to the International \nAIDS Vaccine Initiative, it is making clear inroads into the general \npopulation. As with many countries affected by HIV/AIDS, many of the \nhigh-risk groups, such as commercial sex workers, intravenous drug \nusers, truckers, and migrant workers, all of whom have high infection \nrates, end up spreading HIV at alarming rates as globalization and the \nmarket economies continue to put pressure on the movement of migrant \npopulations of workers.\n\n  Prevention efforts in India face many of the same obstacles as in \nmany developing countries. These include high illiteracy rates, \nwidespread poverty, very poor infrastructure, the low status of women, \nand taboos on talking about issues of sexuality.\n  In East Asia, more than 2.4 million people are already infected with \nthe HIV virus, and an estimated 150,000 children have been orphaned. \nWhile China does not yet have the same infections as India, Chinese \nresearchers estimate that the number of HIV-infected people could jump \nto 10 million in a few years.\n  Countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are also \nvulnerable, with Russia experiencing the highest increase in infection \nrates in the world last year. The Russian Federation had more new HIV \ninfections in 2000 than in all the previous years of the epidemic \ncombined, totaling 700,000 infections in the year 2000, up from 170,000 \nin 1997.\n  Latin America and the Caribbean are also heading down the same path. \nIn fact, some of the Caribbean island states have worse epidemics than \nany country outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Five percent of the adults \nin Haiti are living with AIDS.\n  Even these alarming statistics do not give a full picture of the \nscope of the HIV/AIDS threat. In fact, for many people in the \ndeveloping world, AIDS is simply another burden on top of many others, \nsuch as poverty, armed conflict, and incomplete infrastructure.\n  By eating away at the social capital of many of these countries, AIDS \nis decimating the most productive members of society who are needed to \nsolve many of the other problems in their nations.\n  In addition to the challenges posed by AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis \nare also exacting a tremendous toll on the developing world. In 1999, \nthere were an estimated 8.4 million new tuberculosis cases, and 10.2 \nmillion new cases are expected in 2005 if present trends continue. \nMalaria also poses an increasing threat as well, killing at least 1 \nmillion people each year, about 3,000 people a day.\n  The spread of each of these infectious diseases is made worse by \nhealth systems' failure, population movement, deteriorating sanitation, \nand insufficient prevention and treatment efforts.\n  A human crisis of this proportion demands that we respond with \nurgency and thoughtfulness. We must continue to support robust \nprevention, treatment and care programs. But we must also recognize \nthat vaccines are the most effective weapons in the arsenal of modern \nmedicine to stop the threat of AIDS and other infectious diseases. \nPharmaceutical companies, however, are reluctant to invest in research \nfor vaccines to prevent HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases because \nthey fear they will not recover the expense of their research.\n  The bill that I am introducing today, along with my colleague Senator \nFrist, is designed to address this problem by providing incentives for \npharmaceutical and biotech research companies to accelerate their \nefforts to develop vaccines and microbicides to prevent AIDS, TB, \nmalaria, and other\n\n[[Page S5009]]\n\ndeadly infectious diseases. It does this in three ways.\n  First, it provides a 30 percent tax credit each year on qualified \nresearch expenses to develop microbicides for HIV and vaccines for HIV, \nTB, malaria, and other infectious diseases that kill more than 1 \nmillion people annually. This is an expansion of the existing R tax \nand can be applied to clinical trials outside of the United States, \nsince the majority of those infected with these diseases are beyond our \nborders.\n  Second, it provides a refundable tax credit to small biotechnology \ncompanies based on the amount of qualified research that they do in a \ngiven year. Biotech firms are among the most innovative when it comes \nto research. Increased research efforts by these firms could be \ninstrumental to the effort to develop effective vaccines, particularly \nfor HIV/AIDS.\n  Third, the bill provides a 100 percent tax credit on contracts and \nother arrangements for research and development of these vaccines \nand microbicides. This credit, which is an increase over the 65 percent \ncredit now in the tax code, is designed to serve as an incentive to \nlarger pharmaceutical companies to work hand in hand with the smaller \nbiotech companies to pick up the pace of vaccine development.\n\n  Over the last year a number of pharmaceutical companies have taken \nsteps to help in the treatment of those infected with AIDS by providing \nlife-extending therapies to the developing world at reduced costs. \nThese drugs are critically important but the war against AIDS cannot be \nwon unless we develop vaccines against the HIV virus and related \ninfectious diseases. The pharmaceutical and biotech companies hold the \nkey.\n  Once vaccines are developed, it is imperative that they be widely \ndistributed. The bill that I am introducing today with Senator Frist \nalso addresses the distribution side of the equation. It provides a 100 \npercent tax credit to companies on the sales of new vaccines and \nmicrobicides as long as those sales are made to a qualified \ninternational health organization or foreign government for \ndistribution in developing countries. It also directs the Secretary of \nthe Treasury to establish a fund in the Treasury for the purchase and \ndistribution of eligible vaccines to developing countries. Finally, it \nurges continued U.S. government support for the Global Alliance for \nVaccines and Immunizations, GAVI, and the Global Fund for Children's \nVaccines.\n  Mr. President, many steps need to be taken in the war against AIDS \nand other infectious diseases. This bill focuses on only one area but a \ncritically important one: vaccine development and distribution. If the \npublic and private sectors work together with energy and commitment, I \nbelieve we can develop the vaccines and once developed, we will win the \nwar.\n  It is easy for people in a country as rich as we are, as safe as we \nare, as blessed as we are to lose sight of what is happening on the \nrest of the planet. There are even some in this country who are quick \nto simply say: Well, it's their fault; it's the result of their sexual \npractices; it's the result of their values; it's the result of their \nculture.\n  It may well be that it is possible for people to cast a finger and to \npoint blame, but this is a crisis of human proportions that affects all \nof us. It affects all of us because of the potential destabilization of \nwhole nations with which we do business and on whom we must rely in a \nwhole series of relationships.\n  It is also critical for us to understand the implications of this \nbecause in the world today there are no boundaries. This is a disease, \nand a disease has all the capacity to be carried across boundaries and \nbecome as important to us in this nation as it should have been already \nsimply by virtue of the number of people in our country who are \ninfected and who may potentially carry the disease elsewhere.\n  Yes, we must continue to support prevention; yes, we must continue to \nsupport treatment; and, yes, we must continue to support care programs. \nBut I do not believe any of us can feel secure in the notion that there \nwill be enough money, enough delivery systems, or that we will ever \nhave the capacity to provide the kind of care, treatment, and \nprevention that will deal with the numbers about which we are talking \nin a global pandemic of this nature.\n  The most important tool, the most important weapon in the arsenal \nagainst this we have not even begun to use because we have not \ndiscovered it yet, and that is a vaccine. A vaccine can replace all of \nthe need for infrastructure, except for the delivery of the vaccine, \nthe need for care, the extraordinary burden on health care systems, and \nthe incapacity of systems to deal with the sheer numbers we are facing.\n  There is a reason we do not have a vaccine. It is because there is no \nmarketplace. All of these countries are poor, and the drug companies, \nby and large, have an incentive to provide the drugs that most rapidly \nremunerates them. We have Prozac, Viagra, and a host of other drugs \nthat are quickly and easily put in the marketplace.\n  We need to create an incentive in the Tax Code to encourage research \nand development for the creation of an AIDS vaccine. Many of us are \nconfident that if the United States were to create the kind of energy \nin our research and development technology, in our education sector, we \nhave the ability to provide the ultimate vaccine against this.\n  Senator Frist, a colleague of enormous respect in this institution, \nas a physician is unparalleled in his understanding of the difficulties \nof this issue.\n  I am proud that he is a cosponsor with me of this legislation. We are \nhoping our colleagues will join us next week when the tax bill comes to \nthe floor in reconciliation. We have an opportunity to provide the \nsmall amount of money necessary through this tax structure to be able \nto create the vaccine that can help deal with this crisis.\n  Many steps are needed in the war against AIDS and other infectious \ndiseases. This bill focuses on only one area, but it is a critically \nimportant one, vaccine development and distribution. If the public and \nprivate sectors work together with the energy and commitment that we \nproduced for so many other things in this country, we can make a global \ncontribution of historic proportions. I think we should strive to do \nnothing less than that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to support of S. 895, the \nVaccines for the New Millennium Act of 2001. In an age where \nantibiotics are taken for granted, we often forget that one fourth of \nall deaths worldwide, over 13 million people annually, are the result \nof infectious disease. In the next hour alone, 1,500 will die from an \ninfectious disease such as AIDS, malaria, TB or pneumonia, over half \nthose who die will be under the age of 5 years old.\n  The developing world suffers a disproportionate burden of infectious \ndisease deaths, which destroy lives and perpetuate poverty and \nsickness, undermining gains in economic growth, education and life \nexpectancy. Vaccines, the most cost-effective weapons in the fight \nagainst infectious diseases, have eradicated smallpox, nearly \neliminated polio from the planet, and dramatically lowered measles \nrates.\n  Yet vaccines are not reaching all those who need them. The expanded \nuse of currently available vaccines, such as those for tetanus, measles \nand hepatitis could save up to 4 million children every year. The U.S. \nheavily invests in immunization programs, providing over $100 million \neach year for polio eradication efforts and millions more to support \nother global vaccination programs. Recently, we joined the Gates \nFoundation and other governments to fund the Global Alliance for \nVaccines and Immunization to help purchase and deliver the latest \nvaccines to the poorest countries.\n  But despite these programs, effective vaccines do not yet exist for \nmalaria, TB, or AIDS, diseases that together kill nearly 6 million \npeople each year. Unfortunately, research and development for diseases \nsuch as these, lag far behind the need. Of the $60 billion investment \nin health research by the public and private sectors, only 10 percent \nis allocated to the health needs of developing countries.\n  The National Institutes of Health is the global leader in searching \nfor new vaccines for these diseases, but the job of NIH is science, not \ndevelopment and distribution of commodities such as vaccines. We must \nencourage increased attention by the private sector if vaccines for \nAIDS, Malaria and TB are to become a reality.\n\n[[Page S5010]]\n\n  Research and development by both pharmaceutical and biotech companies \nhave provided dramatic and lifesaving technologies and drugs that \nbenefit millions here and abroad. Their efforts are the lynchpin that \nensures recent advances in science reach the widest number of people. \nBut companies are faced with a conundrum, how do they justify the \nhundreds of millions of dollars necessary to develop and license a \nvaccine, such as for TB, when the markets for those vaccines are \nprimarily in the world's poorest countries, countries spending less \nthan $10-20 per person on health care per year?\n  The Vaccines for the New Millennium Act of 2001, is an attempt to \nprovide market incentives for both the large pharmaceutical industry \nand smaller biotech companies to accelerate development of vaccines for \nAIDS, malaria and TB, diseases that disproportionately affect \ndeveloping countries.\n  The bill will provide incentives at multiple levels in the vaccine \ndevelopment process. It: provides a 30 percent tax credit for research \nand development expenditures for vaccines for malaria, TB, and AIDS; \nprovides a refundable tax credit to biotech companies that are doing \ninnovative research but are not yet making a profit; provides a 100 \npercent credit on sale of vaccines for these three diseases to poor \ncountries. Over 10 years, this provision alone could provide as much as \n$1 billion in additional funding for pharmaceutical companies that \ndevelop vaccines for AIDS, malaria, and TB; authorizes a purchase fund \nfor these three vaccines to be established after they become available \nto the market; and provides the same package of benefits to research \nand development of microbicides for HIV/AIDS--medications that would \nenable women to protect themselves from infection with the virus.\n  It is the objective of this bill to energize the public/private \npartnership that has helped the U.S. pharmaceutical industry become the \nworld leader in innovation. By promoting increased R for diseases \naffecting the poorest countries, we will all benefit. There is a clear \nhumanitarian and moral call to do what we can to provide safe and \neffective vaccines to save lives. But beyond this obligation, we cannot \nforget that infectious diseases do not respect borders. Until TB, \nmalaria, and AIDS are eliminated, we all face the threat from diseases \nthat should be rapidly relegated to the waste bin of history.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n          Vaccines for the New Millennium Act of 2001--Summary\n\n       This bill has two purposes: to provide incentives to \n     pharmaceutical and private sector biotech companies to \n     accelerate research and development of vaccines and \n     microbicides to prevent deadly infectious diseases such as \n     HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, which kill some 5-6 \n     million people annually; and to increase international access \n     to vaccines and microbicides, once developed.\n\n                   Incentives to Accelerated Research\n\n\n      1--increased tax credit for vaccine research and development\n\n       Provides a 30 percent tax credit on qualified research \n     expenses to develop microbicides for HIV and vaccines for \n     malaria, TB, HIV and other diseases that kill 1 million \n     people or more annually. This is an expansion of the existing \n     20 percent Research and Development tax credit.\n       Mandates that a company file a research plan with the \n     Secretary of the Treasury on these priority vaccines or \n     microbicides before claiming the tax credit.\n       Allows the tax credit to be applied to the costs of \n     clinical trials outside of the United States, because of the \n     prevalence of malaria, TB, and HIV in developing countries. \n     However, pre-clinical research must be conducted in the \n     United States in order to claim the tax credit.\n\n\n         2--refundable tax credit for small, biotech companies\n\n       Provides a refundable tax credit to small biotech companies \n     based on the amount of qualified research that they a company \n     does in a given year. This credit is designed to stimulate \n     increased research among firms that often do the most \n     innovative research.\n       Mandates that any firm receiving this credit put an \n     equivalent amount of funds into research and development \n     within 2 years of having received the credit. Such \n     expenditures cannot be claimed under the tax credit for \n     qualified vaccine research and development. Requires the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate regulations to \n     recapture the credit if a company fails to make these \n     expenditures.\n\n\n               3--tax credit for research contracted out\n\n       Provides a 100 percent tax credit on contracts and other \n     arrangements for research and development on these priority \n     vaccines and microbicides. This credit, an increase from the \n     existing 65 percent, is designed as an incentive for larger \n     firms to contract with smaller, vaccine research companies.\n\n           International Access to Vaccines and Microbicides\n\n\n          1--Tax Credit on sales of vaccines and microbicides\n\n       Provides a 100 percent tax credit on the value of sales of \n     new vaccines and microbicides for malaria, TB, and HIV and \n     any other disease killing more than 1 million people \n     annually. Sales must be made to a qualified international \n     health organization or foreign government for use in \n     developing countries.\n       Limits the annual credit on such sales to $100 million \n     through the years 2002-2006 and 125 million through the years \n     2007-2010.\n\n\n          2--establishment of lifesaving vaccine purchase fund\n\n       Mandates the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a \n     purchase fund in the Department of the Treasury at the time \n     that an eligible vaccine is ready for purchase.\n       Authorizes the Secretary to use the fund to purchase \n     vaccines and distribute those vaccines in developing \n     countries.\n\n\n           3--other mechanisms to increase access to vaccines\n\n       Requires a company that develops a vaccine or microbicide \n     using the research and development credit to certify to the \n     Secretary of the Treasury that it will establish a plan to \n     maximize distribution of the vaccine or microbicide to \n     developing countries. Such plan would not waive any rights to \n     pricing, patent ownership or release of proprietary \n     information.\n       Urges continued US government support for the Global \n     Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations, GAVI, and the Global \n     Fund for Children's Vaccines.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Allard, Mr. Leahy, \n        and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 897. A bill to amend title 39, United States Code, to provide that \nthe procedures relating to the closing or consolidation of a post \noffice be extended to the relocation or construction of a post office, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Government Affairs.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to re-introduce an \nimportant, common sense, community-based bill with my friend, Mr. \nJeffords. That bill is the Post Office Community Partnership Act of \n2001.\n  It is not by mistake that we offer this bill during National Historic \nPreservation Week. This week, sponsored by the National Trust for \nHistoric Preservation, highlights the need to support the diversity and \nhistory of our communities and work to revitalize them.\n  A few years ago, we discovered that post offices throughout the \ncountry were not paying attention to local ideas and local needs before \nclosing, relocating, consolidating, or constructing new facilities. I \nknow of several examples in my home state of Montana. Post offices in \nLivingston and Red Lodge, for example, proposed changes that would have \nseverely altered the downtown fabric of those communities. These small, \nrural towns have a Main Street by name and by function. It's on Main \nStreet that people stop by the post office on the way to the bank or \nthe grocery store. It's where they enjoy the chance to not only get all \ntheir ``in town'' chores done, but also interact with each other.\n  It's small town ``Main Streets'' all over the country that are \nthreatened when post offices close or relocate. At a time when many \nrural communities are struggling, the closure or relocation of a Main \nStreet post office is the sounding of a death knell.\n  Communities like Livingston and Red Lodge define our rural \nlandscapes. They have been built around a cluster of essential services \nthat ensure their vitality. Communities are unnecessarily hurt when \ncornerstone institutions, like post offices, close or relocate. People \nnot only lose a gathering place, they lose an important element of \ntheir community.\n  There are certainly instances where closures, relocations, \nconsolidations, and new construction are good choices for a community. \nThis bill doesn't change that. What it does, is address those instances \nwhere people and communities have suffered because the Postal Service \nhas made a decision without consulting with community members.\n\n[[Page S5011]]\n\n  While the Postal Service has made some internal changes in the past \ncouple of years to include more public involvement, I fear that new \npressures on delivery service will tempt the Postal Service to focus on \nways to meet their business needs, while belying the role they play in \ncommunities.\n  Today, Senator Jeffords and I are re-introducing legislation to \nensure public participation in local post office decisions relating to \nclosing, consolidation, relocation, or new construction. This bill \nisn't about imposing new mandates on the Postal Service. It's about \nhonoring the role that the Postal Service plays in our towns and \ncommunities. It's about protecting a partnership that communities and \nthe Postal Service have nurtured throughout the history of this \ncountry.\n  Indeed, partnership is what this bill is all about. Specifically, our \nbill outlines a process for community notification and involvement. It \nmakes sure that a community's voice is heard. It requires the Postal \nService to post notification of proposed facility changes. It specifies \nthat local government officials be notified of the proposed changes at \nthe same time as persons serviced by the local post office. And it \nrequires the Postal Service to follow local public participation \nprocesses if they are more stringent than their own.\n  These common-sense provisions will ensure that communities continue \nto partner with the Postal Service and that both the Postal Service and \nour communities will continue to enjoy a mutually beneficial \nrelationship.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Jeffords and me in passing \nthis important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 897\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague \nSenator Baucus in reintroducing the ``Post Office Community Partnership \nAct of 2001.''\n  This bill is similar to the one we introduced in the 105th and 106th \nCongress that so many of our colleagues supported in the past. It is my \nhope that this year the bill will become law. We are also coordinating \nour efforts with Representative Blumenauer of Oregon who will introduce \na companion bill in the House of Representatives this week.\n  This bill will allow local communities to have a voice in determining \nthe future of their local Post Office. In many towns across Vermont, \nthe post office functions as the social and economic cornerstone of the \nlocal downtown area. Not only does the post office provide a daily \nservice to residents, it is an enduring neighborhood institution. The \npost office is an enduring neighborhood institution where\n\n[[Page S5012]]\n\nresidents catch up with their neighbors, or get the latest news. As a \nconsequence many small towns across America are hurt by decisions to \nclose, relocate or consolidate postal facilities. Our bill will \nincrease local community input when the Postal Service determines that \na facility will be constructed, consolidated, relocated, or closed.\n  This bill also addresses larger smart growth concerns. Right now, the \nU.S. Postal Service is exempt from local zoning and building laws. This \ncreates situations where the new facilities do not fit in with the size \nor scale of the local community. Many new facilities are relocated to \nthe outer fringes of downtowns which encourages sprawl. Transplanting \nlocal facilities out of downtown locations has a potentially \ndevastating impact on the character of many towns. This bill will help \npreserve the small town way of life by preventing sprawl and \nencouraging the re-use of historic structures. The Post Office \nCommunity Partnership Act will help communities have a say in the \nfuture of their local post offices.\n  There have been a number of incidents in Vermont where a post office \nhas moved out of the traditional town center and local officials have \nhad little or no say in the decision. In Perkinsville, VT the post \noffice moved from the general store to a site miles from the downtown. \nThe same thing happened in Fairfax, when the post office moved from a \nhistoric building downtown to a strip mall.\n  A prime example is Westminster, one of the oldest towns in Vermont. \nThis town of 3,200 people was shocked to learn that the Postal Service \nwas replacing their old facility with a building more than four times \nas large with 33 parking spaces. There were several reasons the \ncommunity and local government officials were outraged at the decision. \nFirst, the Postal Services's standard ``design number 30'' does not fit \nin with Westminster's size, scale, zoning, or historic character. The \nPostal Service has been unwilling to modify their standard designs to \nmeet community needs. Moreover the neighboring town recently built a \nnew post office with more than 1200 PO boxes that are still vacant. The \nPost Office Community Partnership Act will allow the Postal Service and \nthe local community to work together from the beginning of the planning \nprocess toward common sense solutions that benefit everyone.\n  This legislation is necessary to ensure that local communities will \nalways have a voice in the Postal Service's decision making process. As \ntowns struggle to grow and plan for their development, the Postal \nService has all too often been an unwilling partner. In Vermont and \nacross the U.S., many communities are attempting to carefully plan \ntheir future development, to protect and preserve their open space, \nprevent unregulated sprawl, and conserve natural resources. Yet they \nare not getting any assistance, and are often hindered by Postal \nService decisions. This bill will close some of the loopholes that \nallow the Postal Service to operate outside the regulations that \nlocalities place on other businesses and government agencies.\n  This legislation will strengthen the ties between the Postal Service \nand local governments, help preserve our downtowns, prevent sprawl, and \npromote sensible, managed growth. I urge my colleagues to join Senator \nBaucus and me in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor \nof the Post Office Community Partnership Act. Too often the Postal \nService's designs for new offices fail to conform with local land use \nlaws and these new cookie-cutter structures are replacing what were \nonce the heart and soul of our towns. This legislation will ensure that \nthe Postal Service does a better job of listening to local communities, \nrespecting zoning regulations, and preserving Vermont's distinctive \ncharacter.\n  In Vermont and across the country, Post Offices are community \nlinchpins, serving more than just generic mailing stations. It is the \nPost Office where people go to meet their neighbors and talk about the \nlatest news. The Postmaster is sometimes the only national \nrepresentative in a community, and they often provide advice and \nguidance about important issues. The Post Office is inextricably linked \nwith daily life. Remove it, and the special character of the place is \nlost.\n  As the Post Office has experienced financial difficulties in recent \nyears, the prospect of Post Office closures has loomed larger. \nUnfortunately, inadequate processes are in place to ensure that the \nU.S. Postal Service will consult with local communities in the event of \na closure, relocation, or consolidation. This legislation will ensure \nthat the service notifies communities far in advance of any action, and \nensure that concerned citizens have a role in decisions.\n  With such provisions in place and other much-need reforms, the U.S. \nPostal Service will work through its difficulties. The service will \ncontinue to grow, expanding access and making much-needed \nmodernizations to its older facilities.\n  Too often, though, new post offices look like they do not belong in \nthe heart of a traditional town center. Local zoning ordinances are \nignored, and the Post Office contributes to unsightly sprawl. While \nthere are many success stories, there are few detailed guidelines to \navoid repetitions of the failures. That is why this legislation also \nincludes provisions to ensure the U.S. Postal Service will follow local \nland use laws.\n  Successful mail service is a subtle balance between efficiency and \ncontributing to the community. I think this important legislation will \nhelp the U.S. Postal Service find that balance well into the future. I \ncommend Senator Jeffords for introducing this legislation, and I urge \nits swift consideration and passage, as it will help preserve the \nimportant role of our Post Offices in our way of life.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 898. A bill to make technical amendments to the Radiation Exposure \nCompensation Act (42 U.S.C. 2210 note), provide compensation to certain \nclaimants under such act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing bipartisan \nlegislation that will provide important and necessary technical changes \nto the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990, RECA, as amended.\n  I am delighted that my good friend and esteemed Chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Domenici, is joining me as the primary \ncosponsor. Pete and I have been working on RECA since its enactment in \n1990 and his leadership has been invaluable over the years in making \nthis program a reality.\n  I want to give special thanks to Senator Daschle for joining us as an \noriginal cosponsor on this important legislation. His support of this \nprogram has been critical to its success.\n  I also want to thank Congressman Chris Cannon who is introducing the \ncompanion bill in the House.\n  The compensation fund established under the original RECA Act of 1990 \nprovides a level of financial support to thousands of individuals, both \nworkers and civilians, who were not informed about the health hazards \nassociated with radiation exposure. Many of these individuals worked in \nuranium mines, many drove the trucks which transported uranium ore, and \nmany happened to live downwind from a nuclear test site. These \nindividuals, especially the downwinders, became ill due to their \nradiation exposure.\n  As my colleagues will recall, last year Congress passed the Radiation \nExposure Compensation Amendments of 2000, S. 1515. This law, P.L. 106-\n245, included new eligibility standards so that individuals who were \ninjured as a result of working in the government's nuclear weapon's \nprogram would receive some compensation for their radiation-related \nillness.\n  The RECA Amendments of 2000 made important changes to the original \n1990 Act by updating the list of compensable illnesses, primarily \ncancers, eligible for consideration as well as increasing the number of \nindividuals and states eligible for compensation based on the latest \nscientific and medical information gathered over the past decade.\n  It has become painfully clear that there remain several important \nproblems with the program which needs immediate or corrective attention \nby the Congress.\n\n[[Page S5013]]\n\n  First and foremost is the fact that the RECA Trust Fund is depleted. \nThis is a situation we cannot allow to continue.\n  I must say that I am outraged by the lack of funding for RECA. If \nSocial Security recipients suddenly did not receive their checks, can \nyou imagine the outcry that would fall on the Congress? A government \nIOU is a second injustice for families who have already suffered once \ntoo much.\n  The fact of the matter is that funding for RECA must be permanently \nappropriated. Otherwise, we continue to run the risk of annual \nappropriation shortfalls during the appropriations process.\n  Because the trust fund is depleted, RECA claimants are now receiving \n``IOU'' letters from the Federal Government in lieu of a check. I am \ninformed by the Justice Department, which oversees the RECA program, \nthat approximately 180 claims cannot be paid because the trust fund is \ndepleted. Morever, I understand this number is likely to increase to as \nmany as 2,000 claims.\n  This situation is simply unacceptable. I have met with RECA claimants \nin my state. It does not take long to see the pain and suffering they \nhave endured over the years. Pain and suffering, I might add, that has \ntaken a toll not only on their lives but on the lives of their \nfamilies, as well.\n  Most of these individuals are now retired; they live on modest \nincomes, and fear their declining health will only exacerbate their \nlimited family finances.\n  Many of these individuals have already died as a result of their \ninjuries sustained while working for the government's nuclear \nproduction program. They have paid the highest price for service to \ntheir country--their lives.\n  I recently received a copy of a letter from one of my constituents, \nMiss Rita Torres, who wrote to President Bush regarding her father, Mr. \nJose O. Torres, who suffered from cancer as a result of working in a \nuranium mine.\n  Mr. Torres was diagnosed with lung cancer two years ago. It \nmetastasized to his liver. He had to use oxygen constantly because part \nof one of his lungs had been removed.\n  Seven months ago Mr. Torres received a letter from the Department of \nJustice informing him he had been approved for compensation under the \nRECA program.\n  According to Mr. Torres, ``When I received my approval, it was a \nhappy day. I have exhausted all my means and have been waiting for some \nrelief from my government since the approval letter arrived seven \nmonths ago. Once I was a strong man, glad to work hard all day long. \nBut I am no match for the pain, it has brought me to tears, it has \nbrought my wife to tears as she struggles to make me comfortable, it \nhas brought my children to tears to see their parents suffer so. I have \nno access to money. I have no influential friends. I am a simple person \nwho has understood that when you gave your word, it meant something. \nBut all the promises to the people have been forgotten. To be near the \nend [of my life] with no relief from the government has saddened me \nvery much.''\n  Mr. Torres never received his check from the federal government. He \nreceived an IOU instead.\n  Several weeks ago, on March 21 at 2:30 p.m., Mr. Jose Torres passed \naway. He was 73.\n  We cannot forget these brave Americans. When Congress passed the \noriginal RECA legislation in 1990 and the subsequent RECA 2000 \namendments last year, we made a promise to them.\n  Mr. Torres, like thousands of other individuals in the 1940s, 50s and \n60s, worked in some of the most horrendous conditions imaginable all \nthe while not knowing that they were exposed to dangerous levels of \nradiation.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will provide for a permanent, \nindefinite appropriation to the RECA Trust Fund. Both the President's \nbudget and the budget resolution contain a provision proposing to fund \nRECA on a permanent basis.\n  The bill we are introducing today provides the necessary authority \nfor Congress to follow-through and appropriate a full and permanent \nallocation to the trust fund.\n  Let me also take a moment to comment briefly about another key \nprovision in the bill which I believe deals with a matter of fairness \nfor the RECA community.\n  The legislation we are introducing today ensures that all individuals \nexposed to radiation as a result of the government's nuclear weapons \nproduction program are accorded the same level of benefits.\n  Last fall, Congress passed the Department of Defense Authorization \nAct of 2000, P.L. 106-398, creating a new ``Energy Employees \nOccupational Illness Compensation Program.'' This new program, which I \nsupported, establishes a compensation fund for Department of Energy, \nDOE, employees and contract employees who were injured due to exposure \nto radioactive materials while working at DOE nuclear facilities and \nweapons testing sites.\n  Under the Energy program, individuals whose claims are approved will \nreceive a monetary amount of $150,000 plus prospective medical \nbenefits. These benefits are considerably more generous than those \nprovided under RECA.\n  During the DOD conference last fall, Senator Domenici and I worked to \nprovide an increase in benefits for the RECA claimants to provide them \nwith an additional $50,000 plus prospective medical benefits.\n  It seems blatantly unfair for the federal government to provide a \nricher level of benefits to its own employees than for innocent \ncivilians who happened to live downwind from a test site, or who worked \nin one of the mining operations.\n  Although the final agreement did extend additional benefits to the \nRECA workers, the conferees decided not to include the downwinders or \non site participants.\n  The bill we are introducing today corrects this injustice and ensures \nthat all individuals exposed to radioactive materials, as part of the \ngovernment's program, are treated the same with respect to the level of \nbenefits provided.\n  The third and final key provision of this legislation provides \nnecessary technical changes to the 2000 Act which, essentially, were \nrecommended by the Department of Justice. The 2000 Act inadvertently \neliminated some claimants previously eligible for compensation, and \nmade it more difficult for other claimants to prove eligibility.\n  For example, in amending the list of downwinder areas, RECA 2000 \ninadvertently eliminated individuals in a portion of Mohave County in \nArizona who were previously eligible under the original RECA program. \nAs a consequence, claimants who reside in this portion of Mohave County \nare no longer eligible for compensation. The technical amendment would \nagain include this area in the definition of downwinder areas.\n  The proposed legislation we are introducing today will also improve \nthe efficiency of the RECA program. Moreover, this bill will ensure \nfairness in the administration of RECA.\n  I am particularly mindful of concerns regarding the inclusion of \nadditional cancers or counties to be included in the Act as well as the \nstandards for length of radiation exposure necessary to qualify for the \nprogram. I know there has been some confusion over the length of \nradiation exposure requirements for certain cancers.\n  In this regard, I have included in the bill Section 5 which \nspecifically directs the National Research Council to report to \nCongress annually with recommendations to include additional cancers, \nor counties, in the program. Moreover, the NRC is directed to examine \nwhether the requirements for exposure to radiation should be reduced. \nThis section will provide Congress the needed epidemiological data to \nassist us in resolving these issues.\n  It is critical that Congress pass this legislation as soon as \npossible. And, to that end, I intend to schedule this bill for an \nexecutive business meeting in the Judiciary Committee as soon as \npossible.\n  This bill has strong bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this measure so that the Federal Government can keep its \ncommitment to those eligible claimants for whom RECA was enacted.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 898\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S5014]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today, with Senator Hatch, to \nintroduce the Radiation Exposure Compensation Technical Amendments and \nRefinement Act. These technical amendments are needed because the RECA \namendments we passed in 2000 inadvertently eliminated some claimants \npreviously eligible for compensation and made it more difficult for \nother claimants to prove eligibility.\n  These technical amendments are very important, but perhaps more \nimportantly this bill provides mandatory funding for the now-bankrupt \nRECA Trust Fund. For over a year now, eligible claimants have been \nreceiving nothing more than a five-line IOU from the Justice \nDepartment. This is an injustice I never imagined when I authored the \nRadiation Exposure Compensation Act in 1990--an injustice that can and \nmust be rectified through this bill.\n  RECA was designed to compensate our nation's uranium mine workers who \nbecame afflicted with debilitating and too often deadly radiation-\nrelated diseases. These men helped build our nuclear arsenal--the \narsenal that is, at least in part, responsible for ending the\n\n[[Page S5015]]\n\ncold war. We must not let their sacrifice go unanswered.\n  These miners and their families lived under tough conditions. Some \nlived in one-room houses located as close as 200 feet from the mine \nshafts. Their children played near the mines and their families drank \nunderground water that exposed them to radiation. These miners faced \nlong, uncomfortable days many feet underground.\n  Many of those uranium miners from New Mexico who endured these \nconditions were Native Americans from the Najavo Nation. To this group \nof victims, our government owes a special duty of care based on a \nlongstanding trust relationship formed by treaties and agreements.\n  Mr. President, the Najavos and all the uranium miners performed a \nspecial service for our nation, and our nation owes them a special \nobligation. An obligation that it has twice failed to keep.\n  Strike one: The government had adequate warning about the radiation \nhazards of uranium mining, and yet federal mine safety standards were \nnot fully implemented until 1971. Thus, prior to 1971, the miners were \nsent into inadequately ventilated mines with virtually no warning \nregarding the dangers of radiation.\n  Strike two: The government has failed to keep the program fully \nfunded. Frankly, this is unconscionable. Those who helped protect our \nnation's security must be compensated for their suffering. Anything \nless is unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, our legislation today would ensure that the government \ndoes not strike out. These men served our nation well, and it is time \nfor this nation to serve them well.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Allen):\n  S. 899. A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of 1968 to increase the amount paid to families of public safety \nofficers killed in the line of duty; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Frances \nCollender Public Safety Officers' Benefit Improvement Act of the year \n2001.\n  At around 6 a.m. on February 6 of this year, Corporal Frances \nCollender of the Delaware State Police pulled her cruiser behind a van \nthat had been disabled by an accident on Route 1 in Odessa, DE. \nTragically, Corporal Collender was struck and killed by another driver \njust as she was assisting the disabled motorist. There was a little bit \nof snow on the ground.\n  Corporal Collender was not only a beloved mother and daughter, she \nwas also beloved by her entire troop and by the State Police. This was \na woman who, after having started another career, went back and decided \nto become a public safety officer and joined the elite of the Delaware \nState Police. She was sort of the mother figure of these folks who were \na lot younger than she. She was a leader. She was a corporal, but in \nmany ways she was the captain. She was the one to whom everybody \nlooked.\n  Everything and anything that was good that was being sponsored by \npolice organizations in our State--she was not atypical in that sense--\nshe was involved in. She was always one who not only refused to shirk \nher duty but took on additional responsibilities.\n  She did not have to respond to this call. She was about to get off, \nbut she responded--it was typical of her--to keep someone else from \nhaving to come out. She was ``nearby,'' so she responded. And she has \npassed away. She volunteered, as she always did, and, in doing so, \nmaybe saved somebody else's life but lost her own.\n  This week, with thousands of law enforcement officers, survivors, and \nfamily members gathered in the Nation's Capital for National Police \nWeek, we listened to the President of the United States, as we have \nother Presidents. We listened as the rollcall was called of all fallen \nofficers nationwide in the calendar year 2000. Until you attend an \nevent such as this, as I am sure my colleagues have, it doesn't--how \ncan I say this?--it doesn't sink in, just how incredible these officers \nare, just what incredible chances they take for us, and just how many \nlose their life in doing so.\n  Corporal Collender had two beautiful daughters, one of whom has \nbecome my buddy. She is 17 years old; she is smart; she is beautiful; \nshe is engaged. She lives with her grandmom and grandpop who, if you \nknew them--especially grandmom--you would understand, without knowing \nCorporal Collender, that she is everything I said she is.\n  It seems to me we have to do more than pay our respects once a year \nto these families for the sacrifices they have made on our behalf. I \nwas involved with a group, years ago, that decided although it is \ntechnically not a Federal responsibility, we should provide a death \nbenefit to fallen and slain officers. What I am suggesting today is \nthat a death benefit is not sufficient. It was set years ago. Although \nit has increased with inflation, it is below what I think is a \nrealistic need of the average first responder's salary.\n  This will cover first responders including firefighters. If you think \nabout it, there are very few people in law enforcement--none goes into \nit because they think they are going to make a lot of money, and very \nfew in law enforcement come from families who have trusts or endowments \nor inheritances that are left. They are working-class people, almost \nall these days college educated. But they make a decision because of \ntheir sense of duty, their sense of honor, and their sense of just \nwanting to take on difficult tasks. When they die, their families are \nleft in a very difficult circumstance.\n\n  I need not tell anyone in here that a $150,000 death benefit--which \nis what the original death benefit is up to now because of inflation--\nis insufficient. It is not going to pay even for the college costs of \none of Corporal Collender's daughters, if she goes to a private \ninstitution, by the time they get there. It will not even pay for the \ncollege costs of her younger daughter if she goes to my alma mater, the \nState University of Delaware.\n  So I think it is time, particularly in this period of incredible \nsurplus we are talking about, when we can decide that the inheritance \ntax should be eliminated for billionaires, when we decide we are going \nto give hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax breaks to people who \nmake over a million bucks and up, that we ought to be able to, for the \nrelative handful, thank God--we are talking hundreds now, not talking \nthousands--we ought to be able to raise the death benefit for those who \ngive their lives to make us safer.\n  Since 1972 with the shooting of a New York deputy sheriff, over \n15,000 public safety officers have been killed in the line of duty; 30 \nofficers from my State. Thirty from my little State have paid the \nultimate price, with Corporal Collender being the most recent loss. \nThis past Sunday, 313 names were added to the National Law Enforcement \nOfficers Memorial. Yesterday, as I said, families paid tribute to those \nfallen officers by laying a wreath at the National Peace Officers \nMemorial Service. I was there. The President paid tribute to Corporal \nCollender and her family and to the families of all officers who were \nlost.\n  There are too many--there are too many--line-of-duty deaths each \nyear, and for too long our response to their families just hasn't been \nenough.\n  The Justice Department runs the Public Safety Officers' Benefits \nprogram, an initiative begun 25 years ago to make one-time payments to \nassist public safety officers and their families when they become \ndisabled, or lose their lives, in the line of duty.\n  For the first 12 years of its existence the Public Safety Officers' \nBenefits Program issued $50,000 payments to qualifying officers and \ntheir families.\n  In 1988, we recognized this figure was inadequate both to express the \ngratitude of a grateful nation and to try to put these families on \nsound financial footing. So 13 years ago we raised the payment to \n$100,000 and indexed it for inflation. This year the program began at \n$151,000.\n  Last year, 181 claims were paid, and the Public Safety Offices' \nBenefits program has successfully helped disabled officers, their \nfamilies, and the families of those officers killed in the line of duty \nput their lives back together.\n  It is time to take another look at the Public Safety Officers' \nBenefits program. Recently, the other body approved legislation that \nwould increase to $250,000 the maximum death benefits for families of \nmilitary personnel killed in the line of duty. We should do the same \nthing for the families of slain\n\n[[Page S5016]]\n\npublic safety officers, including firefighters.\n  So today I am introducing the Frances Collender Public Safety \nOfficers' Benefits Improvement Act, legislation that will increase the \npayment under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program from \n$100,000 to $250,000. Payments will continue to be indexed for \ninflation. We have not adjusted the payment under this program for \nalmost 15 years, and the families of those who have paid the ultimate \nprice deserve some more help than they are getting.\n  I have raised this issue with my good friend and chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Hatch. He has indicated he may very well \nwant to join as an original cosponsor of the bill. I have not been able \nto get in touch with him this morning, so I have not added his name. \nThe reason I am introducing the bill now is because the afternoon will \nget so busy and I may not have an opportunity to speak to the \nintroduction of this legislation. If my friend from Utah decides to \njoin me on this bill, as I hope he will, I am prepared to rename this \nact in the name of both Frances Collender and a slain Utah police \nofficer that my friend from Utah would like to add to this legislation. \nI would be happy to do that if he decides and wishes to join me.\n  During Police Week, while the Collenders and other heroic families of \npublic safety officers are in Washington to pay tribute, let's show our \ngratitude as well, beyond our sympathy. Washington can pay tribute. \nThey can pay tribute by us voting and agreeing to increase this death \nbenefit. It is the least Congress can do to express our gratitude to \nthe peace officers for all they have done. If we cannot afford it now, \nwe can never afford it. I do not see how we can afford not to do this \nfor the public safety officers of this Nation.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the family of Frances Collender for their \nbravery because it is sometimes much harder to be in the waiting room \nthan the operating room. Sometimes it is much harder to be at the grave \nsite than being the one buried, I suspect. They have shown great class. \nThey have shown great resolve. And the one thing all of us who deal \nwith law enforcement and firefighters know, they never forget their \nown. Although those two beautiful young girls of Frances Collender do \nnot have their mother, they have inherited, for as long as they live, \nthe entire police force of the State of Delaware, who, for real--it is \nnot hyperbole--will be there for them, whether they ever knew their \nmother or not, until the day they die. It is part of the tradition, it \nis part of the honor, and it is part of our responsibility as well.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from Delaware, the people of Nevada \nand people all over the country should be grateful to the Senator from \nDelaware, as they are any time they realize there are fewer slain \npolice officers as a result of the work done by the Senator from \nDelaware in giving us the COPS Program, putting tens of thousands of \nnew police officers all over America on the streets, so there are fewer \nslain police officers, so there is less crime.\n  I, of course, did not know Frances Collender. The Senator, from \nDelaware as usual, is very articulate in explaining the importance of \nthis woman to the State of Delaware. But as important as she is to the \nState of Delaware, the Senator from Delaware is important to the \ncountry for the work he has done. In Nevada, it has made a difference. \nHaving additional police officers on the street has been a big benefit. \nWe have less crime in Nevada and around the country. Statistics, by any \nway you look at them, have proven that.\n  So on behalf of the people in Nevada, and on behalf of the people of \nthis country, I extend our appreciation to the Senator from Delaware \nfor his undying efforts to make sure we have more police officers on \nthe streets. Without the Senator from Delaware, it would not have \nhappened.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. As usual, he is \ngenerous and gracious. He is, as everyone on both sides knows, one of \nthe most gracious men who serves in this body. He is a gentleman with a \nbackbone like a ramrod. I take his comments to heart because I believe \nhe means them. It means a lot to me that he does.\n  There are few things I have done in my 28-year career in the Senate \nthat I believe has been more worthwhile, and that I am more proud of, \nthan working with the law enforcement agencies of this country, getting \nthem from 500,000 to over 600,000 in local law enforcement agencies.\n  I appreciate the sentiments expressed by my friend. I add, he was \nthere every step of the way, voting for it, adding amendments, pushing \nit. I know he will be with me as we try to, quite frankly, prevent the \nPresident of the United States from eliminating that program. I am sure \nthe President cares deeply about the safety of law enforcement officers \nin the country. I hope we can get his attention, to convince him that \ncutting the COPS Program in this upcoming budget is a mistake. I think \nonce he focuses on that, we have a shot of doing that.\n  But, again, I thank my friend from Nevada. He is a real gentleman and \na good friend. And I thank the Presiding Officer for listening. One of \nthe things--I should not say this--I like best about the present \noccupant of the chair is, whenever I stand to speak in this Chamber--I \nam sure he does it for everybody--he looks and listens and acts as if \nhe is paying attention, and it makes a big difference. He is not \nsigning his mail. I know I am not supposed to say that, but I am going \nto say it anyway because I appreciate his courtesy, speaking of a \ngentleman.\n  I thank you all and yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 901. A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to \ndirect the Secretary of the Interior to cease mineral leasing activity \non the outer Continental Shelf seaward of a coastal State that has \ndeclared a moratorium on mineral exploration, development, or \nproduction activity in State water; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Coastal States \nProtection Act, which is intended to protect our Nation's fragile \ncoastlines from the detrimental environmental impacts of offshore oil \nand gas development. Chronic leakage associated with normal oil and gas \noperations, as well as catastrophic spills such as the horrific Santa \nBarbara spill in 1969, irreparably contaminate the ocean floor, \ntidelands, and beaches.\n  In California, there is strong and enduring public support for the \nprotection of our oceans and coastlines. My State decided that the \npotential benefits that might be derived from future offshore oil and \ngas development were not worth the risk of destroying our priceless \ncoastal treasures. To ensure that our beaches remain pristine and our \nwaters clear, California passed legislation permanently prohibiting oil \nand gas exploration in State waters. Unfortunately, the State only has \njurisdiction over the territory that extends three nautical miles out \nfrom shore.\n  Federal waters off the coast of California, which extend beyond State \nwaters to 200 nautical miles out, have received several forms of \ntemporary protection from additional offshore oil and gas development. \nSince 1982, Congress has approved successive 1-year leasing and \ndrilling moratoria that have provided protection for U.S. waters. In \n1998, President Clinton issued a 10-year ban on Outer Continental Shelf \nactivity off the coast of California. We now face, however, mounting \npressures to explore new sources of domestic oil and gas.\n  My bill provides permanent protection by ensuring that no mineral \nleasing can occur on the Outer Continental Shelf in Federal waters \nwhere the State has placed a moratorium on mineral exploration, \ndevelopment, or production activity in adjacent States waters. Thus, \nthis bill guarantees that the wishes of a State are reflected in the \nmanagement decisions made regarding associated Federal waters.\n  This legislation is similar to bills I introduced in the 104th, \n105th, and 106th Congress. Several officials in the new administration \nhave expressed strong support for State and local decision-making, so I \nam hopeful that they will join me in supporting this legislation.\n  This bill will make an important and lasting contribution to the \nprotection of our Nation's coastlines.\n\n[[Page S5017]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. \n        Smith of New Hampshire):\n  S. 902. A bill to amend section 1951 of title 18, United States Code \n(commonly known as the Hobbs Act), and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nclose a long-standing loophole in our Nation's labor laws, and help \nstop union violence in America. The bill would make clear that violence \nconducted in the course of a strike is illegal under the Federal \nextortion law, the Hobbs Act. I am pleased to have Chairman Hatch and \nothers join me in introducing this important measure.\n  Violence has no place in our society. As I have said many times \nbefore, I would, if it were in my power to do so, put an absolute stop \nto the disruption of commerce in this country by intimidation and \nviolence, whatever its source.\n  Unfortunately, corrupt union officials have often been the source of \nsuch violence. Encouraged by their special Federal exemption from \nprosecution, corrupt union officials have routinely used intimidation \nand violence over the years to achieve their goals. Since 1975, the \nInstitute for Labor Relations Research has documented over 9,000 \nreported incidents of union violence in America. A major study entitled \n``Union Violence: The Record and the Response by Courts, Legislatures, \nand the NLRB,'' which was updated and republished in 1999 by the John \nM. Olin Institute at George Mason University, discusses the problem and \ntrends in union violence in detail. This updated study shows that while \nunion membership and the total number of strikes has decreased in \nrecent decades, the number of reported incidents of violence per strike \nhas actually increased. It is clear that union violence remains a \nserious issue facing our Nation today.\n  Let me make clear that I agree that the Federal Government should not \nget involved in minor, isolated physical altercations and vandalism \nthat are bound to occur during a labor dispute when emotions are \ncharged. Action such as this is not significant to commerce. However, \nwhen union violence moves beyond this and becomes a pattern of \ncoordinated violent activity, the Federal Government should be \nempowered to act. State and local governments sometimes fail to provide \nan effective remedy, whether because of a lack of will, a lack of \nresources, or an inability to focus on the interstate nature of the \nconduct. It is during these times that Federal involvement is needed.\n\n  Let me also note that this legislation has never been an effort to \ninvolve the Federal Government in a matter that traditionally has been \nreserved for the states. Labor relations are regulated on a national \nbasis, and labor management policies are national policies. There is no \nreason to keep the Federal Government out of serious labor violence \nthat is intended to achieve labor objectives.\n  Indeed, the Congress intended for the Hobbs Act to apply to the \nconduct we are addressing in this legislation today. The decision to \nkeep the Federal Government out was not made by the Congress. Rather, \nit was made by the Supreme Court in the United States versus Enmons \ndecision in 1973, when the Supreme Court found that the Hobbs Act did \nnot apply to a lawful strike, as long as the purpose of the strike was \nto achieve ``legitimate labor objectives,'' such as higher wages. Such \nan exception does not exist in the words of the statute. The Court \ncould only create this loophole through a strained interpretation of \nthe law. In his dissent, Justice Douglas aptly criticized the majority \nfor, ``achieving by interpretation what those who were opposed to the \nHobbs Act were unable to get Congress to do.''\n  The Enmons decision is an unfortunate example of judicial activism, \nof a court interpreting a statute to reach the policy result the court \nfavors rather than the one the legislature intended. This is a problem \nthat has concerned many of us in the Senate for many years. We have \nheld numerous hearings on this matter in the Judiciary Committee since \nthe Enmons decision. We must continue to focus on this serious problem \nuntil it is solved.\n  It is time we closed the loophole on union violence in America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 902\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Cache La Poudre River Corridor Act to \nmake technical amendments; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Cache La Poudre \nRiver Corridor Technical Amendments Act of 2001.\n  When former Senator Hank Brown and I decided to sponsor the Cache La \nPoudre River Corridor Act, Public Law 104-323, it was only after we \nheld numerous meetings with the affected individuals, groups and \ngovernmental entities to determine how best to protect the area. The \nresult was a delicate compromise bill to which all parties agreed.\n\n[[Page S5018]]\n\n  The purpose of the Act was to designate the Cache La Poudre Corridor \nwithin the Cache La Poudre River Basin for special use. It is to \nprovide for an educational and inspirational benefit to both present \nand future generations, as well as provide unique and significant \ncontributions to our national heritage of cultural and historical \nlands, waterways, and structures within the Corridor.\n  The Act also established the Cache La Poudre Corridor Commission to \nconsult with public officials and conduct public hearings on how to \nadminister the corridor consistent with the purpose of the Act. The \nmake-up of the Commission was to represent the affected counties and \ninterested parties.\n  However, due to drafting errors and conflicting interpretations of \nthe appointment process for the Commission, local communities and the \nDepartment of the Interior have been unable to proceed with \nimplementing the Act.\n  To correct these errors, my colleague Congressman Bob Schaffer and I \nare introducing the Cache La Poudre River Corridor Technical Amendments \nAct of 2001. These changes will allow the Cache La Poudre River \nCorridor Act to be fully implemented.\n  These corrections will address several non-controversial provisions \nof the original law, which include correcting references to affected \ncounties and clarifying duties of the commission. I hope that Congress \nwill move quicky and act on the Cache La Poudre River Technical \nCorrections Amendments Act.\n  I thank my colleagues for their consideration of this matter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Warner, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n        Cochran, Mr. Allen, and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 904. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan above-the-line deduction for qualified professional development \nexpenses of elementary and secondary school teachers and to allow a \ncredit against income tax to elementary and secondary school teachers \nwho provide classroom materials; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, just last week, on May 8, 2001, the Senate \noverwhelmingly passed an amendment that I offered to the education bill \ncurrently on the floor. This amendment, which passed by a vote of 95-3, \nstated:\n\n       The Senate should pass legislation providing elementary and \n     secondary level educators with additional tax relief in \n     recognition of the many out of pocket, unreimbursed expenses \n     educators incur to improve the education of our Nation's \n     students.\n\n  At that time, both Senator Collins and I were pursuing the same goal, \nobtaining much needed tax relief for our teachers. However, despite \nsharing the same goal, we each had our own bill and each had our own \napproach towards achieving this shared goal.\n  Senator Collins has truly been a leader on this issue. I commend her \nfor her work in highlighting this issue and for her tireless efforts to \nimprove education in this country.\n  I am so glad that Senator Collins and I had the opportunity to sit \ndown and discuss teacher tax relief legislation in greater detail. As a \nresult of these discussions, we have joined forces and agreed on an \napproach to achieve our shared goal.\n  Today, I am honored to be joining Senator Collins in introducing the \nTeacher Tax Relief Act.\n  This Collins/Warner bill is cosponsored by Senators Landrieu, \nCochran, and Allen. We will be offering this bill as an amendment to \nthe tax reconciliation bill that will be on the Senate floor tomorrow.\n  The Collins/Warner Teacher Tax Relief Act has two components.\n  First, the legislation provides a $250 tax credit to teachers for \nclassroom supplies. This credit recognizes that our teachers dip into \ntheir own pocket in significant amounts to bring supplies into the \nclassroom to better the education of our children.\n  Second, this legislation provides a $500 above the line deduction for \nprofessional development costs that teachers incur. This deduction will \nparticularly help low-income school districts that typically do not \nhave the finances to pay for professional development costs for their \nteaches.\n  Our teachers in this country are overworked, underpaid, and all too \noften, under-appreciated. In addition, they spend significant money out \nof their own pocket to better the education of our children.\n  These out of pocket costs place lasting financial burdens on our \nteachers. This is one reason our teachers are leaving the profession. \nLittle wonder that our country is in the midst of a teacher shortage.\n  While the primary responsibility rests with the states, I believe the \nFederal Government can and should play a role in helping to alleviate \nthe nation's teaching shortage.\n  On a Federal level, we can encourage individuals to enter the \nteaching profession and remain in the teaching profession by providing \ntax relief to teachers for the costs that they incur as part of the \nprofession. This incentive will help financially strapped urban and \nrural school systems as they recruit new teachers and struggle to keep \nthose teachers that are currently in the system.\n  Our teachers have made a personal commitment to educate the next \ngeneration and to strengthen America. While many people spend their \nlives building careers, our teachers spend their careers building \nlives.\n  The Teacher Tax Relief Act goes a long way towards providing our \nteachers with the recognition they deserve by providing teachers with \nimportant and much needed tax relief.\n  It is important to note that providing a specific profession with tax \nrelief is not without precedent. Title 26, United States Code, Section \n62(a) allows an above the line deduction to performing artists in \nconnection with their performances.\n  I believe teachers in this country deserve similar treatment under \nthe tax code. I look forward to a vote on the teacher Tax Relief Act in \nthe next few days.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise this evening, along with my good \nfriend, the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, to \nintroduce the Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2001. We are very pleased to be \njoined by the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Allen, \nand Senators Cochran and Landrieu, as original cosponsors of our \nlegislation. All of these Senators are strong advocates for education \nand for our Nation's teachers.\n  It would be difficult to script a more appropriate time for us to \nintroduce this important legislation. We stand now at the summit of an \neducation debate that began over 2 weeks ago. At the same time, we \nanticipate a major tax relief bill to which we will turn our attention \nas early as tomorrow.\n  Our bill is related to both. It is both sound education policy and \nsensible tax policy. We plan on offering it as an amendment to the tax \nbill as soon as feasible on the Senate floor.\n  For that reason, Senator Warner and I wanted to take advantage of \nthis time this evening to talk a little bit about our bill and the \nensuing amendment. In the midst of the education and tax debates, we \nare asking the Senate not to overlook the selfless efforts of our \nteachers and the many financial sacrifices they make to improve their \ninstructional skills and the classrooms where they teach. Senator \nWarner deserves tremendous credit for focusing our attention, through a \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment to the education bill, on the need to \nprovide tax relief for our Nation's teachers.\n  Our teachers serve such a critical role in the education and \ndevelopment of our children. In fact, study after study demonstrates \nthat other than involved parents, a high-quality, dedicated teacher is \nthe single most important prerequisite for student success.\n  The amendment which Senator Warner offered earlier this past week, \nand which I was proud to cosponsor, expressed the sense of the Senate \nthat Congress should pass legislation providing teachers with tax \nrelief in recognition of the many out-of-pocket expenses, unreimbursed \nexpenses they incur to improve the education of our children. The bill \nwe introduce today is legislation very similar to Senator Warner's \namendment which was adopted by the Senate by a vote of 95-3.\n  The bill we introduce today is targeted to support the expenditures \nof teachers who strive for excellence beyond the constraints of what \ntheir schools can provide.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Warner, Senator Hatch, and I each \nintroduced\n\n[[Page S5019]]\n\nour own version of our teacher tax relief bills. Last year Senator Kyl \nand I teamed up in a similar way. We have now all come together behind \nthe Teacher Tax Relief Act of 2001, which enjoys bipartisan support \nfrom our colleagues as well as the endorsement of the National \nEducation Association.\n  Our bill has two major provisions. First, it will allow teachers, \nteachers' aides, principals, and counselors to take an above-the-line \ndeduction for their professional development expenses. I have talked \nwith teachers in Maine who have financed continuing education courses \nat the master's and doctoral level as well as seminars out of their \npocket. They then came back to their schools and shared their knowledge \nwith their colleagues, and that additional course work has made them \nbetter teachers.\n  Some school districts reimburse for those kinds of professional \ndevelopment expenses. It would be great if they all did. But some \nschool districts simply don't have the resources to help teachers who \nare striving to improve their skills.\n\n  What our bill will do is help those teachers who are financing those \neducational expenses out of their own pockets by giving them an above-\nthe-line tax deduction.\n  The second provision of our bill will grant educators a tax credit of \nup to $250 for books, supplies, and equipment they purchase for their \nstudents. The tax credit would be set at 50 percent of such \nexpenditures so that teachers would receive 50 cents of tax relief for \nevery dollar of their own money they spend for supplies for their \nclassroom.\n  It is remarkable how much the average teacher spends every year out \nof his or her own pocket to buy supplies and other materials for their \nstudents. According to a study by the National Education Association, \nthe average public school teacher spends more than $400 annually on \nclassroom materials.\n  Just recently, I met with Idella Harter, president of the Maine \nEducation Association. She told me of the books, rewards for student \nbehavior, and other materials she routinely purchases for her \nclassroom. One year Idella decided to save her receipts to see how much \nshe actually was spending. She said she started adding up the receipts \nand was startled to discover they totaled over $1,000. When they got \nthat high, she decided to stop counting. But she continues to this day \nto purchase supplies and materials for her students.\n  When you think that the average teacher is not particularly well \npaid, it speaks volumes about their dedication that they are willing to \nmake that kind of investment to improve the teaching for their \nstudents.\n  Idella is not alone. Maureen Marshall, who handles education issues \nfor me in my office, taught public school for several years in Hawaii \nand Virginia. In her first year as a teacher, she, too, spent more than \n$1,000 of her own money on educational software, books, pocket charts \nto assist with language arts instruction, and other materials. Because \nof her tax situation, she could not deduct any of these expenses from \nher taxable income.\n  The ultimate beneficiaries of efforts to provide financial assistance \nto our teachers are our students. Our bill provides tax relief for up \nto $1,000 spent out of pocket by teachers for professional development \nand for supplies. These are teachers who are going the extra mile for \nour children, for our students.\n  Our bill makes it a priority to reimburse educators for just a small \npart of what they invest in our children's future.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us in support of this important \ninitiative. I hope they will join us in a resounding vote when Senator \nWarner and I offer this proposal as an amendment to the upcoming tax \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Mr. Reid, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 905. A bill to provide incentives for school construction, and for \nother purposes, to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation today \nwith my good friend and colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, to deal \nwith the issue of overcrowded and dilapidated schools. In March I \noffered an amendment in the Senate Finance Committee that was very \nsimilar to the legislation that we are introducing today. I am sorry \nthat the amendment failed on a 10-10 vote in the Committee, but I am \nhopeful that we can come together to find a way to pass school \nconstruction legislation during this Congress.\n  The need for school construction assistance is great. Three-quarters \nof the public schools are in need of repairs, renovation, or \nmodernization. More than one-third of schools rely on portable \nclassrooms, such as trailers, many of which lack heat or air \nconditioning. Twenty percent of public schools report unsafe \nconditions, such as failing fire alarms or electric problems.\n  At the same time the schools are getting older, the number of \nstudents is growing, up nine percent since 1990. The Department of \nEducation estimates that 2,400 new schools will be needed by 2003 and \npublic elementary and secondary enrollment is expected to increase \nanother million between 1999 and 2006, reaching an all-time high of \n44.4 million and increasing demand on schools.\n  It's increasingly difficult to have meaningful reform in schools that \nare falling apart at the seams. Research does show that student and \nteacher achievement lags in shabby school buildings, those with no \nscience labs, inadequate ventilation, and faulty heating systems. Older \nschools are also less likely to be connected to the Internet than \nrecently built or renovated schools. Facilities are vital to \nimplementation of research-based school reform efforts. We know, for \nexample, that students learn more effectively in small classes, but \nschool districts cannot create smaller classes or hire more teachers \nunless there is a place to put them.\n  Many schools are trying to offer more robust curricula, including \nmusic, physical education and classes in the arts, but their ability to \nprovide these programs is hampered if there is no space to house them.\n  Almost every State in the Nation has implemented curriculum \nstandards, calling for advanced work in science and technologies, but \nsome schools are so old that their electrical wiring cannot support \nenough computers for the students and their science facilities are so \nantiquated that students cannot perform the experiments required to \nlearn the state's curriculum.\n  Some school districts are looking to implement universal preschool, a \nservice that we know enhances children's school preparedness and which \na study published in last week's Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation confirmed makes children more likely to complete high \nschool, less likely to need special education or grade retention \nservices while in school, and more likely to avoid arrest as young \nadults, but the lack of available facilities is often prohibitive. If \nwe are serious about encouraging research-based, meaningful, effective \neducation reforms, and if we are serious about doing our part to help \nlocal districts run safe schools, a commensurate investment in school \nfacilities is imperative.\n  The America's Better Classroom Act, is similar to legislation \nintroduced in the House by Congressman Rangel and Congresswoman Johnson \nthat has 158 cosponsors. Our legislation allows the Federal government \nto issue $24.8 billion in school modernization bonds through a formula-\nbased allocation to states and through expansion of the Qualified Zone \nAcademy Bond, QZAB, program. The bill also includes a $200 million set-\naside for Bureau of Indian Affairs schools for two years to help school \nreplacement projects at schools funded or run by the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs.\n  Our bill would allocate 60 percent of $22 billion in bonds to states \nbased on school-aged population. The remaining 40 percent of the bond \nrevenue would be directly allocated to the 125 school districts with \nthe largest number of low-income students based on ESEA Title I \nfunding.\n  States and local school districts are investing in school \nconstruction, but it is clear that they still need our help. Annual \nconstruction expenditures for elementary and secondary schools have \nbeen growing. But local and state budgets have not been able to keep up \nwith demand for new schools and the repair of aging ones. Unless school \nleaders can\n\n[[Page S5020]]\n\npersuade their wary voters to pass such bond referendums or raise local \ntaxes, though, there's often little hope of change. Until the last few \nyears, the plight of state and local leaders had not received much \nattention from Washington. Last year we came together to respond to \ntheir call by funding a $1.2 billion grant program and this year we \nshould come together again and pass legislation that continues our \ncommitment to help local districts with their repair and renovation \nneeds.\n  It is a tragedy that so many of our Nation's students attend schools \nin crumbling and unsafe facilities. According to the American Institute \nof Architects, one in every three public schools in America needs major \nrepair. The American Society of Civil Engineers found school facilities \nto be in worse condition than any other part of our nation's \ninfrastructure.\n  The problem is particularly acute in some high-poverty schools, where \ninadequate roofs, electrical systems, and plumbing place students and \nschool employees at risk. Last month I visited the Westford Public \nSchool District in Massachusetts. School facilities were a big concern \nfor this semi-rural town which has seen its student population sky \nrocket in recent years, but has not experienced comparable property tax \nrevenues. In order to meet the fiscal demands of new school \nconstruction, the town is foregoing replacement of large, drafty \nwindows from the early 1950s and is relying on pre-fab trailers to \nserve as an elementary school.\n  The Wilson Middle School in Natick, MA was built for approximately \n500 students and currently houses 625. The school has no technical \ninfrastructure, it has no electrical wiring to allow the integration of \ncomputers in the classroom. The classrooms are 75 percent of the size \nof contemporary classrooms and were built with chairs and desks fixed \nto floor. Classrooms like these make it near-impossible for teachers to \nuse modern-day teaching methods which rely heavily on student \ncollaboration and interaction. The school also lacks science \nlaboratories, making it impossible for students to do hands-on work and \nexperiments.\n  Natick High School, like many aging school buildings around the \nCommonwealth, needs to have its basic infrastructure updated: \nelectrical wiring, heating, plumbing and intercom systems are among the \nmany components of the school in need of modernization. Also, the \nscience labs are presently unable to meet the demands of updated state \ncurricula. Natick put in place a prototype lab, and saw remarkable \nchanges in students' interest and ability to experiment in science.\n  I am very pleased to be introducing this legislation today with \nSenator Harkin, and it is my sincere hope that we can come together \nagain on the issue of school construction and pass legislation that \naddresses this Nation's critical need for school repairs and \nrenovation, and that we can do it as a part of a broader package of \nhonest and tough reforms which focus, above all else, on the goal of \nempowering our schools to raise student achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/16/senate-section/article/S5020-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 90--DESIGNATING JUNE 3, 2001, AS ``NATIONAL CHILD'S \n                                 DAY''\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, \nMr. Brownback, Mr. Carper, Mr. Cleland, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Craig, Mr. \nCrapo, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Edwards, Mr. \nEnsign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \nHagel, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Johnson, \nMr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nLieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. McCain, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nNelson of Florida, Mr. Reid, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \nSchumer, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. \nStabenow, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \nWarner, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary\n\n                               S. Res. 90\n\n       Whereas June 3, 2001, the first Sunday of June, falls \n     between Mother's Day and Father's Day;\n       Whereas each child is unique, is a blessing, and holds a \n     distinct place in the family unit;\n       Whereas the people of the United States should celebrate \n     children as the most valuable asset of the United States;\n       Whereas the children represent the future, hope, and \n     inspiration of the United States;\n       Whereas the children of the United States should be allowed \n     to feel that their ideas and dreams will be respected because \n     adults in the United States take time to listen;\n       Whereas many children of the United States face crises of \n     grave proportions, especially as they enter adolescent years;\n       Whereas it is important for parents to spend time listening \n     to their children on a daily basis;\n       Whereas modern societal and economic demands often pull the \n     family apart;\n       Whereas, whenever practicable, it is important for both \n     parents to be involved in their child's life;\n       Whereas encouragement should be given to families to set \n     aside special time for all family members to engage together \n     in family activities;\n       Whereas adults in the United States should have an \n     opportunity to reminisce about their youth to recapture some \n     of the fresh insight, innocence, and dreams that they may \n     have lost through the years;\n       Whereas the designation of a day to commemorate the \n     children of the United States will provide an opportunity to \n     emphasize to children the importance of their developing an \n     ability to make the choices necessary to distance themselves \n     from impropriety and to contribute to their communities;\n       Whereas the people of the United States should emphasize to \n     children the importance of family life, education, and \n     spiritual qualities;\n       Whereas because children are the responsibility of all \n     people of the United States, everyone should celebrate \n     children, whose questions, laughter, and dreams are important \n     to the existence of the United States; and\n       Whereas the designation of a day to commemorate our \n     children will emphasize to the people of the United States \n     the importance of the role of the child within the family and \n     society: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 3, 2001, as ``National Child's Day''; \n     and\n       (2) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     on the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nthat designates June 3, 2001, as National Child's Day.\n  National Child's Day celebrates the children of this country, \nrecognizing them as one of our nation's most valuable resources, a \nresource that should be cherished and protected. Too often, we tell the \nworld that children are our future, and yet our actions do not always \nconvey our belief in the statement. Children are often made to feel \nthat their challenges, concerns, and ideas are not valid. National \nChild's Day shows the children of our country that we recognize the \nvalue of each of our children and the contributions they make to this \ngreat nation.\n  It is important therefore, that we establish a day of national \nadmiration. This simple, yet important, resolution will ensure that our \nchildren receive the message of love, support, and encouragement they \ndeserve.\n  Nearly 5 million children return to an empty home after school each \nweek while their parents work because most communities lack adequate \nafter-school programs. These children are more likely to engage in a \nhost of risky behaviors that threaten their future.\n  Many children face crisis of grave proportions. Sadly, over 5 million \nAmerican children go to bed hungry at night. There has been an increase \nin the number of children in or in need of foster care services. Our \nchildren deserve more, and we must make a commitment to reverse these \ntrends. When we fail to invest in our children, we fail to invest in \nour country.\n  National Child's Day focuses on children's accomplishments and \naddresses their needs. The establishment of a National Child's Day will \nencourage families to spend more quality time together and will \nhighlight the special importance of the child in the family unit.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in establishing June 3, 2001, as \nNational Child's Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/16/senate-section/article/S5020-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5020-S5021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 649.
