Mr. President, September 11, 2001, will forever be burned \ninto American history as a day of horror without precedent.\n  Our hearts and prayers are with survivors and families of those who \nwere murdered in New York City, the Pentagon, and in the hijacked \nairplanes.\n  Although still appalled by the damage, the United States is in the \nprocess of recovering from these attacks.\n  Fate has written many painful chapters in America's history. Each is \nsharply engraved into our collective memory. Most are battles and wars: \nGettysburg, Pearl Harbor, Iwo Jima, Pork Chop Hill. Others were acts of \nmadmen such as the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal building and \nthe slaying of our Presidents Lincoln, McKinley, and John F. Kennedy.\n  The magnitude of Tuesday's attack defies understanding. It is the \nscale of what happened that day that freezes the mind in horror. The \nwrenching sights of passenger planes deliberately flown into the \nlargest symbol of America's economic and military strength\n\n[[Page S9344]]\n\nwas an assault on how we think of ourselves, our Nation and our role in \nthe world and in history.\n  Vehicles of peaceful domestic travel were bent horrifically into \nmissiles of death shot into the heart of our economy--into all of our \nhearts. The blasts we watched in real-time and in slow-motion reruns in \nour collective mind's eye have buried splinters deep into our souls.\n  As shock gives way to action, recovery and the identification of \nthose responsible, we must remember this is not the first time the \nAmerican people have been tested. History has probed the limits of our \nstrength and patience many times, over many generations of Americans.\n  As the realization of what has happened continues to sink into our \nnational consciousness, we must never forget that each time our Nation \nis tested, each time we have survived--as we will again.\n  And while it seems impossible to believe today, barely days after \nthis horrific attack upon our soil, we must draw strength from the \nknowledge that each test has failed to diminish our Nation. Just the \nopposite. America's history is written by a people who rise to every \nchallenge, and history has shown we will prevail.\n  We are the greatest and most powerful nation today precisely because \nwe have met and triumphed over adversity. This is our national \nidentity. This is what it means to be an American. This is the strength \nof character that built this Nation over the last four centuries.\n  Americans do not face challenges. We surmount them. And we grow \nstronger as a result.\n  I am confident that we are already seeing this in the days after the \ndisaster. We see it in the faces of the New York firemen and police \nofficers, the dedicated men and women who fought to protect and recover \nand who have often lost their lives in that effort. A grim \ndetermination and smoldering pride etched in the ashes on their faces--\netched with sweat. And tears. And blood. We see it in the faces of our \nmilitary men and women still breathing life into our Nation's military \ncommand center at the Pentagon.\n  We see it in the commitment of the urban search and rescue teams and \nother public safety officers who have gone into New York City and into \nthe Pentagon to help. I am deeply honored and proud that my good \nfriends in the Missouri Task Force One, from the Columbia, MO, area, \nare there helping, and they want to help. Americans want to help. While \nthe terrorists hit their targets, caused death and damage, their real \naim of terrorism is to strike a crippling psychological blow. The \nterrorists will succeed only if we surrender our confidence in our \nNation. Americans cannot and will not allow them this victory.\n  Many people have asked me, what can we do? I hear that from \nMissourians all the time. First, obviously, is prayer, for those who \nhave been lost, for those who suffer, for the families and loved \nones. I ask also for prayers for individuals, for families, for \nguidance, that they may be strong, that this country may be strong, \nthat we may not be disabled by the threats of terrorism.\n\n  We must continue to be strong as Americans. There are things we can \ndo. Giving blood is one thing that is readily available. I ask all my \nconstituents to listen to their radios and televisions and contact the \nlocal blood donor stations.\n  I ask citizens not to panic. We have seen panic in the buying of \ngasoline with 30-car-long lines. Do not horde. Prices are going way up; \ndo not buy. Do not raise prices. Do not price gouge.\n  This country will be strong. We will have our economy back on track \nif we behave rationally and responsibly. Let us not be crippled by \npotential terrorism. Let us not put up barriers that are impossible to \novercome.\n  I have talked with people in the airline industry. Our airline \nindustry is suffering billions of dollars of losses. We must have a \nbetter airline security system. But let us be smart about it. Let us \nnot make it impossible to travel by airplane.\n  We are beginning the process of taking down the extraordinary \nsecurity items around this Capitol. This is the people's place of \nbusiness. We want people to be able to visit. Normally on Thursday \nmornings I have an open house for Missourians. They could not get here. \nI had a tough enough time getting here myself. We are going to go back \nto business in this Capitol. We need to go back to business as \nAmericans. We need to build the strength in our families. That will \nstrengthen our country.\n  I hope those considering scheduling sporting events will realize this \nis part of our national culture. These should go forward. I ask we not \nbe so terrorized by the terrorists that we forget what we do in this \ncountry and why we are strong.\n  I believe the President has indicated the war against terrorism will \nbe conducted with great vigor, with no terrorist, and no nation \nharboring them, safe. The President's hands ought not to be tied. So we \ncan ensure our Nation is never dealt a similar blow, we must give the \nPresident the authority, support him and give him the resources and \nprovide him the freedom to act, to preempt the acts of terrorism.\n  Tuesday's attacks have shaken us. But the bedrock beliefs and \nprinciples of the United States remain strong. We will show the \nterrorists.\n  Our immediate focus must be to recover from these attacks. And to \ntend to the victims and their families. We may not know the full toll \nfor many weeks.\n  In the longer run, we must recognize that these attacks demand an \nappropriate response from the United States.\n  I know the man who is the President of the United States. I know this \nman. And I am confident that he will throw the full weight of the U.S. \nGovernment behind the task of identifying and destroying those \nresponsible for the attacks. The President should also have the power \nto take appropriate steps to prevent a reoccurrence. And I know that he \nhas the support of both political parties in the U.S. Congress. And \nmore importantly, he has the full support of the American people.\n  Our Nation must not rest until those behind the attacks are \ndestroyed. Our unyielding anger will span the world and reach the \nterrorists wherever they may try to hide. The world is not big enough \nto offer them the concealment they seek. We will find them, we will get \nthem, and we will make them pay for what happened Tuesday.\n  Any nation that seeks to provide protection or cover for the \nterrorists ought to think twice before doing so. The President is \ncorrect to make no distinction between the terrorists and those nations \nthat shelter them. The price of doing so will be very high.\n  Let us be clear about what Tuesday's attack was--and what it was not. \nIt was an act of war, not a simple criminal act. I say it was not \nmerely a criminal act because of its scale. It was too large to be only \na criminal act. It was an act of war against our people, our way of \nlife, and against all people who cherish democracy and freedom.\n  I believe there has been an unfortunate trend in the American \nGovernment in recent years to ``criminalize'' acts that are by \ndefinition acts of war against this country. That trend has delayed our \npotential responses until the evidence collected approached the \nstandards required by a court of law. I believe that to have been a \nmistake.\n  The war against terrorism--and its war against us--is just that, war. \nAnd we ought to be free to respond in kind. Not only after that fact, \nbut I believe the President's hands ought not to be tied. To ensure our \nNation is never dealt a similar blow, we must give the President the \nauthority and freedom to act to preempt such acts. That is he must be \nable to strike terrorists before they strike.\n\n  For many years the prevailing trend has been to shackle our \nintelligence agencies--to err on the side of doing too little rather \nthan doing too much. I understand the forceful reasons behind this \ntrend. Nothing is more dear to us than the protection of our civil \nliberties. Our political culture at root is defined by our steadfast \nguardianship of our civil liberties.\n  I believe we can do more to attack terrorism without further \nencroaching upon our civil liberties. I believe we can strengthen the \nreach of our intelligence agencies significantly at no risk to our \ncivil liberties.\n  We know the incalculable cost of getting this balance wrong. In our \nunderstandable zeal to protect our civil liberties, we hampered the \nvery agencies\n\n[[Page S9345]]\n\nthat protect not only our lives but our very way of life.\n  America is a different nation today than it was Tuesday morning. We \nhave been attacked in a way without precedent, in kind and magnitude. \nOur Nation needs time to grieve, we need time to tend to our dead and \nto care for the wounded and their families.\n  Tuesday's attacks have shaken us. Yet the bedrock beliefs and \nprinciples that anchor the United States remain strong. Just how strong \nis something the terrorists will soon discover.\n  God bless the United States of America.\n  The ACTING PRESIDING pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, is recognized to speak for up to \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this is a very sad time \nfor America. The unthinkable has happened. What we always feared could \nhappen, but prayed never would happen, has happened.\n  I rise today to pay tribute to the men and women who lost their lives \nin this cowardly attack against the United States of America.\n  I, as so many others, am overcome by the magnitude of this horrific \nact, a cowardly act against innocent people. It is hard to understand \nwhat would motivate people to do such a thing. But now I think we \nunderstand our hearts must go out to the victims, to their families, \nand all who have suffered at the hands of this evil that struck this \ngreatest nation on Earth.\n  May God be with those who have passed and those who are suffering. \nWords, I know, are of little solace in a terrible tragedy such as this \nin dealing with the shock and pain. I know words may ring hollow \ncompared to the pain and disbelief that the families must be feeling. I \nwant those families to know we are as one nation under God. We are \nunited in our resolve, no matter who we are, to see justice done on \nbehalf of the lives lost so senselessly.\n  We must unite and comfort our fellow Americans in these difficult \ndays. Their grief is immeasurable and they need our support. They will \nhave it.\n  My State lost many citizens in this tragedy, including Thomas \nMcGuinness of Portsmouth who was the copilot of American Airlines \nFlight 11. I knew Tom personally. He was a fine man. His family and the \nfamilies of all those who have lost loved ones are devastated by this \ntragedy. They need our prayers.\n  I commend the efforts also of the brave men and women who are working \naround the clock, risking their own lives to rescue those still trapped \nin both the Pentagon and at the World Trade Center. We stand behind \nthem and pray for their success. As each hour goes by, we hope to see \nanother survivor and another family member united.\n  I also commend President Bush and Senators Daschle and Lott and the \nleadership in the House for returning to this city and getting back to \nbusiness, letting these people know we will not tolerate this \ninterruption in our system, and demonstrating we will not be cowed by \nthe actions of these despicable people.\n  The American people understand an act of war was committed against \nthe United States of America. Make no mistake about it, it was an act \nof war. You can say it is the Pearl Harbor of the new millennium, but \nit is far worse than Pearl Harbor. I might add, we responded to Pearl \nHarbor and we will respond to this. Make no mistake, the United States \nof America will respond to this heinous act with overwhelming force. We \nwill find those responsible and those who supported these evil acts. \nThey will be eradicated. This is not a question of bringing criminals \nto justice. This is an act of war, and it will be responded to as an \nact of war.\n  After we win--and win we will--we do have some serious questions we \nwill have to answer. What went wrong? Why didn't we have the \nintelligence assets we needed? How can we protect ourselves in the \nfuture without giving up the civil liberties we cherish so much? Where \nare our priorities? These are all important questions which need \nserious attention and honest answers.\n  We must never forget the magnitude of this loss and its effect on our \nway of life. September 11, 2001, will always be with us. Like December \n7, 1941, we will always remember where we were. In the past, we have \nnot decisively acted against some of these terrorist attacks and \nthreats. This will not stand any longer.\n\n  Some talk about multilateral efforts to combat terrorism; that is \nfine. I am here today to say to the American people we will act \nunilaterally, if necessary, to protect our people. We need to send a \nclear message to terrorists and those countries that harbor them that \nthere is no distinction, as the President has said, between the \nterrorists and the country that harbors them; we will decisively act \nagainst this cowardly aggression, and they will pay the full price for \nwhat they did.\n  As our President said, America will hunt down and punish those \nresponsible. President Bush will have my support and the support of \nevery American to do just that. We must be on the offensive against \nterrorists and those states and individuals who support them. The \npolicies of the past must change. We are at war, and this is a war that \nwe will win.\n  God bless America.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Arkansas is recognized to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, on Tuesday a series of terrorist attacks \non the United States shook our Nation and left thousands suffering or \ndead. Almost all of us in this Chamber have risen to express our \ncompassion. Almost everything has been said. But with such a tragic \nevent, each one of us feels compelled to tell our own story.\n  I rise today to offer my continued prayers and condolences to the \nvictims and their families. And I rise to add my voice to those \ncondemning the atrocities committed against the United States of \nAmerica Tuesday morning, September 11, 2001.\n  The four hijackings, and the deliberate terrorist attacks on the \nWorld Trade Center and the Pentagon, are an outrage against our nation \nand against human decency. I support the President in his pledge to \ndevote all of our country's resources to the task of determining who is \nresponsible for these acts and of holding them accountable.\n  In the days to come, we will need to reflect on Tuesday's events to \ndetermine what we will take from them and how we will respond.\n  To begin with, it appears certain that these attacks will force us to \nre-define our national defense priorities. According to many reports, \nthe hijackers of the airplanes were armed only with knives and \nboxcutters. This disturbing detail underscores the reality that the \ngreatest threats against our national security and our well-being may \nno longer be missiles or tanks or armies. The greatest threat is \nterrorists or rogue nations armed with simple weapons and a dangerous \nresolve.\n  It is time that we demonstrate the same resolve in preventing and, \nwhen necessary--as now--responding to acts of terror. We need to \nreconsider how our security apparatus, our intelligence network, and \nour channels of diplomacy can be strengthened and more effectively \nemployed to ensure that these attacks are never duplicated. Let us \nbegin a new dialogue about our national security that accounts for this \nchanged and changing reality. Let us devote all our resolve to tracking \ndown and destroying these agents of terror.\n  We need to recognize also that Tuesday's events must, by necessity, \ncall us out of our complacency. For too many years, our national \ncharacter has too often been focused inward.\n  Tuesday's tragedy should remind us of our duty to not only our \nfamilies and our immediate circles, but of our duty to our neighbors, \nour communities, and our nation.\n  Still, the reports that we have heard suggest that these terrible \nattacks have brought out much of the best in the American character--\nthe courage of the search and rescue team members, the commitment of \nour law enforcement officers, the generosity of those who have given \ntheir support to these efforts, and the sympathy and caring that all \nAmericans have extended to the suffering.\n  I am deeply disturbed, however, by some other reports that are coming \nto light. Arkansas newspapers reported Wednesday morning that rumors of \noil shortages have forced a run on gas stations in the American \nheartland, and that some station owners have raised\n\n[[Page S9346]]\n\nprices to exploit this fear. I am pleased that the Attorney General of \nArkansas, Mark Pryor, has pledged to investigate the actions of these \nprofiteers. Those who attempt to profit from these events should know \nthat their actions will not be tolerated and that, if necessary, they \nwill face prosecution for their actions. I ask my colleagues to join me \nin denouncing this sort of profiteering from tragedy.\n  Foremost in my mind is the human dimension of Tuesday's events. It \nwill likely be several days before we have a clear sense of how many \nlives were lost, but there is no doubt that the total will be in the \nthousands. Numbers of this magnitude will ensure that the effects of \nthese horrific acts will be felt by all Americans.\n  We now know that Sara Low, a native of Batesville, AK, and a flight \nattendant on American Airlines Flight 11, was killed when her plane \nstruck the World Trade Center. Sara was a 1991 graduate of Batesville \nHigh School and a graduate of the University of Arkansas. Our deepest \nsympathy and our prayers are with her parents, Mike and Bobbie Low, and \nher family and friends as they grapple with this horrible tragedy.\n  It is a horrible and saddening reminder of how the shock waves of \nthese events are felt throughout our nation, far beyond New York and \nWashington. As a daughter, as a wife, as a mother and as an American, I \nam deeply pained by our suffering today.\n  It has now been over 48 hours since the first plane struck the World \nTrade Center, and even now it is possible that there are scores of \npeople trapped in the debris and rubble in New York and in Virginia. \nOur prayers are with them and their families, and it is my great hope \nthat, if there are survivors, they are rescued soon and reunited with \ntheir loved ones.\n  We also extend our prayers and sympathy to the families of those who \nwere killed in Pennsylvania, where United Airlines Flight 93 was forced \ninto a crash landing.\n  Tuesday morning, these terrorists made their statement, at a great \nand unprecedented cost of American lives. Let our statement to them be \nthat this was an act of war, and from this point forward, the United \nStates of America is at war against these kinds of actions.\n  Let them know that although they may strike at the United States, \nthey cannot strike at the freedom and resolve that make our nation \ngreat.\n  I join my colleagues in letting these terrorists and anyone else who \nwould take such actions against this great Nation know, it will not be \ntolerated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas yields \nthe floor.\n  The Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, is recognized to speak for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I join my colleagues and all \nAmericans--those from my State of Alaska and throughout the world--in \nprayer, prayer for those who tragically lost their lives last Tuesday \nand for those who are even now fighting for their lives in the rubble \nassociated with the tragedy in New York and possibly still at the \nPentagon.\n  The inhumanity of this act will live in infamy. We yearn in heartfelt \nsorrow for the families of those injured, those lost. We all join \ntogether in support of our President and to assert our resolve to \nendure the evil wrought Tuesday, to ensure that evil is countered, and \nthat that evil is destroyed.\n  The hunt for those responsible has begun. The terror they have sought \nto inspire will not stand. So let's be very clear, recognizing the \ngreat and enduring virtues of our Nation: our liberty, our tolerance, \nour fairness. These are the very values which the terrorists trampled \nupon in pursuit of their misguided quest. These will not save those \nresponsible for these crimes. We recognize our own values are \nsacrosanct, but our resolve to protect those values is absolutely \nunshaken. We should not, as we follow the tracks of the killers to the \nlairs of their leaders, presume to know their identity with certainty. \nNeither can we begin to know their motivations for committing the most \ncriminal of acts--killing innocent people.\n  If the killers believed that they, through this act, would enter the \nKingdom of Heaven, they now realize the real destination to which Satan \nhas guided them.\n  But to the children of America I say: Have faith; your parents, your \nteachers, your Government are all working hard to protect you, to \nprotect you from this horror. Your responsibility is to grow, to learn, \nto play--and many adults are working to bring those responsible to \njustice, to ensure that they and those who helped them never commit \nthis kind of a crime again.\n  To the terrorists who have sought to bring fear and chaos to the \nUnited States, I say to you: You have failed. It is you who should be \nafraid, afraid of the sense of justice of the American people, afraid \nof your fate at the hand of God, afraid of what you have unleashed.\n  As we shared, along with Members of the House, on the steps the other \nevening ``God Bless America,'' let me also mention the dimension of \nthis which we all relate to in our own lives.\n  I stand here as one who recalls as a child the ``Day of Infamy,'' \nDecember 7, 1941. I noticed a piece that indicated the deaths from that \nsurprise attack on Pearl Harbor. It was 2,403. Clearly, this tragic set \nof circumstances brings the death toll to many times that amount.\n  We have the realization for the first time that an aircraft has been \nused as a weapon by terrorists. How do we protect the public? What \nchange is it going to make in transportation? It has shaken some of the \nfoundations and symbols of our Nation--our buildings--which represent \nprosperity in our economy. It has not shaken the resolve to recover nor \nthe resolve to pursue those responsible. We are prepared to move heaven \nand Earth to bring to justice those who are responsible for this \ncarnage.\n  But everything did change Tuesday. Things will be different in this \ncountry. We still do not know the extent of the threat, although we do \nknow that we all must be vigilant.\n  I join with my colleagues in an expression of faith and an expression \nof hope and an expression of conviction that America will overcome this \ntragedy. America will never forget this tragedy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Florida is recognized to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Madam President. I wish to commend you and \nSenator Smith for the eloquent remarks you have just delivered to the \nAmerican people.\n  We all are shocked by what occurred on September 11, and we recognize \nthat this will be a demarcation date in the history of America. It will \nbe a date upon which we will recognize our loss of innocence and the \nnew reality of our vulnerability. Not since the Civil War has there \nbeen a conflict of such violence committed on the territory of the \nUnited States as we experienced on Tuesday.\n  As with Pearl Harbor and the assassination of President John Kennedy, \nall Americans will forever remember where they were and what was in \ntheir mind as they heard of the tragic events of last Tuesday. Today \nour prayers are with the victims in New York and here in the Pentagon \nand with their families.\n  Our admiration and good wishes go to the brave firefighters, \npolicemen, doctors, nurses, and all the other emergency personnel who \nare working so hard to find the survivors and to deal with the pain. We \npray for our Nation as well. We have entered a new phase in history, \none that will unfortunately be marked by a pervasive sense of \ninsecurity.\n  I am fortunate to be a grandfather of 10 beautiful boys and girls. \nTheir mothers called me Tuesday evening to tell me how frightened the \ngrandchildren were and that they were wondering whether their \nneighborhood, whether their school, and whether their own brothers, \nsisters, mothers, fathers, and friends would be subject to the same \nthing they had just seen on television.\n\n  Every time we take a trip, particularly by airline, we are likely to \nbe reminded of Tuesday's incident. We will also face increased \nsecurity, particularly at airports and seaports. Our border checkpoints \nwill be reinforced. But all of these are necessary changes. Frankly, I \nbelieve the vast majority of Americans will agree that there will be\n\n[[Page S9347]]\n\nreasonable, new restrictions in light of the new period of American \nhistory in which we will now be living.\n  To honor the lives of the victims, we must take steps to assure that \nother Americans will not be subject to the same fate. A first step in \nthat honoring will be to support the President of the United States of \nAmerica. He will have some extremely difficult decisions to make in the \nnext few days.\n  Clearly, we are not going to allow this horrific act to go \nunanswered. As has been the case in so many other incidents of \nconflict, we will enter this commitment to see that those who have \ncommitted these deeds will be brought to justice with great enthusiasm. \nThe real test will be whether we are prepared to make the long march \nthat is likely to be required in order to root out the many cells of \nterrorists around the world that represent a continuing threat to our \nsecurity. The President will need our support then even more than now.\n  We also need to rebuild some of our institutions that will be on the \nfront lines of our efforts to assure the security of America. One of \nthose with which I feel a particular responsibility is our national \nintelligence capability. To deal with terrorism, there is no \nalternative but to have the most effective capacities to anticipate \nwhat the motivations and capabilities of our particular adversaries are \nand then to be able to interdict those capabilities before they can be \nput into action.\n  We have seen over the past several years a degradation in some \nimportant areas of our intelligence capabilities. We will know in the \nnext few weeks whether those shortfalls bear a part of the \nresponsibility for what happened on Tuesday.\n  Illustrative of the areas in which we are going to need to pay \nrenewed attention and additional new resources will be rebuilding our \nhuman intelligence. For a long period during the cold war we became \nincreasingly dependent upon technology as the means of gathering \ninformation. That played a critical role. But in this new era there is \ngoing to be no substitute for having well-trained, diverse in \nbackground and language skills, and technologically competent persons \nwho can represent the interests of the United States in getting inside \nthese organizations so that we will have a level of understanding that \nwill allow us to prepare for and to avoid incidents such as Tuesday's \ntragedy.\n  We also must make some investments in some of our technological \nareas, particularly the National Security Agency, which for many years \nhad been our prime means of gathering information by essentially \neavesdropping on our adversaries. That capability, which was developed \nto a very high level during the cold war when most of those \ncommunications were over the air, has been degraded as countries, \nincluding our own, have gone to other forms of communication. As an \nexample, communicating computer to computer does not allow the kind of \ndetection we have relied on in the past. It is going to be important \nthat we make a new commitment and a new investment to build up that \ncapability to what it has been historically.\n  With the permission of the body, I am submitting for the \nCongressional Record a recent article which appeared in the Washington \nPost which examines the National Security Agency, some of its immediate \nchallenges, and the pathway to a stronger and more secure future that \nis being developed under the direction of its leader, LTG Michael V. \nHayden. I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Washington Post Magazine, July 29, 2001]\n\n                            Test of Strength\n\n     For two years, Air Force general Michael Hayden has waged a \n         secret struggle to overhaul the world's most powerful spy \n         agency. Nothing's riding on his success but the future of \n         America's national security\n\n                            (By Vernon Loeb)\n\n       The call came after dinner on a Monday night, as the \n     general was watching the TV news at home. There was a \n     computer problem back at the agency. A software failure had \n     knocked out the network.\n       ``Give me a sense,'' the general commanded the duty officer \n     over the secure phone line. ``What are we talking about?''\n       ``The whole system is down,'' the duty officer said. A \n     result of overloading. Plus, the network had become so \n     tangled that no one really seemed to know how it worked. \n     There was no wiring diagram anyone could consult. It was \n     January 24, 2000. Lt. Gen. Michael V. Hayden was still new on \n     the job--just finishing his 10th month as director of the \n     National Security Agency--but he did not need a duty officer \n     to explain the implications of his computer problem. The \n     agency's constellation of spy satellites and its giant \n     listening stations on five continents were still vacuuming \n     communications out of the either. Their vast electronic \n     ``take''--intercepted telephone calls, e-mails, faxes and \n     radio signals--still poured into memory buffers capable of \n     storing 5 trillion pages of data at agency headquarters at \n     Fort Meade. But once in house, the data froze. Nobody could \n     access it, nobody could analyze it.\n       The NSA--the largest and most powerful spy agency in the \n     world--was brain-dead.\n       Hayden called George J. Tenet on a secure phone and broke \n     the news to the director of central intelligence. The \n     nation's two top spymasters knew there was nothing they could \n     do but get out of the way and let the technicians try to \n     figure out what was wrong. The keepers of the nation's \n     secrets now had another one to keep--a secret Saddam Hussein \n     or Osama bin Laden or some other enemy of the state could \n     have surely used to great advantage.\n       The next morning, the only consolation Hayden had was the \n     snow: A blizzard had blasted Washington and shut down the \n     federal government, giving his gathering army of computer \n     engineers and techies some time--without the workforce \n     around--to bring the agency out of its coma. Hayden's despair \n     deepened as two full days passed without progress. The \n     mathematicians and linguists reported back for duty Thursday \n     morning, only to find a handwritten message taped to doors \n     and computer terminals: ``Our network is experiencing \n     intermittent difficulties. Consult your supervisor before you \n     log on.''\n       The crash had now become a security crisis. By noon, at a \n     hastily called ``town meeting,'' Hayden walked onto the stage \n     of the agency's Friedman Auditorium and told thousands of \n     employees--in person and on closed-circuit television--what \n     had happened.\n       ``We are the keeper of the nation's secrets,'' he said at \n     the end of his grim presentation. ``If word of this gets out, \n     we significantly increase the likelihood that Americans will \n     get hurt. Those who would intend our nation and our citizens \n     harm will be emboldened. So this is not the back half of a \n     sentence tonight that begins, `Honey, you won't believe what \n     happened to me at work.' This is secret. It does not leave \n     the building.''\n       Could all 30,000 employees live by the code of secrecy \n     they'd grown up with?\n       To Hayden, a career intelligence officer who had served in \n     the first Bush White House and had run the Air Force's \n     cyberwar center, the computer crash seemed the perfect \n     matephor for an agency desperately in need of new technology. \n     But the reality, he would quickly see, was actually worse. \n     Antiquated computers were the least of the NSA's problems.\n       By virtue of its magnitude and complexity, the NSA invites \n     superlatives and outsize comparisons. Its collections systems \n     scoop up enough data every three hours to fill the Library of \n     Congress. It employs the world's largest collection of \n     linguists and mathematicians and owns the world's largest \n     array of supercomputers. To power the supercomputers, it uses \n     as much electricity as the city of Annapolis. To cool them, \n     it maintains 8,000 tons of chilled water capacity. One of its \n     most powerful computers generates so much heat it operates \n     while immersed in a nonconducting liquid called Flourinert.\n       But beyond the gee-whiz factor lies an agency in need of \n     reinvention.\n       Heir to America's World War II code-breaking heroics, the \n     agency was created in secret by President Harry Truman in \n     1952. Signals intelligence--SIGINT, in spy parlance--has long \n     been considered even more valuable than human intelligence or \n     satellite imagery, because the quantity and quality of the \n     potential take is so much greater. The NSA was intended to be \n     the world's premier SIGINT agency, encoding American secret \n     communications while stealing and decoding other nations'. \n     Soon after its founding, the agency started growing into a \n     juggernaut that would put listening posts around the globe, \n     spy ships and submarines out to sea, and reconnaissance \n     planes and satellites in the heavens.\n       The NSA rose to dominance in what were, in \n     telecommunications terms, simpler times. Radio signals and \n     microwaves were ripe for the taking as they bounced off the \n     ionosphere or traveled straight out into space; to intercept \n     them, one simply needed to get in their path. And the NSA \n     did this better than anyone else, using everything from \n     portable receivers that picked up vibrations off \n     windowpanes to geosynchronous satellites 22,000 miles \n     above Earth.\n       It was the NSA that first reported the presence of Soviet \n     offensive missiles in Cuba in 1962. It was the NSA that first \n     warned of the Tet offensive--five days before the attacks \n     commenced across South Vietnam in January 1968. All told, the \n     NSA broke the codes of 40 nations during the Cold War and, \n     through an operation code-named Gamma Guppy, intercepted \n     personal conversations of Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev. In \n     1986, President Ronald Reagan went so far as to bomb Col. \n     Moammar Gaddafi's Tripoli headquarters\n\n[[Page S9348]]\n\n     after NSA intercepts revealed Libya's role in a terrorist \n     attack on a Berlin discotheque that had killed two U.S. \n     servicemen and a Turkish woman.\n       Making and breaking codes requires absolute secrecy, and \n     the NSA took secrecy to extremes. Most Americans had never \n     even heard of the agency for decades after it was \n     established. In 1975, a Senate select committee headed by \n     Sen. Frank Church revealed that the NSA had far exceeded the \n     foreign intelligence mission envisioned by Truman and had \n     been spying domestically on the likes of Jane Fonda, Joan \n     Baez, Benjamin Spock and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n       The revelations led to laws and regulations that strictly \n     prohibit the NSA from spying on U.S. soil--laws and \n     regulations, agency officials say, they now strictly follow. \n     But the agency's cult of secrecy proved far more resilient. \n     Even after the Church committee's revelations, it was a \n     standing joke at Fort Meade that NSA stood for No Such Agency \n     or Never Say Anything. In 1982, when author James Bamford was \n     writing his groundbreaking first book about the agency, The \n     Puzzle Palace, the Reagan administration threatened to \n     prosecute him for espionage if he did not return sensitive \n     documents he had obtained through the Freedom of Information \n     Act. The administration ultimately backed down, but its \n     treatment of Bamford was a sign of how secretive and arrogant \n     the NSA had become. (By contrast, Hayden cooperated with \n     Bamford on his second book about the NSA, Body of Secrets, \n     which was published in May.)\n       The agency's high opinion of itself was backed up by its \n     success throughout the Cold War, success that rested on three \n     pillars: massive budgets, superior technology and the luxury \n     of having a single main adversary--the Soviet Union--that \n     enjoyed neither of those first two advantages.\n       Now, all those pillars have crumbled.\n       The NSA is still one of the largest employers in the state \n     of Maryland, but it lost 30 percent of its budget and an \n     equivalent slice of its workforce during the 1990s. And \n     instead of one backward adversary, the agency found itself \n     trying to deploy against elusive terrorist groups, drug \n     cartels and rogue states, in addition to a full slate of \n     traditional targets ranging from Russia to China to India to \n     Pakistan. In 1980, the NSA focused about 60 percent of its \n     budget on the Soviet Union. By 1993, less than 15 percent was \n     fixed on Russia.\n       But if the end of the Cold War was hard on the NSA, the \n     onset of the digital age was harder. More and more \n     communications were moving through hard-to-tap fiber-optic \n     cable. More and more were encoded with powerful new \n     encryption software that was proving virtually impossible to \n     break. By the late 1990s, NSA officials had given up a futile \n     effort to limit the spread of encryption software, but they \n     were left fearful of how their agency's capabilities could \n     wither if, say, Microsoft started building powerful \n     encryption algorithms into its operating systems.\n       More immediately, the NSA had to confront the exploding \n     volume of global communications. In the 1950s, there were \n     5,000 computers in the world and not a single fax machine or \n     cell phone. Today, there are more than 100 million hosts on \n     the Internet serving hundreds of millions of networked \n     computers, not to mention 650 million cell phones in use \n     worldwide. And with broadband fiber-optic cable being laid \n     around the world at the rate of hundreds of miles an hour \n     (virtually the speed of sound), the speed for moving digital \n     data down these slender pipes more than doubles annually--\n     faster even than computing power, which doubles every year \n     and a half.\n       With more and more digital data moving across the Internet \n     and bouncing off communications satellites, SIGINT has become \n     more important than ever. Yet the interceptible data stream \n     has threatened to drown the NSA's analysts in a roiling sea \n     of 1s and 0s.\n       In this new context, private industry suddenly controls the \n     technology that the NSA needs to keep pace. But the NSA has \n     been isolated from the dynamism of the market by its own cult \n     of secrecy. The agency has fallen farther and farther behind, \n     unable to sort through a torrent of information streaming \n     back into Fort Meade's computers and, to some extent, \n     incapable of replacing its Cold War troops trained in radio \n     intercepts and Russian with Internet engineers and Arabic \n     speakers.\n       In 1999, the House Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence declared that the NSA was ``in serious \n     trouble,'' desperately short of capital and leadership. Civil \n     libertarians, Internet privacy activities and encryption \n     entrepreneurs--not to mention the European Parliament and \n     thousands, perhaps millions, of ordinary Europeans--question \n     the continuing need for such an agency, describing the NSA as \n     an ``extreme threat to the privacy of people all over the \n     world,'' in the words of an American Civil Liberties Union \n     Web site.\n       But the U.S. government considers SIGINT so essential that \n     one senior intelligence official recently called the NSA's \n     possible demise the greatest single threat to U.S. national \n     security. So, three years ago, when the House and Senate \n     intelligence committees began sounding the alarm, the \n     director of central intelligence began an all-out search for \n     somebody to fill the NSA's leadership void. George Tenet \n     turned to a man who lacked the innate spookiness normally \n     associated with this spookiest of agencies. A small man with \n     a crew cut and a bald pate. A man with a scholarly interest \n     in history. A man who would show no fear of either the public \n     or the agency he would have to overhaul.\n       Michael Hayden, 56, grew up in an era when the backbone of \n     America's industrial might comprised steel mills and \n     factories, in a neighborhood on Pittsburgh's North Side where \n     men carried lunch buckets to work and proudly traced their \n     ancestors to County Galway.\n       His father, Harry Hayden Sr., was a welder at Allis-\n     Chalmers, a plant that made giant electrical transformers. \n     Harry worked the 3:30-to-midnight shift, leaving his wife, \n     Sadie, to raise their three children almost by herself. But \n     he remembers how, when he would awake before dawn and walk to \n     the bathroom, the light would always be on in Michael's room \n     at 5:30 in the morning. The boy was studying.\n       Michael was a standout student, and an athlete as well. \n     ``We never had to talk about Michael,'' says Harry, now 81. \n     ``Everybody else was.''\n       As early as grade school, Michael showed a talent for \n     impressing talent spotters. His football coach at the St. \n     Peter's parochial schools says Hayden clearly had ``the \n     smarts'' to play quarterback--no small judgment, coming as it \n     does from Dan Rooney, son of the founding owner of the \n     Pittsburgh Steelers and now the franchise's president. In \n     time, however, Hayden distinguished himself most in the \n     classroom, graduating near the top of his class at North \n     Catholic High School and at Duquesne University, where he \n     majored in history.\n       One day, he surprised his father by coming home from \n     college and announcing that he had signed up for Air Force \n     ROTC. It was 1967, when a lot of young men were burning their \n     draft cards to protest the Vietnam War. ``He wanted to \n     travel, and I guess there wasn't a better way to do it,'' \n     Harry says. Still, after graduating, Michael married his \n     college sweetheart, a Chicagoan named Jeanine Carrier. She \n     typed and proofread his master's thesis in American history \n     at Duquesne while he drove a cab, worked as a nigh bellman at \n     the Dusquesne Club and coached St. Peter's to a football \n     title.\n       Then he started his service in the Air Force, as an analyst \n     and briefer at the headquarters of the Strategic Air Command \n     at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. Harry Hayden Jr. \n     figures his older brother joined the service because he had \n     read everything he could about American history and wanted to \n     start participating.\n       A decade into his Air Force career, Michael held the rank \n     of major and was chief of intelligence for a fighter wing at \n     Osan Air Base in South Korea. The director of operations, \n     Col. Chuck Link, a fighter pilot, detected the same \n     leadership qualities Dan Rooney had recognized years earlier. \n     So did Hayden's men. Gene Tighe, a young intelligence \n     officer, remembers Hayden more as a mentor than a commanding \n     officer. ``He thought it was a great thing to be out and \n     about and getting this opportunity overseas,'' Tighe recalls. \n     ``He wanted us to see the temples, the rice paddies, go \n     shopping in Hong Kong. He took a vested interest in making \n     you feel important.''\n       After Osan, Hayden spent six months studying at the Armed \n     Forces Staff College in Norfolk and 18 months learning \n     Bulgarian before he became an Air Force attache to Sofia.\n       Two years later, he came home without a new assignment, but \n     Link quickly recruited him to a job on a prestigious policy \n     and planning staff inside Air Force headquarters at the \n     Pentagon. Soon Link's boss, Gen. Chuck Boyd, the Air Force's \n     director of plans, took notice of Hayden's ability to think \n     conceptually and put his thoughts down on paper.\n       ``He's got the soul of a historian, he really does,'' Boyd \n     says. ``He thinks things are explainable on the basis of how \n     things have been. It's a scholarly bent, combined with an \n     exceptional sensitivity to human behavior.''\n       One day in the summer of 1989, Boyd told Hayden to go down \n     to the National Security Council and see two men, an Air \n     Force general and an arms-control expert. Hayden took the \n     Metro across the river and reported to an office on the third \n     floor of the Old Executive Office Building. Only then did he \n     realize the he'd been sent to a job interview.\n       He spent the next two years as the NSC's director for \n     defense policy and arms control, where he wrote national \n     security adviser Brent Scowcroft's annual policy document on \n     strategy, then two more years at the Pentagon running a \n     policy staff for the secretary of the Air Force. In 1993, \n     Boyd, then commander of the U.S. European Command in \n     Stuttgart, Germany, asked Hayden to head its intelligence \n     directorate as the United States was becoming directly \n     involved in the Balkans. From his attache days in Bulgaria, \n     Hayden probably knew the region as well as anyone in the U.S. \n     military.\n       On June 2, 1995, Hayden walked into the U.S. Embassy in \n     Belgrade to learn that an American F-16 piloted by Air Force \n     Capt. Scott O'Grady had been shot down over Bosnia. The news \n     marked a turning point in Hayden's thinking as a soldier.\n       Serb Gen. Rathko Mladic had been saying publicly that he \n     would deny Serb airspace to NATO. Operations officers at the \n     European Command had dismissed the threat, but Hayden was \n     familiar with Mladic and did not see him making idle threats. \n     As an intelligence officer, he had informed the operational \n     commanders of Mladic's statements and relayed his impression \n     that the general was\n\n[[Page S9349]]\n\n     not to be trifled with. But he didn't believe it was his \n     place to voice further objections--until after O'Grady was \n     shot down.\n       ``Maybe I [should] have picked up the phone and told the \n     air commander, `Every time I see that orbit on your morning \n     slides, I get nervous,' '' Hayden says, ``But I didn't.''\n       The incident forced Hayden to see the obsolescence of the \n     military's traditional hierarchy, in which intelligence was \n     seen merely as a support function. Increasingly, Hayden \n     realized, intelligence was becoming so essential to make use \n     of and counter sophisticated weaponry that it had become as \n     much of a weapon in its own right as any bomb or missile. \n     ``It was a kind of redefinition of self, as a professional,'' \n     he says. ``It's not about intelligence successes or failures; \n     it's just successes or failures.''\n       Hayden's next assignment, as commander of the Air \n     Intelligence Agency at Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, \n     gave him plenty of opportunity to further hone his thinking. \n     Kelly is where the Air Force works on its plans for \n     cyberwar--attacks designed to take down adversaries' \n     computer networks. Hayden next served as deputy chief of \n     staff for the United Nations Command and U.S. Forces \n     Korea. To those inculcated in military culture, this move \n     sent a message. He crossed the divide between the bookish \n     world of intelligence into the front-line world of \n     operations. In the words of one senior intelligence \n     official, ``Here you've got an intel weenie who the four-\n     star operator recognized as something special.''\n       Late in 1998, he was leading a military delegation \n     negotiating with a group of North Korean generals at \n     Panmunjon, where talks at that high a level had not taken \n     place in seven years. He was in Seoul when Tenet, searching \n     for a new NSA director, summoned him for an interview. They \n     met at the Wye Plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore, where \n     Tenet was attending Arab-Israeli peace talks hosted by the \n     Clinton administration. After a relaxed interview in which \n     Tenet asked Hayden about his views on life and change, Hayden \n     flew back to Korea with a clear signal from Tenet that the \n     NSA job was his. Given the job's normal three-year term and \n     his lack of SIGINT expertise, Hayden knew he'd been handed \n     the most challenging assignment of his career. Still, he \n     returned to Seoul in a celebratory mood. He took his wife to \n     the movie theater at Yongsan Army Garrison, which was playing \n     a new movie starring Will Smith, ``Enemy of the State.''\n       The film opens with a scene in which a rogue NSA official \n     (played by Jon Voigt) assassinates an influential congressman \n     (Jason Robards) who refuses to back a bill expanding the \n     agency's power to spy on Americans. From there, the movie \n     portrays the NSA as a lawless band of high-tech assassins who \n     try their best to kill a Washington lawyer (Smith) who just \n     happens to witness another NSA assassination on streets \n     around Dupont Circle.\n       As Hayden watched, surrounded by GIs whooping it up in the \n     theater, he sank lower and lower in his chair.\n       In real life, the NSA's image problems were a bit more \n     complicated.\n       In 1997, the European Parliament had commissioned a report \n     on Echelon, a global communications system. That report had \n     concluded that the NSA was capable of intercepting every fax, \n     phone call and e-mail in Europe. The conclusion was wrong--\n     Echelon is actually a relatively small system through which \n     the NSA and its electronic spy partners in the United \n     Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand divide \n     responsibility for processing intercepted satellite \n     communications--but it did not matter. The European \n     Parliament's anxieties flared into a controversy that \n     wouldn't go away, fueled by the lawmakers' suspicions that \n     the NSA was stealing European companies' secrets and passing \n     them on to their American competitors, a practice NSA \n     officials say they do not engage in.\n       Beyond industrial espionage, the Europeans also worried \n     about individual privacy, because the U.S. laws and \n     regulations that keep the NSA from spying on Americans \n     provide no similar protections for foreigners. By 1999, this \n     controversy had attracted the attention of civil libertarians \n     in the United States who were concerned about possible NSA \n     spying against Americans on the Internet, which the agency is \n     prohibited by law from doing.\n       While all this was brewing, the agency's boosters on \n     Capitol Hill were becoming alarmed that the NSA was in \n     serious trouble because of new communications technologies--\n     fiber-optic cables that couldn't be tapped, encryption \n     software that couldn't be broken and cell phone traffic too \n     voluminous to be processed.\n       Hayden was keenly aware of the irony: He was inheriting an \n     agency that was simultaneously being accused of omnipotence \n     and incompetence. And then, almost as soon as he arrived at \n     Fort Meade, Hayden discovered another wrinkle: The NSA \n     director didn't really run the agency. The agency, Hayden \n     soon come to understand, had been diffused into five \n     directorates that ran as fiefdoms unto themselves. The \n     bureaucratic overlap was staggering, and no one had a picture \n     of the whole. There were 68 different e-mail systems at Fort \n     Meade, and 452 internal review boards of one sort or another.\n       It wasn't as though the bureaucracy was actively trying to \n     sabotage him--``that would have required them to unify,'' \n     Hayden says. Rather, he couldn't get the senior leadership to \n     agree on anything, ``from whether or not we should invest $2 \n     billion in a new collection system to whether we should serve \n     grilled cheese'' to visiting delegations.\n       Early in his tenure, Hayden began plotting an internal \n     coup, naming two review teams--one made up of NSA insiders, \n     the other private-sector experts--to tell him what was wrong \n     with the agency. The results were startling.\n       The insiders' report blasted Hayden's predecessors and the \n     NSA's senior civilian managers, saying the agency ``has been \n     in a leadership crisis for the better part of a decade . . . \n     the legacy of exceptional service to the nation that is NSA \n     is in great peril. We have run out of time.''\n       The outsiders cited the agency's ``reluctance'' to move \n     from ``legacy targets to newer targets'' and said that NSA \n     had already become ``deaf'' to concerns from its customers--\n     military commanders, White House policymakers and the CIA. \n     ``Right now, when stakeholders tell NSA that `NSA doesn't get \n     it,' the agency simply repeats itself and talks louder,'' \n     their report said.\n       But Hayden remained cautious, painfully aware that he was \n     no expert in signals intelligence. He thought he saw what \n     needed to be done but didn't feel sure, especially when many \n     of his senior managers who were SIGINT experts were reluctant \n     to move.\n       Then the computers crashed in January 2000, confirming his \n     worst fears about the agency's antiquated technology and its \n     leaden bureaucracy.\n       With the snow outside headquarters still being cleared, \n     Hayden strode off the stage in Friedman Auditorium. His \n     challenge--This does not leave the building--was still \n     ringing in everyone's ears. In a room off the agency's \n     operations center, he called all of the agency's top \n     technicians and engineers together and told them just how \n     serious the meltdown had become. Tenet was still giving \n     them plenty of room to fashion a solution, Hayden said, \n     but pressure was building ``downtown.''\n       Hayden has no trouble remembering the day's event. That \n     Thursday happened to be his 32nd wedding anniversary. That \n     night, with the system showing some signs of life, he took \n     Jeannie to an inn west of Frederick called Stone Manor for \n     dinner. On the drive home, Robert Stevens, the NSA's deputy \n     director for technology, called to say that he needed to talk \n     to Hayden ``secure.'' Hayden called him back on a secure line \n     as soon as he got home.\n       The system had been dysfunctional for more than 72 hours. \n     It was back up to about 25 percent capacity, Stevens said, \n     but he didn't think the techies were on the right path. He \n     wanted permission to take the entire system down and start \n     all over again.\n       By then, a team of NSA engineers and contractors had \n     pinpointed an outdated routing protocol as the cause of the \n     failure. With the system completely shut down, they began \n     installing a massive hardware and software upgrade. And by \n     Friday morning, the system was coming back to life, node by \n     node. Deeply relieved, Tenet drove over to Fort Meade that \n     night and personally shook the hands of dozens of disheveled, \n     unshaven techies, many of whom hadn't been home since Monday.\n       Hayden, feeling much better about life the following \n     afternoon, went cross-country skiiing with his wife on the \n     Fort Meade gold course. Soon, he noticed that he was being \n     shadowed by an NSA patrol car. Trudging through the snow, an \n     officer asked Hayden to take off his skis and come with him \n     back to the operations center. George Tenet needed to talk to \n     him--ABC News had the story.\n       Tenet told Hayden to talk to the reporter, John McWethy, on \n     the record so he would get the story right. Hayden said fine. \n     He knew McWethy, and knew where he was based--the Pentagon. \n     The leak had come from there, not Fort Meade. ``You held the \n     line,'' Hayden later told his own people. ``You kept it \n     secret while it had to be secret.''\n       But with Hayden's relief came a realization about the \n     larger task ahead: The price he would pay for moving too \n     cautiously would greatly exceed whatever he would pay for \n     being too bold.\n       He would be bold.\n       Hayden's internal coup began with an innocuous act: He \n     hired a chief financial officer. Without one, he had no way \n     of making strategic decisions based on how much money was \n     being spent across the entire agency on line items like \n     research and development, information technology and \n     security. So Hayden hired Beverly L. Wright, a Wellesley \n     College graduate with an MBA from the Harvard Business School \n     and a solid reputation as CFO at the old Baltimore investment \n     bank of Alex. Brown.\n       For an agency that had always promoted its own and promised \n     lifetime employment, hiring from the outside was a radical \n     act.\n       Then Hayden did it again, hiring a former GTE \n     telecommunications executive named Harold C. Smith to take \n     control of the agency's information technology. In doing so, \n     he wanted to extend a powerful metaphor he'd drawn from his \n     experience in the Air Force. He had come to see the service \n     as the military expression of the American aviation industry \n     and American culture--its dynamism, its risk taking, its \n     proud individualism. He believed that the NSA had to become \n     the intelligence expression of American technology and \n     American culture. It needed to embrace the innovative, \n     flexible, entrepreneurial spirit that had come to define the \n     digital age. ``We can no longer provide to America what we \n     need to do so isolated from America,'' he says. ``To end the \n     isolation, America needs to know us better.''\n\n[[Page S9350]]\n\n       And so, as his housecleaning began, Hayden also launched an \n     openness campaign, appearing in April 2000 at a rare public \n     session of the House Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence. With the European Parliament continuing its \n     Echelon investigation and the American Civil Liberties Union \n     voicing similar concerns, Hayden told the committee that NSA \n     employees took great care ``to make sure that we are always \n     on the correct side of the Fourth Amendment.''\n       ``Let me put a fine point on this,'' Hayden testified. \n     ``If, as we are speaking here this afternoon, Osama bin Laden \n     is walking across the bridge from Niagara Falls, Ontario, to \n     Niagra Falls, New York, as he gets to the New York side, he \n     is an American person. And my agency must respect his rights \n     against unreasonable search and seizure.''\n       Rep. Heather Wilson (R-N.M.) pressed Hayden on this point. \n     ``Does NSA spy on the lawful activities of Americans?'' she \n     asked.\n       ``No. The answer is we do not,'' Hayden said.\n       ``Do you inadvertently collect information on U.S. \n     citizens?'' asked Rep. Tim Roemer (D-Ind.).\n       Yes, Hayden replied. But, he said, ``if it is not necessary \n     to understand the foreign intelligence value of the \n     information collected, it is not reported, it is destroyed. \n     And it is destroyed as quickly as we can do that.''\n       Back at Fort Meade, Hayden's grand plan for rebuilding the \n     agency for the digital age was slowed by his inability to \n     pick a deputy. He had departed from tradition again, \n     appointing a search committee instead of simply anointing one \n     of the bureaucracy's nominees. He was intrigued by the notion \n     of picking an outsider, even though retired Adm. Bobby Ray \n     Inman, a legendary past NSA director whom Hayden frequently \n     called for advice, strongly objected. ``What I thought he \n     couldn't do was go to somebody who didn't know the \n     business,'' Inman recalls. ``The learning curve is too long, \n     and you'd get waited out.''\n       Ultimately, Hayden resolved the conflict by picking an \n     insider who had worked as an outsider. William B. Black had \n     spent 38 years running some of the agency's spookiest \n     operations before retiring in 1997 and going to work for \n     Science Applications International Corp. He was, by \n     training, yet another Russian linguist. But Black had \n     served a tour as chief of an elite unit focused on Russian \n     communications. More important, he had run the Special \n     Collection Service, the joint NSA-CIA operation that works \n     out of foreign embassies and fuss the talents of human \n     spies and ultra-tech eavesdroppers to get very close to \n     particularly difficult targets. Most telling was Black's \n     final NSA assignment: special assistance to the director \n     for information warfare. In that role, he had established \n     the government's preeminent cyberwarfare unit--and \n     alienated so many NSA bureaucrats by poaching on their \n     cherished turf that resignation was his only viable \n     option.\n       Hayden liked Black's expertise and his reputation as an \n     iconoclast. In July 2000, he invited Black to his house for \n     dinner. Over couscous and roasted vegetables the director had \n     prepared himself, Hayden made it clear that he wanted a \n     deputy who could help change the system, not end-run it. \n     Black's one-word answer--``Exactly''--convinced Hayden that \n     he had his deputy.\n       With Black onboard, Hayden was ready to move. Last October, \n     he rolled out his reorganization plan, wresting control of \n     the agency from its own bureaucracy. All the NSA's support \n     services would be centralized under Hayden's chief of staff. \n     And where there were five overlapping directorates, Hayden \n     would have just two: one for information security (the \n     agency's codemakers) and another for signals intelligence \n     (its codebreakers).\n       Now, he hoped, senior managers could focus on going after \n     bytes.\n       A decade ago, a single NSA collection system could field a \n     million inputs per half-hour. Automated filtering systems \n     would winnow that to 10 messages that needed review by \n     analysts. With today's explosion in communications traffic, \n     multiply a million inputs per half-hour by a 1,000 or 10,000, \n     and 10 messages needing review becomes 10,000 or 100,000. \n     Cutting-edge fiber-optic systems now move data at 2.5 to 20 \n     gigabits per second. The latest Intelsat satellites can \n     process the equivalent of 90,000 simultaneous telephone \n     calls. A single OC3 line on the Internet transmits 155 \n     million bits per second--the equivalent of 18,000 books a \n     minute.\n       From an operational standpoint, the NSA's Cold War vacuum-\n     cleaner approach is no longer tenable--there's just too much \n     to be collected, and it's too hard to process. The only way \n     for the NSA to remain relevant in this environment is to \n     target the individuals and organizations whose communications \n     are most valuable--and targeting now is more complicated than \n     programming a target's telephone number into a computer. To \n     succeed in the digital age, NSA analysts must understand how \n     a target communicates, what its Internet protocol addresses \n     are, and how its traffic is routed around the world.\n       And with so many conceivable targets in the world, the only \n     way to zero in on the most important ones is to ask White \n     House officials, Pentagon commanders and CIA officers to \n     identify the targets they're interested in. The days when NSA \n     officials sent the White House whatever interested them are \n     over.\n       Now, SIGINT requires the agility to move from system to \n     system and adapt to new technologies. If that can be done, \n     the potential for electronic spying is enormous. \n     Sophisticated Internet surveillance techniques now make it \n     possible to acquire data ``in motion'' across the network--\n     and data ``at rest'' in computer databases, the new frontier.\n       ``The world has never been more wired together than it is \n     today,'' says Stewart Baker, who served as the NSA's general \n     counsel from 1992 to 1994. ``It's the golden age of \n     espionage. Stealing secrets is going to get even easier for \n     people who employ technologically advanced tools and are \n     willing to work aggressively at it.''\n       Even so, the challenges are formidable. The NSA is known to \n     be hard at work trying to gain access to fiber-optic cables. \n     How it is doing is not publicly known. One means would be \n     tapping undersea cables or placing interception pods over \n     ``repeaters'' that periodically boost fiber-optic signals. \n     But even if the lines can be tapped, transmitting the torrent \n     of intercepted data from the depths of the ocean to Fort \n     Meade in anything close to real time would be far harder \n     still, possibly requiring the NSA to lay its own fiber-optic \n     lines from the tap to some sort of relay station.\n       The most recent European Parliament report on Echelon \n     concluded that such links would be far too costly. The report \n     also said that new laser regenerators used to amplify fiber-\n     optic signals cannot be tapped the way repeaters can, meaning \n     that ``the use of submarines for the routine surveillance of \n     international telephone traffic can be ruled out.''\n       The Navy's decision to spend $1 billion to retrofit its \n     premier spy submarine, the USS Jimmy Carter, would suggest \n     American policymakers believe otherwise.\n       Another challenge facing Hayden's NSA is to decode \n     communications encrypted with powerful--and widely \n     available--software. When Hayden became director, the deputy \n     he inherited told Congress that the encryption software would \n     make the job of decoding encrypted messages ``difficult, if \n     not impossible,'' even with the world's largest collection of \n     supercomputers.\n       One alternative is to steal 1s and 0s before they are \n     encrypted, or after they are decrypted. This requires classic \n     esponage--as practiced by the Special Collection Service, the \n     top-secret joint CIA-NSA operation. In the Code War, American \n     spies recruited Soviet code clerks. Now the targets of \n     choice--the people paid to sell out their governments or \n     organizations--are systems administrators and other techies \n     capable of providing encryption keys or planting electronic \n     ``trapdoors'' in computer systems that can be accessed from \n     computers on the other side of the world.\n       The irony amid all this new technology is that human \n     beings--old fashioned spies--are suddenly as important as \n     ever.\n       With his organization laid out and his mission clarified, \n     Hayden began updating his human resources last December. He \n     freed up enough slots and cajoled additional funds from \n     Congress to hire 600 people this year--three times what the \n     agency had been hiring annually. Sixty senior managers \n     accepted early retirement incentives, giving him enough \n     headroom to reach down a generation in selecting new \n     managers. Maureen A. Baginski, a member of the insiders team \n     that produced the scathing management assessment for Hayden \n     back in 1999, headed the class.\n       She would run the newly created directorate of signals \n     intelligence. Now, an operations officer targeting a \n     terrorist cell could team with an engineer who could help him \n     figure out how the cell's communications were routed around \n     the world. And though Baginski, too, is a former Russian \n     linguist, she clearly understood the challenges ahead. ``You \n     could literally stare for 25 years at the Soviet land mass \n     and never have this kind of volume problem,'' she says. \n     ``They were slow, so it was okay if we were slow. Today, it's \n     volume, it's velocity and it's variety.''\n       Her management style, too, is more current--more attuned to \n     the idea of empowering the people beneath her. When a U.S. \n     Navy EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft--an NSA asset--crash-landed \n     on China's Hainan Island this spring after colliding with a \n     Chinese fighter jet, an operations officer called Baginski at \n     home late on a Saturday night, told her what had happened and \n     said, ``You will want to come in.''\n       Baginski replied: ``No, I will not want to come in.'' Her \n     reasoning was that the agency already had a person charged \n     with running an emergency response operation. ``Why should I \n     do it in a crisis if someone else does it every day?'' \n     Baginski said.\n       As Baginski was settling in, Hayden was busy looking \n     outside the NSA for new people to work for her--and soon \n     found the agency swamped. In February, the home of No Such \n     Agency and Never Say Anything held a job fair to recruit \n     computer scientists, mathematicians, linguists and analyst to \n     become new spooks. Seventeen hundred people registered in \n     advance--and hundreds of walk-ins dressed in dark business \n     attire showed up and waited in a line that snaked through the \n     parking lot. Hayden's openness initiative was paying \n     dividends.\n       Soon, he advertised in the outside world to fill eight \n     other top jobs, including chief information officer, chief of \n     legislative affairs, deputy associate director for research \n     and chief of SIGINT systems engineering. All of the jobs paid \n     between $109,000 and $125,000, well below salaries for \n     commensurate jobs in the private sector. But, as Black is \n     fond of saying, ``patriotism still works on occasion.''\n       By the end of March, the NSA began its first major push to \n     involve the private sector in development of new SIGINT \n     technology\n\n[[Page S9351]]\n\n     with an initiative it called Trailblazer. A total of three \n     contracts, worth about $10 million apiece, were awarded to \n     corporate consortia led by Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc., \n     Lockheed Martin Corp. and TRW's systems and information \n     technology group.\n       Skeptics wonder whether it will all be enough, given the \n     speed with which technology is moving. They also question \n     whether there is enough top technical talent still left at \n     the NSA to manage complex relationships with contractors so \n     that the contracts result in real gains instead of white \n     elephants. The Federal Aviation Administration, after all, \n     hired IBM in the late 1980s to design a new air traffic \n     control system--and ended up abandoning the project at a cost \n     of $500 million.\n       But analysts on Capitol Hill and other close observers in \n     the private sector say Hayden, Black, Baginski and company \n     appear to be getting their message across that the NSA must \n     take risks if it is ever to ``own the virtual,'' as one \n     industry analyst put it.\n       James Adams, a British journalist turned Internet security \n     executive who serves on a panel of outside advisers created \n     by Hayden, says the agency's workforce breaks down into three \n     distinct camps: 25 percent are enthusiastic about Hayden's \n     program, 25 percent are threatened and dead set against it, \n     and 50 percent are sitting on the fence waiting to see who \n     wins.\n       Sometime this summer, Hayden plans to publish reduction-in-\n     force procedures to deal with the naysayers, if need be. He \n     will keep offering retirement incentives, preferring the \n     carrot to the stick, but now accepts that layoffs may be \n     necessary.\n       They would be the first in the agency's history.\n       With all the changes, Hayden may be making enemies among \n     his agency's old guard, but he's also building a powerful \n     constituency elsewhere. ``We went deaf for 72 hours because \n     of an antiquated system that should have been upgraded years \n     ago,'' says Tim Sample, staff director of the House Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence. ``When you're at that point \n     in an organization, it takes a monumental effort over a \n     sustained period to get back up to speed. They needed a \n     leader--and that's what they got.''\n       Sample's boss, Rep. Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.), the \n     committee's chairman, recently floated the idea of promoting \n     Hayden to a four-star general and extending his three-year \n     tour, now less than a year from completion.\n       Tenet has gone even further. ``My personal view is, Mike \n     Hayden must stay out there for five years--he has got to have \n     time on target,'' Tenet says. ``He's thinking out of the box. \n     He's engaged. He's not afraid of opening up the NSA. He's not \n     afraid of the American public. And he knows what has to be \n     done.''\n       Hayden is willing to stay on, if that's what Tenet and \n     Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld desire. There is, he knows, \n     much work still to be done. His personal focus this summer--\n     now that the computers seem to be working again--is people. \n     Specifically, promotions. Six months ago, Hayden got rid of \n     all regulations requiring employees to spend two years at one \n     pay grade before they get promoted to the next. Now he's \n     trying to make sure that the agency's hidebound promotions \n     panels start taking advantage of that freedom. If the right \n     people don't advance, Hayden believes, nothing else really \n     matters.\n       He says he feels more and more confident about the course \n     he's charted. But there's a certain fatigue in his voice. ``I \n     feel tired,'' Hayden allows. ``But I see points of light more \n     frequently.''\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, with a prayer that God will be with us \nas we enter this next and more challenging period of our Nation's \nhistory, I extend the wish that God will bless our Nation and that we \nwill be worthy of his blessings.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Collins, is recognized to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, it is very difficult to wrap one's mind \naround the terrible tragedy that our Nation has suffered. It is still \nharder to comprehend what must have been in the hearts and minds of \npeople willing to commit such atrocities against their fellow human \nbeings. It is very difficult to even find the right words to speak \nabout the attack on America.\n  But speaking about it is something we must do. The American people \nand the Government of the United States of America must speak \nforcefully and with crystalline clarity. The families and friends of \nthose killed or wounded in these awful terrorist attacks must know that \nthe prayers of every American and of millions upon millions of people \naround the world are with them now.\n  The heroic firefighters, police officers, rescue workers, National \nGuardsmen, doctors, nurses, members of the clergy, and the citizens who \nare volunteering, who are even now struggling to save the lives of the \nsurviving victims and to help grieving families, must know that our \nhearts and our deepest gratitude are with them in their vital work.\n  Our Commander in Chief and all the men and women of the Armed Forces, \nour law enforcement community, and our intelligence agencies must know \nthat we stand behind them, as perhaps never before in my lifetime, as \nthey set about with grim resolution to ensure that justice is done to \nthose responsible.\n  And the evil people who planned and committed these atrocities--and \nall of those who may have aided and abetted them--must know that far \nfrom paralyzing the American people and dividing us fearfully against \none another, what they have done instead is instantly to unite all of \nus into one people. We stand united in the solidarity of grief and \ncommitment to our fellow citizens and utterly single minded in our \ndetermination to remain unbowed and to see justice done.\n\n  In fact, this is my fifth year in the Senate, and never have I seen \nthe Senate more united and more determined than we are now.\n  These, then, are the messages we must send--and that we must keep \nsending with relentless determination. America may have lost a measure \nof our innocence, a degree of that special separateness that has helped \nus to keep our land of liberty safe from some of the storms that have \nlong battered other peoples in an often turbulent world; we clearly are \nnot as separate or as safe as once we thought. But no one--no one--\nshould doubt our resolve and our resilience. It is in moments such as \nthese that the special character of America can and should shine \nthrough with particular brilliance. It shines through in our sacrifices \nin helping fellow citizens in terribly trying times. It shines through \nin the sacrifices of those brave and heroic passengers who were on the \njet that did not make it to the intended target. It shines through in \nour commitment, even in adversity, to the bedrock values that make our \nsystem of government worth protecting, even as those values draw the \nmurderous ire of twisted souls whose only answer to the discourse of \nliberty is a vocabulary of violence, terror, and death.\n  As we care for survivors and comfort those who have lost loved ones, \nwe also will set about finding those responsible. We must respond to \nthese horrors in a way befitting our voices as free and united people. \nBut let there be no doubt, respond we should and respond we will.\n  As difficult as it is to find a voice to talk about the horrors we \nhave experienced, I believe by finding our voices amid such shock, \nrage, and pain we reaffirm our most cherished principles as citizens of \nthe United States of America.\n  With God's help, we shall persevere, we shall find comfort in our \ngrief, we shall find strength in the days ahead, and we shall hold \nthose responsible for these attacks on America responsible for their \nactions.\n  Madam President, seeing no one seeking recognition, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I stand before my fellow Senators in \nfull support of the resolution on which we voted yesterday. A stunned \nworld and Nation is struggling to come to grips with the horrifying \nviolence of September 11, 2001. I support the President's efforts to \nmarshal the resources of our intelligence, law enforcement, diplomatic, \nand military apparatus to bring about justice and to do so as swiftly \nas possible.\n  I call on any nation known to be harboring terrorists to fully \ncooperate with the United States and stem the rising tide of conflict. \nI believe people around the world are in equal measure demanding \njustice for these horrendous crimes and anxious for the world to settle \nits disputes in a rational and civilized manner.\n  We must cling to the hope that this is possible, even while we \nrecognize that on this Earth there exists people capable of \nunbelievable barbarism. This is a time of overwhelming sadness, and I \njoin my colleagues in support of S.J. Res. 22.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I assume we are still in morning business \nand offering statements with regard to the incidents of Tuesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, ironically, on September 11 of this year, \nI was involved in a press conference looking at a report card to \nCongress on the deployment of E-911, the national emergency number. \nLast year, we passed that bill and the President signed it, with now \nthe deployment of enhanced 911, which tells wireless phone operators \nthat when you dial 911 on your wireless phone, you will get the nearest \nfirst responder rather than some other area, maybe your home area, even \nthough you may be in roam, and I do not spell that R-o-m-e.\n  How ironic that started at 9 o'clock in the morning. It is one of \nthose pieces of legislation that goes unnoticed. Yet it has a lot to do \nwith public safety, especially in rural areas where we rely on \nwireless. It also nationalizes 911 as the emergency number across the \nNation.\n  I made the statement at that time that we are dealing with a \ndifferent world. Not only do we have to deal with our own little family \nemergencies, we also have to deal with this world of terrorism. So 911 \nand the ability to communicate becomes very important. As we walked out \nof that press conference, we were notified that an airplane had hit the \nWorld Trade Center in New York.\n\n  Not only did I stand still but the world has stood still. We were \nshocked; we were outraged at an unprovoked act of violence committed \nagainst thousands and thousands of innocent Americans.\n  Immediately, our President and Commander in Chief, George Bush, \nordered the Federal Government to assist the victims of the violence, \ninvestigate these acts of terror, and to take the steps to bring those \nresponsible for these tragedies to justice.\n  I fully support the President's actions and will do whatever I can as \nan individual to help him and our country in this time of need.\n  Terrorism, which has been condemned around the world, cannot and will \nnot be tolerated in this country. I know the President will take all \nmeasures necessary to seek out and to punish those who viciously \nattacked innocent and defenseless Americans.\n  We, as Americans, are a strong and resilient people. We will heal, \nand we will emerge stronger than ever. The strength and spirit of our \nRepublic and the democracy it represents will shine through. We will \nnot simply endure; we shall prevail. And we will send a sharp message \nto those cowards saying that terrorist acts will not be tolerated or \ncondoned. They will never be able to destroy the spirit of a free \npeople, the freedom we enjoy, and our way of life.\n  Our thoughts and our prayers go out to those who tragically lost \ntheir lives and to those friends and families who lost their loved \nones. This is far more than a tragedy to them. It is an outrageous act \nof terrorism that killed and injured so many innocent and decent \ncitizens of our country. Nothing I can say to express my sympathy for \nthose suffering is enough. My outrage of that cowardly act remains \nunwavering.\n  For now, we must mourn those who have passed on and care for those \nwho were injured. We must let the President, our law enforcement \npeople, military, and the intelligence community work. As a law-abiding \nnation--and we are a nation of laws--we must be sure to place the blame \non the guilty. Taking independent action against innocents or guests of \nour country has to be guarded against.\n  The anger I feel inside has to be tempered because decisions made \nwhile in this state are usually not good decisions. Many are filled \nwith that same anger and an unyielding desire for revenge. I realize we \nmust remain calm and focused. In the heat of passion, fired by \noutrageous, despicable acts of those who are guilty, our leaders must \nbe calm and dispassionate in determining who is responsible, where they \nare, and how we must deal with them.\n  Have no doubt, America, we will find those responsible. I say to \nthose who are responsible: You cannot hide. You can run, but you cannot \nhide. Justice will be served. It will be swift, and it will be harsh.\n  September 11,--9-11--2001, will live a long time in the memory of \nmany of us.\n  I was almost 7 years old on that Sunday, December 7, 1941. I remember \nthat day, and I can remember being a small lad growing up on a farm. My \nfolks talked to each other differently and so did the neighbors on \nMonday morning, the 8th, than any of us had ever heard before. I can \nremember when my mother yelled out of the house, because we had an old \nbattery radio and didn't have electricity in those days--Dad and I were \nin the barn choring. Mother said that the Japanese had bombed Pearl \nHarbor. My dad looked down at me and he said: ``Where is Pearl \nHarbor?'' We didn't even know. Next, the pictures came out of Pearl \nHarbor of the bellowing smoke from the Arizona and of the California \nlying half on its side. It remained in our minds for a long time.\n  I fear that the pictures of the World Trade Center and the damage \ndone there will live in the minds of young folks as Pearl Harbor did \nwith us. Tuesday's acts represented a well-planned, well-financed \nattack on our freedom by a faceless, gutless enemy.\n  I also want to warn the American people that we are at war. It can be \ncalled by no other name. So I stand firmly and proudly behind my \nCommander in Chief, the President of the United States. There is no \ndoubt about our unity and resolve to track down, root out, and \nrelentlessly pursue terrorists and the states that harbor them. I stand \nby to support our military and intelligence community and will fight \nfor all the resources they need to ensure our national security. Let us \nnot forget this as we consider our funding bills.\n  What is important and what is not important? We must sift through and \nsearch our souls. This is a great nation with a strong and brave \nhistory. Americans have come together and triumphed in difficult times \nsuch as these. We will do it again, and we will punish those \nresponsible. America remains resolved in its efforts to find those who \nso cowardly committed these horrific acts.\n  One always looks for words, but sometimes words escape us. That is \nkind of bad when words escape an auctioneer. But to quote a few words \nfrom the ``Battle Hymn of the Republic,'' those responsible will soon \nunderstand the true meaning of this line:\n\n       He hath loosed the faithful lightning of his terrible swift \n     sword.\n\n  I will tell you, America will do that, indeed, and America will march \non.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S9353]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I come to the Chamber with a \nvery heavy heart because of the tragedy so many people have \nexperienced. It has touched all of our lives in one way or another. So, \ntoo, I have had a personal experience just in the last few minutes of \nhow the tragedy has touched the life of my wife and me, for one of the \npassengers on the airliner that crashed into the World Trade Center was \na personal friend of our family, Sonia Puopolo of Boston and Miami.\n  I come to the Chamber to share this experience because the grief that \nso many across this Nation have felt is shared by all of us--of talking \nto Sonia's husband Dominic and to her daughter Tita, who are so full of \nlife and so upbeat and effervescent, talking to them in this condition \nwhere they still have the presence of mind in the midst of their \nunbelievable grief to be able to remember the good times, and Dominic \ntelling me about the 40-some years he had the privilege of knowing his \nwife and the 37 years of marriage, where he met her in Puerto Rico and \nwhere it was planned he was going to be on the same flight and how she \nhad insisted, no, she was going to Los Angeles so that she could be \nwith their son by herself and enjoy her son since Dominic had already \nbeen in Los Angeles with their son.\n  This is the part of tragedy that puts a human face on the tragedy, \nbut for Florida and Floridians it does not end there. A few minutes \nthereafter, I spoke by telephone with a courageous Fort Myers \npoliceman, Officer Lyles, who has now gathered with his family in \nanother part of Florida because it was his wife, Cee Cee Lyles, on the \nairliner that crashed in Pennsylvania, which we now know was headed for \nWashington and another target, perhaps this building; that she was able \nto get through to her husband by cell phone and he could hear the \nscreams in the background. She told him they had been hijacked, and she \ntold him she loved him and loved their children.\n  This is a part of the grieving process that is necessary for us to \nall go through, but it is also a poignant story of two lives that are \ntouching the State of Florida that gives us even more resolve of why we \nare going to find the perpetrators, we are going to hunt them down, and \nthey are going to be brought to justice.\n  I have seen America in this situation--and in my lifetime I have seen \nit several times--but the one I remember so vividly is the time of \nnational tragedy when the symbol of our technological prowess, the \nspace shuttle Challenger, in January of 1986, exploded in front of our \neyes. I recall that event because there was something from the \nexperience of that tragedy for the American people that was instructive \nto the rest of the world. That is, that Americans overcome. Americans \npersevere. When we are knocked down, we are not knocked out; we get up \nand we respond.\n\n  That has happened over and over in our history. It is part of our \ncharacter as an American people that we overcome. We saw it in the \nRevolutionary War. We have seen it in every war since. We saw it in the \nnational tragedy of the Challenger explosion, and we are seeing it \nagain in the national tragedy of this terrorist attack.\n  In the process of overcoming and persevering, we make right that \nwhich is wrong. And so, too, the American people are unified in our \ncommitment that we will find the perpetrators and they will be dealt \nwith.\n  This is not a time for revenge. We are a forgiving people. That is \npart of our nature. That is part of our Scriptural background. But we \nare also a proud people who will not let the national reputation be \nsullied; we will protect it.\n  I come to the Senate today out of my personal grief, having just had \none telephone conversation with a family who is convulsed in grief, and \nabout to have another telephone conversation with another Florida \nfamily who is suffering likewise, to say that I don't understand the \nplan that good people are taken, but I do understand the ultimate plan \nthat we are a nation blessed by God over and over and that God is \nprotecting us. America will not only survive, America will do as she \nhas so often done: America and Americans will overcome.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, our national will is being tested as it \nnever has before. On the clear, sunny morning of September 11, we were \nattacked from out of the shadows. There are no words to fully describe \nthe depth of this infamy. And not enough tears to properly mourn the \ninnocent lives so cruelly taken.\n  Thousands of families are grieving today over loved ones lost in this \nsenseless attack on our nation and all of us mourn with them and keep \nthem in our prayers.\n  But from within the depths of this horror, we saw and honor the \nheroism of our police and firefighters, many of whom gave their lives \ntrying to rescue others. We thank them and offer our condolences to \nthose who lost a loved one in the line of duty. We also offer our \nthanks to all the medical workers who are working tirelessly trying to \nsave lives.\n  While our enemy is still uncertain, our resolve must be unflinching. \nThose who thought they could bring us to our knees must instead see us \nstanding tall, united, and resolved to see that justice is done.\n  We stand firmly behind President Bush and his diplomatic and military \nefforts to discover who is behind these attacks and hold them \naccountable. The United States will respond decisively and forcefully \nagainst those who have perpetrated this atrocity and those who offer \nthem safe harbor and assistance.\n  I am also outraged by reports of price gouging at gasoline stations \naround the Nation. Those who would profit in our time of grief are not \nonly contemptible; in Michigan they are also criminals. The Michigan \nAttorney General has asked me to direct complaints to their regional \noffices.\n  Our Nation will come through this crisis even stronger than before. \nThose who attack from the shadows will see that we do not surrender to \nfear, but rather will go forward united in steely purpose and iron \nresolve. Even as we mourn, it is important that we carry on with the \nnation's business, with the immediate priority being to get help to the \nfamilies and communities that were the victims of this horrendous \nattack.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the tragedy that has befallen America is \nonly just beginning to fully sink in. The horror is so unimaginable, \nthe devastation so great and the suffering it leaves in its wake is \nalmost beyond our comprehension. We feel we have all, personally, been \ndealt a great blow, no matter where we live, whether or not we knew any \nof the victims. Our hearts go out to the many, many families who are \nsuffering, and in a very real sense, we feel as if we are one family \ntogether today.\n  As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, which has \njurisdiction over the Federal Emergency Management Agency--FEMA--I \npledge the full support of the committee to the relief effort. I would \nlike to read the text of a letter that my committee sent to the \nPresident today:\n\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to commend you and the \n     Administration for the Federal Government's response to the \n     horrific terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New \n     York and the Pentagon. In particular, we are encouraged and \n     impressed by the organization and coordination at the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency.\n       We and our staff stand ready to assist you in your efforts \n     in any way, including making any immediate changes to \n     statutes or program funding levels within the Committee's \n     jurisdiction that are necessary to implement measures to save \n     lives and restore safety and order as quickly as possible.\n       Thank you for your resolve and determination.\n       Sincerely, Members of the Committee of Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n  Of the thousands of people working in the World Trade Center complex, \n2,600 are Federal employees, working for a variety of Federal agencies. \nThe General Services Administration is working diligently to find \ntemporary office space so that these employees may get back to work as \nsoon as possible.\n  America picks up and goes on. We are shaken but we are not bowed. We \nare also comforted by the stories of great heroism that come flooding \nout of this tragedy, the stories of people going back for friends, \noffice workers carrying disabled colleagues down 80 flights of stairs, \nfirefighters and police rushing up the stricken towers in their frantic \neffort to save lives. Still today,\n\n[[Page S9354]]\n\nwe are watching rescue workers who have not slept in 2 days, continuing \nto dig through the rubble, exposing themselves to great hazards, \nrunning on adrenaline from the news that three people were just found \nalive today.\n  As more information comes to light, we are seeing a picture emerge of \nanother great act of heroism--the crashing of United Airlines Flight 93 \nin Pennsylvania. From what we can glean from phone calls from \npassengers on that flight, realizing that the hijackers planned to \ncrash their plane and learning that two hijacked planes had just \ncrashed into the World Trade Center, passengers decided to take action. \nWe can only surmise from their last words to family members that \nseveral passengers confronted the hijackers and the plane was prevented \nfrom completing its mission. It is unlikely that we will know for sure \nwhat target the hijackers had in mind, but we can be fairly certain \nthat brave passengers saved the lives of many hundreds or even \nthousands of people, and maybe even our own lives. I believe that all \nof America should be deeply grateful to them and their courage in the \nface of death.\n  America has closed ranks behind its President and its people. I am \nalso very pleased that so many of our allies have closed ranks behind \nus. Yesterday, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization--NATO--for the \nfirst time in its 52-year history, invoked collective defense \narrangements under Article 5 of its Charter that states that an attack \nupon one member of the alliance is viewed as an attack upon all. This \nreiteration of NATO solidarity is unprecedented and will be most \nhelpful in formulating a unified response. Condolences and offers of \nassistance have poured in from all regions of the world, giving us \nheart as we focus on the task ahead of us.\n  Fighting terrorism is an exceedingly difficult task. It will take \napplying ourselves in a way we have never done before. Ferreting out \nterrorists and destroying their networks will be long and arduous work. \nIt will require a concerted international effort and potentially great \npatience. We will need the strong cooperation of our allies, and we \nwill need to reach out to nations that are not our traditional allies. \nFighting terrorism is usually a frustrating task, as targets are \nelusive and the means of terror difficult to control. We still hope to \nlearn a great deal more about the perpetrators of this tragedy and \nuncover those who helped them. I expect that we will take firm action \nin retaliation. But this may take time, and it must be done in a manner \nthat will not unnecessarily provoke reprisals or generate additional \nacts of terrorism. I am confident that American resolve will remain \nfirm no matter how long or how difficult this fight.\n  In closing, I would like to recognize the contributions to the relief \neffort from my small State of Vermont. The Vermont Air Guard has \nalready flown many hours of additional missions as part of the effort \nto maintain security over American airspace. Vermont doctors, nurses, \nfirefighters, and rescue workers have volunteered in great numbers to \nhelp. All over the State, people have lined up to give blood. True to \ntheir history, Vermonters are quick to offer their help.\n  I see this strength replicated all across America. This makes me, and \nall Americans, proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/13/senate-section/article/S9354-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now resume \nconsideration of H.R. 2500, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2500) making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, \n     and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2002, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Dorgan amendment No. 1542, to increase funds for the trade \n     enforcement and trade compliance activities of the \n     International Trade Administration and to reduce funds for TV \n     Marti.\n       Dorgan amendment No. 1543, to prohibit the sale of disaster \n     loans authorized under section 7(b) of the Small Business \n     Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am awaiting the attendance of the Senator from New \nHampshire who is in an important conference at the moment. Let me bring \nmy colleagues up to speed. We have tried our best, working out certain \namendments all yesterday and earlier this morning--those that would be \naccepted, those that would be included in the managers' amendment, and \nthose that would still be pending. On both sides we are trying to \nassemble the determinant list of pending amendments. When we do, we \nwill ask unanimous consent and see if we can facilitate the disposition \nof this bill today, and no later than tomorrow. We will see what best \ncan be done.\n  Pending that, let me say a word about the efforts of your \nsubcommittee of Commerce, Justice, State in the field of \ncounterterrorism. For example, in early May, your subcommittee, under \nthe leadership of Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, chairman at that \ntime, held 3 days of comprehensive hearings of which I now hold a \ntranscript.\n  On May 8, we had a hearing with Department of the Treasury Secretary \nPaul O'Neill; Department of Defense Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz; \nSecretary of State Colin Powell; and Secretary of Transportation Norman \nMineta.\n  That afternoon, we had a hearing with FEMA Director Joseph Allbaugh; \nNational Security Administrator John A. Gordon; and Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission Chairman Richard A. Meserve.\n  On May 9, at that hearing, we had Attorney General John Ashcroft; \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson; Commerce \nSecretary, Don Evans; and in the afternoon, Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs, Anthony Principi; Secretary of Agriculture, Ann Veneman; and \nSecretary of the Interior, Gale Norton.\n  On May 10, we had the joint task force civil support commander, Gen. \nBruce Lawlor; the American Red Cross president and chief executive \nofficer, Dr. Bernadine Healy; a panel of State and local \nrepresentatives from fire, police, public health, and emergency \nmanagement. And then in the afternoon, we closed the session with the \nDirector of the CIA, George Tenet; the FBI Director, Judge Louis Freeh, \nand VADM Thomas Wilson.\n  We were trying our best to lay the groundwork for better coordination \nof our effort on counterterrorism. I ask unanimous consent to have the \nstatement by President Bush, dated May 8, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         President George W. Bush,\n                                         White House, May 8, 2001.\n\n                       Statement by the President\n\n\n       domestic preparedness against weapons of mass destruction\n\n       Protecting America's homeland and citizens from the threat \n     of weapons of mass destruction is one of our Nation's \n     important national security challenges. Today, more nations \n     possess chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons than ever \n     before. Still others seek to join them. Most troubling of \n     all, the list of these countries includes some of the world's \n     least-responsible states--states for whom terror and \n     blackmail are a way of life. Some non-state terrorist groups \n     have also demonstrated an interest in acquiring weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n       Against this backdrop, it is clear that the threat of \n     chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons being used against \n     the United States--while not immediate--is very real. That is \n     why our Nation actively seeks to deny chemical, biological, \n     and nuclear weapons to those seeking to acquire them. That is \n     why, together with our allies, we seek to deter anyone who \n     would contemplate their use. And that is also why we must \n     ensure that our Nation is prepared to defend against the harm \n     they can inflict.\n       Should our efforts to reduce the threat to our country from \n     weapons of mass destruction be less than fully successful, \n     prudence dictates that the United States be fully prepared to \n     deal effectively with the consequences of such a weapon being \n     used here on our soil.\n       Today, numerous Federal departments and agencies have \n     programs to deal with the consequences of a potential use of \n     a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapon in \n     the United States. Many of these Federal programs offer \n     training, planning, and assistance to state and local \n     governments. But\n\n[[Page S9355]]\n\n     to maximize their effectiveness, these efforts need to be \n     seamlessly integrated, harmonious, and comprehensive.\n       Therefore, I have asked Vice President Cheney to oversee \n     the development of a coordinated national effort so that we \n     may do the very best possible job of protecting our people \n     from catastrophic harm. I have also asked Joe Allbaugh, the \n     Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to \n     create an Office of National Preparedness. This Office will \n     be responsible for implementing the results of those parts of \n     the national effort overseen by Vice President Cheney that \n     deal with consequence management. Specifically it will \n     coordinate all Federal programs dealing with weapons of mass \n     destruction consequence management within the Departments of \n     Defense, Health and Human Services, Justice, and Energy, the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, and other federal agencies. \n     The Office of National Preparedness will work closely with \n     state and local governments to ensure their planning, \n     training, and equipment needs are addressed. FEMA will also \n     work closely with the Department of Justice, in its lead role \n     for crisis management, to ensure that all facets of our \n     response to the threat from weapons of mass destruction are \n     coordinated and cohesive. I will periodically chair a meeting \n     of the National Security Council to review these efforts.\n       No governmental responsibility is more fundamental than \n     protecting the physical safety of our Nation and its \n     citizens. In today's world, this obligation includes \n     protection against the use of weapons of mass destruction. I \n     look forward to working closely with Congress so that \n     together we can meet this challenge.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We noted in this statement that the President appointed \nVice President Cheney to conduct hearings, devise a comprehensive \nstudy, and develop a position with respect to coordination, and he \ndesignated in the same instrument Joseph Allbaugh, the Director of \nFEMA, to create an Office of National Preparedness responsible for the \nimplementation of the results.\n  He asked that FEMA's Director coordinate all Federal programs dealing \nwith weapons of mass destruction and consequence management within the \nDepartments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Justice, the EPA, \nand the other Federal agencies.\n  It was our considered judgment that FEMA was not going to be the \nappropriate office to handle, certainly, the prevention of any kind of \nterrorism. Since terrorism is now not only admitted to be a crime, but \nmore than that, an act of war--which this particular Senator believes \nit to be--you have to go with the Department of Justice.\n\n  The President, of course, at a time of war, is really the director. \nBut for the peacetime coordination--let's call it that--the \nsubcommittee thought it best not to be implemented by a \ncounterterrorism, or terrorism, czar--we know what drug czars have \ndone; very little, in all candor.\n  On the contrary, the subcommittee unanimously passed out within the \nCommittee of Appropriations itself--and I read on page 10:\n\n       The United States is in the beginning stages of developing \n     an organizational structure for leadership in the area of \n     terrorism preparedness. A National Coordinator for Security, \n     Infrastructure Protection, and Counterterrorism was \n     established 4 years ago within the National Security Council. \n     Under Presidential Decision Directive 62, the National \n     Coordinator was tasked with coordinating interagency \n     terrorism policy issues and reviewing ongoing terrorism-\n     related activities. While the designation of a National \n     Coordinator signaled the previous Administration's \n     recognition of the weight of the problem, it was not a \n     permanent solution. Responsibility for developing national \n     security policy belongs to the President. However, it is the \n     responsibility of the Congress to provide the means to \n     implement a systematic and synchronized policy that will \n     achieve sustainable Federal, State, and local cooperation on \n     domestic terrorism issues. Whomever is responsible for \n     managing this Nation's activities to combat terrorism must be \n     accountable to the American people.\n       Despite increased attention to this problem over the last 5 \n     years, there remains considerable confusion over jurisdiction \n     at all levels of government. In order to improve coordination \n     and centralize the policy-making structure for domestic \n     terrorism within the Department of Justice, the Committee \n     recommends the creation of a Deputy Attorney General for \n     Combating Domestic Terrorism (DAG-CT). The Committee \n     recommends $23,000,000 for this purpose. The DAG-CT shall \n     have as its principal duty the overall coordination and \n     implementation of policy aimed at preventing, preparing for, \n     and responding to terrorist attacks within the United States. \n     This person will be directly responsible to the Attorney \n     General. This office will be responsible for domestic \n     terrorism policy development and coordination and will speak \n     for the Department on and coordinate with all of the \n     appropriate agencies for terrorism-related matters.\n\n  The subcommittee also committed, of course, at the full committee, \nthe authorization for that Deputy Attorney General, section 604. I \nread:\n\n       (b) Section 504 of title 28, United States Code, is amended \n     by inserting after ``General'' the following, ``and a Deputy \n     Attorney General for Combating Domestic Terrorism''.\n       (c) There is established within the Department of Justice \n     the position of Deputy Attorney General for Combating \n     Domestic Terrorism, who shall be appointed by the President, \n     by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n       (d) Subject to the authority of the Attorney General, the \n     Deputy Attorney General for Combating Domestic Terrorism \n     shall serve as the principal advisor to the Attorney General \n     on, and, with the Deputy Director of the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency, serve as one of two key government \n     officials responsible for domestic counterterrorism and \n     antiterrorism policy.\n\n  We tried, providing this, to put it in step with the President's \ndirective. Now, with the terrible events of the past two days, the \nWhite House, along with the leadership, has agreed on a $20 billion \npackage relative to counterterrorism and any activity the \nadministration deems necessary as a result of that terrorism.\n  Of course, the subcommittee would be willing to conform now or in \nconference with what the President and the leadership desire. But there \nmust be coordination and there must be a fixed responsibility if we are \nreally going to handle this particular problem. I am confident the \nAmerican people would agree with us that we have to have better \ncoordination from the very get-go; namely, with respect to \nintelligence.\n  I got into that intelligence game almost 50 years ago, in 1954 as a \nmember of the Hoover Commission investigating intelligence activities. \nAt that particular time we had good covert activity, fine agents buried \nwithin the Soviet Union and other places. There is not any question, if \nwe can get into the Soviet Union, we can get into Osama bin Laden and \nHamas, and Hezbollah, and any other of these terrorist groups.\n  We used to read all these articles about how difficult intelligence \nwork was. It is not an easy thing, where you just call to find \nsomething out. On the contrary, you work at it.\n  Our friend Tom Clancy just momentarily said, of the 20,000 employees \nout there at the CIA, we only have about 800 in covert operations. And \nto quote General Schwarzkopf after Desert Storm--I will never forget a \nbriefing we had at the Appropriations Committee Defense Subcommittee--\nhe said he could not depend on intelligence from the CIA, that it was \nmush.\n  The reason he called it mush was he said it was so overanalyzed, the \ncorners were cut, the edges were rounded, and everything else of that \nkind. I found out at that time they had 864 intelligence analyzers at \nthe CIA. Cold, hard facts are analyzed, analyzed, and analyzed, and \neveryone wants to protect their backsides, so in analyzing, you are \ngiving yourself a grade, you are not giving the cold, hard, \nintelligence fact. That is what General Schwarzkopf called it--mush. He \nsaid he had to depend on his pilots in Desert Storm.\n  Obviously, the problem persists with a massive attack upon the United \nStates in such a coordinated and deliberate fashion, and we have not an \ninkling. We know about Mogadishu; we know about the barracks in Saudi \nArabia; we know about the Embassy in Kenya; we know about the Embassy \nin Tanzania; we know about the U.S.S. Cole, we know about the prior \nattack on the World Trade towers. The leader of all that continues to \nsay he is really going to pull off an attack on the United States of \nAmerica. And when it occurs, we say we wonder who did it.\n  We are hard learners. We have to get going and get serious about this \nwar we are in. In that light, I want to make sure counterterrorism is \ncoordinated and we do everything possible to secure ourselves \ndomestically.\n  With respect to that, on Thursday morning at 9:30 we will have a \nmeeting and a hearing before the Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nfull Committee whereby we will hear from notably, I take it, the \nSecretary of Transportation, and Jane Garvey, the head of the Federal \nAviation Administration. Also, perhaps we will hear from the FBI in a \nclosed hearing ahead of time so that we will know exactly what is \nneeded and what the threat is.\n\n[[Page S9356]]\n\n  Eliminating the curbside check-in option as part of new federal \nsecurity standards announced yesterday doesn't fully address our \nsecurity problems. After all, luggage checked curbside or at the desk \nboth have to go through some type of scanner.\n  Unless and until we federalize the security screeners and the \nscanners that you find at airports, unless we federalize like the \nEuropean Governments, we are not going to get a better result than the \npresent one. And that is folks who are privately hired by the airlines \nworking for minimum wage, staying for an average of three months or so.\n  My wife had two knee replacements. She has titanium knees. We know \nthe metal detector is going to sound. I am trying to explain to the \nemployees there and they do not understand. We need trained \nprofessionals working in airport security.\n  Heightened security measures on airplanes are also needed. The \nairplane cabins need to be secure, so no one can get to the pilots. The \ndoor has to be made more stable and solid. There is no reason to open \nthe door. Tell pilots to bring a box lunch. They can communicate, if \nthere is an emergency, and if they identify it as an emergency. But if \na terrorist starts taking over the crew, they can hear it. They have \ncommunications. They can land the plane and save, hopefully, some of \nthe individuals.\n  But terrorists ought to know up front that they are not going to turn \na domestic flight into a weapon of mass destruction and just run it \ninto a building. That has to stop immediately.\n  I would like to be able to talk at length about what needs to be \ndone. But that is enough. I think perhaps the last talk should be about \nbetter orchestration, coordination, and action quietly. That is really \nwhat is needed at this particular time.\n  I ask colleagues if they have an amendment to please come to the \nfloor immediately. Let's present it, debate it, and have a vote on it. \nOtherwise, we will make up that list of amendments. I will soon be \njoined by the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Credit should go to the Senator from New Hampshire who set up these \nhearings. In May, he had everyone in the administration come, as you \ncan tell from this hearing record. It is the most comprehensive look-\nsee the Government has had with respect to terrorism this year.\n  We think we have to fix some responsibility, and we have to \nappropriate for it.\n  There is some $364 million for the various offices that you might see \non page 48 of the Committee report where you have the total activities \nto combat terrorism: Management and Administration, $8 million; Center \nfor Domestic Preparedness, Fort McClelland, AL, $30 million; for \nconsortium members, $58 million; National Energetic Materials Research \nand Testing Center in New Mexico, $7 million; National Emergency \nResponse and Rescue Training Center at Texas A, $7 million; National \nCenter for Bio-Med Research and Training, Louisiana State University, \n$7 million; National Exercise, Test and Training Center at Nevada Test \nSite, another $7 million; Domestic Preparedness Equipment Grants, $175 \nmillion; Dartmouth Institute for Security and Technology Studies, $18 \nmillion; Oklahoma City National Memorial Institute for the Prevention \nof Terrorism, $18 million; Virtual Medical Campus, $2 million; Domestic \nPreparedness Exercise Grants and Exercise Support Funds, $20 million; \nTOPFF II, $4 million; Annual Exercise Program, $5 million; Improved \nResponse Program, $3 million; other training, $35 million; technical \nassistance, $8 million; prepositioned equipment, $8 million; and Web \nSite Pilot, $2 million.\n\n  It adds up to around $364 million.\n  That really was a result of the Oklahoma bombing. We went in every \ndirection possible. But that is our problem. We are still going in \nevery direction. We are not coordinating. The responsibility is not \nfixed. Someone ought to be at that Cabinet table--the Attorney General \nwith his assistants talking with the President, who, of course, has the \nprime responsibility.\n  Let me say, so far so good. The country has responded admirably. I \nthink our Government is up and well and doing good.\n  There is a wonderful element of bipartisanship.\n  During the August break, I was on a trip in Australia, and up around \nThailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and China in the Pacific area. Everywhere \nI went, the Ambassador would get into the budget, and I would tell them \nhow we were running a heck of a deficit. I told them there wasn't any \nsurplus. Now everybody will admit to it. The law in Section 201 of the \nSocial Security Act of 1935 says that if there's a surplus in the \nSocial Security trust fund, then we must invest that in government \nnotes. We take the money, but we don't give it to Social Security.\n  Under Section 13-301 of the Budget Act, it says thou shall not use \nthat money. Follow section 21 of the Greenspan report of 1983, which \nconcurs. It says thou shall not use this money against the deficit, or \nin the general revenues to account for lowering the deficit. But we do. \nWe have done it since President Johnson's time. Up to President \nJohnson's time, we never did. But President Johnson didn't do it. He \nhad a surplus in 1968-1969 without the use of Social Security funds.\n  In any event, I said to each one of these Ambassadors that our \nproblem back in the States is that we need some national purpose. We \nare just running around with courthouse politics. It is a shameful \nthing. We can't do anything but argue about who is responsible for the \ndeficit, or who is going to invade the trust fund, or stem cell \nresearch. The country is really asleep. The leadership is in all \ndirections. What we really need is a national purpose. I think at least \nin the last 48 hours we now have a national purpose. We know who the \nenemy is. Let's characterize it: People who give up their life for a \ncause, we will call them the enemy. But they call them heroes.\n\n  Let's depict this properly. It is the leadership. And I commend the \nPresident for saying we are not only going to hold those responsible, \nbut the countries that harbor them. I think he is right on target.\n  But that is the whole idea now. We are in this war together. We are \nworking together. I think that has helped this particular bill along. \nWe are going to try to get a finite list of amendments.\n  Now, with my ranking member here, I yield to Senator Gregg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I thank the chairman for yielding to me. \nI appreciate his courtesy in my arriving in the Chamber a little late \nfor the beginning of this work, as a group of us were in a meeting on \nhow we are going to handle this bill and move it along, I hope.\n  I congratulate the chairman of the committee for this bill, which is \na soothsayer bill really. Long before the events of the day before \nyesterday, which were so horrific and which reflected the threat of \nterrorism to our Nation, our committee aggressively pursued the issue \nof how to try to prepare for such an act.\n  We have held innumerable hearings over the last 4 or 5 years. One of \nthe lines that has flowed through all those hearings has been the fact \nthat our intelligence community--our communities focused on domestic \nintelligence and our communities focused on international \nintelligence--had concluded that it was more than likely, it was a \nprobability, that a terrorist event would occur in the United States \nand that it would be of significant proportions. And it has occurred.\n  How have we tried to ready for this? Well, a lot of the response you \nsaw in New York--which has been overwhelming and incredibly \nprofessional, and heroic beyond description, which has taken the lives \nof many firefighters and police officers and just citizens who went to \nhelp--a lot of that response was coordinated as a result of initiatives \nthat came out of the hearing process, and the question of first \nresponder, and how we get the people who are first there up to speed as \nto how to handle this type of event. So in that area at least there has \nbeen some solace.\n  But the real issue remains, How do you deal with an enemy who, as the \nchairman just related, is willing to give their life to make their \npoint and who has, as their source of support, religious fervor, in \nmost instances--and I suspect this is going to be proved true\n\n[[Page S9357]]\n\nin this instance--a religious fervor which gives them a community of \nsupport and praise which causes them to be willing to proceed in the \nway that they did, which is to use their life to take other innocent \nlives?\n  First, how do you identify those individuals because they function as \na fairly small-knit group, and it is mostly familial. It involves \nfamilies. It involves sects which are very insular and very hard to \npenetrate.\n  But equally important, when you are trying to deal with that type of \na personality and that type of a culture, which basically seeks \nmartyrdom as its cause, as its purpose for life, and sees martyrdom as \npart of its process for getting to an afterlife in terms of their \nreligious belief--how do you deal with that culture and group of \nindividuals without creating more problems, without creating more \npeople who are willing to take up the banner of hatred and willing to \npursue and use their life in a way to aggravate the situation?\n  I think we as a committee have concluded that the first thing you \nhave to do is have a huge new commitment to intelligence. And we have \nmade this point. We have dramatically expanded the overseas efforts of \nthe FBI as an outreach of this effort. But it involves more than that.\n  We have to set aside our natural inclination as a democracy to limit \nthe type of people we deal with in the area of human intelligence. \nUnfortunately, the CIA in the 1990s was essentially limited and \ndefanged, for all intents and purposes, in the area of human \nintelligence gathering because the directives and the policies did not \nallow us, as a nation, to direct our key intelligence community to \nbasically go out and employ and use people who were individuals who \ncould give us the information we needed. Because of our reticence as a \ndemocracy to use people who themselves may be violent and criminal, we \nfound ourselves basically sightless when it came to individual \nintelligence.\n  So we have to recognize that in a period of war, which is what I \nthink everyone characterizes this as, and which it truly is, we are, as \na nation, going to have to be willing to be more aggressive in the use \nof human intelligence, and we are going to have to allow our agencies \nin the international community to be more aggressive.\n  Equally important, we, as a nation, because of our natural \ninclination and our very legitimate rules relative to search and \nseizure and invasion of privacy, have been very reticent to give our \nintelligence communities the technical capability necessary to address \nspecifically encoding mechanisms.\n  The sophistication of encoding mechanisms has become overwhelming. I \nasked Director Freeh at one hearing when he was Director of the FBI--\nand I remember this rather vividly because I didn't expect this \nresponse at all--what was the most significant problem the FBI faced as \nthey went forward. He pretty much said it was the encryption capability \nof the people who have an intention to hurt America, whether it \nhappened to be the drug lords or whether it happened to be terrorist \nactivity.\n  It used to be that we had the capability to break most codes because \nof our sophistication. This has always been something in which we, as a \nnation, specialized. We have a number of agencies that are dedicated to \nit. But the quantum leap that has occurred in the past to encrypt \ninformation--just from telephone conversation to telephone \nconversation, to say nothing of data--has gotten to a point where even \nour most sophisticated capability runs into very serious limitations.\n\n  So we need to have cooperation. This is what is key. We need to have \nthe cooperation of the manufacturing community and the inventive \ncommunity in the Western World and in Asia in the area of electronics. \nThese are folks who have as much risk as we have as a nation, and they \nshould understand, as a matter of citizenship, they have an obligation \nto allow us to have, under the scrutiny of the search and seizure \nclauses, which still require that you have an adequate probable cause \nand that you have court oversight--under that scrutiny, to have our \npeople have the technical capability to get the keys to the basic \nencryption activity.\n  This has not happened. This simply has not happened. The \nmanufacturing sector in this area has refused to do this. And it has \nbeen for a myriad of reasons, most of them competitive. But the fact \nis, this is something on which we need international cooperation and on \nwhich we need to have movement in order to get the information that \nallows us to anticipate an event similar to what occurred in New York \nand Washington.\n  The only way you can stop that type of a terrorist event is to have \nthe information beforehand as to who is committing the act and their \ntargets. And there are two key ways you do that. One is through people \non the ground, on which we need to substantially increase the effort--\nand this bill attempts to do that in many ways through the FBI--and the \nother way is through having the technical capability to intercept the \ncommunications activities and to track the various funding activities \nof the organizations. That requires the cooperation of the commercial \nworld and the people who are active in the commercial world. That call \nmust go forth, in my opinion.\n\n  Another thing this bill does, which is extremely positive and which, \nagain, regrettably anticipated the event, is to say that within our own \nFederal Government we are not doing a very good job of coordinating our \nexercise.\n  There are 42 different agencies that are responsible for intelligence \nactivity and for counterterrorism activity. They overlap in \nresponsibility. In many instances, they compete in responsibility.\n  Turf is the most significant inhibitor of effective Federal action \nbetween agencies. Although there is a sincere effort to avoid turf, and \nin my opinion, in working with a lot of these agencies, I have been \nincredibly impressed by a willingness of the various leaders of these \nagencies, both under the Clinton administration and under the Bush \nadministration, to set aside this endemic problem of protection of \none's prerogatives and allow parties to communicate across agency lines \nand to put aside the stovepipes. Even though there is that commitment, \nthe systems do not allow it to occur in many instances.\n  This bill, under the leadership of the chairman, includes language \nwhich has attempted to bring more focus and structure into the cross-\nagency activities. One of the specific proposals in the bill, which may \nnot be the last approach taken and probably won't be but is an attempt \nto move the issue down the field, is to set up a Deputy Attorney \nGeneral whose purpose is to oversee counterterrorism activity and \ncoordinate it across agencies and who is the repository of the \nauthority to do that. There is no such person today in the Federal \nGovernment. Of these 42 agencies, everybody reports to their own agency \nhead. Nobody reports across agency lines. There is virtually no one who \ncan stand up and say, other than the President, ``get this done.''\n  The purpose of the Deputy Attorney General is to accomplish that, at \nleast within the law enforcement area and within much of the \nconsequence manager's area, especially the crime area, although it is \nunderstood that this individual will work in concert with the head of \nFEMA, the purpose of which is to actually manage the disaster relief \nefforts that occur as a result of an event such as New York or where \nyou have these huge efforts committed.\n  That type of coordination is so critical. Would it have abated the \nNew York and Washington situation? No, it wouldn't have. But can it, in \nanticipation of the next event, because this is not an isolated event. \nRegrettably, whether we like it or not, we are in a continuum of \nconfrontation here.\n  As I mentioned earlier, there is not one or two people but rather a \nculture that sees this as an expression of the way they deliver their \nmessage for life, or after life for that matter. Regrettably, we have \nto be ready for the potential of another event.\n  I do believe this type of centralizing of decision, centralizing \nauthority, centralizing the budget responsibility is absolutely \ncritical to getting the Federal Government into an orderly set of \nactivities or orderly set of approaches.\n  Just take a single example. If you happen to be a police officer in \nEpping, NH, and you have a sense that you notice something that isn't \nright, you know it isn't necessarily criminal but you think there is \nsomething wrong, something that might just, because of your intuition \nas an officer or your\n\n[[Page S9358]]\n\nknowledge as an officer, might need to be reported, you can call your \nState police or you can call the FBI or you can call the U.S. attorney, \nbut there really is no central clearinghouse for knowledge. There is no \none-stop shopping. If you as a fire chief want to get ready in Epping, \nNH, for an event, you don't have a place to go for that one-stop \nshopping where you can find out how you train your people, where they \ngo for training, what your support capabilities are going to be, who is \ngoing to support you. This should exist within the Federal Government. \nIt does not. This is an attempt to try to get some of that into a form \nthat will be effective and responsive to people.\n\n  Of course, when you get to the end of the line--we have talked about \nall the technical things we can do as a government and all the \nimportant things we can do to try to restructure ourselves and commit \nthe resources in order to improve our capacity to address this, but in \nthe end it comes down to a commitment of our people, understanding that \nwe are confronting a fundamental evil, an evil of proportions equal to \nany that we have confronted as a nation, and that we as a nation cannot \nallow those who are behind this evil to undermine our way of life and \nour commitment to democracy.\n  We must make every effort, leave no stone unturned--regrettably, \nthese people live under stones to a large degree--to find these people \nwho are responsible and to bring them to justice. But we also must make \nevery effort to recognize that in doing that, we cannot allow them to \nwin by losing our basic rights and the commitment to openness as a \nsociety and a democracy. Then they would be successful, if we were to \ndo that.\n  So as we rededicate ourselves, as we all continue to see the image of \nthose buildings collapsing and the horror that followed--and we all \nobviously want retribution and we are all angered by it--we have to \nreact in the context of a democracy. We have to pursue this in the \ncontext of what has made us great, which is that we are a people who \nunite when we confront such a threat. We unite and we focus our \nenergies on defeating that threat. But we don't allow that threat to \nwin by undermining our basic rights and our openness as a society.\n  In summary, I appreciate all the efforts of the chairman of the \ncommittee to bring forward a bill which, regrettably, understood that \nthis type of event could occur and attempted to address it even before \nit did. Now I think it is important we pass this legislation. It does \nempower key agencies within the Government who have a responsibility to \naddress the issue of counterterrorism not only with the dollars but \nwith the policies they need in order to be more successful in their \nefforts.\n  There is still a great deal to do. There is still a lot of changes we \nneed to make, a lot of changes in the law we should make in order to \nempower these agencies to be even more effective. Certainly there is \ngoing to be a great deal more funds that have to be committed than what \nare in this bill in order to give these agencies--the FBI and the State \nDepartment--the resources they need to be strong and be successful in \npursuing the people who committed this horrific act and in protecting \nAmericans around the world and especially protecting our freedoms and \nliberties here in the United States.\n  This bill is clearly a step in the right direction. I congratulate \nthe chairman for bringing it forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Conrad are printed in today's Record under \nMorning Business.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have two of the finest managers in the \nSenate working this bill--the Senator from South Carolina and the \nSenator from New Hampshire. We need to move this bill along. We need \nhelp from the membership of this Senate. Staff has worked hard to work \ndown the amendments, and they have a fairly finite list now. But there \nis talk now that there are some issues still unresolved by Members of \nthe Senate.\n  We are going to have a recess, by virtue of a previous order, at \n12:30. I am going to recommend to Senator Daschle and Senator Hollings \nwhen we come back at 2:15--or whatever time it is--that we move beyond \nthis point of people having disagreements with certain parts of this \nbill. If people are going to be in disagreement, let them come out here \nand tell us what is wrong with the bill.\n  We need to move forward. This is a very important piece of \nlegislation. It is our sixth appropriations bill. When we finish, we \nstill have seven to go. We haven't had conferences on the ones we \npassed. This country is in a state of emergency. We need to do the work \nof the Congress, and the work of the Congress at this stage, nearing \nthe end of the appropriations season, is to finish these bills by the \nend of the fiscal year. That is looking very dubious at this time. So \nwe have to move forward.\n  I repeat, the two managers are the best we have, or as good as we \nhave; that is for certain. We have to move this bill along.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, the distinguished Senator--other than \nhis reference to me--is on target. We have a bill that was passed not \nonly unanimously out of subcommittee but the full committee. It has \nbeen before the Senate last week and this week. Everyone knows the \nprovisions within the bill. I was just told by a colleague who had \nserved previously in the House--he said the reading clerk reads each \nsection as they go through each section, and you have to be there and \npropose your amendment. After that, the amendment is passed or defeated \nand they go to the next section. You cannot offer an amendment to one \nthat has already been read and passed upon.\n  We have to devise some other way. We are sitting around here in \ncharge of the business of the Senate pleading. We should not be \npleading. I do not want to be like Al Haig--``I'm in charge''--but I \ncan make a motion for third reading and they can defeat the motion or \nwe can have a live quorum and get everybody here and disrupt them. We \nare going to have to take disruptive action, or something, to get some \nkind of response. The leader is exactly right. The country is in a \nstate of serious purpose now, and they do not want any dallying around \nand ``I have to have this amendment,'' ``I have to have that,'' and \nthey want me to put it in. Let them propose it. I heard one amendment \nhas $70 million all of a sudden. We do not have any moneys like that. \nWe have our 302(b) allocation.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I want to say this also. This bill was brought from the \nsubcommittee and the full committee to the floor prior to this \nsituation that took place in New York. If there were ever a vision two \nmen had, it is this bill. This bill deals with terrorism. That is what \nis in this bill. If there were ever an appropriate time to pass this \nlegislation, it is now. There is a provision in this legislation that \nsets up within the Justice Department somebody who will work on \ncounterterrorism. This is very fine legislation, and it is very \nappropriate for the day and time in the history of this country. We \nhave to move this bill forward.\n  The Senator is absolutely right. The Senator from Louisiana, who was \njust here, and I served in the House, as the Senator from New Hampshire \nserved in the House. When you have a section in a bill in the House and \nyou are not there to offer your amendment, you are out of luck; it is \ntough luck. Here we wait around begging people to come to the floor and \ndo the business of the Senate. That is not the way it should be.\n\n[[Page S9359]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished leader.\n  I immediately give credit to the ranking member, the Senator from New \nHampshire, who as chairman had the vision that it was necessary we have \nsome coordination and a full comprehensive review of the problem of \nterrorism and how to respond to it. It was under his leadership that we \nhave these sections in the bill. Now we are ready to move. We are ready \nto go to third reading, and we are ready to pass it. The two leaders \nare here.\n  I again suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been meeting with the two managers of \nthe bill. It appears we are very close to working something out. \nHowever, it does not appear we can offer a unanimous consent agreement \nat this time. Those Members who have some problems with this \nlegislation, if we don't work something out between 12:30 and 2:15, \nthey will have to come on the floor at 2:15 and personally object; \notherwise, the managers of the bill will move to third reading.\n  We have cooperated, and we appreciate very much those people who have \ninterest in this bill working with us to this point, but we are down to \nthe nitty-gritty where we need to get the bill done.\n  This is such good legislation. I repeat what I said a short time ago. \nThis bill has some very important items in it for antiterrorism. It has \nwithin the Department of Justice a coordinator for antiterrorism \nactivities that was written long before the New York terror took place. \nThis bill is so important to what took place that we need to finish \nthis bill today.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the counsel of the assistant \nDemocratic leader. I would note that there are a number of Senators who \nhave amendments. We expect to protect those amendments. At no later \nthan 2:30, I hope, we will have a complete list, and we will work \ntowards that. My expectation is that we have heard already from \neveryone who has an amendment. We are pretty close to having a complete \nlist.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we were scheduled to recess at 12:30. I ask \nunanimous consent we extend the time for speaking until 12:40, as the \nSenator from New York has a very important message to deliver to the \nSenate.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will that be in morning business?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have heard the discussions about the \nbill on the floor, the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. As \nthe chairman and ranking member know, I have offered two amendments, \none of which is fairly controversial. My proposition would be that I \nwithdraw that amendment. I will chat about it for 1 minute. I \nunderstand from discussions we have had that the chairman and ranking \nmember would approve my second amendment by a voice vote, and I propose \nI be allowed to withdraw the amendment dealing with eliminating funding \nfor TV Marti and using that money instead to enhance enforcement and \ncompliance in international trade.\n  I will ask consent to do that in a moment. Things have changed very \nsubstantially and now is not the time for this discussion. That doesn't \nmean I don't believe during this appropriations process this year, \neither in conference or in some other device, we ought not do what I \npropose in my amendment. I believe very strongly in my amendment that \nidentified $10 to $11 million of tragic waste of the taxpayers money \nand identified an area that cries out in a desperate need: our trading \npartners like compliance of enforcement of our trade laws dealing with \nChina, Japan, Europe, Mexico, and Canada.\n  Although I ask consent to withdraw the TV Marti amendment if we have \nreached agreement on the other amendment, I want everyone to understand \nthat this is not necessarily the end of that discussion this year. But \nI think it is probably better not to continue the discussion at this \ntime.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I appreciate the Senator's understanding and \nwillingness to withdraw the first amendment. I will see if we have an \nunderstanding.\n  Mr. GREGG. My understanding is we reached agreement with the Senator.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let's agree to the amendment now.\n  Mr. GREGG. Have the yeas and nays been requested on either amendment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Can we call that amendment up?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1543\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The small business amendment is the pending \nquestion.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \n(No. 1543) of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The amendment (No. 1543) was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1542, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask consent to be allowed to withdraw the amendment I \noffered dealing with funding for TV Marti and trade compliance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota \nvery much.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me just say again that while I have \nwithdrawn that particular amendment, I believe very strongly that we \nneed to revisit this as we go along in this process. I think this is \nnot the time to do that. I have talked to the Senator from South \nCarolina, who I know has some feelings about this as well. We will \nrevisit this later in this process.\n  Let me say how much I appreciate the work of the Senators from South \nCarolina and New Hampshire; they have done so much work on this bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/13/senate-section/article/S9359-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9359-S9361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL SUPPORT FOR NEW YORK\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I wanted to take just a few minutes of \nmorning business to report to my colleagues about my visit, along with \nSenator Schumer, to New York yesterday, to convey the appreciation that \nNew Yorkers feel, starting with our Governor and our mayor but going \ndown through the people whom I saw--whether they were a firefighter, or \npolice officer, or emergency medical technician, or someone standing on \nthe street--for the unified and extraordinary support that has been \ndemonstrated by our entire country, starting with our President.\n  Senator Schumer and I flew to New York with Administrator Joe \nAllbaugh, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for \nthe purpose of assessing the damage and attending a very long briefing \nwith the Governor and mayor and their respective staff who are on the \nfront lines dealing with this tragedy.\n  We took a military plane from Andrews and flew to LaGuardia where we \ngot into helicopters. The helicopters flew us to the tip of Manhattan \nwhere we circled from the East River toward the Hudson and were close \nenough in to see the burning debris, to see the wreckage, the crumpled \ndestruction of the buildings that had once stood there--a sight that \nthe only comparable basis I think most living Americans would have, \nsuch as our distinguished senior Member, Senator Inouye, is what war \nwas like in World War II, or Korea, or Vietnam.\n  We took another pass so we could get in a little bit closer. As we \ndid, we saw dozens and dozens of people running away from the site. We \nlater learned that the continuing danger from these structurally \ndamaged and unsafe buildings had driven our rescue workers out.\n  We landed at the heliport on the East Side and went in to meet with \nthe mayor and the Governor. We had some time to talk with the press, \nwhere everyone expressed the solidarity and unity that the people of \nNew York are\n\n[[Page S9360]]\n\ncertainly feeling between and among themselves, and that we are \ngrateful for the support that our President, our Congress, our entire \nGovernment, and people have given New York.\n  We then went in a convoy down to the site. I wish every one of my \ncolleagues could have been with us, because the streets were lined with \npeople holding American flags and signs expressing their gratitude and \ntheir thanks to the many workers and volunteers who had come to help, \nand a real sense of resolve and demonstration of support for our \nNation.\n  Because of the difficulties with the buildings, we were not able to \ngo in as close as we had originally planned. So we stopped at a place \nshort of the immediate area that one could approach and still not \ninterfere with the search and rescue mission or be in danger. We put on \nour masks because the acrid smell of the still burning debris is \nextraordinarily oppressive. We got a briefing on the spot from some of \nthe people who were directly in charge of the work that is being done.\n  I felt as though I were on the edge of hell. I watched the smoke \nrising. I could see the twisted wreckage, and I had a much clearer \nvisual image because of my helicopter view. I saw the people who have \nbeen there hour after hour since this vicious attack occurred coming \ntoward me. Their shift was over. They were seeking some respite--\nfirefighters in their uniforms covered from head to toe with dust and \ndebris, exhausted, and dragging their fire axes with them.\n  The impression and feeling that one gets from actually being even as \nclose as I was is so much greater with respect to the devastation than \nwe see on our television screens. The television in a sense contains a \nminiaturized view of what has happened in New York.\n  When we then stood there for a few minutes--and that is all we were \nable to spend there--we visited with people who were looking for their \nlost loved ones. One mother in particular had just come down to the \narea hoping against hope to hear something about her son. Residents who \nhad lost their apartments, their offices, and their businesses were \nstanding on the side of a familiar street in a totally awful, \ninexplicable new circumstance.\n  We then went to the police academy which has been set up to be the \ncommand center since the city's command center was lost in the collapse \nof one of the ancillary buildings to the two towers, and we had a very \nlong and very informative briefing from the mayor, from the Governor, \nand from all of the people on the front lines--the police commissioner \nand others who talked about where they were in the struggle that they \nare engaged in against this massive mountain of debris.\n  Just that night they had moved out more than 120 dump trucks filled \nwith debris. The estimate from the Army Corps of Engineers is that \nthere will be at least 500,000 tons of debris.\n  In addition to the immediate search and rescue and cleanup work that \nhas to go on, the power situation, the loss of energy and telephone and \ncommunication services, has meant that the New York Stock Exchange \ncould not open for business yesterday. It has meant that there are \nstill many offices of our major financial institutions unable to \nreopen.\n  The humanitarian needs are enormous. There is an armory down on \nLexington Avenue at about 25th or 26th Street that will be open for \nthose whose family members and loved ones and friends are missing so \nthat they can go down and identify, and have that registered, and \nprovide additional information that may be required for identification.\n  The overall impression that I certainly take from that experience \nyesterday is of the pride I feel in the work that is being done, of the \nleadership given by our mayor and our Governor, of our police and fire \nand emergency personnel, the extraordinary readiness of our hospitals \nto care for the injured, the tragedies--there are not as many injured \nas they had expected--and the realization that we have a very big job \nahead of us, a job of cleaning up and rebuilding and reconstructing.\n\n  I asked for some estimate from the mayor and the Governor as to what \nwe were looking at because this is something for which we have to plan. \nThey were obviously unable to say what the total estimate would be of \nthe costs that have already been incurred and will necessarily have to \nbe incurred in the future, but they know that they could immediately \nexplain and justify $20 billion of direct costs. We will be asking our \ncolleagues for a show of support, as a way of recognizing that the \nepicenter of this attack on our country occurred in New York City.\n  I took a late train back last night because I needed to be here to \nwork with my colleagues on not only the further understanding of the \nlevel of devastation and need that has occurred but to answer questions \nand to be available as we continue to try to sort out what kind of \nnational response is required.\n  I am very pleased that the President will be going to New York \ntomorrow afternoon. I applaud and salute him for that decision. I know \nit was a difficult decision because of the security issues that \nsurround the movement of any President. I personally, on behalf of my \nconstituents, thank him.\n  I will be meeting, along with Senator Schumer, and others, at the \nWhite House this afternoon with the President, where I will personally \nnot only convey my appreciation for his leadership, his commitment, and \nhis visit tomorrow, but also the specifics about the requests that the \nGovernor and the mayor have made for additional and specific Federal \nassistance.\n  In addition, I introduced legislation earlier today that will be \ncosponsored by many colleagues on both sides of the aisle. It has an \nidentical companion bill in the House. It is S. 1422, which will \nexpedite the process by which the Federal Government provides benefits \nto the families of public safety officers, firefighters, police \nofficers, emergency service personnel, and others who lost their lives \nin the line of duty.\n  I am very pleased, once again, that the President, in his video-phone \nconversation with the mayor and the Governor, stated his strong support \nfor this legislation.\n  It has been said that more public safety officers lost their lives in \nthe terrorist attack against the United States on September 11 than in \nany other single event in modern history.\n  We may not know exactly how many rescuers gave the ultimate sacrifice \nyet, but I was told by the acting commissioner yesterday that they are \nmissing 300 firefighters.\n  I just was handed a note that is a very good piece of news, that they \nhave just found two firefighters and one citizen still alive, which is \nwhy the search and rescue mission has to continue. We cannot give up. \nWe know from cell phone communication and from the experience and \nintuition of our firefighters and rescue personnel on the scene that it \nis still possible--as we just learned--for people to be alive buried \nunder that rubble. We will not give up until we find every single \nperson.\n  Yet when we look at who is on the front lines, it is not me carrying \nthe ax. It is not me as one of the ironworkers who rushed down to \nvolunteer their services to help remove some of the debris. It is not \nme as a police officer who is on the front lines. It is these men and \nwomen who have made the sacrifice to protect us, and to respond as they \nwould have at a time of battle. And, in effect, when this act of war \ntook place, they were our front-line soldiers.\n\n  The Federal Government provides a one-time benefit payment to the \nfamilies of public safety officers lost in the line of duty through the \npublic safety officer benefit program. Unfortunately, these benefits \nare often delayed for long periods of time because of very burdensome \nregulatory applications.\n  In fact, I stood in this Chamber back in May to commend the sacrifice \nof brave New York City firefighters who lost their lives in a Father's \nDay blaze in Queens. Their families are still struggling to complete \nthe application process. They fill it out and they are told they need \nmore information.\n  It is imperative that we take action now to ensure that the family \nmembers of those brave men and women who lost their lives in this \nterrorist attack are not confronted with the same onerous process.\n  So the legislation that I have introduced today would direct the \nDepartment of Justice to expedite the process for these families of \nthose who lost their lives while responding at the World Trade Center \nin New York City, the Pentagon in Virginia, or in Stonycreek Township, \nPA.\n\n[[Page S9361]]\n\n  Given what I heard on television from the President, and the \nextraordinarily broad support that I have for this already in the \nSenate, I do not think this will be a controversial piece of \nlegislation. But I hope it can be considered as soon as possible to \nsend a tangible message to our firefighters, our police officers, and \nour emergency personnel that we are with them and their families in \ntheir time of loss.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we are just realizing the full depth of the \nhumanitarian crisis and grief and loss that has occurred. For the \nchildren who have now been orphaned, the husbands and wives who have \nbeen widowed, the parents who are facing what no parent should have to \nface ever--the loss of their son or their daughter--there are no words \nadequately to describe or express our sense of loss as a society.\n  I am very grateful that the city, the State, and FEMA will be on the \nground with grief counseling, with psychological help, with mental \nhealth services because having been to more disasters in my life than I \nwished, I know that those who do not bear any visible injuries or scars \ncarry deep and lasting wounds.\n  We will, as a nation, not only seek out the enemy wherever he may be, \nbut we will also care for the grieving and the wounded. We will, I \nknow, do everything required to provide whatever help and assistance we \ncan as a nation.\n  I also hope that for those who were far away from any of the attacks \non September 11, they, too, will talk with one another and comfort each \nother.\n  I was very grateful and proud to see Laura Bush, Mrs. Bush, on \ntelevision today talking about the need to have an open conversation \nwith our children, depending upon their ages, to reassure and comfort \nthem because the binding up of our wounds as a nation goes far beyond \nlower Manhattan, or Arlington, VA.\n  We have all been stricken by this cowardly act of terrorism, but I am \nconfident that we will respond with the same resolute purpose that has \nalways defined us as a nation, with the same compassion that marks us \nas a people, and with the same resolve to not only defend ourselves \nwherever and whenever that is necessary, but to rebuild and reconstruct \nthe human spirit and the physical terrain of America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the senior Senator from New \nYork will be recognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I join with my colleague in speaking of our trip that \nwe had to New York and in what we are seeking to do here.\n  I fly home to New York every week. The sight I see is usually a \nfriendly sight: first over Staten Island and the Verrazano Bridge, and \nthen Prospect Park and my home which is on Prospect Park in Brooklyn, \nthen the Statue of Liberty and those two tall towers that stand as \nsymbols of New York.\n\n  We flew back with FEMA Administrator Joe Allbaugh last night. Those \ntowers were gone. I felt violated. My city, the city we all love, had \nbeen violated. To hear the people talk about looking for their loved \nones, to go down there and see a war zone, to fly in the helicopter and \nsee these two tall towers gone--unbelievable.\n  Two things get us through this: First, the resilience of New \nYorkers--I talked about that yesterday--and second, the words of not \nonly sympathy but offers of help from the President, Members of both \nsides of this body, from all regions and, in addition, from the other \nbody.\n  We have talked to the mayor and Governor. We have put together a \nplan. We are going to ask our colleagues for help. We are going to ask \nthem for $20 billion in addition to the appropriation that will come \nforward now. It seems like a huge sum of money, but let me catalog some \nof the problems.\n  The mayor and Governor are compiling a list. We want to move this \nbill quickly so that list will not be complete and this will not be a \ncomplete inventory of our needs. We will certainly have to come back.\n  Rescue and recovery will cost $10 billion, according to the mayor. \nThe subway that has collapsed under the World Trade Center Towers will \ncost $1 to $3 billion to fix. We have lost 20 million square feet of \noffice space; 100,000 people don't have places to work. Add to that the \nloss of life of the brave policemen, firefighters, EMS people, those \nwho went to work in the morning innocently. This is not a usual tragedy \nfor a usual response. We need help. We need large help.\n  The President told me when I spoke with him that he would do anything \nhe could to help. We are so glad he is coming to New York tomorrow. The \nmayor and Governor have expressed that, and so do we. But we need, of \ncourse, more than just expressions of sympathy and solidarity, as \ndeeply as those are appreciated. Our financial markets are crippled. \nOur electricity market, our phone system, all of this is in huge \ntrouble.\n  We are putting forward, Senator Clinton and myself, a proposal. We \nwill bring it in broad outline before our colleagues in a few minutes. \nWe will then work on language, and hopefully it can be incorporated \ninto the bill.\n  Let me just say, these are the most difficult times I have faced as \nan elected official. I now understand, during our valiant struggles--\nwhether it be the Revolution, the Civil War, World War II--how brave \nour soldiers were to just go on despite the heavy burdens pressed upon \nthem. I feel that a little bit myself. It is hard to get up in the \nmorning having not slept or having had nightmares of those planes going \nthrough the towers. There are too many things to do in the day, but \nevery one of them is essential. And go on we must.\n  To my colleagues and the Nation, New York desperately needs your \nhelp. We have come before you as people who contribute greatly to our \nNation in so many different ways. Now we need you. Please be there for \nus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/13/senate-section/article/S9361-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The managers are working on \nthat at this time. Awaiting their arrival, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to applaud the managers of this \nbill, Senators Hollings and Gregg, for focusing on a problem that \nsimply has not received the attention it deserves in recent years. I am \nreferring to the disturbing lack of Immigration and Naturalization \nService inspectors at the land ports of entry that line our borders \nwith Canada and Mexico. Based on an analysis of workload and workforce \nneeds, the INS estimates that our 104 land ports of entry are staffed \nat a mere 49 percent of their optimal level, leading to long lines and \nexhausted, overworked inspectors.\n  The situation in my home State of Maine is even more alarming. \nMaine's 12 land ports of entry are staffed, on average, at 41 percent \nof their optimal level. This means that 71 INS inspectors must perform \nthe work of 174 men and women. To put the problem in perspective, I \npoint out that, last year, Maine's 71 INS border staff inspected \napproximately 6.75 million people who passed through our land border \nports of entry in 3 million passenger vehicles, 400,000 commercial \ntrucks, and thousands of buses and trains.\n  Moreover, many of these inspections are far from routine. Since 1996, \nthe Portland, ME district of the INS--which includes 14 land border \npoints of entry in Vermont and one in New Hampshire--has confiscated \nover 2,500 fraudulent documents and apprehended\n\n[[Page S9362]]\n\nhundreds of narcotics and alien smugglers, over 8,200 criminal aliens, \nand approximately 4,000 aliens who were the subject of lookouts by the \nINS and other agencies. Last year alone, the Portland district office \napprehended 4 terrorists.\n  These figures underscore the critical need for additional land border \ninspectors to protect the integrity of our borders and the safety of \nthose who currently man them. This latter point is perhaps best \nillustrated by the situation at the border port of entry in Coburn \nGore, Maine. Coburn Gore should be staffed by 12 INS inspectors. \nInstead, it has two. Together with two Customs Service inspectors, they \nman the port of entry 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Most of the \ntime, Coburn Gore is manned by only one inspector. Think about that. A \nsingle inspector must not only keep traffic moving but must also decide \nwhen and whether to conduct a time-consuming secondary inspection when \nsuspicion is raised. Not surprisingly, traffic sometimes backs up to \nthe Canadian border. And when assistance is needed, a call must be \nplaced to the State Police barracks in Skowhegan, the nearest sheriff's \noffice in Farmington, the nearest Border Patrol office in Rangeley, or \nthe nearest land border port of entry in Jackman, each of which is \nlocated at least an hour's drive away.\n  For years, all available INS resources have been allocated to \nincrease the number of Border Patrol agents stationed on our southern \nborder. At the same time, the number of land border inspectors actually \nhas decreased slightly. I am therefore very pleased that Senators \nHollings and Gregg have allocated $25.4 million to hire 348 land border \ninspectors to, in their words, ``begin the long process of aligning \nmanning with workload requirements.'' Eighteen of these new inspectors \nwould be located in Maine, and would increase the number of INS \ninspectors stationed at land border ports of entry in my home State by \n25 percent. Significantly, the bill would mean two new inspectors for \nCoburn Gore.\n  On August 31, I wrote to Attorney General Ashcroft asking him to \nsupport the increase in land border inspectors including in this bill \nbut, unfortunately, excluded from the House version.\n  It is cruelly ironic that today, in the aftermath of the worst \nterrorist attack the world has ever witnessed, news reports have \nindicated that some of the terrorists responsible may well have entered \nour country through one or more of Maine's understaffed land border \nports of entry.\n  The INS and Customs Service inspectors on our northern border work \nhard and long to protect our safety. It is disturbing to learn how \noften they encounter terrorists and other criminals seeking to gain \nentry into the United States. Yet it is comforting to know how often \nthese criminals are apprehended before they can accomplish their goals.\n  As skilled and as vigilant as they are, our border inspectors need \nmore help, and that is why I commend the Senator from New Hampshire and \nthe Senator from South Carolina for their work. I strongly support the \nprovisions in this bill that will put more inspectors where they are \nurgently needed on our borders.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nMichigan, Ms. Stabenow, be recognized as in morning business for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about how Tuesday's \nterrorist attack is testing our national will and our character. There \nare no words to fully describe the depth of that infamy and not enough \ntears to properly mourn the innocent lives that have been so cruelly \ntaken. We join all Americans in a focus to help those victims, \nfamilies, and communities who have been terrorized, and also to focus \non those who are responsible and hold them accountable.\n  We have come together to say loudly and clearly that we will respond \nto those who have attacked and murdered Americans. But I am also \nconcerned that in our anger, an anger we all share, we would lash out \nat fellow Americans who come here from the Middle East, which is also \nwrong.\n  I am disturbed by reports from my home State of Michigan that Arab \nAmericans have been victims of threats and hate mail and their \nbusinesses and institutions have been vandalized. One businessman felt \nso threatened that he bought two American flags--one for his home and \none for his business--as he felt he needed to prove his love for his \ncountry. We want people to fly American flags out of pride, not out of \nfear.\n  The Koran, just as the Bible, is a book of love, peace, and \ntolerance. There are those who have outrageously perverted that \nmessage. It reminds me of the Ku Klux Klan that took the symbol of the \ncross and the words of Christianity and perverted them to lash out with \nhate and violence against other Americans. There are those in the world \nwho are extremists who are doing the same thing with the religion of \nIslam.\n  I know Arab Americans, as all Americans, grieve and have anger and \noutrage about what has happened, and they want justice for Americans.\n  I stand here today urging all of us to come together as Americans and \nnot allow the terrorists to have another victory by having us turn on \neach other. Arab Americans, as all Americans, have lost loved ones. \nThey are part of the rescue crews, and they are the nurses and the \ndoctors working around the clock to save lives. We, all of us, have \nbeen attacked and assaulted as Americans of all faiths, of all \nbackgrounds. We stand as Americans to take on those who threaten us and \nto respond and hold them accountable. It is important in our grief and \nin our anger that we not allow the terrorists to turn us on each other.\n  This is a time of testing our American values, our beliefs, and our \nwill. It is an opportunity for all of us to stand together and make a \nstatement about who we are and what we believe. I know that in the \ngreat State of Michigan, all that I represent, everyone I represent, \nstand together arm in arm to make sure the victims and the families \nhave what they need and that justice is served in this outrageous \nattack on America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/13/senate-section/article/S9362-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9362-S9387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED \n              AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday and this morning, one by one \nMembers of the Senate came to the Chamber offering their thoughts on \nthe events that occurred on September 11. There were words of \ncondolence to the terrorism victims and their families. There have been \nwords of praise for firefighters and police officers, many of whom gave \ntheir lives attempting to help others.\n  There were words of anger and warning at the perpetrators of these \nterrorist attacks, and there were words of concern and outrage the \nUnited States is not doing enough to prevent and combat terrorism from \nrearing its ugly head on our shores.\n  During my own remarks, I noted that General Holland, the U.S. Air \nForce commander in chief of the Special Operations Command at MacDill \nAir Force Base in Florida, who directs our counterterrorism efforts on \nbehalf of the U.S. military, does not have a direct civilian \ncounterpart. I reiterate what I and several other of our colleagues \nsaid yesterday: We should have one.\n  I find it almost ironic, while the terrorists were attacking our \ninnocent civilians and our democratic freedoms, we in the Chamber of \ndemocracy's most deliberative body were considering a bill that takes a \nsignificant step to provide such a civilian counterpart to the military \npoint person on counterterrorism.\n  This bill before the Senate today contains language to create the \nposition of Deputy Attorney General for Combating Terrorism.\n  When I spoke this morning, I commended the two managers of this bill.\n\n[[Page S9363]]\n\nSenator Hollings said he was glad to participate, but the original idea \ncame from the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg. The Deputy \nAttorney General for Combating Terrorism would not only oversee the \ncounterterrorism activities within the Department of Justice but would \nalso provide much needed leadership throughout the Federal Government \nfor counterterrorism prevention, preparedness, crisis management, and \nconsequence management.\n  This Deputy AG would be appointed by the President of the United \nStates, confirmed by this Senate, and would have the authority and \naccess to resource, coordinate, and oversee the full range of programs \nthroughout the Federal Government to combat terrorism.\n  This Deputy Attorney General would also make recommendations to the \nCongress and the President for developing a strategy preventing, \npreparing, and responding to terrorism.\n  Moreover, this Attorney General would play the central role in \nreviewing the budgets of all the Agencies and Departments within the \nFederal Government to determine whether they are adequately funded to \nimplement our national strategy against terrorism, and when General \nHolland or some other person who follows in his footsteps would want to \ntalk to his civilian counterpart, he would have some place to go and \nnot have to go to the FBI, the Department of Justice, the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service, or the Department of State. There would be \none place for the military counterpart to go.\n  As Senator Gregg stated earlier today, this proposal may not and \nshould not be the last word in how we respond to terrorism in this \ncountry and abroad.\n  Given the barbaric and uncivilized events of Tuesday, we need action \non the part of this Congress and we need it now. We have a bill before \nus today that addresses many of our concerns. For the fourth or fifth \ntime today, I commend Chairman Hollings and Senator Gregg for their \nleadership and their vision in including this language in this bill \nthat was written well before the tragic events of Tuesday. I pledge my \nassistance to them in retaining this language as we move forward in the \nconference committee on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his generous comments \nabout the efforts of Senator Hollings and myself in this area and his \nsupport of these initiatives in this bill to accomplish some focus on \ncounterterrorism, although, as he mentioned, it is not going to change \nwhat happened in New York. It may appear it is too little too late. It \nis actually in anticipation of trying to get ready for the next round \nof what is clearly going to be a long and difficult struggle for our \nNation. It is part of that effort. It is not as comprehensive, but it \nis an important element of it. I certainly thank him for his support as \nhe is a significant leader within the Senate, and his support is \nwelcome and will give this proposal a little bit more credibility.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me also thank our distinguished leader, Senator \nReid.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following list I send \nto the desk be the only first-degree amendments in order to H.R. 2500; \nthat they be subject to relevant second-degree amendments; that upon \ndisposition of all amendments, the bill be read a third time and the \nSenate vote on passage of the bill; that upon passage of the bill, the \nSenate insist on its amendments, request a conference with the House on \nthe disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and that the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The list of amendments is as follows:\n\n                               Amendments\n\n       Bayh: Social Security Payback.\n       Boxer: Relevant.\n       Boxer: Relevant.\n       Breaux: Relevant.\n       Byrd: Relevant.\n       Byrd: Relevant.\n       Byrd: Relevant to the list.\n       Carnahan: Byrne grants.\n       Clinton: Increasing funds for Internet Crimes Against \n     Children Task Force.\n       Clinton: Authorizing pension benefits for spouses.\n       Daschle: Relevant.\n       Daschle: Relevant.\n       Daschle: Relevant to the list.\n       Dodd: Election Reform.\n       Durbin: Replacing Clean Diamonds Act.\n       Feingold: Relevant.\n       Feingold: Relevant.\n       Feinstein: Crib Safety.\n       Feinstein: INS Backlog.\n       Feinstein: Judges.\n       Feinstein: Relevant.\n       Graham: Social Security Trust Fund.\n       Harkin: SOS--Discrimination against Islamic Faith.\n       Hollings: Managers Amendments.\n       Hollings: Relevant.\n       Hollings: Relevant to the list..\n       Inouye: Relevant.\n       Kennedy: Relevant.\n       Landrieu: Domestic Violence.\n       Landrieu: Relevant.\n       Nelson (FL): Relevant.\n       Nelson (FL): Relevant.\n       Reid: Relevant.\n       Reid: Relevant to the list.\n       Schumer: Relevant.\n       Hatch: 15 related to terrorism.\n       Bond: American Airlines.\n       Sessions: Funding for Coverdell Crime Lab.\n       Sessions: Tech on Crime Lab.\n       Sessions: 2 Relevant.\n       Kyl: Terrorism.\n       Kyl: Relevant.\n       Thurmond: Circuit Meetings.\n       B.

Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation and \nleadership of Senator Gregg and the leadership on both sides of the \naisle in helping us with this finite list.\n  They said not to send up the matter of the conferees at this \nparticular time, but that is the same list. The list, Mr. President, is \nagreed to on both sides and the Chair has already ruled. I only ask \nthat some of these Senators come forward so we can debate and vote.\n  I want to confer with my ranking member to see what we can have \nbrought up and what we can eliminate and bring this to a conclusive \nlist because this one is pretty long.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to address for a few moments one of \nthe issues we are going to be confronting both on our committees and I \nam sure in the Chambers of the House and the Senate in the not-too-\ndistant future as a result of the tragic events of this week, and that \nis the issue of airline safety and what we can do in the future to \nprevent this tragedy from ever happening again or prevent any kind of \nhijacking of airliners in the future.\n  It occurred to me as I began thinking about this--and I have been a \npilot all my life. I have flown since I have been about 20 years old, \nboth as a military pilot and a civilian pilot. I have my commercial \nlicense. So having flown all these years, I am quite aware of the \ndifferent steps that need to be taken to provide for aircraft security.\n  It occurred to me, while I was thinking about all of this, that over \nthe last several years I have been to Israel on more than one \noccasion--two or three times--and with all of the terrorist activity \nthat the Israelis have had to put up with over all these years, they \nhave yet to lose an El Al airliner. Having gone through the procedure \nof flying on El Al as I have done in the past, I know they have a \nsystem in place in which you are very certain that no one is going to \nhijack that airplane. It seems to me we could learn a lot from how the \nIsraelis have done that.\n  I am hopeful our Secretary of Transportation, Mr. Mineta, as he looks \nat this issue, will call upon our friends in Israel and those who run \nEl Al airlines to consult with us. It has to do with a process and a \nprocedure which might slow things down a little bit. It is true\n\n[[Page S9364]]\n\nit might slow things down a little bit, but at least I believe it will \ngive passengers in this country the absolute assurance they are going \nto be safe when they get on that plane.\n\n  The other thing that occurred to me was that whenever you go out of \nthis country and you come back into this country and you go through \nimmigration, you show them your passport. That immigration officer sits \nin the back of that little desk and swipes your passport through with \nyour photograph and your numbers. They do it for everyone coming \nthrough. I am told they have a list of suspected terrorists, suspected \ncriminals, those who have a record, and that list is readily accessible \nso they can match a passport coming in--not just a U.S. passport but \nany passport anywhere in the world--check those papers against that \nlist, and they know right away if a name pops up if this is someone \nthey need to detain or to have a further look at before they are \nallowed into this country.\n  It is my understanding that list is not available to the airlines, \nand I wonder again if perhaps this is another system that we ought to \nlook at where, before you get on an airplane, you have your ID, but \nthat some instant check be done to make sure you do not have some kind \nof a record, that you are who you say you are, and that you would not \nbe on the same list the Immigration and Naturalization Service, INS, \nwould have or a more appropriate list.\n  Third, we need to make sure our checked baggage is better examined. \nAgain, I go back to what El Al does in terms of making sure that when \nyou get on the airplane, it is your baggage, that the baggage has been \nx ray'd thoroughly, and before you get on the plane they have \nidentified that as your luggage. We do not do that in this country.\n  That would not be as easy to accomplish as it sounds. It could cause \ndelays. But, I am hopeful that we can develop efficient methods that \ncan be implemented to efficiently do that minimizing those delays.\n  It has also been suggested that when you get on an airplane you ought \nto have a photographic record of that. Tickets can be purchased over \nthe Internet. Once you walk up to the counter and receive your boarding \npass, you have to show them a photo ID. But once you get the boarding \npass, you can give that to anyone. Anyone can get on that airplane. \nThere is a breakdown there.\n  Every time I walk into a 7-Eleven store or up to an ATM machine to \ndraw out money, a picture is taken. When you walk into a 7-Eleven \nstore, there is a photograph taken of you in that store. There is a \nrecord kept of that. It seems to me a simple matter to put in place \nthat when you walk up to get your ticket, a photograph is taken. That \nphotograph is matched with your identification. When you go to board \nthe airplane and they take your boarding pass and put it through the \nelectronics, your picture pops up alongside the boarding pass so they \nknow you are the exact person who bought that ticket.\n  It seems to me these are simple, technological means we can use to \nensure those who buy tickets are the same people who get on the plane \nand make sure the baggage checked is yours. This method might sharply \nsimplify the process of assuring that checked package being placed on a \nplane matches those that get on board that plane.\n  However great a system is, redundancy is essential. So, we also need \nto think about increasing safety on the aircraft itself.\n  There has been talk of putting sky marshals on appropriate flights. I \ngot a fax from a friend I flew with in the Navy. Larry Durbin retired \nas an airline captain from United Airlines. He faxed one sentence: Tom, \nwhy don't you hire retired airline captains as sky marshals? I thought \nto myself, that might be a pretty good suggestion. We have a lot of \nretired airline captains past the age of flying. They might be \ninterested in this type of occupation. I think that is something we \nought to consider. Obviously, they know about flying; they know what it \ntakes. I believe they could help us immensely.\n  I am told El Al has on their airlines solid doors in their airplane \ncabins. Once the pilot, the copilots, and the flight engineers are in \nthe cockpit, they lock the door and you cannot get in. You cannot kick \nit in. The only way to unlock it is from the other side. We do lock our \ndoors on our planes in this country, but, quite frankly, they are not \nvery secure doors. I believe that is another item we ought to look at \nin terms of making sure that no one can breach cabin security.\n  Last night, I spoke with Senator Stevens, both of us being pilots of \nold vintage. We were talking about the old days. We always had an IFF, \nidentification friend or foe, in military parlance, on all aircraft. \nWhen the aircraft started up and you turned on the electrical system, \nthat IFF began to transmit. It was on until that airplane was either \nshot down or landed and turned off. I believe we ought to have that on \nevery domestic airliner in this country. It is a simple device.\n  In other words, these people got on and somehow they knew how to turn \nthe transponder off. Once they did that, it was very hard to keep track \nof the airliner. But with an IFF system that identified a specific \naircraft that would be on all the time, that could never happen again.\n  These are some of the things we are going to have to discuss on the \nSenate floor and in our committees. Many different measures we have \nbeen very lax about. We have been very lucky in this country, very \nlucky in our domestic and international air service. Our luck has run \nout. I think now is the time to take a hard look at all of the security \nmeasures we need to ensure airline passengers have the absolute \nassurance once they get on that airline it will not be blown up and it \nwill not be hijacked.\n\n  These are just some of the measures I have been thinking about that I \nam hopeful the Congress will take action on soon, in coordination with \nthe Secretary of Transportation and the administration. Many \nimprovements are already being implemented. But, other ideas need to be \ndiscussed and be implemented. These and perhaps whatever measures are \nadvisable.\n  In some cases, where airlines now have the responsibility, we \nprobably want to shift those important safety considerations to the \nGovernment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator from Iowa. He has \ngiven a very cogent overview of our needs. It struck this Senator in a \nsimilar fashion. I don't have the expert knowledge that the Senator \nfrom Iowa has as an active pilot. However, everyone should know, we \nimmediately set up a hearing with the Secretary of Transportation. The \nfirst time we get back from the Rosh Hashanah holiday, Monday, Tuesday, \nand Wednesday, we set it up for 9:30, on Thursday morning before the \nCommerce, Space, Science Transportation Subcommittee where we have \njurisdiction of the Federal Aviation Administration. Along with that, \nwe have a bill from Senator Hutchison of Texas with respect to air \nmarshals.\n  I have been at a news conference and one system was mentioned in \ndetail, which I agree with. Otherwise, the only one you may have left \nout was a matter of professionalizing the scanners and screeners. The \npresent system now is to leave it to the private airlines. They hire, \nat the minimum wage level, folks who are totally ill-equipped, not \nproperly trained, and not professional, and they only stay on the job \nuntil they can get a paying job, so to speak.\n  I have mentioned that for several years because in Europe they are \nall government employees. Governments in the various countries will not \nallow it to be done except through those professionals. I think we can \nget that done, and any other suggestions that the distinguished Senator \nhas, I appreciate his leadership on this score. We want to hear from \nhim. The Senator is welcome to come to the hearing next week at 9:30 on \nThursday morning.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that. This is the chairman's jurisdiction \nand I know of his intense interest. I did not know about the hearing. I \napplaud the Senator for that and congratulate the Senator for moving \naggressively in this area. I say to my friend, better training of those \nindividuals doing the checking is on my list; I just didn't read it. I \ndidn't want to take all afternoon.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is what everyone suggested. Everyone realizes it \nis inadequate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I might add that this ought to be a governmental \nfunction.\n\n[[Page S9365]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I think it should be. It is in Europe.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So we could have them well trained and they know what \nthey are looking for.\n  I share with my friend from South Carolina something that happened to \nme in August which gave me pause for concern, but you move on in life.\n  I was making something; I had to get a 2-inch galvanized pipe that \nwas about 32\\1/2\\ inches long. I had to drill some holes in it and I \nhad to get it from here to my house in Iowa. I have been working on it \nhere. I thought, how am I going to get it out there? It would not fit \nin my suitcase. So I got a cardboard tube from a package store and put \nit in the tube and taped it over. I thought to myself, boy, am I going \nto have trouble when that goes through the x-ray machine, 32\\1/2\\ inch \nlong, galvanized, heavy pipe, into which I drilled holes.\n  So I go through the x ray machine out here at National. I set it \nthere and I thought, I have all my Senate ID and everything to show \nthem I am a Senator and they can trust me. I could open it up and show \nthem it is just a plain piece of pipe with some holes drilled in it.\n  It went through the x ray machine and they didn't say anything, \nnothing. I could not believe it. I thought to myself, what if that had \nbeen filled with dynamite? What if it was not me and they just took it \nright on board with a fuse?\n  I thought to myself, something has to change. For something like that \nto go through an x ray machine and they did not even pick it up, a pipe \nthis long, that round, and probably about a quarter inch thick--and \nthey did not pick it up? It should have been changed many years ago.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The main thing is we have to secure that door \nimmediately. You cannot use a domestic flight as a weapon of mass \ndestruction. That has to be done in the next 3 weeks. We ought to get \nan FAA order out, not about the bags at the check-in, but I mean \neverybody ought to know they might go down themselves but they are not \ngoing to do like they did at the Pentagon or the World Trade Center.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Those doors have to be solid metal doors.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Locked from the inside, and with a rule not to open \nthem on cross-country flights.\n  I just flew from Honolulu to Sidney, Australia, and I never saw those \npilots come back once. The wind wasn't good; it was 11\\1/2\\ hours. So \nthey can hold tight for 4 hours on a cross-country flight.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the chairman for his diligence, moving forward \nrapidly on this matter. I look forward to the hearing. If my schedule \npermits, I would like to sit in on the hearing. I appreciate his offer.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would appreciate if you would come, and I would \nappreciate it if you will help this afternoon, getting rid of this \nother bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will do what I can. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join with the Senator from South Carolina \nin hoping Senators who have amendments will bring them to the floor. \nThe opportunity is here to proceed on this bill. In the context of what \nhappened in the last 2 days, the passage of this bill is obviously not \nan Earth-shattering event, but it is an important element getting our \nhouse in order, showing we are doing the business of the Government.\n  Ironically, a great deal of this bill is directed at assisting the \nFBI, which has a huge responsibility now, and assisting the Justice \nDepartment, which is really the lead agency in the present effort to \ntrack down the people who have committed this despicable act, and \nassisting the State Department, which has been under tremendous \npressure. These agencies need to have the reassurance that we as a \nSenate are going to act and support them. I hope people who have \nconcerns about how this bill is structured and wish to amend it will \nbring those concerns to the floor.\n  In the short term, I know the Senator from South Carolina has \nmentioned the opportunity to go to third reading. We do have a list of \namendments. We wish to give those folks the opportunity to bring them \nforward. They have the right to bring them forward. But this bill is \nalso important. This legislation needs to be passed. I hope people will \ncome to the floor and make their amendments known.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we now have a unanimous consent agreement \nthat is in effect that limits amendments. We have spoken on this side \nof the aisle to a number of Senators. There are only a few who have \ngiven some indication that they want to offer amendments.\n  I say this with the full understanding that this has been cleared by \nthe manager of the bill. There is going to come a time this afternoon \nwhen Senator Hollings and the ranking member are going to move to third \nreading. The fact that they have these amendments listed doesn't mean \nthey can hold up this bill. If people want to offer these amendments, \nthey have to come over here and offer them. Otherwise, the two Senators \nwill move to third reading, and we will have final passage on the bill.\n  Is that a fair statement?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. This is a fair statement. That should be represented to \nall Senators who have amendments and an interest in these proceedings.\n  Right to the point, on the other side of the aisle I think this is an \nimportant amendment by Senator Hatch and Senator Kyl. They will \nmomentarily come to the floor. Other than that, we are almost cleared \non the other side as well. Within the next hour, I would be prepared to \nmove to third reading, unless, of course, my colleague comes down and \nwants to offer his amendment.\n  As the distinguished leader is doing, I give notice. Come on down and \nlet us hear from you. We welcome you offering any amendment. But we \nhave to get on because leaders on both sides have an important \nemergency authorization bill of $20 billion for the President, plus \nsome other matters that the President wishes us to take up, plus an \nappointment or two. We are wasting valuable time by not moving along \nwith an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I second what the Senator from South \nCarolina said. We are at a critical period in our Nation, and we are \ntreading water. That is inappropriate. This bill has a lot of important \nelements which are very apropos and necessary for assisting agencies \nthat are in the middle of the fight against terrorism today. We should \nmove it. I agree with the statement by the Senator from South Carolina \nand hope that Members will offer their amendments. If not, I would \nsupport going to third reading.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1558\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I send to the desk a managers' \namendment. It has been gone over with the ranking member and the other \nside.\n  Let me yield on that score.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we have reviewed the managers' amendment \nand support the managers' amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for himself \n     and Mr. Gregg, proposes an amendment numbered 1558.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1558.\n  The amendment (No. 1558) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n\n[[Page S9366]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have been listed as potentially having an \namendment today. I want to address the subject. I discussed this at our \nbipartisan caucus luncheon today because this is one of the many \nserious aftermaths of the tragedy of September 11.\n  We have talked a great deal, as we should--properly so--about the \ntremendous search and rescue efforts that are going forward. We are \ngoing to move expeditiously to make sure we find those who may be \nalive, and today as we watch the news, we see very gratifying stories \nof people being found alive. As I have said before, a search and rescue \nunit is there from central Missouri where I live. They are working \nhard.\n  I also mentioned, in addition to the deaths, the damage, and the \ndestruction that the terrorists have caused directly, they will be \nsuccessful to the extent they are able to cripple this country \npsychologically or destroy our economy. We all have a responsibility to \nwork with, to encourage, to respond to the needs of our citizens so \nthey can move forward and not be paralyzed by fear so we can get this \ncountry working again.\n  We have a responsibility as well to make sure that our economy is not \ncrippled.\n  The situation was brought to my attention today about the two \nairlines whose airliners were hijacked by these terrorists who are \nconducting their own form of war against the United States. They \ncaptured airlines and used helpless passengers as human bombs to \ndestroy the two towers of the World Trade Center, to destroy a section \nof the Pentagon, and, with sorrow but without as great a damage, to \ndown one plane in Pennsylvania.\n  Two of the airlines involved are major airline carriers, American \nAirlines and United Airlines. They have lost airplanes. More important, \nthey have lost valued employees and their priceless cargo, the \npassengers.\n  At this point, the entire airline industry in America is facing a \ncrisis. They have been grounded. Their expenses go on, but their \nrevenues are not coming in. For all of these airlines, we must consider \na number of ways to assist them, and we should work on that very \nquickly to make sure we do not lose airline service because if we were, \nas a result of this action, to see commercial airline traffic cut off \nin the United States, our economy would be crippled.\n  United Airlines and American Airlines face a very unusual \ncircumstance where because their planes were involved, there is a \npotential for lawsuits on behalf of the passengers who were killed, the \ncrew that was killed, and potentially even the innocent victims on the \nground, which we do not know the final total but we expect it is past \nthe 4,000 mark, and we fear greatly that it may go significantly \nhigher.\n  I spoke today about the need of providing some means of keeping these \nairlines from being put out of business by the potential liability. It \nis not just the lawsuits that they might face in the future that could \nforce these airlines out of business. The potential of the lawsuits has \nthe likelihood of making it impossible for them to continue normal \nfinancing operations. In other words, if they were to go to a bank and \nsay: We need to keep our cash flow intact so we have the cash to run \nour airlines, to purchase the jet fuel, to pay our employees, to buy \nthe supplies, a bank might look at them and say: If you are exposed to \nlawsuits of wrongful death for untold thousands of people, we cannot \nlend you money, in which case one could easily see the end of these two \ngreat airlines, with the tremendous impact this would have on our \neconomy, not just our traveling public but the entire economic \nstructure that depends upon good airline service.\n\n  I raised the question of limiting liability at lunch today with a \nnumber of colleagues. One of the concerns that came back from them was, \nokay, who will compensate these unfortunate victims? We have talked \nwith legislative counsel. We are working with the Congressional \nResearch Service. We do not have ready the amendment I had hoped to be \nable to present on this bill, but the amendment we are considering \nwould provide compensation for all of these victims under the Federal \nTort Claims Act. That means the victims would be compensated in the \nappropriate manner to the extent they could establish the basis for \ncompensation. It would mean the Federal Government would pay the \nclaims. The important impact would be this would take that one \npotentially crippling liability off the financial balance sheets of the \ntwo airlines.\n  I am concerned if we do not do that, the airlines will not be able to \nsecure normal financing or extraordinary financing that will now be \nrequired to get them back into the air to continue the service that is \nvital not only for those of us in the traveling public but for the \nentire economy which depends upon good commercial airline service, not \nonly for passengers but for delivery of other commodities by mail.\n  We have heard stories about organ donations. Organs being transported \nfor implantation purposes cannot be handled because there is no airline \nservice. There are many aspects of this economy which depend very much \non the effective continuation of airline service.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in attempting to find a way where we \ncan be fair and equitable to those innocent victims and their surviving \nfamilies and still not cripple our economy.\n  As I said earlier this morning, the terrorists have struck a mortal \nblow against our fellow citizens, against Americans, against the \nbuildings in New York, the Pentagon, and elsewhere. We must deny them a \nvictory because what they really want to do is cripple us economically \nand psychologically. There will be many more steps we must take to make \nsure our economy is not crippled, and there will be concerns coming out \nof the financial community as well, which is where many firms have \nsuffered great losses. But this particular concern is one where I ask \nthe leaders and members of all committees involved to consider very \ncarefully how we can expeditiously provide an alternative means for \ncompensating the victims that does not put the future of two of our \nmajor airlines at risk.\n  This is not something we can talk about in the next couple of months \nand act on at the end of this year, the first of next year. This is a \nquestion which is imminent, which must be resolved within a matter of \ndays, not even a matter of weeks.\n  I do not have an amendment at the desk, but I will ask that my name \nbe removed from the rolls of those who proposed to offer an amendment \nso that the managers of the bill can go about passing this very \nimportant Commerce-State-Justice bill which has many other important \nelements. I invite the thoughts, the discussion, and the constructive \nsuggestions of my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The first urge would be not to say anything, not to \nrespond, but in deference to one of the best Senators I have served \nwith over my 34 years, I know the Senator from Missouri is genuine, he \nis sincere, and he is concerned about the economy and the future of \nthese airlines.\n  I heard about this a little while ago. Let us have hearings. There is \nnothing to avoid that. We are going to have hearings, first of all, \nwith respect to safety so we can get the airlines back up and running.\n  I am an old-time trial lawyer. With respect to any kind of claims, if \nthere are indeed claims, they would not be filed for months. It appears \nto me as an act of war they might define some negligence, but be that \nas it may, the FBI is going to do some of the best investigating for \nus.\n  That will take months. If you filed a summons and complaint in the \nnext\n\n[[Page S9367]]\n\nhour, you would not get to court before the end of next year, I can \ntell you that, with the motions and everything else. So trying to \ncompensate the victims, which we will be concerned with, there is no \nquestion the Senator from Missouri is correct on that particular score, \nthat is to come.\n  We heard this about the airlines and we found out last year from a \nGAO report that they had $100 billion in reinsurance. But barring that \nand later the statement made that we do not want to wreck the economy, \nwe can save the economy in this Chamber of the Senate.\n  A couple of months ago we were talking about surpluses, surpluses, \nsurpluses, surpluses. As of this minute, according to the debt to the \npenny by the Secretary of the Treasury, there is $96 billion. It could \nwell be these losses would amount into the billions, maybe not $96 \nbillion. But you and I have done this in the last several months, \ntalking about surpluses and cutting revenues some $74 billion and then \nrunning around in a circle, where did the money go? The economy went \ninto a dip. We took $74 billion out this fiscal year that is going to \nend in 2 weeks' time.\n  So for those who are concerned about the economy--and please include \nme in that number--let us look at where it has really been devastating. \nThis act of war is devastation enough. I appreciate the sincerity and \nthe vision of my colleague from Missouri. We definitely are going to \nhave some hearings on this issue, and I will be supporting some kind of \ncompensation, but as of this minute, the safety of the people is the \nsupreme law--salus populi suprema lex esto. The Senator from New \nHampshire will have to coach me on my Latin. He has the Boston Latin \nschool up there, and they have the Charleston Latin school that is not \nquite as keen.\n  In any event, it is the 12th Roman canon, the safety of the people to \nget on these airlines. Do not worry about claims. Do not worry about \ncompensation. Worry about safety. Already one-third of the air \ntraveling public says they do not want to travel on a plane right now.\n  One of the best things we can do is have this quick hearing, \nestablish a locked cabin door policy where the cabin is not accessible, \nwhere you cannot make a domestic flight into a weapon of mass \ndestruction, and get along with those ways where we can do the real job \nof the Senate.\n  As to compensation, we are going to have to get to that later in \nhearings. I do appreciate the Senator from Missouri raising this \nparticular question and the fact that he will set it aside now so that \nwe can move on this bill this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as the chairman of the subcommittee and \nthe manager of the bill knows very well, in September 1999 the \nDepartment of Justice sued the tobacco industry to recover federal \ncosts associated with diseases caused by smoking. The suit alleges that \nthe tobacco companies engaged in a campaign since 1953 to defraud and \ndeceive the American public regarding the dangers of smoking disease \nand death, despite the fact that the companies were aware of these \nhealth effects.\n  This case continues to be pending before the courts. Last year, a \nU.S. District Court judge dismissed some counts of the lawsuit but \nupheld the government's right to sue the tobacco industry under the \nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. That portion of the \ncase is still pending. Discovery is underway, and the judge has set a \ntrial date for the year 2003.\n  There were a number of press reports that indicated some uncertainty \nof the Department of Justice about this lawsuit. The Attorney General \nhas indicated that he was going to personally review the lawsuit and \ndetermine whether or not to vigorously pursue it.\n  Just last week, the Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil \nDivision at the Department of Justice testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee that the suit is proceeding as planned. I presided \nover that testimony.\n  I inquire of the chairman of the subcommittee, the manager of this \nimportant appropriations bill, whether it is his intent and \nunderstanding that amounts provided for the Department of Justice in \nthis appropriations bill are available for conducting this lawsuit \nagainst the tobacco companies.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. In response to the distinguished Senator, there is \nnothing specifically providing for funds. Actually the bill itself is \nsilent.\n  Section 109, which was used by the previous administration to charge \nthe various other Departments of the Government that would be \ncompensated as a result of a successful lawsuit, is still in existence \nand is available to the Attorney General. I have discussed that with \nthe Attorney General myself.\n  There is a real difference with respect to my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. As the Senator from Illinois knows, we have had a \ncouple of votes on this. In any event, we figured the best way was to \nremain silent. But I say affirmatively, section 109 and what was \navailable to the previous administration is available to this \nadministration to continue with the suit.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the chairman on this important appropriations \nbill. So there is nothing in this appropriations bill which in any way \ninhibits the vigorous pursuit of this lawsuit?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. There is nothing.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator and yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1559\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I send a managers' amendment to the \ndesk, that has been checked on both sides, and ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for himself \n     and Mr. Gregg, proposes an amendment numbered 1559.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 12, line 10, strike ``an in effect on June 1, \n     2000,''\n       On page 17, line 20, after the colon insert the following: \n     ``Provided further, That, of the amount appropriated under \n     this heading, $67,000,000 shall be transferred to the \n     Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvements Account \n     under section 204 of the Immigration Services and \n     Infrastructure Improvements Act of 2000 (8 U.S.C. 1573), to \n     be used for the same purposes for which funds in such account \n     may be used and to remain available until expended:''.\n       On page 24, strike lines 19, 20, and 21, and insert \n     ``$79,625,000 shall be for discretionary grants under the \n     Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement \n     Assistance Programs, including $1,500,000 for the Standing \n     Against Global Exploitation (SAGE) Project, Inc.''.\n       On page 76, line 6, strike ``$3,063,305,000'' and insert \n     ``3,061,805,000''.\n       On page 25, after line 21 insert the following:\n       (d) $200,000 for the Attorney General to conduct a study \n     and prepare a report to be submitted to the Subcommittee on \n     Commerce, Justice and State Appropriation of the Senate and \n     House of Representatives Appropriations Committee on the \n     response of local law enforcement agencies to emergency calls \n     involving domestic violence.\n       On page 115, after line 25, add the following:\n       Sec. 623. Clause (ii) of section 621(5)(A) of the \n     Communications Satellite Act of 1962 (47 U.S.C. 763(5)(A)) is \n     amended by striking ``on or about October 1, 2000,'' and all \n     that follows through the end and inserting ``not later than \n     December 31, 2001, except that the Commission may extend this \n     deadline to not later than June 30, 2003.''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1559.\n  The amendment (No. 1559) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S9368]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold and yield for a moment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the two managers of the bill, I \nhave been instructed by the majority leader to indicate that he has \nevery desire and every intent to finish this bill tonight.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We should finish it momentarily. I know of two \namendments they tell us about, but they have been telling us about them \nall afternoon. I am ready to move to third reading.\n  We will have a recorded vote. We will pass this bill tonight. We are \njust about through. That is why I sent up the managers' amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator from Nevada would yield on that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Excuse me, New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. A wonderful State. Vermont is pretty, too.\n  Mr. REID. We wish we had New Hampshire's water.\n  Mr. GREGG. We would be happy to send you some.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And Vermont's ice cream.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Republican leader has also advised me he expects this \nbill to be done tonight. So we will stay here until we get a final vote \non it. We are down to, I guess, two amendments --potentially two \namendments from our side of the aisle. It would be great if we could \nget those wrapped up so we could close this bill up and get on to a \nsupplemental which is very important.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It isn't the case, Mr. President, of us not being \nconsiderate, deliberate, and patient. The two amendments that could \nbe--or one, perhaps--that could be offered, they have been put on \nnotice publicly here twice by our distinguished leader, Senator Reid, \nmyself, and others. And they have been contacted. I hope they get to \nthis Chamber in the next few minutes because we just can't wait all \nafternoon and hear that they are getting together an amendment. This \nbill has been under consideration for 2 days.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I also say to my friend, in relation to the procedure \naround here, it is just out of the courtesy of the two managers of this \nbill that you are not moving forward.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. REID. The managers have every right within the rules of the \nSenate to now move to third reading, but they have been very patient. I \nappreciate that. I hope the people who are trying to work out these \namendments appreciate their patience.\n  But also, on the other hand, the two managers have been in this \nChamber all day long, in quorum calls most of the time. That is not \nappropriate. I hope people will understand that courtesy should be \nreciprocal.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished leader and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1560\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), for himself, Mr. Hatch, \n     and Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 1560.\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding discrimination \n                        against Arab Americans)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. (a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) all Americans are united in condemning, in the \n     strongest possible terms, the terrorists who planned and \n     carried out the September 11, 2001 attacks against the United \n     States as well as their sponsors, and in pursuing all of \n     those responsible until they are brought to justice and \n     punished;\n       (2) the Arab American and American Muslim communities, are \n     a vital part of our nation;\n       (3) the prayer of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the \n     Archbishop of Washington in a Mass on September 12, 2001 for \n     our Nation and the victims in the immediate aftermath of the \n     terrorist hijackings and attacks in New York City, \n     Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania reminds all Americans that \n     ``we must seek the guilty and not strike out against the \n     innocent or we become like them who are without moral \n     guidance or direction.'';\n       (4) the heads of state of several Arab and predominantly \n     Moslem countries have condemned the terrorist attacks in the \n     U.S. and the senseless loss of innocent lives; and\n       (5) vengeful threats and incidents directed at law-abiding, \n     patriotic Americans of Arab descent and Islamic faith have \n     already occurred such as shots fired at an Islamic Center and \n     police having to turn back 300 people who tried to march on a \n     mosque.\n       (b) The Senate--\n       (1) declares that in the quest to identify, bring to \n     justice, and punish the perpetrators and sponsors of the \n     terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, \n     that the civil rights and civil liberties of all Americans, \n     including Arab-Americans and American Muslims, should be \n     protected; and\n       (2) condemns any acts of violence or discrimination against \n     any Americans, including Arab-Americans and American Muslims.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on \nthis amendment at 5:20 and that there be no amendments allowed on the \nbill prior to the 5:20 vote, and the time be divided between Senators \nHatch and Harkin during the approximately 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself \nand Senator Hatch of Utah, and other cosponsors are Senator Reid and \nSenator Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Also, Senator \nHollings, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, and Senator Feingold \nwanted to be added as cosponsors.\n  The entire Nation has been shocked and dismayed at what transpired \nearlier this week in New York and at the Pentagon in Northern Virginia \nand in Pennsylvania. These were attacks on the American values of \nliberty, diversity, and tolerance; the terrorists hate us for what we \nare and what we believe in. As we mourn our dead and pursue the \nattackers, we must strive to protect not only the American people, but \nalso our American values.\n  I am truly saddened when I hear of malicious and sometimes criminal \nacts that have been committed all around the country in the last couple \nof days against Americans who may be from the Mideast, or whose \nancestors may have been from the Mideast, who may be of Arabic dissent, \nor of the Islamic faith--but who had nothing at all to do with these \nattacks.\n  Arab Americans and American Muslims have faced a terrible rash of \nhate crimes since Tuesday morning:\n  On Wednesday, police turned back 300 people who tried to march on a \nmosque in Bridgeview, IL, a southwest Chicago suburb, waving American \nflags and shouting ``U.S.A., U.S.A.''\n  I would like to read a quote from Governor Ryan of Illinois, who \nsaid:\n\n       The terrorists who committed these horrible acts would like \n     nothing better than to see us tear at the fiber of our \n     democracy and to trample on the rights of other Americans.\n\n  I think Governor Ryan had it right when he was responding to those \nmarching on this mosque in a suburb of Chicago.\n  Up to six shots were fired at an Islamic center in Irving, TX, a \nsuburb of Dallas.\n  A Molotov cocktail was tossed at an Arab American community center in \nChicago.\n  In Huntington, NY, a drunk 75-year-old man tried to run over an \nAmerican Pakistani woman in a parking lot, then followed her into a \nstore and threatened to kill her for ``destroying my country.''\n  Two bricks with notes were thrown through the window of an Islamic \nbookstore right here in Alexandria, a suburb of Washington, DC. One \nnote was addressed to ``Arab murderers.'' The other opened with an \nobscenity and said, ``You come to this country and kill. You must die \nas well.''\n  Members of the Islamic community center in Sterling, VA, came to the \ncenter in order to give blood for the victims of the terrorists acts. \nWhen they arrived, they found their hallway spray-painted with black \nletters, several feet tall, saying, ``Die, pigs,'' and ``Muslims burn \nforever.'' Other\n\n[[Page S9369]]\n\nmosques and community centers have been vandalized, splattered with \nblood, and received hate messages, and more.\n  These acts are attacks both on Americans and on our American values \nof liberty, diversity, and tolerance. They are acts of hate, as \nGovernor Ryan said, that tear at the fabric of American society. We \ncannot accept them or let them go unanswered.\n\n  It is especially ironic that these acts of hate have occurred despite \nstrong Arab, Arab American, and American Muslim support for our country \nin the wake of the terrorist acts. Heads of state in Saudi Arabia, \nEgypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Pakistan, and other predominantly Muslim \ncountries have strongly condemned the terrorist attacks and the \nsenseless loss of innocent lives. American Muslims have lined up to \ngive blood for those injured in the attacks, waiting in line for hours, \nalong with so many other Americans. They are as saddened, sickened, and \noutraged at what happened as other Americans.\n  The terrorist attacks were heinous crimes, and we will bring to \njustice and punish their perpetrators and those who aided or harbored \nthem. But we must make sure that when we train our sights on the enemy, \nwe do not harm innocent people in the crossfire. Again, I quote from \nCardinal McCarrick, the Archbishop of Washington, speaking at a mass on \nTuesday:\n\n       We must resist the temptation to strike out in vengeance \n     and revenge and, in a special way, not to label any ethnic \n     group or community for this action, which certainly is just \n     the work of a few madmen. We must seek the guilty and not \n     strike out against the innocent, or we become like them who \n     are without moral guide or direction.\n\n  These outbursts of hate, this misplaced blame and labeling of an \nentire group, is not an inevitable response. When 168 people died in \nthe bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, some \npeople immediately falsely assumed that Islamic extremists had done it, \nand the same kind of vandalism and hate speech occurred. Later, when we \nfound out that the main perpetrator was Timothy McVeigh, nobody said \nall Christians are to blame.\n  Not all Christian churches were attacked. No acts of hate against \nAmerican Irish followed the bombing in Oklahoma City. We brought the \nperpetrator to justice, but we did not attack others simply because \nthey may have looked like, or belonged to the same faith as, or had the \nsame ethnic background as Timothy McVeigh.\n  We should not paint with a broad brush those who may look the same, \nor have the same ethnic background or religion, as those who \nperpetrated these heinous acts on Tuesday.\n  In Arabic, Islam means peace, and in the Koran it says:\n\n       Whoever kills a soul unjustly, it will be written in his \n     book of deeds as though he killed all humanity.\n\n  Chapter 5, verse 32 of the Koran.\n  Those who are using the Islamic faith as some justification for the \nwholesale killing of innocent people are simply trying to cloak their \nmurderous activities with the cloak of religion and the Islamic faith.\n  The Islamic faith is a religion of compassion and mercy, of tolerance \nand justice, and we should not let those terrorists, those who kill \ninnocent people, try to make the Islamic faith into something it is \nnot.\n  This amendment that Senator Hatch and I and others have sent to the \ndesk expresses the sense of the Senate condemning the vicious backlash \nagainst our Arab Americans and American Muslims. The resolution also \naffirms the important role that American Muslims have played in America \nand in our world culture, and affirms the American values of religious \nfreedom, rule of law, and civil rights.\n  I hope this will be adopted unanimously as a strong statement of our \nenduring support for our constitutional framework of tolerance, civil \nrights, human rights, and diversity.\n  In this time of national trial, we must come together with \nresolution, determination, and unity. We cannot afford hate, \ndivisiveness, or prejudice, or we become like the terrorists.\n  I urge all my colleagues, I urge all Americans to celebrate our \ndiversity, to reaffirm the contributions and civil liberties of all \nAmericans, including Arab Americans and American Muslims.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nIowa for his work on this amendment. I am very pleased to join with him \nin this amendment. As a former chairman of the Judiciary Committee and \nthe current ranking member, I commend the good senator from Iowa for \npreparing an amendment that demonstrates America's inherent principles \nof justice and fairness for Americans of all backgrounds.\n  American values require that we choose our enemies specifically and \nnever do so by ethnic or racial identities. That is just the way our \ncountry is. Yet the incidents my distinguished friend from Iowa has \nrecounted, of which I am aware, really indicate there are people out \nthere who fail to recognize that there are wonderful Arab Americans and \npeople of the Islamic faith who are just as patriotic and just as \ndevoted to our country as anybody in this body, and there is little or \nno excuse for the kind of prejudice we have seen.\n  The purpose of this sense-of-the-Senate resolution is to have the \nSenate on record to let people know that we do not believe in \nprejudicial activities against any American citizen. All Americans \nshould be free from discrimination, including Arab Americans and \npersons of the Islamic faith.\n  We all know decent, dedicated and patriotic people among the Arab-\nAmerican and Muslim communities of our country. These people, in the \nfinest tradition of the immigrant contribution to the American \ntapestry, have made and are making contributions in their communities \nand to our country.\n  We all know how important it is for us to stand together against \ntyranny and prejudice. We all know that it is important for the Members \nof the Senate to be on record against these type of prejudicial \nactivities.\n  We oppose terrorists, not ethnic groups. We oppose the people who \nhave done these horrendous, horrific acts, not U.S. citizens who are \ndevoted to our country and who are just as horrified as any and all \nother Americans.\n  We are going to do something about these terrorists. I believe that \nsoon we will have sufficient identifications to be able to take very \nstrong action against those who have committed these atrocities and \nagainst those who are harboring those who commit these types of \natrocities. And the whole world, I believe, will be with us.\n  It would be a tragedy if we as Americans commit acts of \ndiscrimination and violence against fellow Americans who may hold \nbeliefs that are different from other fellow Americans or who may be \nethnically different from other Americans. It would be a tragedy if we \nallow this to continue. It is important for all of us to embrace each \nother, to stand together against tyranny, to stand together against \nterrorism throughout this world, and some of the most vociferous \nantagonists of terrorism are Arab Americans and members of the Islamic \nfaith.\n  I know that my fellow Americans are all outraged at the events of \nlast Tuesday. No one has an edge on outrage. No one, it seems to me, is \nmore pure than anybody else when it comes to this. But it is simply \nunacceptable, immoral and illegal to take it out on people who are \nhonorable, decent U.S. citizens or on people who support us throughout \nthe rest of the world and especially in the Middle East as well.\n  I commend my colleague for his initiative. He is doing the Senate and \nthe country an important service. I consider it an honor to cosponsor \nthis resolution with my dear friend, Senator Harkin and I hope \neverybody will vote aye on this particular sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, I yield my remaining time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nUtah. I commend the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Iowa on \ntheir comments that there should be a clear-cut distinction between \nthose who are responsible for terrorism and impugning any motives to \nany other Americans whatever may be their descent.\n  We are a nation of immigrants. My parents were both immigrants. There\n\n[[Page S9370]]\n\nare Native Americans, but by and large this is a country of immigrants \nand ethnicity. Making judgments about people should not be based on \ntheir descent.\n  When we talk about terrorism, we are talking about specific \nindividuals who have committed specific acts subject to proof and not \nanyone else.\n  I have sought recognition principally to have a discussion with my \ndistinguished colleague from Idaho about the International Criminal \nCourt. There was an amendment accepted by voice vote earlier which \nprohibited the use of any funds for the Preparatory Commission of the \nInternational Criminal Court. The matter will have to be resolved in \nconference.\n  The House of Representatives has a different provision, and I want to \ndiscuss the matter briefly. I regret if I have caused any delay here.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the distinguished Senator will yield, the Senator \nfrom Iowa wants to ask for the yeas and nays on his amendment. Can we \ndo that?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator from Iowa wants me to yield for that \npurpose?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. And not lose the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do that for the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I was about to say I regret if I have caused any delay, \nalthough I do not know that I have. I was in the Chamber about 2:25 \np.m. to conduct the business I had, and other matters were being \nattended to on the floor at that time, and then the President asked the \nMembers whose States were involved in the recent terrorist attack to \ncome to the White House, and I came back from there as soon as I could.\n  To the point on the International Criminal Court, I was a sponsor in \nthe early 1980s of an international criminal court. At that time the \nthought was that the court would be directed to acts of terrorism, \nkidnapping, and hijacking, as well as drug dealing, when the world was \nfaced with these enormous problems which could not be dealt with on the \nnational level. We had at that time, in the early to mid-1980s and \nbeyond, drug dealers operating out of Colombia where we could not \nsecure their extradition.\n  The thought then was that the drug dealers might be turned over to an \ninternational criminal court, but not to the United States, for \nprosecution. There was a riot outside the U.S. Embassy in Honduras \ninvolving some individuals whom the United States wanted to extradite \nto the United States. Again, an example of what might have been handled \nby an international criminal court. As to hijackers and terrorists, the \nthought then was that countries might cede custody of these individuals \nto an international criminal court, whereas they would not give custody \nto the United States because of national sovereignty and issues of \nideology. Since the mid-1980s when a lot of impetus was made for an \ninternational criminal court, of which Senator Dodd and I were the \nprincipal cosponsors on resolutions--which I shall not burden the \nRecord with at this time because we are getting close to the time of a \nvote--the International Court has turned in a very different way with \nthe War Crimes Tribunal. The War Crimes Tribunal has been effective in \nbringing before it Milosevic and others who were war criminals on \ncharges of crimes against humanity, and there has also been a similar \ntribunal in Rwanda.\n  There has arisen a very difficult issue about the court asserting \njurisdiction over U.S. military personnel and U.S. citizens based on \nwhat are essentially governmental decisions.\n  When I was in The Hague talking to the War Crimes Tribunal prosecutor \nCarla Del Ponte, I was surprised to hear from her that she had given \nconsideration to a possible indictment of NATO Commander General Wesley \nClarke at the urging of Russia and Yugoslavia. Carla Del Ponte \nconsidered possible prosecution against General Clarke for targeting \ncivilians or for using unreasonable force because the targeting of \nmilitary installations resulted in injury to civilians.\n  It seemed to me, and I said this to Carla Del Ponte, that such \nauthority given to the prosecutor of the War Crimes Tribunal, or the \nprosecutor of an international criminal court, goes too far. Having had \nsubstantial experience as a district attorney, it should be determined \nwhether indictment is going to be a fact question or a question of \ndiscretion on the part of the prosecutor. This should be considered \nwhen indicting someone of the standing of General Clarke, who is \ncarrying out governmental decisions by NATO. I thought his indictment \nhardly fit what was conceived generally to be the jurisdiction of an \ninternational criminal court.\n  It is my judgment the United States cannot be a party to an \ninternational criminal court which would consider an indictment \nillustratively of General Wesley Clarke. If the President takes action \nagainst terrorists under a resolution authorized by the U.S. Congress, \nwho knows if that governmental decision is going to be subject to a \nprosecutor's judgment? That action would be outside of the range of \nwhat is considered a criminal act or what is considered traditionally, \nas a crime against humanity.\n\n  All of this brings me to a concern that I have about the prohibitory \nnature of the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho, which limits any funding to the Preparatory Commission. My view \nis the United States should participate in the Preparatory Commission \nin an effort to try to establish jurisdiction, which makes sense and is \nconsistent with our principles. If we do participate in the Preparatory \nCommission, I am sure that we can affect the ultimate jurisdiction of \nthe International Criminal Court. If we participate, I have a sense \nthat the United States will be able to structure an international \ncriminal court targeted in a realistic way and involving traditional \ncriminal concepts as opposed to governmental decisions. There is a \ndistinct possibly--again, not a certainty, but a possibility--that the \nInternational Criminal Court can be so structured.\n  I am concerned that an international criminal court which does not \nhave input from the United States will come into existence. Input from \nthe U.S. could correct problems that may arise if the international \ncriminal court seeks to exercise jurisdiction over Americans at a later \ndate, even if we are not a member of the criminal court.\n  International criminal law has taken a very expansive turn in modern \ntimes through efforts to prosecute people such as former U.S. Secretary \nof State Henry Kissinger and former Chilean President General Augusto \nPinochet, and with courts in other countries exercising previously \nunheard of jurisdiction .\n  It is my hope that in conference we can structure an arrangement \nwhere funding is not denied to the U.S. Government so that it can \nparticipate in the Preparatory Commission. U.S. participation in this \ncommission would allow this country to work out these issues so that \nAmerican citizens and citizens of other countries will not be subject \nto runaway jurisdiction, and so that we will not have Secretary \nKissinger subject to prosecution again. General Pinochet of Chile is \nanother matter, but I would rather be inside the tent than outside it \nwhen trying to deal with these issues.\n  I yield to my distinguished colleague from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for yielding. I must \nsay, in all respect to him, I have always appreciated the Senator's \nlegal mind and the way he works through very difficult processes, and \nit does not differ here.\n  He and I are extremely concerned about the very broad authority that \nappears to be given to a new court if it becomes ratified. That is why \nearly this week I moved to deny our participation in it.\n  It is arguable, by those to whom I have listened, that even a \npreparatory commission's involvement is not going to allow us to change \nthe jurisdiction as prescribed by the Rome treaty. The Senator has \nevery right to be concerned about this broadened authority\n\n[[Page S9371]]\n\nand efforts internationally to go after some of our officials for their \nresponsible actions based on our public policy.\n  The issue is that 30-some-odd nations have already ratified it. It \ntakes 60 with or without our approval. It could become an operative \ncourt. It has an independent prosecutor who legitimately, by its \nactions, could go after anyone 18 years of age or older anywhere in the \nworld. In other words, our sovereignty, our ability to protect our \ncitizens, might only rest within our borders. It was not long ago that \nHenry Kissinger was in France and our Secretary of State had to \nintervene to protect him because a French judge was after him, trying \nto arrest him. This happened less than a few months ago.\n\n  I think the Senator is right to be concerned at a time when our \nPresident is rallying internationally a coalition of nations to develop \na strategy to go after international terrorism, that somewhere down the \nroad that President might be held accountable by an international body, \neven though he had the express permission of this Nation and our people \nto protect this Nation and our people, and would choose to do so in an \nextraterritorial way.\n  Those are very legitimate concerns. I do not know that our presence \nat the table can make the difference because it is my understanding we \ncannot change the basic premise or the intent of the Rome Treaty.\n  I told my colleague from Pennsylvania that I will work with him in \nconference. Clearly, this has to be defined in a way that does not \nallow an arbitrary approach. I am concerned our presence at the \nPreparatory Commission in some way gives to the world an idea that we \nmight be subliminally endorsing this concept. It must be clear we do \nnot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the pending amendment has expired. \nThe question is on agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Voinovich) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Are there any other Senators in the \nChamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 98, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 278 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--98\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Dodd\n     Voinovich\n       \n  The amendment (No. 1560) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we have been very patient and very \nunderstanding. I am ready for the amendment or amendments that the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona has. But it has to be forthcoming or \nwe will just move to third reading. If they don't want a vote for third \nreading, then we will move on to something else.\n  This situation has really gotten totally out of hand with respect to \nthe system for bills being considered on the floor of the Senate. That \nis the work of the Senate. That is front and center. From time to time \nthere are amendments, and they are held up. It takes actually less time \nto work them out. So I am not all antsy that we have to be moving and \nvoting every second. In fact, that is what we have been doing all \nafternoon. We have had a good afternoon working them out.\n\n  But the Senator from Arizona has been put on notice. I understand \nthat he is still trying to reconcile an amendment that some would agree \nto and then some would not agree to; and others are saying: Look, wait \na minute. This is authorization on an appropriations bill; it covers \nthe jurisdiction of several committees; it deserves to be heard before \nvoted upon.\n  I do not know that the point of order would be made of legislation on \nan appropriations bill. But I say this publicly so everybody is on \nnotice. I do not want to say that we just abruptly moved for it. I do \nnot have to get third reading. I have other work to do.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from South \nCarolina would yield for a question.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I share his sentiments in trying to move this bill and \ncomplete it. I wonder what would prevent us from going to third \nreading. Is there an objection to doing that?\n  Frankly, when a bill has been on the floor a long period of time, and \npeople are on notice, it seems to me they have some responsibility to \nbe here to offer amendments.\n  So I ask the Senator, what would prevent us from going to third \nreading at this point?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It would be the will of the Senate whether they want to \ncontinue or not. It would be an up-or-down vote. It would not be a \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might inquire further, obviously no one wants to \nshortchange the opportunity of any Senator to offer any amendment at \nany point.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But there comes a time, it seems to me, that when, if you \nhave an amendment, you have a responsibility to come and offer it, and \nlet the Senate decide.\n  If there are those who have amendments, I hope they will come to this \nChamber. I know the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from \nNew Hampshire have been in this Chamber, literally begging for people \nto come and get these amendments to the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. And on this particular amendment, my understanding is \nthat there are serious misgivings about it because, No. 1, it is \nauthorization, a tremendous authorization bill affecting the \nintelligence activities and the different departments and the different \ncommittees involved there. And the committee chairman, I understand, \nwould oppose it. I know two or three Senators who say they are going to \noppose any amendment that involves legislation on an appropriations \nbill.\n  So I am saying this publicly so no one will think that I am \npresumptuous or traumatic in any sense that I just cut somebody off. \nThey are just cutting off the real work of the Senate because everybody \nis ready to vote on final passage of this measure.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee is in the \nChamber. Maybe he can enlighten us as to where we are headed and that \nwe should wait. I will, along with the chairman of the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DORGAN. One final point, if I might, if the Senator from South \nCarolina will yield.\n  I would encourage the Senator to consider going to third reading on \nthis bill, or at some point there needs to come a time when the Senate \nsays it is time to go to third reading if people are not going to be \nhere to offer amendments.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The distinguished Senator from Vermont, Mr. President, \nhas been waiting patiently for 5 or 10 minutes to speak as in morning \nbusiness. And then we will come back on to this bill. So I ask \nunanimous consent that he be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a brief moment?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from South Carolina and my friend from \nNew Hampshire, there are negotiations going on in the hall now. I have \nbeen told that within less than 10 minutes they will come in and report \nto the two\n\n[[Page S9372]]\n\nmanagers of the bill as to what progress has been made. They feel \nconfident they will have something to offer. So we shall see.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Good.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Jeffords are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 1559\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I send a technical amendment to modify \namendment No. 1559 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is to be so \nmodified.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n       On page 24, line 19, strike ``$83,125,000'' and insert \n     ``$84,625,000''.\n       On page 24, line 21, before the ``;'', insert the \n     following: ``, of which $1,500,000 shall be for the Standing \n     Against Global Exploitation (SAGE) Project, Inc.''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah is going to offer an \namendment on his behalf and others'. I ask unanimous consent this \namendment be the only first-degree amendment in order to this bill, of \ncourse, with appropriate second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1562\n\n  (Purpose: To enhance the capability of the United States to deter, \n   prevent, and thwart domestic and international acts of terrorism \n             against United States nationals and interests)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for Mrs. Feinstein, for \n     herself, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Kyl, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1562.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted and Proposed.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are all interested in moving forward to \nsupport this funding bill, and we broke through the barrier where this \nis the last pending amendment. We are also even more concerned that the \nGovernment have the right tools to hunt down and find the cowardly \nterrorists who wreaked such havoc 2 days ago. For this reason, I \nbelieve it is important to make available important tools to those \ninvestigating this and related matters. This amendment, in my opinion, \nis critical and should pass this evening.\n  I have been working with my colleagues, Senators Feinstein, Kyl, and \nSchumer, on a package of reforms that can aid these investigations. I \nwill highlight a few of the provisions to this bill.\n  As the tragic events of this week have shown, one of the most \nessential tasks our Federal Government faces in the post-cold-war era \nis that of protecting our Nation and our citizens from the unprovoked \nacts of terrorism. In the aftermath of Tuesday's devastating attacks on \nthe World Trade Center and the Pentagon, we, as lawmakers, must take \nevery step possible to ensure, in addition to adequate financial \nresources, that the law enforcement community has the proper \ninvestigative tools at its disposal to track down the participants in \nthis evil conspiracy and to bring them to justice.\n  One of the most effective investigative tools at the disposal of law \nenforcement agencies is the ability to go to a Federal judge and get \nwiretapping authority. It is critical in matters such as this. That is \nthe ability to intercept oral or electronic conversations involving the \nsubject of a criminal investigation. The legislative scheme that \nprovides this authority, and at the same time protects the individual \nliberties of American citizens to be secure against unwarranted \ngovernment surveillance, is referred to in the criminal code as Title \nIII. Among the many protections inherent in Title III is that only the \ninvestigations of certain criminal offenses, those judged to be \nsufficiently serious to warrant the use of this potent crime-fighting \nweapon, are eligible for wiretapping orders. The law lays out a number \nof crimes deemed by Congress to be serious enough to warrant allowing \nthe FBI to intercept electronic and oral communications.\n  Title III currently allows interception of communications in \nconnection with the investigation of such crimes as mail fraud, wire \nfraud, and the interstate transportation of stolen property.\n  Inexplicably, however, the Federal terrorism statutes are not \ncurrently included in Title III. I have been complaining about this for \na long time and this is the time to correct it.\n  Let me repeat that. Title III currently allows interceptions of \ncommunications in connection with the investigation of such crimes as \nmail fraud, wire fraud, and the interstate transportation of stolen \nproperty--important issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will please suspend. The Senate \nwill be in order. Senators will kindly take their conversations off the \nfloor.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. It takes care of those criminal activities, mail fraud, \nwire fraud, and the interstate transportation of stolen property, \nhowever the Federal terrorism statutes are not currently included in \nTitle III. As a result, Federal investigators are often hampered in the \nuse of this powerful tool when investigating terrorist incidents. We \nhave to remedy that, and we should not let a day go by without \nremedying it. We should not let some of the petty aspects of this body \nstand in the way, not passing this type of legislation right now when \nit is really needed, on the day that, for the first time in my 25 \nyears, a vote was interrupted by a bomb threat and we all had to move \noutside.\n  It is time to start fixing these laws. We can play around with \ncommissions. We can play around with task forces. We can do a lot of \nother things, but I would like to fix it now.\n  At this juncture of our history it is essential that we give our law \nenforcement authorities every possible tool to search out and bring to \njustice those individuals who have brought such indiscriminate death \ninto our backyard. However, we must also be careful that in our quest \nfor vengeance we do not trample those very liberties which separate us \nas a society from those who want to destroy us.\n  We are fortunate that we already have in Title III a legislative \nscheme that balances these conflicting interests. We must not be \nhesitant to bring this very important tool--the wiretapping statute--to \nbear on the terrorists who threaten our national security. That is one \nof the things this amendment will do, and in my opinion one of the most \nimportant things that this amendment will do. But it is not all this \namendment will do.\n  Second, cybercrime is one of the fastest growing areas of criminal \nactivities. Terrorists, criminals, and hostile governments are using \ncomputers as tools to perpetrate crimes, and are targeting computer \nnetworks to perpetrate acts of terror that, until this week, would have \nbeen unimaginable on American soil. Millions of dollars are lost \nannually as a direct result of this criminal behavior, and it is no \nlonger a fantasy that thousands of lives could be lost in future \nterrorist incidents.\n  The FBI is devoting an increasing share of its resources to combat \ncybercrime. It is up to us as lawmakers to ensure that, in additional \nto adequate resources, the FBI has the proper tools at its disposal to \nmeet this new challenge.\n  Title III allows the Department of Justice to go to a Federal judge \nand get authority to intercept oral or electronic conversations in \nconnection with the investigation of criminal activity. The law lists a \nnumber of crimes deemed by Congress as serious\n\n[[Page S9373]]\n\nenough to warrant allowing the FBI to intercept communications. Because \ncybercrime is a relatively recent development, the Federal cybercrime \nstatute is not currently included in Title III. As a result, Federal \ninvestigators could not use this powerful tool when investigating \ncybercrime offenses.\n\n  Tuesday's despicable attack on the World Trade Center and the \nPentagon must serve as a wake-up call that we are vulnerable to attack \nin ways we have never imagined. A computer-based attack on our criminal \njustice infrastructure remains a very real possibility. I urge all my \ncolleagues to agree to this amendment to provide our law enforcement \nauthorities with the tools they need to effectively combat this growing \nmenace to the security of our society.\n  There are other important tools this amendment will provide, tools \nthat those investigating the terrorist acts committed earlier this week \nwill be able to use to prevent terrorist acts in the future. We put up \nwith an awful lot of mistaken arguments around here throughout all \nthese years that made it very difficult to put human intelligence to \nwork in the interests of the protection of our people, and it is \ninexcusable, under these circumstances, to allow that to continue.\n  As you know, in some cases, when dealing with human intelligence \nassets, sometimes you have to deal with unsavory characters because \nthey are the only ones who can get inside and help us know the \nmotivations of some of the people who are about to do terrorist acts. \nIt is pretty pathetic that we cannot get our law enforcement people the \nability to get wiretap authority against terrorists because they are \nnot included in title III, unless there is some underlying criminal \nreason for doing so. We have to stop that. If we wait any longer, it \nseems to me, it is a big, big mistake, with the way people are afraid \nin this country, with what happened this week, and with the threats \nthat continue to surround us throughout the world.\n  I have a lot more to say on this, but I think, if I can, I would like \nto yield the floor to my colleague from Arizona, if he cares to take \nthe floor, and he can talk about further aspects of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it is my intention to be very brief, unless \nthere is some objection to what we are doing, because I think all of us \nwould like to get on with the adoption of this piece of legislation so \nwe can conclude work on this bill. But just to ensure there is an \nadequate description of it, I would like to take a minute.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that Senators DeWine, Sessions, and \nThompson be added as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I believe Senator Schumer will have some things to say in a \nmoment. He may ask as well to be added.\n  Let me be very clear about the intent of this legislation. This \ncountry has just suffered the worst terrorist attack in its history. \nAll of us are focused on the victims. We are focused on the terrible \ndevastation and the individual lives impacted. But, as policymakers, we \nhave also been asked some hard questions by our constituents and those \nquestions include things such as: Why can't our Government do something \nabout these horrible crimes? As policymakers, we have to respond to \nthat. We have such an opportunity. I use that word advisedly because in \nthe circumstances that put us where we are today, that word seems \nhardly appropriate. But we do have an opportunity, given the fact we \nare here doing business on behalf of the American people, and that part \nof that business is the bill that relates to the jurisdiction of the \nJustice Department, the funding for that Justice Department, and the \nfact that the bill before us, in fact, even includes some revisions in \nthe law with respect to the authority to deal with terrorism. It sets \nup a special new office in the Attorney General's office, a Deputy \nAssistant Attorney General, to deal specifically with terrorism, and in \nother ways deals with terrorism. Therefore, there is an ability for us \ntoday to focus on some additional improvements that can be made in our \nlaw to deal with terrorism.\n  I hasten to say that this is not ``the answer'' to the problem of \nterrorism. In the first place, I do not think there is a silver bullet. \nThere is no single answer. We already know that there are a whole lot \nof things we are going to have to do to improve our ability to detect \nit, to predict it, to stop it, and to enforce whatever action is \nappropriate after the fact.\n  I am sure we will be creating commissions and we will be passing \nlegislation. In fact, we are going to be passing an appropriations bill \nto begin to fund some of the cleanup of this in the very near future, I \nhope.\n  There are a lot of things that we have to do. One set of things \nexperts in terrorism have been telling us for a long time and the \nDirector of the FBI has been telling us has to do with a few changes in \nthe law that make it easier for our law enforcement people to do their \njob.\n  I have a copy of just one of the three major commissions that have \nreported on terrorism. This is a report called ``Countering the \nChanging Threat of International Terrorism,'' a report from the \nNational Commission on Terrorism. This was chaired by former Ambassador \nBremer and Maurice Sonnenberg, both of whom testified before the \nTerrorism Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, which I chaired at \nthe time. In fact, all of these commission reports have been the \nsubject of hearings before our subcommittee, as well as numerous other \nhearings dealing with the subject.\n  In addition to that, we have had a lot of testimony from the Director \nof the FBI and other U.S. Government officials all imploring us to do \nsome things to help in this battle against terrorism. We took a run at \nsome of these things. In fact, we incorporated some of the provisions \nof these commission recommendations in the bill that passed the Senate \na year and a half ago.\n  It is hard to put a percentage on it, but maybe half of the amendment \nbefore us tonight embodies those same recommendations. So we have \nalready voted on half of the things that are in this amendment. Some of \nthe others have come later.\n  The point is that we dealt with these issues. There has been \nlegislation dealing with these issues. There have been numerous \nhearings about these issues. They were in effect lying on the table \nwaiting for us to deal with them. Unfortunately, it is the case that \neven though from time to time we have put some of these ideas out, \nthere has always been a reason not to do it, to wait, to defer, to hold \noff on that, and that we will have a comprehensive look at this or \nwhatever it might be. We have to set our priorities around here.\n  But those of us who sit on the terrorism committee--the Intelligence \nCommittee and other committees of jurisdiction--have become \nincreasingly restless because we keep getting briefed on the potential \nfor terrorist threats, and we keep imploring our colleagues to please \nlet us act on these things.\n  Finally, we have an event that is so horrendous and so deplorable \nthat all of America is asking us to declare war on terrorism. Indeed, \nthat should be our attitude, in effect. So we are now faced with a \nchallenge from our constituents, and they are absolutely right. What \nare you going to do about it? Of course, the first question they have \nbeen asking us is, What have you been doing about it? My answer is \nthere are a whole lot of things you are going to see us doing that we \nneed to do.\n  We can start tonight with a few substantive changes in the law that \nwill make an impact on our ability to fight these crimes of terrorism. \nSome of this bill calls for analysis and reports about some additional \nthings that we might want to do. It will give us the factual basis for \nacting in the future. Some of the provisions are actual operative \nprovisions that will take effect the minute the President signs the \nbill to begin to give our law enforcement and intelligence agencies the \ntools they need to better fight these kinds of crimes.\n  The former chairman of the Judiciary Committee has just talked about \na couple of these provisions--the so-called ``predicate crime \nprovisions.'' It is incredible our law enforcement agencies have to \nbegin investigating crimes of terrorism under the auspices of looking \ninto other crimes. Maybe there is computer fraud or credit card fraud \nand we will use that as we look to investigate crimes which are really \ncrimes of terrorism. With this, we call\n\n[[Page S9374]]\n\na spade a spade, and say we are investigating terrorism. That is what \nwe expect is the case. That gives us the legal authority to go to the \njudge and get the warrant or authority to move forward.\n\n  In addition, we have an odd thing which crept into our policy that we \nchange. It made sense when it was applied to other governments. We said \nwe are not going to recruit people to spy on other governments guilty \nof crimes or human rights abuses. That is a policy. I don't think we \nwere thinking about terrorism because it is pretty hard to infiltrate a \nterrorist organization with a Boy Scout. They sort of show. What you \nneed are people who are accepted by these terrorist cells. Some of them \nare undoubtedly going to have some things in their background of which \nordinarily we would not approve. But it is the only way they are going \nto get into the terrorist cell. We provide that kind of recruitment can \ntake place.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes. I am happy to yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, does the Senator understand that \nintelligence agencies today are unable to buy information--just to use \nthat as example--from someone who might be part of a terrorist \norganization?\n  Mr. KYL. If I could respond, that is not the issue we are addressing \nhere--the purchasing of information. What we are addressing is the \nrecruitment of what the intelligence community calls ``assets''--people \nwho would be useful in infiltrating an organization and getting \ninformation out of that cell and sharing that information with us.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is the distinguished Senator from Arizona saying that we \nare unable to have what is called a retainer, or bribe, or anything \nelse on a regular basis and have somebody who is part of the terrorist \norganization be giving information to us?\n  Mr. KYL. This amendment doesn't deal with any question of payment for \nagent services. I presume we could do that. This amendment doesn't have \nanything to do with that. The problem that we have here is the former \nDirector of the CIA created the policy because of some things that \noccurred in our past--if we are going to recruit assets, people who \nwould do work for us, those people cannot have in their background \nhuman rights abuses. They cannot have that kind of background. That is \na principle policy if you are recruiting somebody to act against \nanother government. But when you are trying to infiltrate a terrorist \norganization, you are probably going to have to talk to people who \nthemselves have pretty checkered backgrounds. If you could use those \npeople--whatever their motivation; maybe they do it for money, or for \nsome other reason--but if they are willing to give you information \nbased upon their ability to find out what a terrorist organization is \ndoing, then it is very valuable.\n  As the distinguished chairman knows, our ability to collect \ninformation on these groups is very limited. Almost everybody in the \ncommunity talks about the need for better human intelligence. Unless we \nare able to recruit the kind of people who could provide that \nintelligence, it is going to be pretty difficult for us to get it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator has the right to make his whole \nargument, and I don't want to interfere with that. Unfortunately, \nbecause this is something that we have had no hearings on, we haven't \nhad the discussions in the appropriate committees--Intelligence, Armed \nServices, and Judiciary--we are somewhat limited in opposition. I will \nnot cite numerous examples of situations which I think would make clear \nthat we do not have the limitations. I know the concern the Senator \nfrom Arizona has. I don't question his concerns. But in open session, I \nam restrained from going into some of the very specific things where \nconcerns he raised have been responded to in the law by our country. I \nwill not. But that is why I would suggest something like this to the \nArmed Services Committee which has the ability to go easily into closed \nsession, and often does. It would be able to look at it and make a \nrecommendation to the Senate.\n\n  Our committee would be able to make a recommendation to the Senate, \nwhich can be done relatively quickly, and the Intelligence Committee.\n  I would feel far more comfortable voting on something like this if \nthese various committees not only had a chance to look at it but that \nPresident Bush's administration--the Attorney General, the Director of \nCIA, the Secretary of Defense--would have the opportunity to let us \nknow their views on it. I would feel far more comfortable with that. I \nworry that we may run into the situation where--all of us have joined \ntogether in our horror at these despicable, murderous acts in New York \nand at the Pentagon--we do not want to change our laws so that it comes \nback to bite us later on.\n  Mr. KYL. I want to assure the distinguished chairman that we are not \nchanging the law. This is simply a guideline the previous CIA Director \nfelt was needed. We are not changing the law. We are not doing anything \nuntoward or unconstitutional.\n  Our constituents are calling this a war on terrorism. In wars, you \ndon't fight by a Marquis of Queensberry rules. The time to be overly \npunctilious about who you get to work with you to get information from \nthe enemy ought to come to an end.\n  I will assure the distinguished chairman that we are assured that in \nthe past this has not been too much of a problem. But the problem is, \nour folks are a little reluctant to try to go recruit people with the \ncurrent limitations in place because of the difficulties that presents.\n  All this does is to change a guideline--no legal statutory change--\nthat simply says if they believe particular people would be useful in \ngathering intelligence against terrorist organizations--it is \nspecifically limited to that--then they may recruit those people even \nthough there might be something in their background that suggests they \nhave a checkered past.\n  If we cannot use informants against terrorist organizations, which by \ndefinition means there are no good actors, then we start this war with \none hand tied behind our back.\n  There are a lot of other changes that we make in this amendment. Let \nme just illustrate the nature of the things we do. I think almost all \nof them are going to be very uncontroversial.\n  We ask for a study on the role that the National Guard could play in \nthese events.\n  We say it is the sense of Congress that we should commence a long-\nterm research and development program to address catastrophic terrorist \nattacks. Our intelligence folks really need to begin R into \ntechniques for dealing with things such as fiberoptic cable. It is very \ndifficult to intercept communications. With things such as encryption, \nit is very difficult to hear what people are really saying. Times are a \nchanging. We need to be able to develop the techniques to meet these \nnew challenges. This simply expresses the sense of the Senate that we \nshould get on with that.\n  There is a section in this amendment that permits disclosure by law \nenforcement agencies of certain intelligence obtained by the \ninterception of communications. We implement one of the recommendations \nof the Bremer commission, which said there is a lot of illicit \nfundraising for terrorist organizations going on in the United States. \nWe need to get a handle on that. So again, we have the sense of the \nSenate in this amendment that Congress needs to do that. It is not a \nsignificant operational provision.\n  We have a report required on controls on pathogens and equipment for \nthe production of biological weapons. I think this is something \neveryone will support. There has been a lot of testimony on its need.\n  There is a provision that our law enforcement people would like, \nwhich I think is eminently reasonable, and that is that they be \nreimbursed for the cost of professional liability insurance. When we \nsend them off to do certain kinds of work and they may act in such a \nway that they are going to get sued, ordinarily the Government would be \nthe party that is sued. But the Government is immune from suit, so the \nindividual agents are sued. We would like to at least pay for part of \ntheir professional liability insurance when we have asked them to go \noff and do something.\n  Then the final provision, other than the two Senator Hatch has \nalready talked about, deals with authorities that the last Director of \nthe FBI has implored our committee to give him for years. I will state \nthe problem and then tell you what the solution to it is.\n\n[[Page S9375]]\n\n  When you do a wiretap, it is fairly straightforward. You go to a \ncourt, get an order based upon cause, and then you tap into the phone \nline. But with regard to computer attacks, whether it be a terrorist \nattack, all the way down to a hacker--and even hackers can cause a lot \nof problems, but what you want to do, hopefully in real time, is trace \nthe attack back to its source, so you can stop it or you can prosecute \nthe perpetrators. And if it is a terrorist attack, you want to get to \nit immediately.\n\n  The problem is, these people are very clever. Someone, let's say in \nAfghanistan, will electronically hook into somebody in New Delhi. And \nthen through that computer they hook into somebody at the University of \nCalifornia in San Francisco. And through that computer they hook into \nAT in Chicago. And through that computer they hook into the Pentagon.\n  It is well known that you can do this. It is not apparently that \ndifficult to do. Unfortunately, under the law, when the Pentagon starts \ngetting hit, first you get a court order in Virginia. Then you go to \nIllinois and you get a court order there. Then you go to San Francisco \nand get a court order there. I don't know what you do in New Delhi. But \nthe bottom line is, we need to have one place where you go get your \ncourt order, just like you do for a wiretap.\n  That is what the FBI Director, on numerous occasions, asked us to \nprovide, the authority to be able to do that. I can quote you page \nafter page of his testimony asking for this. I will not do that in the \ninterest of time.\n  These are the kinds of things that law enforcement has asked us for. \nThis combination is relatively modest in comparison with the kind of \nterrorist attack we have just suffered.\n  Clearly, there are a whole range of actions that we are going to need \nto take, but the benefit of it is they have all been the subject of \nhearings or reports by these commissions. They are clearly the kinds of \nsteps that we need to begin to take. And we can do that tonight on a \nbill which clearly relates to the subject and at least begin the \nprocess of assuring the American people that we are doing what we can \ndo to stop these horrible events.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have been consulting with the chairman of \nthe committee, and we are hopeful to get a vote on this amendment and a \nvote on final passage. We do intend, according to our leadership, to do \nthat tonight.\n  In the interest of time, I was wondering if we could reach a time \nagreement on this amendment. Obviously, the proponents of the amendment \nhave just spoken, by my estimate, for about a half an hour. I was \nwondering if we could reach a time agreement where anybody rising in \nopposition would be able to claim a half an hour, and then there would \nbe a final 10 minutes which would be equally divided. We would have a \nvote on this amendment sometime around 8:45. I ask unanimous consent if \npeople would agree to that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I reserve the right to object; actually I will.\n  I say to my distinguished friend from New Hampshire, I would be \ndelighted to discuss that. I am still reading this amendment. We have, \nfor example, the requirement for full reimbursement. It sounds like a \ngood idea for people who are----\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask the Senator, is there a time agreement the Senator \nwould be comfortable with?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will be happy to discuss it with him. I thought it might \nbe a little easier if I could get some of the questions I have \nanswered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I withdraw my request, then, and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. There is----\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator might want to seek recognition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I wonder if the proponents of the legislation could tell \nme, how much--I am not going to say we should not do this, but we have \nprofessional liability insurance, as it looks to me, for several \nthousands of people.\n  Do we have any idea how much that would cost? Are we talking about \n$50 million, $100 million, $200 million? Can any of the proponents of \nthe legislation tell me that?\n  Let's say it is $200 million. We will just write that down. It is \neasy enough to say $200 million. We have something that has been put \ntogether in the last few minutes.\n  So we have a requirement, notwithstanding any other provision of law. \nIn other words, notwithstanding whatever other limits are in here, we \nshall reimburse for professional liability insurance for what appears \nto be several thousands of people.\n  Heck, I would like to add to that maybe we could all get ours paid \nfor at the same time. I know mine costs several hundred dollars a year.\n  This might be a fine thing, but if we ask the CIA and the Justice \nDepartment to do that, it has to come out of their budget. They are all \nstrapped for money to spend on fighting terrorism and whatnot. Are they \nwilling to take a $200 or $300 million cut from their budget? I just \nask the question. I have not heard an answer.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course. I yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am not sure we know the exact amount, but what \njustification is there for these heroic law enforcement people who are \ndoing the people's business to have to pay for their own liability \ninsurance in case they get sued by a voracious trial lawyer who would--\n--\n  Mr. LEAHY. It seems to me the distinguished Senator from Utah \nmisstated--and I assume by accident--what I said. I happen to be in \nfavor of people who are going to be out there for our country getting \ntheir insurance paid for if they are in a situation where they do not \ncome under the normal provisions that insulate them from suit.\n  I know millions of dollars were spent by people from all the \ninvestigations that the Congress and others had against government \nemployees, investigations that resulted in nothing in the end, except \nfor the millions of dollars these people paid out of their own pocket. \nSure, I think they should have insurance for that. I just ask the \nquestion: How much? And will this money come out of their other budget? \nIf it is going to be $200 million or $300 million, let's have a line \nitem for that. I will vote for such a line item.\n  In here it says, on wiretapping, pen registers, trap and trace \ndevices, if the court finds that a State investigator or law \nenforcement officer--it could just be an investigator; I don't know if \nthis means a private investigator, a licensed PI--if they certify to \nthe court that the information is relevant, if they just came in and \nsaid: Your Honor, I certify this is going to be relevant; I am a State \ninvestigator; I am the deputy sheriff of East Washtub--I apologize to \nanybody if there is such a town, East Washtub. Let's say I am a deputy \nsheriff on weekends and a mechanic the rest of the time, and I certify \nwe need this, a State officer. Does that mean a Federal judge is going \nto stop things and give them the order?\n  I have worked with some very good deputy sheriffs in my time. I am \nnot sure that even with the best--some of them were darned good when I \nwas a prosecutor--any of them are going to go into Federal court and \nsay: I want to certify I need this wiretap or this pen register, trap \nand trace.\n  I think we ought to at least know what that is, going into people's \ncomputers because the local investigator says, ``I want to.'' I am not \nsure if the authorities, under normal going into court, asking for a \ncourt order, having a hearing, can go into my computer; that is one \nthing. But if somebody goes out there, for example, and sees me having \ntarget practice outside my house--I have a pistol range out back of my \nhouse--and they say: I wonder how many guns he has; I want to go into \nhis computer to find out just in case he has listed his ammunition \npurchases. Should they be allowed to? I would think some of those who \nare concerned about the rights of gun owners might be a little bit \nconcerned about this provision. I am a gun owner. I am concerned.\n  Authority to do wiretaps. It says here that we will redesignate \nparagraph (p), as so redesignated by section 434(2) of the \nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Public Law 104-\n132; 110 Stat. 1274, as paragraph (r); and (2) by inserting after \nparagraph (p) as so redesignated by section 201(3) of the Illegal \nImmigration\n\n[[Page S9376]]\n\nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, division C of Public \nLaw 104-208; 110 Stat. 3009-565, the following new paragraph:\n\n       (q) any criminal violations of sections 2332, 2332a, 2332b, \n     2332d, 2339A, or 2339B of this title (relating to terrorism). \n     . . .\n\n  Does anybody want to tell me what that means? I thought we were here \nto give help to our law enforcement and our antiterrorist authority to \ngo after people. I thought we were here to try to finish up a bill that \nthe Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from New Hampshire have \nworked on very closely--and the Senator from West Virginia and the \nSenator from Alaska--that would give money to our law enforcement \nagencies so we could go ahead and work and try to get the money which \nthe city of New York and the State of New York desperately need after \nthe horrific, murderous terrorist acts in that city. I thought that was \nwhat we were here for.\n  I will not reread what I said, but to do something that nobody here \non the floor can understand or explain, including the people who \nintroduced the amendment.\n\n  Now maybe somewhere there is a press release in there. Why don't we \nall send out a press release, a generic one that says we are against \nterrorists? No Member of the Senate is for terrorists. Why don't we say \nwe are against murder? Of course we are. But then why don't we say what \nwe are doing here? We are going to amend our wiretap laws so we can \nlook into anybody's computers.\n  If we are going to change all these things, if we are going to direct \nthe Director of the CIA and, in effect, direct the President to change \nthe rules of the CIA, something the President could have them do just \nlike that, if the President really wants to--if we are going to do all \nthat here, with no hearing, what does this do to help the men and women \nwho were injured or killed in the Pentagon--and their families? What \ndoes this do to help the men and women in New York and their families \nand those children who were orphans in an instant, a horrible instant? \nHundreds, perhaps thousands, of children became orphans \ninstantaneously. What does that do for them?\n  Somewhere we ought to ask ourselves: Do we totally ignore the normal \nways of doing business in the Senate? If we do that, what is going to \nhappen when we get down to the really difficult questions?\n  Maybe the Senate wants to just go ahead and adopt new abilities to \nwiretap our citizens. Maybe they want to adopt new abilities to go into \npeople's computers. Maybe that will make us feel safer. Maybe. And \nmaybe what the terrorists have done made us a little bit less safe. \nMaybe they have increased Big Brother in this country.\n  If that is what the Senate wants, we can vote for it. But do we \nreally show respect to the American people by slapping something \ntogether, something that nobody on the floor can explain, and say we \nare changing the duties of the Attorney General, the Director of the \nCIA, the U.S. attorneys, we are going to change your rights as \nAmericans, your rights to privacy? We are going to do it with no \nhearings, no debate. We are going to do it with numbers on a page that \nnobody can understand.\n  And by the way, we are going to tell the people who are working \naround the clock today to stop that and give us reports within 2 months \non all these areas. By the way, we commend you for the work you are \ndoing, but set aside a few dozen people and the President to give us \nthese certifications. Part of it seems to me to ask the Attorney \nGeneral to report back to us right away. We are asking the President to \nreport back to us right away.\n  Frankly, I think the Attorney General and the President have their \nhands full right now. I commend them for what they are working on. I \nhave talked with the Attorney General several times over the last few \ndays. He hasn't told me that he needs this investigation. He is pretty \nbusy working on what he is doing. And I say Attorney General Ashcroft \nis doing a very good job.\n  I have spoken to the Director of the CIA. He has not requested that \nwe suddenly turn the attention of the Senate to this legislation. I \nhaven't heard from the President that he wants to suddenly have them do \na number of reports connected with this. Maybe it would make a lot more \nsense if we gave the chairman, the vice chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, and the chairman and ranking member of Judiciary a chance to \nactually have the kind of hearings necessary to know what we are doing \nso that we do not get into some of the problems we got into in the \npast.\n  If we are going to change habeas corpus, change our rights as \nAmericans, if we are going to change search and seizure provisions, if \nwe are going to give new rights for State investigators to come into \nFederal court to seek remedies in the already overcrowded Federal \ncourts, fine, the Senate can do that. But what have we done to stop \nterrorism and to help the people in New York and the survivors at the \nPentagon?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have heard a lot of talk here. But we are \ntalking about giving the tools to law enforcement that it needs to stop \nfurther terrorist acts in our society. You want the authority? I will \ntell you what the authority is right now. We don't need a lot of facts \nand statistics.\n  This publication I hold in my hand is ``Countering the Changing \nThreat of International Terrorism,'' the report of the National \nCommission on Terrorism. By the way, every one of these principles in \nthis amendment, the Justice Department wants, and wants badly, so that \nthey can do their job to protect American citizens.\n  This National Commission on Terrorism says, just to go back to the \noriginal point:\n\n       By recent statute, a Federal agency must reimburse up to \n     one-half of the cost of personal liability insurance to law \n     enforcement officers and managers or supervisors.\n\n  Here is their recommendation, and it is not a bunch of obfuscation; \nit is pretty darn straight:\n\n       Recommendation: Congress should amend the statute to \n     mandate full reimbursement of the cost of personal liability \n     insurance for Federal Bureau of Investigation special agents \n     and Central Intelligence Agency officers in the field who are \n     combating terrorism.\n\n  As I understand it, CIA officers do have this. So it is not something \nthat hasn't been considered or discussed by the top echelons of people \nwho are knowledgeable about terrorism.\n  To get back to the provisions that we are considering, a lot of \npeople in this country don't realize that you cannot tap the lines of \nthe terrorists without some predicate reason for doing so. They are not \nin Title III of our code. This corrects that. It doesn't give law \nenforcement agents carte blanche to go out and do wiretaps. You still \nhave to go to a judge. You still have to get the requisite authority. \nYou have to present persuasive evidence to a judge to obtain wire-\ntapping authority.\n\n  But this is a tool that absolutely has to be had now, not a month or \ntwo from now. Let me go just a little bit further. This statute does \nnot change the standard for trap and trace. It only adds emergency \nauthority for the U.S. attorney. All trap and trace applications are \napproved by a Federal judge. You have to make your case before a \nfederal judge. It isn't some wild-eyed breach of personal privacy. It \ngives us some tools to go get the terrorists. Local sheriffs cannot \napply for trap and trace under these new provisions. Only U.S. \nattorneys can. I get a little tired of that type of talk. I have heard \nthe suggestion that anybody can go in, and anytime some local sheriff \nwants to, he can tap a computer. That is unmitigated bull.\n  Let's talk about the computer situation. Currently, a judge's order \napplies only in the jurisdiction where it is issued. Typically, hackers \ngo from computer to computer, leaving a trail that law enforcement has \nto follow. Investigators must go from jurisdiction to jurisdiction \nobtaining a trap and trace in every jurisdiction in order to follow a \nhacker's trail. Let's put it terms of a terrorist who happens to go in \nall 50 States. That means that, in order to investigate, law \nenforcement has to go in every State in the Union to a Federal judge \nand get authority to do what ought to be done overnight in front of a \nsingle federal judge. Under the amendment we are proposing, it can be \ndone overnight by going to a single federal judge.\n\n[[Page S9377]]\n\n  These are the kinds of things that bother me. This is what this \namendment will do.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to sit down soon because I know we are \nready to vote soon.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee suggested that a prosecutor \ncould get a wiretap for anything they wanted under our amendment. With \nall due respect, under Title III, a prosecutor must still go to a \njudge, just as he or she would when investigating wire fraud or \ninterstate transport of stolen property. If this amendment is passed, \nthe only change would be that a prosecutor could get wiretapping \nauthority with respect to a terrorism or cyberterrorism offense.\n  Is terrorism or cyberterrorism as important as that? Will a judge \napply a different standard in issuing authority for those wiretaps? You \nand I know a Federal judge will not do that. I think the answer is \nobvious. Why should we dither when we know that these tools will help? \nThe FBI are the Justice Department strongly support for these important \nreforms. Let us adopt them now, and fight these problems now. We are \nnot altering the Constitution or taking away the people's rights. We \nare helping to give the tools to our law enforcement community to stop \nterrorism. We are helping law enforcement help us to be safe and to \ninvestigate the crimes like those committed this week.\n  There is a lot more I could say. I understand we are ready to vote. I \nwanted to set the record clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will respond only because my name was \nmentioned in this last debate and the implication was made as to what \nmy position was. Let me state my position to be accurate on the Record. \nI read this to say: If the court finds that the State investigative or \nlaw enforcement officer--obviously two entirely different things--has \ncertified to the court that the information likely to be obtained by \nsuch installation used is relevant to an ongoing criminal \ninvestigation, they get the order.\n  That is what the amendment says. You could have a State investigator, \nnot even a sworn police officer, come in and say: Your Honor, I certify \nthat this is relevant; give me the order. It seems to me as though the \njudge has much choice. We do it to fight terrorism on computers. How is \na terrorist defined? We know what terrorism was at the trade towers. Is \na terrorist somebody who comes in and says: I want to come in armed and \nmake a statement, carrying a legally registered, licensed weapon and \nmake a statement: I should have an easier time to carry my guns? Some \npeople may feel terrorized. In my State, it would be routine. Is it \nterrorist activity if somebody blocks a contractor who wants to tear \ndown trees to open up a development and have sent e-mails to their \nfriends about this? Is that terrorist activity? It is easy to define \nterrorism.\n  It says, however, if you come in from wherever and say you are the \nprivate investigator hired by the contractor, you say: Hey, I certify \nthis, give me the order, and you get it. Fine, if that is what we want. \nI would be a little bit concerned about our own rights as Americans.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have one question I want to ask, perhaps, \nof my friend from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have not had a chance to read this language until \ntonight. I guess that is part of the problem. It also is clear this is \ngoing to be adopted. I want to ask one question for the record.\n  This amendment goes beyond changes in the wiretap law as it relates \nto terrorism; is that correct? The language is ``any ongoing criminal \ninvestigation.''\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So it is broader than terrorism. I am not debating merits \nplus or minus. I am trying to understand what is in it since it came to \nme for the first time tonight. I want to be very clear, at least the \nway I read this, that this is not something that is just limited to \ncounterterrorism, about which I think all of us would have a passion.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. The wiretapping provision is a broad investigational \nauthority. It is not limited just to terrorism, but, currently, \nterrorism is not included in that authority. It is one of the defects \nin our system. All we are trying to do is get it included so we can \nfind these people, and we can do it. Even so, before being granted \nwiretapping authority, you have to make a case, before a Federal judge, \nthat you have probable cause to believe that the subject of the wire-\ntapping order has committed a serious criminal offense.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If my friend will yield further, I understand we want to \nmake sure terrorism is included in our statutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Right.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This amends, though, our statutes. I am not arguing the \npros and cons. It amends not just terrorism, but it amends the wiretap \nlaw and all criminal activity, including terrorism; is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. It adds terrorism to Title III. In addition, it upgrades \nwiretap laws to include computer terrorism, cyberterrorism, even right \ndown to illegal hacking.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But it does not relate.\n  Mr. HATCH. Because those offenses are not currently covered in Title \nIII, and we need to correct that defect or we cannot resolve these \nproblems with regard to terrorism.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I tend to agree with our friends that we need to \nstrengthen the law on that point. I want to be clear on one point: We \nare not adding terrorism to make sure we are covered. We are applying \nthese new standards to all criminal activity, not just terrorism.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct, but keep in mind, our current laws are \nantiquated laws based upon telephones, where now we are in the area of \ncyberterrorism, and we must upgrade the laws to take care of that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I make one request of my good friend from Vermont, the \nchairman, because he has raised some important questions about making \nsure we take the time to know what we are doing. We are not going to \nhave that time tonight. That is obvious. I express the hope, given the \nkind of points that have been made here, that it would be possible, \nbefore this comes back in the form of a conference report, for there to \nbe some review of some of these provisions by the Judiciary Committee.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we will try our best. We are, of course, \nunder the same limitation as everybody else trying to get a lot of work \ndone. I had planned in the next week or so to do a number of judicial \nhearings. I suppose we can spend the time doing this. It probably would \nmake some sense.\n  We do not define terrorism, but we say we are adding that. I guess \nsome kid who is scaring you with his computer could be a terrorist and \nyou could go through the kid's house, his parents' business or anything \nelse under this language; it is that broad.\n  Again, the Senate can vote for whatever it wants. I certainly hope we \nwould put in, and I will support the money for the liability insurance. \nThe problem, I suspect, is with several hundred million dollars. But if \nthat is what we want, we should do it. Let us make sure we know. I will \ntry to get the time for people to work on this during the next couple \nof weeks to try to answer the questions.\n  The Senator from Michigan asks a legitimate one. We will set aside \nvirtually everything else in the Judiciary Committee to get an answer. \nHad I or our staff been asked about this, we probably could have had \nthose answers, but I saw it about 30 minutes ago, about the same time \nthe Senator from Michigan did.\n  I tell my friend from New Hampshire who asked a question earlier, I \nhave no objection to voting any time the Senator from New Hampshire \ndesires to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have had a very good debate on this \namendment. We have had two people who feel very strongly about the \nissue explain very well their respective positions, and the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee indicated he will hold further hearings on \nthis. He is concerned about the way this amendment arrived.\n  The fact is, a lot of times legislation, as the Senator from Utah and \nthe Senator from Vermont know better than I,\n\n[[Page S9378]]\n\nthey both having served here longer than I, sometimes ends up this way.\n  I hope we can get rid of this amendment at the earliest possible \ndate. It is my understanding the proponents of the amendment have \nagreed to accept a voice vote. It is clear this amendment will be \nagreed to. When this bill goes to conference, the two veteran \nlegislators who are managing this bill will be able to deal with some \nof the problems that have been raised tonight.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield? I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Helms be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1562.\n  The amendment (No. 1562) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                 satellite home viewer improvement act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when Congress enacted the Satellite Home \nViewer Improvement Act (SHVIA) in 1999, I well remember, as ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, that we amended the Copyright Act to \nauthorize satellites to carry local channels into local markets. We \nknew at that time, however, that satellites would be unable to carry \nlocal TV stations on a must carry basis.\n  To address this limitation, we did two things. First, we delayed \nimplementation of a full must-carry obligation until January 1, 2002, \nso as to give the industry time to upgrade their satellites to handle \nmore channels. I regret that the satellite industry has challenged the \nmust carry requirement on constitutional grounds, but also observe that \na federal court recently threw out their lawsuit. Second we directed \nthe FCC to make ``final determinations'' regarding license for \nalternative technologies that could deliver local channels on must-\ncarry basis to markets that the satellites would not be able to serve.\n  I know my friend from New Hampshire shared my interest in this issue, \nas we both hail from states with television markets that are considered \ntoo small to receive local channels via satellite. Could my friend \nrefresh for the record what last year's appropriations bill for the FCC \nhad to say about this matter?\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank my friend from Vermont for raising this. As the \nSenator stated, the SHVIA gave the FCC 1 year from the date of \nenactment, or November 29, 2000, to make a final determination \nregarding licenses which had been filed at the FCC in January 1999. \nThus, Congress effectively gave the FCC nearly two years to make a \n``thumbs-up-or-thumbs-down'' decision on these applications.\n  As we were putting together last year's CJS appropriations bill, it \nbecame apparent to us that the FCC was not going to follow that \nstatutory directive by acting on the license applications. Accordingly, \nwe inserted report language into the conference report reiterating and \nclarifying the SHVIA directive. Specifically, we wrote that the FCC \n``shall take all actions necessary to complete the processing of \napplications for licenses.''\n\n  When the November 29, 2000, deadline was reached, however, the FCC \ndid not fully satisfy the directive.\n  I would ask my good friend from Hawaii, who, as a senior member of \nthe CJS Appropriations Subcommittee and as the Chairman of the Commerce \nSubcommittee on Communications, is uniquely qualified to share his \nexpertise on this FCC matter.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank my friends from New Hampshire and Vermont for \ntheir interest in this issue. The satellite ``local-into-local'' \nproblem is indeed a problem in our states, but we are far from alone. A \nnew watchdog group, Equal Airwaves Right Now!, or EARN, recently \nreleased a study which projected that DBS carriers will not carry any \nlocal TV stations in 17 states next January, when the must-carry \nobligation takes effect. Ten more states will find that less than a \nquarter of their stations are carried by DBS. All told, 80 percent of \nall television markets will not have any local TV service via \nsatellite.\n  This is indeed a problem that the FCC should address as soon as \npossible. So I will concur with the sentiments of my colleagues and \nreiterate once again to the FCC that we expect the agency to make a \ndetermination on these long-pending license applications before the \nyear is over.\n  Only one company has satisfied the statutory directive to demonstrate \nthrough independent testing that its terrestrial service will not cause \nharmful interference to DBS. Thus, on this ground alone, it would \nappear that the FCC cannot hold a spectrum auction, because, with only \none qualified applicant, there can be no finding of mutual exclusivity. \nI'm also concerned about any further postponement of the deployment of \nthis service that would deny consumers the immediate savings that would \ncome about with the entry of a new competitor in the marketplace, which \nsome have estimated will total $1 billion.\n  For all of these reasons, I think it is more than realistic for the \nFCC to issue licenses for this new service by the end of this year \nwithout resorting to an unnecessary and inappropriate auction.\n  I believe the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee would \nalso like to add some comments. He is particularly well qualified on \nthis as he is also a member of the Commerce Committee, which like the \nJudiciary Committee, had jurisdiction over the SHVIA.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the gentleman from Hawaii. He and my colleagues \nfrom Vermont and New Hampshire have correctly recited the legislative \nhistory and I agree that the FCC did not fully satisfy either the SHVIA \ndirective or the CJS clarifying directive. That said, I do want to \ncommend the FCC for advancing the ball forward, so to speak, by \nestablishing a Multichannel Video Distribution and Data Service \n(MVDDS), after having concluded that it is technologically feasible for \nthe terrestrial license applicants to share spectrum with satellite \nproviders.\n  I would also remind my colleagues that last year's appropriations \nbill for the FCC also required applicants who applied to share spectrum \nwith DBS operators to show, through independent testing, that their \nterrestrial systems can safely share spectrum with satellites. It is my \nunderstanding that only one applicant, Northpoint Technology, submitted \nits transmission equipment to the MITRE corporation for the required \nindependent test. The MITRE report confirmed the FCC's earlier \ndetermination that terrestrial-satellite spectrum sharing is feasible.\n  The FCC's comment period for the independent test was statutorily \nlimited to 30 days. The opponents of this new service could contest the \nfindings forever, if we let them. We must insist that the FCC respect \nthat deadline by promptly making a final determination on the \nNorthpoint applications. It is time for the FCC to make good on the \noriginal statutory directive and, better late than never, finally issue \nthe licenses. It has how been over 2\\1/2\\ years since Northpoint filed \nits license applications, and we need the FCC to complete action on \nthese applications now so that this new service can enter the \nmarketplace in a matter of months, not years.\n\n\n                              Hydro Plants\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gregg and \nSenator Hollings for their help. As Senator Gregg knows, American \nTissue has closed its mills in Berlin and Gorham with only a few \nemployees keeping the hydro plants in Gorham running. These employees \nare not being paid. The mills have supported these communities for 150 \nyears and are the largest employers in the north country. In addition \nto people being out of work, American Tissue owes the towns millions of \ndollars in back taxes and water bills. The EDA has visited the area and \nhas seen first hand how desperate the situation is and I would like to \nencourage them to do whatever they can to provide these communities \nwith additional help.\n  Mr. GREGG. I, too, have visited the region and they are truly in need \nof assistance. I would like to thank Senator Smith for bringing this to \nthe attention of the full Senate and will work with my colleague to \nensure this area receives the necessary help.\n\n[[Page S9379]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The situation does indeed sound severe. Hopefully we \ncan provide some assistance.\n\n\n                         Coastal Salmon Funding\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I would like to clarify with my \ncolleagues on the Appropriations Committee the disposition of certain \nfunds earmarked by the Senate report language for the Commerce, \nJustice, and State, the Judiciary and related agencies appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 2002. This earmark, for $1 million within the \nPacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund, addresses natural threats to the \nsouthern Oregon/northern California coho salmon in the Klamath River. I \nwould like to clarify that since this earmark is out of the funds \nprovided for the State of Oregon, these funds are to be spent within \nthe State of Oregon.\n  I can assure my colleagues that there are such overwhelming needs \nrelated to water quality in the Upper Klamath River Basin that these \nfunds would be spent effectively in Oregon to improve water quality or \nenhance flows for the Klamath River system overall. Is that also the \nunderstanding of my colleague from Oregon?\n  Mr. WYDEN. It certainly is. I believe it is imperative that, since \nthese funds are allocated to the State of Oregon, they be spent for on-\nthe-ground activities within Oregon. These funds will be an important \ncomponent of the near-term solutions that the Oregon delegation is \ntrying to put together, literally as we speak, in order to assure more \nstability in the operation of the Federal Klamath Project next spring.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I think that is certainly appropriate, and I have no \nproblem agreeing to such a clarification, provided it is agreeable to \nmy colleague, Senator Gregg.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is agreeable to me as the ranking member on the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Commerce.\n  Mr. SMITH. I appreciate that clarification on this issue of such \nimportance to the State of Oregon.\n\n\n                         mecklenburg county, NC\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, It would be helpful if Senator Edwards and \nI can discuss, for the record, with the distinguished Chairman of the \nCommerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary Appropriations subcommittee, \ntwo matters of considerable importance to the citizens of Mecklenburg \nCounty, NC.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will be delighted to discuss these matters with the \ndistinguished Senators from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the able Senator. Mr. President, I would be remiss \nif I did not start by thanking the chairman and the ranking member, \nSenator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, as well as their outstanding \nstaffs, for all of their hard work in putting this bill together. I \nknow that all involved have invested long hours and that you have made \nmany difficult decisions. Senator Edwards and I are grateful for the \nsupport that we received for several vital initiatives in North \nCarolina that are intended to improve public and officer safety.\n  In particular, I am grateful for the willingness of the committee to \nagree to our request for $500,000 to help equip a new Sex Offender \nRegistration Unit at the Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office. \nTragically, sex offenders are, at once, among the most difficult \ncriminals to convict of their crimes and among the most likely to \ncommit new offenses.\n  North Carolina law requires convicted sex offenders to register with \nlocal law enforcement and to notify the police of their change of \naddress. The safety of the public in general, and the safety of our \nchildren in particular, is placed in jeopardy when a convicted sex \noffender fails to comply with N.C. registration laws. Statewide, \napproximately one in ten convicted sex offenders does fail to register.\n  North Carolina's largest county in terms of population, it is perhaps \nnot surprising that Mecklenburg is also the leader in the number of \nregistered sex offenders. Over the past few years, there have been at \nleast 15 separate instances where offenders that were required to \nregister were later apprehended and convicted of subsequent charges of \nmolestation or the rape of a minor child. Ever one such case is one too \nmany.\n  The abhorrent nature of these crimes demands that we do everything we \ncan to ensure that sex offenders are not able to victimize others when \nthey return to our communities. This $500,000 will help the Mecklenburg \nCounty Sheriff's Office to property identify, register, and consistent \nwith North Carolina law, track these heinous offenders after their \nrelease from prison.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator from North Carolina for his \nremarks. He is correct about the high rate of recidivism among sexual \noffenders. We were delighted to be able to accommodate the request of \nthe Senators from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the chairman. In addition to the $500,000 provided \nfor the Sex Offender Registration Unit, there is one other matter \ninvolving the county that I would like to address. Senator Edwards and \nI combined our efforts in support of the county's request for \n$3,000,000 from the COPS Technology Program for the Criminal Justice \nInformation System. Upon receiving the committee's report, we were \npleased to note that the money requested for CJIS was included but we \nalso noted that the reference to Mecklenburg as the intended recipient \nwas inadvertently omitted. If the chairman would be so kind as to \nclarify the committee's intent with respect to these funds, then I \nwould be most grateful.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am glad to be able to address this \nmatter. The committee was impressed by the fact that Mecklenburg County \nhas already committed $8,500,000 to upgrade its criminal justice \nhistory information systems and intends that the $3,000,000 designated \nfor CJIS be used by the county to assist in their ongoing efforts.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I again thank the chairman and my good friend, Senator \nJudd Gregg, for their vital support on these projects. I would also \nlike to recognize the efforts of Senator Edwards and his staff who \nworked diligently to promote these initiatives.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, one of the greatest challenges facing the \ncriminal justice system is the question of how we ensure that convicted \ncriminals do not repeat their crimes when they are released from \nprison. In my State of North Carolina, there are laws that attempt to \naddress this issue in order to make our communities safer places to \nlive and work. These laws require sex offenders to register with law \nenforcement whenever they move into a new county in the State, and \nrequire law enforcement agencies to locate and arrest sex offenders who \nfail to comply with any part of the registration laws. The \nestablishment of a Sex Offender Registration Unit at the Mecklenburg \nCounty Sheriff's Office will enable the Sheriff to keep better track of \noffenders that move into the County, and to identify sex offenders who \ndo not comply with registration laws. Funding for the Unit is critical \ntoward ensuring that our communities are kept safe from individuals who \nintend to repeat their crimes and prey on some of the most vulnerable \nmembers of our society--our children. I greatly appreciate the support \nof Senators Hollings and Gregg for this important project.\n  Also, as my distinguished colleagues indicated, the committee report \nappropriated $3 million for the Mecklenburg County Criminal Justice \nInformation System. The demands of modern, large, urban law enforcement \nsystems, such as Mecklenburg County's, are numerous. That is why the \nCJIS project is so important. CJIS will help local law enforcement \nagencies and court services to manage and compile information about \ntheir cases and to share electronically maintained subject and case \ndata in real time. The end result will mean increased efficiency and \neffectiveness of the criminal justice system in Mecklenburg County and \nthe surrounding region.\n  Again, I thank Senators Hollings and Gregg for their generous support \nof these projects. I also thank Senator Helms for his tireless efforts \non these and the many other appropriations projects that we have worked \nso closely on together.\n\n\n                            methamphetamine\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I understand that Missouri is waging quite a battle \nagainst Methamphetamines.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. The Senator from South Carolina is correct. The rural \nnature of Missouri and its location in the middle of the country have \nled to a sharp increase in methamphetamine production and trafficking. \nIn fact, I am sorry to say that Missouri now\n\n[[Page S9380]]\n\nranks second in the nation in clandestine meth lab seizures.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. In order to combat that problem, we are including \n$1,100,000 in Fiscal Year 2002 funding for the Missouri Drug \nEradication Initiative.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Those funds will go a long way to enabling Missouri's \nhard-working law enforcement officers to combat this epidemic. I would \nlike to spell out exactly how these funds will be distributed in order \nto maximize their effectiveness:\n  $105,000 will go to the Southwest Missouri Drug Task Force to \nimplement a coordinated, cooperative enforcement effort to reduce, \ndisrupt, and dismantle the narcotics trade in a four county area.\n  $110,000 will be for the Southeast Missouri Drug Task Force to target \nmanufacturing, importation, and distribution and related violent crime \nin Southwest Missouri.\n  $100,000 will enable the Northeast Missouri Narcotics Task Force to \nprovide drug enforcement and assistance to city, county, state, and \nfederal authorities that operate within the region.\n  $120,000 will be for the Joplin Crime Lab for new equipment and staff \nsalaries to analyze and assist law enforcement in fighting \nmethamphetamine and other illegal drugs.\n  $110,000 will provide the Southeast Missouri State University Crime \nLab in Cape Girardeau with funding to assist with relocation into a new \nbuilding on SEMO's campus and funding for new equipment to analyze and \nassist law enforcement in fighting methamphetamine and other illegal \ndrugs.\n  $110,000 will help the North Central Missouri Drug Task Force to \nimplement a coordinated, cooperative enforcement effort to reduce, \ndisrupt, and dismantle the narcotics trade in a seven county area.\n  $100,000 will support the West Central Missouri Drug Task Force's \nmission to combat illicit drug interdiction within a nine county area.\n  $145,000 will go to the Combined Ozarks Multi-jurisdictional \nEnforcement Team (COMET) to aggressively investigate and seek reduction \nof drug violations that occur within the area.\n  The Mid-MO Unified Strike Team and Narcotics Group--MUSTANG--will \nreceive $100,000 to support its efforts to combat meth and other \nillegal drugs.\n  The South Central MO Drug Task Force will receive $100,000 to target \nmanufacturing, importation, and distribution of narcotics in South \nCentral Missouri, including the Mark Twain National Forest.\n  I am extremely pleased that these funds have been included in this \nbill. I am confident that these resources will have a meaningful impact \non Missouri law enforcement's efforts to make our state safe and drug-\nfree.\n\n\nTHE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE NATIONAL CENTERS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT \n                       AND CORRECTIONS TECHNOLOGY\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. The fiscal year 2002 State, Justice, Commerce bill fully \nfunds the President's request for the National Institute of Justice. I \ncommend the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee for \nproviding full funding.\n  Among other things, NIJ provides support for a series of National \nCenters for Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology which test and \nevaluate new law enforcement technology and equipment for various \npurposes.\n  Last year Congress provided $1.2 million to establish a new center in \nAlaska to provide cold weather testing capability. I have received \nreports that all the centers in the lower 48 States would be funded in \nthe President's request, but the new Alaska Center would be zeroed out. \nThat certainly is not understanding of the committee's intention, and I \nnote that the committee report was silent on this point. Could the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina and the chairman of the \nsubcommittee help me clarify this point?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It is the committee's intention that the Alaska Center \nas well as the national centers in the lower 48 States continue to be \nfunded through the National Institute of Justice. There was certainly \nno intention on the part of the subcommittee to zero out the Alaska \nCenter. Within the funding that is agreed upon in conference with the \nHouse for the National Institute of Justice, it is my hope and \nexpectation that we will be able to continue funding all the centers \nnationwide at the fiscal year 2002 level. If reductions are required in \nconference, they will occur proportionally, and if increases are \npossible, they would also be spread proportionally among the existing \ncenters.\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree with the chairman of the subcommittee. There was \nnever any intention of zeroing out the new Alaska Center. We will work \nwith the Senator from Alaska to include language clarifying this issue \nin the statement of managers when we meet in conference with the House \nto work out the differences between the two versions of the bill.\n\n\n                washington state methamphetamine program\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, methamphetamine production and use has \nhad a devastating effect on many communities across our country, and \ntackling this problem has been very challenging to law enforcement.\n  Meth has a particularly large impact on my state. We rank number two \nin the nation in meth production and use. Last year, local law \nenforcement raided five times the number of meth labs than they did the \nyear before in Washington.\n  The impact on our health and the environment are extensive. The \nbyproducts of meth production are highly toxic and hazardous and pose \nserious threats to the public at large. Meth is produced with toxic \nchemicals and generates dangerous byproducts. Because manufacturing can \ntake place in the basements of homes and other populated areas, \ninnocent neighbors are often placed in danger by meth production. There \nare also serious safety issues due to the risk of fire and explosion \nassociated with the chemicals involved. Furthermore, the toxins that \nare used and discarded as a part of meth production have serious and \nlong term impacts on the environment, and the clean-up cost are \nsubstantial.\n  The use of this drug can also have a severe impact on families and \nchildren. People who use and make meth put children and their families \nat risk of hazardous contamination and often live in unsanitary \nconditions. Meth uses also tend to emotionally and physically abuse \nthose around them.\n  With that, I yield to my colleague from the state of Washington, a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Cantwell.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank Chairman Hollings and my colleague, Senator \nMurray, for their tremendous work on this bill and am particularly \ngrateful to the Chairman for his clear understanding of the complicated \nlaw enforcement and natural resource issues facing the western states \nand wish to thank him for his attention to those matters in this bill.\n  I believe that we are facing an epidemic in this nation that has the \npotential to be every bit as devastating as the crack cocaine epidemic \nof the early 1990s. That epidemic is the rapidly spreading abuse of the \ndrug methamphetamine. Except that unlike crack cocaine, meth will not \ndevastate our inner cities--it will instead primarily devastate our \nrural communities.\n  I am sure that the Chairman is aware that rural areas are uniquely \nhospitable to meth production, and the paranoid users of meth seek out \nrural areas because they know that our law enforcement officers are \nspread thin, and that they lack the manpower and the resources to \nconstantly find and destroy new labs. A study by the National Center \nfor Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia found that eighth graders \nliving in rural America are 104 percent more likely to use amphetamines \nthan eighth graders in urban areas.\n  This is the reason that we are intent on ensuring that local law \nenforcement agencies have as much assistance as possible in fighting \nthe further spread of the drug. I hope that the Chairman and the \nmembers of the Subcommittee can work closely with those of us on the \nJudiciary Committee as we work to assess the local need for federal \nresources in the months to come. Again, I thank the Chairman and yield \nback to my colleague from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary Appropriation \nSubcommittee, of which Senator Hollings is Chairman and I am a member, \nhas responded to this problem by providing money under the Community \nOriented Policing Services Program to\n\n[[Page S9381]]\n\nhelp local communities and law enforcement combat meth production and \nuse. In this year's bill, we have provided a good number of resources \nto deal with the meth problem, including an earmark for the Washington \nState Methamphetamine Program.\n  Is it the intent of the Appropriations Committee that the money \nprovided for the Washington State Methamphetamine Program be spread \namong the participating counties in Washington State, which include the \ncounties of King, Benton, Snohomish, Kitsap, Spokane, Thurston, Pierce, \nLewis, Grays Harbor, Mason, Cowlitz, Clark, Grant, Chelan, and Yakima?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Committee has long recognized the problems \nassociated with the use and production of Methamphetamines, and we have \nprovided real money to help local communities and law enforcement deal \nwith this problem. It is the intent of this Committee that the money \nmade available for the Washington State Methamphetamine Program be \nspread among the counties that you have mentioned. I do look forward to \ncontinuing to working with the Senators from Washington on this issue \nin the future.\n\n\n                  pacific coastal salmon recovery fund\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask Senator Hollings, am I correct in \nmy understanding that the Manager's Amendment to the Departments of \nCommerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2002 includes an additional \n$4,000,000 for Washington State's share under the Pacific Coastal \nSalmon Recovery Fund, raising the total for Washington State to \n$24,150,000 and the total for this account to $74,000,000?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator from Washington State is correct.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator. I appreciate his assistance in this \nmatter.\n\n\n              coastal protection and restoration projects\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. It is my understanding that of the $31 million provided \nfor ``Coastal Protection and Restoration Project'' in the National \nOcean Service Account of the Senate Committee Report of the Commerce, \nJustice, State Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2002, $15 million is \nto be provided to the State of Louisiana and $15 million is to be \nprovided to the State of Alaska for coastal impact assistance. This \nfunding is to be allocated to and used by the States of Alaska and \nLouisiana in accordance with the coastal impact assistance program \nauthorized in the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Bill, fiscal \nyear 2001.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator from Louisiana is correct.\n\n\n                           oregon groundfish\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Chairman Hollings, \nfor accepting the amendment I sponsored to provide funding to aid \nOregon groundfish fishers and their families. I also want to thank \nChairman Hollings for providing this opportunity to clarify, for the \nrecord, how the money provided by this amendment should be spent.\n  This amendment provides $2,000,000 in additional National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration funds for Cooperative Research on West Coast \ngroundfish. It also provides $3,000,000 in additional NOAA funds for \nemergency assistance for the Oregon groundfish fishers suffering from \nthe groundfish fishery disaster resulting in more than 40 percent drop \nin income since 1995.\n  The $2,000,000 for cooperative research surveys will be used by the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service to put currently out-of-work \ngroundfish fishing vessels and their owners to work doing annual \ngroundfish data collections. In Oregon, and along with the West Coast, \nthe National Marine Fisheries Service sets harvest regulations \nregarding 83 species of groundfish but collects data on only 16 \nspecies. They do so every three years instead of annually, as they do \nin many other fisheries. This funding for annual surveys means jobs for \ndisplaced fishers and reliable economical and educated labor for an \nagency that claims it can't do its work because it doesn't have enough \nmoney or manpower. It also means better fisheries data, which should \nyield better fisheries management and benefit the environment and local \nfishers.\n  The $3,000,000 for economic assistance is provided for fishers \nimpacted by the loss of the August court case in which the Natural \nResources Defense Council sued NMFS and won because NMFS used 15-year-\nold data to set groundfish harvest levels. Allowable harvests have been \ncut by an average of 64 percent over the past five years, and for some \nspecies it has been cut by 90 percent. This court order will result in \nfurther catch reductions. These folks are on the ropes; if they can't \nfish, they can't pay their bills. They need some help while they figure \nout what to do next as almost 3,000 of them try to transition into \nother lines of work. This assistance money should be used for single, \nlump sum payments to vessel owners who are suffering from these \nfinancial losses. The precedent for this type of payment can be found \nin the Hawaii longline fishery where fishers received $3,000,000 of \nemergency assistance through the Secretary of Commerce in FY 2001 after \nthe courts shut down their swordfish and tuna fisheries.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I understand that the $2,000,000 for cooperative \nsurveys is to be used for annual West Coast groundfish surveys in \nOregon, as well as to provide work for displaced Oregon groundfish \nfishers. I further understand that the economic assistance money is \nintended for vessel owners to tide them over these difficult times. I \nappreciate the Senator bringing this important issue to light and I am \nhappy to have been able to help his constituents on this important \nissue.\n\n\n         new technology to aid fbi's innocent images initiative\n\n  Mr. GREGG. As the distinguished Chairman of the State, Justice, \nCommerce Appropriations Subcommittee knows, we have provided \nsubstantial funds through the years to support Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (FBI) efforts to catch child predators and pornographers \nengaging in criminal activity on the Internet. The FBI's first \nundercover operation in this field of investigation, code named \n``Innocent Images,'' was initiated in 1995. Six years later, Innocent \nImages is an FBI National Initiative, supported by annual funding of \n$10 million, with undercover operations in eleven field offices.\n  The FBI's Innocent Images Initiative utilizes undercover agents \nposing as children on-line to identify and investigate potential sexual \npredators. Under current practice, the FBI's Innocent Images Initiative \nrelies on individual agents posing as children in on-line ``chat \nrooms.'' Thus, the effectiveness of the program is necessarily limited \nbecause human resources are limited.\n  Recently, I became aware that a company called Spectre AI has \ndeveloped new technology that has the potential to increase vastly the \neffectiveness of the Innocent Images Initiative. Spectre's technology \nutilizes computers that are capable of monitoring large numbers of on-\nline chat rooms simultaneously. These computers are programmed to \nsearch for certain key words or phrases for which agents are trained to \nspot when on-line looking for child predators and pornographers. When \nsuch key words or phrases are identified, Spectre's artificial \nintelligence program carries on a limited, two-way dialogue with the \npotential child predator. Simultaneously with the initiation of this \ntwo-way dialogue, the Spectre technology notifies an FBI agent, who \nthen takes over the investigative chat-room dialogue.\n  This new technology developed by Spectre AI has the potential to \nincrease exponentially the number of Internet chat rooms that the FBI \ncan monitor. Thus, it holds the promise of an enormous leap forward in \nthe effectiveness of the FBI's ``Innocent Images Initiative'' and its \ngoal of protecting our Nation's children from sexual predators and \npornographers.\n  Does the Chairman agree with me that Specter AI's new technology \nshould be carefully reviewed by the FBI for possible utilization in its \n``Innocent Images Initiative''?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am intrigued by the new technology that the Senator \nhas described. I certainly will join you in encouraging the FBI to give \nit consideration.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings \nfor considering this amendment. For purposes of clarification, it is my \nunderstanding that this amendment will decrease funding from the \nNational Oceanic and Atomospheric Agency\n\n[[Page S9382]]\n\n(NOAA) Procurement, Acquisition and Construction account by $500,000, \nspecifically from the ``Norman Consolidation Project,'' and add the \nsame amount, $500,000, to the International Trade Administration, Trade \nDevelopment account for International Trade Processing Center Programs \nin McCain County, Oklahoma. Is that how the Senator from New Hampshire \nunderstands this amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes. That is exactly how I understand the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Oklahoma. We are happy to accept this \namendment.\n\n\n   designation of the ft. smith, arkansas INS office as a sub-office\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I would like to discuss the need to designate the \nImmigration and Naturalization office located in Fort Smith, Arkansas, \nas a Sub-office, with an Officer-in-Charge.\n  I understand that the area serviced by the Fort Smith INS office has \nexperienced tremendous growth in its Hispanic population and needs this \ndesignation in order to efficiently administer and enforce our nation's \nimmigration laws.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. That's absolutely correct. As you know, according to \nthe 2000 Census, Arkansas' Hispanic population grew by 337 percent over \nthe course of the past decade, a rate of growth which is believed to be \nthe fastest in the nation. In the Third Congressional District, where \nthe Fort Smith office is located, Hispanics now comprise 5.7 percent of \nthe total population. This phenomenal growth is shown even more \npoignantly when one considers that the Northwest Arkansas county which \nis home to the University of Arkansas, Washington County, experienced a \n629 percent increase in its Hispanic population. Needless to say, this \ninflux of new immigrants is putting a significant strain on the \nprovision of basic immigration services.\n  Mr. GREGG. Can you give me an example of how a Sub-office designation \nwould reduce that strain?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Currently, the staff of the Fort Smith office are \nprocessing a significantly greater number of cases than was originally \nplanned and doing so without a corresponding increase in staff. Thus, \nit is common for a person's work permit or travel document to be \nunnecessarily delayed due to the fact that the Fort Smith office simply \ndoes not have the resources necessary to locally process the \napplication. A Sub-office designation, and the Officer-in-Charge that \nwould accompany it, would allow the Fort Smith office to administer \noaths of naturalization, authorize arrest warrants, issue intentions to \nfine, and process other administrative matters.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I appreciate your bringing this matter to our attention \nand we will look into this situation in conference.\n\n\n                           fy02 scaap funding\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise with a number of my colleagues \nand the Chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State Subcommittee, the \nSenator from South Carolina, to discuss funding for the State Criminal \nAlien Assistance Program, popularly known as SCAAP.\n  As the Senator knows, States and localities across the nation, \nespecially those with high immigration populations, face extraordinary \ncosts associated with incarcerating criminal aliens.\n  The burden continues to grow, for high impact States like California, \nfor example. In February 1997, there were 17,904 undocumented felons in \nthe California correctional system with Immigration and Naturalization \nService holds. By the end of February 2001, there were 20,937 illegal \nalien inmates in the system with INS holds. California taxpayers can \nexpect to spend $571.2 million this year to cover these costs.\n  Over the past few years, the SCAAP program has reimbursed roughly 33 \npercent of the costs incurred by State and local governments. Since \n1997, the authorization level for SCAAP has been $650 million. Funding \nfor the program peaked at $585 million in FY 1999, and dropped to $565 \nmillion in FY 2000.\n  Given the rising costs associated with criminal alien incarceration, \nthe legislation my colleagues and I had hoped that Congress would see \nfit to fully fund this important program at the authorized level of \n$650 million.\n  I am concerned that the bill reported by the committee makes dramatic \ncuts in federal funding for SCAAP, reducing the level of funding by 53 \npercent to only $265 million.\n  Given the urgency of the need and the fact that all 50 States, the \nDistrict of Columbia, Puerto Rico and more than 360 localities received \nSCAAP funding in the most recent reimbursement period, I would like to \ninquire of my friend from South Carolina if there is something that can \nbe done to increase funding for this bill for SCAAP to a more \nappropriate level.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the remarks \nof my good friend, the Senator from California, and also look forward \nto working with the Chairman and Ranking Member of the subcommittee to \nresolve the funding disparity in the State Criminal Alien Assistance \nProgram (SCAAP).\n  Before I begin my comments about this important program and the level \nof funding in the Senate Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill, I \nwant to state my full support for the $565 million funding level for \nSCAAP in the House FY 2002 bill. Through the Crime Control Act of 1994, \nthe Congress created SCAAP to reimburse states and localities for the \ncosts they incur incarcerating criminal illegal aliens. Such costs, it \nhas been made clear, are the responsibility of the federal government. \nSCAAP has been authorized at $650 million, although total expenditures \nof the states and localities exceeds $1.6 billion per year. Though the \nfinancial burden to process and incarcerate criminal illegal aliens \noverwhelms the budgets of many states and localities, SCAAP has never \nbeen allocated its full authorization. Over the past five years, SCAAP \nhas usually been funded at levels between $500 million and $600 \nmillion, which has provided states and localities reimbursement of \nabout 30 cents for each dollar spent on incarceration.\n\n  The Congress would be doing the right thing if it allocated $1.6 \nbillion. In FY 2001, the state of Arizona and its localities incurred \ncosts of well over $30 million to incarcerate criminal illegal aliens, \nand received $18 million in federal reimbursement--when SCAAP was \nfunded at $585 million overall.\n  To reduce the total 2002 SCAAP fund from its $565 million level to \n$265 million (a $300 million decrease), is unacceptable. Should funding \nbe reduced to $265 million, all 50 states, D.C., and the increasing \nnumber of localities that incur costs, which now receive an \nunacceptable 30 cents for each dollar spent, will receive an even more \nunacceptable level of reimbursement.\n  Mr. President, I very much hope that Senators Gregg, Hollings, \nFeinstein, Graham and I can work to resolve these issues before this \nbill is signed into law.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I join with my colleagues to stress the importance of \nadequate funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. When \nour state and local law enforcement undertake the task of assisting the \nfederal government in areas of complete federal jurisdiction, such as \nimmigration, we need to ensure that we are not unfairly shifting the \ncost burden of this task to our state and local partners. The \nincarceration of criminal aliens, when undertaken by state and local \ngovernments, should be reimbursed. SCAAP is a good first step--it \nreimburses some of the costs--we should do more. But at the very least, \nwe should ensure that at least the $565 million allocated in the House \nbill is available for SCAAP this year.\n  Each of our states receives reimbursement from SCAAP. Our law \nenforcement community counts on this funding, and it is our obligation \nto ensure that our federal responsibility is met.\n  I am pleased to be working with so many dedicated colleagues on this \nmatter, and look forward to working with the Committee on an issue of \nsuch importance to each of our states.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator for his encouraging words. As I \nam sure he knows, the SCAAP reimbursements provided in prior years did \nnot nearly cover the costs states and localities incurred to \nincarcerate illegal aliens in their jurisdictions.\n  In Fiscal Year 2000, the last year for which such cost figures are \navailable, the cost for states and localities amounted to more than $11 \nbillion. Thus, last year's funding level covered only $565 million, or \n5.1 percent, of the actual costs.\n\n[[Page S9383]]\n\n  A cut along the magnitude of that which is included in the Committee \nbill would be absolutely devastating. The State of Wisconsin would lose \nmore than $1.1 million in funding; Rhode Island would lose over \n$900,000; Pennsylvania would lose over $1 million. Thus, even states \nwhich have not traditionally had to confront the growth in illegal \nimmigration are bearing the costs of this Federal responsibility.\n  When the Federal government fails in its responsibility to control \nour nation's borders, local taxpayers should not have to foot the bill \nfor incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens in State and local \njails.\n  I will work closely with my colleagues in both bodies during the \nweeks to come to insure that this bill adequately funds SCAAP.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, obviously the highest priority as a nation \nis addressing every aspect of the terrorist attacks that took place in \nour country earlier this week. That is now and should be in the \nforeseeable future our primary concern as a Senate, a Congress and as a \ncountry. Part of responding to that concern includes demonstrating to \nourselves and the world that we can carry on the very important \nbusiness of our country. That business includes election reform.\n  I now address the issue that will become increasingly important as \nour Nation and our deliberations in Congress return to normal. This is \nthe issue of funding for election reform. I appreciate this opportunity \nto include an amendment as part of the managers' amendment to H.R. 2500 \n(S. 1215). This bill contains appropriations for the Department of \nCommerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and related agencies for \nthe fiscal year 2002.\n  My amendment provides a $2 million placeholder for election reform in \nfiscal year 2002. These Federal dollars would be used to fund a Federal \ngrant program administered by the Department of Justice to States and \nlocalities for election reform improvements nationwide.\n  The amendment that I have crafted is identical to the provision \ninserted in S. 1398, the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. The \nCommittee on Appropriations included a $2 million placeholder in the \nFederal Election Commission appropriation for administering a program \nto award Federal matching grants to States and localities to improve \nelection systems and election administration for fiscal year 2002. The \nreport to accompany that bill, S. Report 107-57, notes the intent of \nthe committee that ``once such a program is enacted into law, the funds \nshould be available to immediately begin this process.''\n  My provision mirrors this language. Legislation ordered reported by \nthe Rules Committee on August 2, 2001, S. 565 provides for a Federal \ngrant program to the States and localities to fund election reforms, \nincluding funds to meet minimum national requirements for voting \nsystems standards and technology, provisional voting, and distribution \nof sample ballots, with voting instructions and voting rights. The bill \nfunds the grant program through the Department of Justice. The Senate \nwill debate this legislation later this fall. This amendment preserves \nthe ability of the Senate to fund reform through either the Department \nof Justice, the Federal Election Commission, or both.\n  I firmly believe that it is the obligation of the Congress to provide \nboth the leadership and the resources for election reform. The reforms \nare necessary to provide guidance to States on election administration \nand technology and to re-establish public confidence in our elections \nsystem. Similarly, the financial resources are essential to support \nStates and localities in implementing, maintaining and weaving those \nvital election reforms into the fabric of our American democracy.\n  My amendment for a $2 million placeholder is at the same level of \nsupport that is currently included in the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill for election reform.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \namendment. It is essential that we include the $2 million placeholder \nnow to preserve our ability to negotiate actual funding levels for \nelection reform in conference.\n  Further, I also urge my colleagues to support the companion provision \nfor election reform in the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill when it \nis debated on the Senate floor in the near future.\n  I will support both provisions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of this \nbill, Chairman Hollings and Senator Gregg, for accepting this \namendment, and to thank Senators Durbin and DeWine and Congressmen Hall \nand Wolf for their leadership on this issue. I also want to recognize \nthe NGOs that have worked so hard on this bill, and to recognize the \ndiamond industry itself, which has come forward to work with the \nadvocates and with Congress.\n  I now serve as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee's Subcommittee on African Affairs. I have been to the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. I have been to Angola. And, most \nrecently, in February I traveled to Sierra Leone.\n  In each of these places, I have met amputees, refugees, widows and \nwidowers and orphans. I have seen the tragic consequences of the near \ntotal disruption of a society--the malnourishment, the disillusionment, \nthe desperation. And each time, I have been sickened by the knowledge \nthat some people are getting rich as a result of this misery.\n  I believe that our national values demand that the United States \ndisassociate itself from the trade in conflict diamonds.\n  But over the years that I have served on the Africa Subcommittee, I \nhave also worked on issues relating to countries like South Africa and \nBotswana. These states depend upon their legitimate diamond industries \nto fuel economic growth and development. It is critical to distinguish \nbetween the entirely legitimate diamond exports of a country like \nBotswana, and the diamond trade that has helped the RUF and UNITA to \nsustain bloody wars.\n  This legislation will help to build momentum behind the multilateral \nefforts currently underway to regulate the diamond trade and to create \na ``clean stream'' for the legitimate diamond industry and consumers to \nrely upon. It is my hope that the action we take today will encourage \nthe governmental authorities, advocacy groups and industry \nrepresentatives gathering in London to work toward a multilateral \nsolution. They must take decisive action to implement a rigorous \nregulatory regime, not retreat into half-hearted calls for self-\nregulation.\n  It is equally important to be honest about the fact that stopping the \ntrade in conflict diamonds is not the silver bullet that will stop the \nconflicts in West Africa or the D.R.C. or Angola. These complex crises \ncall for nuanced and multi-faceted policy responses. But this one \nelement--de-legitimizing the trade in conflict diamonds--will make it \nmore difficult, and less lucrative, for some of the most odious actors \non the international stage to continue pursuing their violent and \nabusive agendas. It is unquestionably a step worth taking.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today the Senate voted in favor of an \namendment I offered with Senators Bond and Collins to increase funding \nfor the Small Business Administration's Women's Business Centers \nprogram from $12 million to $13.7 million, by using some additional \nfunds from the Agency's Salaries and Expenses account. I thank all my \ncolleagues for their support of this important resource for women \naround the country who are working for economic independence and \nworking to provide jobs and opportunities for others in their \ncommunities.\n  Today is not the first time the Women's Business Centers have been \nsupported from both sides of the aisle. On April 6th, the full Senate \nagreed by voice vote to a similar amendment Senator Bond and I offered \nto the Senate Budget Resolution. Like today's amendment, that \namendment, Amendment No. 183, increased the funding for Women's \nBusiness Centers from $12 million to $13.7 million.\n  I am encouraged by our ability to work together and reinforce the \ngood work of the Women's Business Centers. When a Center trains an \nentrepreneur, she knows how to approach a lender for a loan, knows how \nto manage her business, and understands the hows and whys of marketing.\n  Let me give you two examples of women who sought assistance from the \nWomen's Business Center in Boston, the Center for Women & Enterprise.\n\n[[Page S9384]]\n\n  Nancy Engel went from struggling to raise her family on public \nassistance to owning her own mail order and catalog company and \ncreating four jobs. She not only helped herself, but has shared her \nbetter fortune by employing other mothers who have the flexibility to \nmake it home in time to meet their kids at the school bus.\n  And then there's Sarah Byrne--a computer specialist who lost her job. \nFed up with being at the mercy of a big company, she launched her own \ncomputer company, Complete Communications. With the help of CWE, Sarah \nhas grown her company in Wakefield, Massachusetts, to about 14 \nemployees.\n  I think it's remarkable that the program opened its first 12 centers \nin 1989 and today women have access to training and counseling at \nalmost 100 sites. I also think it's remarkable that over the past \ndecade the number of women-owned businesses operating in this country \nhas grown by 103 percent to an estimated 9.1 million firms, generating \n$3.6 trillion in sales annually, while employing more than 27.5 million \nworkers. I want to encourage this trend.\n  In closing, I want to thank Senator Hollings and his staff for all of \ntheir help and support of not only this amendment but for the Small \nBusiness Administration in general. Again, I thank all my colleagues \nfor voting in favor of this amendment, and Senators Bond and Collins \nfor offering this amendment with me. I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the amendment was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       In the appropriate place in the bill regarding \n     appropriations for Salaries and Expenses of the Small \n     Business Administration, insert the following after the \n     phrase ``by section 21 of the Small Business Act, as \n     amended'': ``Provided further, That $13,700,000 shall be \n     available in fiscal year 2002 to fund grants as authorized by \n     section 29 of the Small Business Act.''\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I rise today to express my extreme concern about \ndevelopments in the Republic of Korea that have far reaching negative \nimplications for United States semiconductor companies.\n  I am referring to the massive and unjustified government bailout that \nthe South Korean government is providing to Hyundai Electronics, now \nknown as Hynix.\n  Today, I am offering a sense-of-the-Senate amendment on this issue. I \nam joined by my colleague from Idaho, Senator Crapo, in this effort.\n  To date, the South Korean government and the government-owned banks \nhave given Hynix over $5 billion in loans and other types of financing \nwhich carry the guarantee of the government of Korea. This is a subsidy \npure and simple.\n  Now the Korean government is planning on giving Hynix additional \nloans to keep them solvent.\n  In the year 2000, Hynix was the world's largest producer of dynamic \nrandom access memory--or D-RAM--an important type of memory \nsemiconductor that is used in everything from personal computers to \nsatellites. Hynix has captured over 24 percent of the world \nsemiconductor market.\n  However, Hynix achieved such a large share of the global market not \nbecause it is particularly good at making these semiconductor chips, \nbut because it borrowed excessively and built up enormous capacity.\n  Last year, Hynix became unable to service its debt. Hynix lost over \n$2 billion in 2000, and is expected to lose over $3 billion this year \non sales of a little over $3 billion.\n  By any reckoning, this company would have failed were it not for \ngovernment assistance.\n  Now, Hynix is broke and cannot repay the loans it took out to finance \nits expansion. Verging on bankruptcy, Hynix has been kept alive by the \nSouth Korean government through infusions of new cash.\n  Far from solving the company's problems, however, these government \nsubsidies are just plunging Hynix deeper into debt.\n  This behavior circumvents normal market forces and has very severe \nimplications for the companies in the U.S. and the rest of the world \nthat are forced to compete with Hynix's illegally subsidized products.\n  Over the past several months, the Korean government has given \nassurances to me, to my colleague Senator Crapo, and other Members of \nthis body, as well as Ambassador Zoellick, Secretary Evans and \nSecretary O'Neill, that the Korean government will stop giving these \nsubsidies to Hynix--subsidies that clearly violate our international \ntrade agreements.\n  Now, the Korean government seems poised to violate these assurances \ncompletely, destroying the U.S. semiconductor industry in the process.\n  The Sense of the Senate resolution I am offering outlines these facts \nand calls upon the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of \nCommerce, and the United States Trade Representative to request \nconsultations with the Republic of Korea under Article 4 and Article 7 \nof the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures of the World \nTrade Organization.\n  This amendment further asks that the Administration take any other \nactions that are necessary to assure that the improper bailout by the \nRepublic of Korea is stopped, and its effects fully offset or reversed.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nand will join me in calling on the Korean government to stop \nsubsidizing Hynix and to stop this dangerous distortion of the \ninternational semiconductor market.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this bill, \nSenator Hollings and Senator Gregg, for working with me to include an \namendment I offered to the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations \nbill. The amendment is the Bruce Vento Hmong Veterans' Naturalization \nExtension Act. The Act is named after my late colleague and dear \nfriend, Congressman Bruce Vento. Congressman Vento dedicated much of \nhis career to working with the Hmong community in Minnesota. He worked \nfor a decade to ensure the passage of the Hmong Veterans Naturalization \nAct. This amendment would make it possible for all eligible Hmong \nveterans and their wives to receive the benefits they are due under \nthis Act by extending the application deadline from November 26, 2001 \nto May 26, 2003.\n  With less than 3 months remaining before the deadline passes for most \nof those covered under the Act, only 25 percent of all eligible \napplicants have filed for citizenship. Advocates for the Hmong believe \nit will be impossible for all those eligible to file by the deadline. \nThe Hmong community has faced many challenges in getting veterans and \ntheir wives filed. The Department of Justice did not release its \nguidelines for 2\\1/2\\ months and many INS regional offices were \nunfamiliar with the guidelines for a period of time after that, \nresulting in eligible Hmong applicants being turned away. The language \nbarrier that created the need for the Hmong Veteran Naturalization Act \nin the first place has meant that many Hmong needed assistance from \nHmong community advocates to understand the citizenship process and to \nfill out the citizenship application. These advocacy organizations are \nvastly under-resourced and are overwhelmed by the demand for help from \nHmong applicants.\n  I want to make it clear. This amendment would not increase the number \nof eligible applicants. It in no way would change the other \nrequirements of the law. It simply would provide a necessary extension \nfor existing eligible applicants.\n  As the Senator from Minnesota, I am proud to represent one of the \nlargest Hmong populations in America. My experience as a Senator has \nbecome much richer as a result of coming to know the history and \nculture of the Hmong people in Minnesota. I deeply respect their \nextraordinary efforts in support of the American people. When the \nConference Committee meets, I urge my colleagues' strong support of \nthis amendment so it may become law when this bill is passed. The \noriginal Act was passed because of Hmong veterans' tremendous sacrifice \non behalf of the United States during the Vietnam War and because of \nthe unique literacy challenges the Hmong community faces. It would be \nwrong to deny the benefits of the Act to eligible veterans for reasons \nthat are beyond their control. Let us fulfill the intent of the Act we \npassed last year and ensure that these veterans and their families \nreceive the benefits they are due.\n\n[[Page S9385]]\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I congratulate Chairman Hollings and \nSenator Gregg for including in this appropriations measure a grant of \n$500,000 to the National Capital Area Council of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica for its ``Learning for Life'' program that serves 20,000 \nstudents in Washington, D.C., Virginia and Maryland. This is not a new \nprogram; the Congress has funded it for the past two years. By \ncontinuing to fund ``Learning for Life'' for another year, thousands of \nyoung people in the Washington metropolitan area will be able to \nparticipate in an innovative program that helps them develop social and \nlife skills, assists their character development, and helps them \nformulate positive personal values.\n  ``Learning for Life'' is designed to support our schools in their \nefforts to prepare youth to successfully handle the complexities of \ncontemporary society and to enhance their self-confidence and \nmotivation. It prepares youth to make ethical decisions that will help \nthem achieve their full potential.\n  At a time when drugs and gangs are ravaging our schools and \ncommunities, this program is a catalyst to help stop this trend. \nTeachers use age-appropriate, grade-specific lesson plans that give the \nboys and girls in our schools the skills and information that helps \nthem cope with the complexities of today's society. By making academic \nlearning fun and relevant to real-life situations, the core values and \nskills learned by the students participating in this program prepare \nthem to participate in and provide leadership in American society.\n  Senators Hollings and Gregg have been, and continue to be, strong \nsupporters of efforts to enhance educational opportunities for the \nyouth of our country. The thousands of boys and girls who participate \nin this program join me in expressing our gratitude for the continued \nleadership of Senators Hollings and Gregg.\n  I am also thankful for the support of Senators Thurmond and Sessions \nwho joined me in working to continue funding for ``Learning for Life.''\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to address two important \ninternational trade issues raised in this bill: trade in conflict \ndiamonds and trade adjustment assistance.\n  I thank Senator Gregg and Senator Durbin for taking on the important \nissue of so-called ``conflict diamonds.'' As we have all seen reported \nin the press, the struggle for control of diamond mining areas in \nAfrica by various rebel groups have led to the commission of some \nterrible atrocities against unarmed civilians.\n  My colleagues Senator Gregg and Senator Durbin have both introduced \nbills aiming to stem the trade in conflict diamonds. I applaud them for \ntheir efforts.\n  The appropriations measure that we are considering today includes \nlanguage that would implement S. 1084, Senator Durbin's bill to halt \nU.S. imports of conflict diamonds. Some of the measures used in this \nlegislation to respond to the conflict diamond problem fall within the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee. Therefore, the preferred method \nfor considering this measure would be to hold a hearing and mark up the \nbill in the Finance Committee.\n  In this case, however, there is a certain urgency to taking action on \nthe issue of conflict diamonds in order to halt the atrocities that \ncontinue to take place in Africa and restore the confidence of the \ndiamond-buying public in the United States. In addition, Senator Gregg \nand Senator Durbin have worked closely with me and with each other to \nmake sure that the substance of this provision is acceptable to all \nconcerned.\n  Based on this close cooperation and the urgency of the issue, I have \ndecided not to raise a jurisdictional objection. I therefore support \nthe inclusion of S. 1084 in the bill before us.\n  I will now say a few brief words about Trade Adjustment Assistance. \nThe TAA program has been on the books since 1962 and has historically \nreceived wide bipartisan support. The purpose of the program is to help \nworkers and firms that experience layoffs due to import competition.\n  The portion of the Trade Adjustment Assistance program which assists \ntrade-impacted businesses operates out of the Department of Commerce \nand its budget is included in the Commerce, Justice, and State \nappropriations bill. This program helps small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses that are facing layoffs due to import competition to get \naccess to technical support and develop business plans that help them \nadjust to import competition, become more competitive, and maintain or \nincrease employment.\n  The TAA for firms program operates on a shoestring. Historically, the \nTAA for Firms program creates or preserves one job for every $861 \nspent. This is a bargain we cannot afford to pass up. In recognition of \nthis program's track record, in every recent year the Senate has \nattempted to increase funding for this program in the CJS \nappropriations bill. Last year the amount that passed the Senate was \nabout $24 million. Every year, the number gets reduced in conference. \nThis is very frustrating, but certainly not a reason to give up. This \nyear, however, much to my chagrin, the bill before us does not include \nany increase in funding for this program over the current level, so \nthere is no basis even to go to conference on this issue.\n  There is no doubt that the current funding level for the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance for Firms program is sorely inadequate. Every \nyear more firms are certified eligible than there is money to provide \neven the most modest technical assistance. The result is that many \nqualified and deserving firms do not get the technical support they \nneed to get back on their feet and keep jobs in their communities.\n  For example, right now in Montana ten companies have 25 approved but \nunfunded projects for a total shortfall of over $351,000. This includes \nseveral companies that have been forced to severely reduce operations \ndue to imports of dumped and subsidized softwood lumber from Canada. \nThe communities where these businesses are located often do not offer \nmany opportunities for alternate employment and it is important that we \nhelp companies and communities like these to get back on their feet.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to express my profound \ndisappointment that we in the Senate have not even made the attempt to \nprovide a more adequate funding level for this valuable program in FY \n2002, despite its extremely modest cost and proven benefits. I will \ncertainly work to see that this mistake is not repeated next year. I \nwill also work to see what solutions are available to this continuing \nproblem when we mark up a bill to reauthorize the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance program this year in the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I appreciate the good work the committee \nand the managers have done with respect to the fiscal year 2002 \nappropriations bill for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and \nState. However, there is one area in which the bill is deficient; \nnamely, embassy security.\n  The Department of State is requesting a total of $1.3 billion for \nworldwide security upgrade activities in fiscal year 2002, a 22 percent \nincrease over the fiscal year 2001 level of $1.07 billion. This funding \nis to be used to: maintain extensive security enhancements; address \nother domestic and overseas vulnerabilities; construct modern, secure \nfacilities; and correct perimeter security weaknesses.\n  Over the past 3 years, the Department has invested over $3 billion in \nextensive improvements in systems and facilities as well as security \nstaffing to protect U.S. diplomats, employees, and dependents around \nthe world. The $1.3 billion requested in the fiscal year 2002 budget \nincludes $363 million to maintain these programs at their current \nlevels. Examples include continued funding for approximately 6,000 \nguards and surveillance specialists; maintenance of 490 explosives \ndetection devices, 877 walk-through metal detectors, and 283 x-ray \nmachines; and maintenance of almost 1,000 armored vehicles.\n  The fiscal year 2002 budget request also includes $64 million to \nreinforce defenses against cyberterrorism, technical and human \nintelligence gathering efforts, and penetration of our domestic \nfacilities. Included in this effort is the addition of 186 positions, \n86 agents and 100 other security professionals, not only to support \nexpanded programs but to reduce the burden on current\n\n[[Page S9386]]\n\npersonnel and to ensure that sufficient agents are always available to \naddress any serious threat or emergency.\n  The budget request also includes a total of $665 million for seven \nsecurity-driven construction projects that will replace less secure \nembassies or consulates and U.S. AID facilities. The request also \nincludes $211 million to address significant vulnerabilities in systems \nand equipment that monitor perimeter areas and control access to U.S. \nfacilities. These funds will continue perimeter security improvements \nand extend the installation of protective measures to additional posts.\n  I am disappointed that the committee mark does not fully fund the \nDepartment's priority personnel increases for improved diplomatic \nreadiness and worldwide security upgrades. The Department's initial \nrequest had about $95 million to provide for the hiring of 360 new \nemployees to support Diplomatic Readiness requirements. However, the \ncommittee's mark only supports about 40 percent of this new hiring.\n  In order to have the right people in the right place at the right \ntime with the right skills to advance American interests, the \nDepartment has put forward an aggressive plan to bring in over a 3-year \nperiod some 1,100 new employees above attrition. Funding to hire the \nfull 360 employees is one of the Department of State's highest \npriorities and is supported by the authorization marks of both the \nHouse International Relations Committee and the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, as well as by the House appropriators on the \nCommerce-State-Justice bill.\n  Moreover, the hiring of 186 additional diplomatic security \nprofessionals, 86 diplomatic security agents, 9 security engineers, 10 \nsecurity technicians, and 81 civil service infrastructure support \nemployees, is critical to the Department's efforts to improve the \nsecurity of our overseas personnel, facilities and national security \ninformation.\n  Finally, the reductions to the Department's overseas construction \naccount, $219 million and applying $154 million in prior year \nconstruction balances to fiscal year 2002 requirements, will make it \nmore difficult to meet the very ambitious buildings program that the \nSecretary of State has planned.\n  I understand that the committee has maintained funding for embassy \nsecurity in the diplomatic and consular programs and embassy security, \nconstruction, and maintenance accounts at approximately last year's \nlevels. However, the failure by the committee to provide the \nadministration's requested increases for additional security personnel \nand construction could severely hamper the Department of State's \nmultiyear effort to improve security for American personnel serving in \nour embassies overseas. For example, within the funds that the \ncommittee provides for construction, funding is earmarked for projects \nnot on the list of the most urgent, security-driven projects for fiscal \nyear 2002, which will make it more difficult for the Department to meet \nits security-improvement goals.\n  I am also concerned that the funding allocated by the committee does \nnot appear to extend to the protection of U.S. AID employees, an \noversight that should be quickly addressed.\n  We cannot in good conscience leave the manifestations of the American \npresence abroad, namely, our embassies and consulates, inadequately \nprotected. The terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon were \npreceded, it should be remembered, by attacks on American embassies in \ntwo African countries just a few short years ago. U.S. embassy security \nabroad deserves the same degree of attention by authorizers and \nappropriators as homeland defense.\n  I would urge the managers of the bill to revisit this issue in the \nconference with their House counterparts and, at minimum, agree to the \nadministration's request with respect to the embassy security account. \nIndeed, in light of the recent acts of war perpetrated against the \nAmerican homeland, it would only be prudent, in my judgment, for the \nconferees to consider a major increase over the administration's \nrequest.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Hollings and \nSenator Gregg for working with other senators and me to accept an \namendment that will ensure that eligible beneficiaries may receive \ncompensation under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA).\n  Over a year ago, Senator Hatch and I worked together to update RECA \nto ensure it took into account the latest scientific evidence and to \nextend benefits to new groups of workers, including uranium mill \nworkers and ore transporters. In addition, we extended eligibility for \ncompensation beyond the group of five States identified in the original \nlaw, to additional States where uranium mining occurred, including \nSouth Dakota.\n  Due to the concerns about the amount of funding available for this \nprogram, language was included in both the fiscal year 2001 and fiscal \nyear 2002 Commerce, Justice and State Appropriations bill limiting the \npayment of compensation to the original RECA beneficiaries. While I \nshare concerns about the limited amount of funding available, I cannot \nsupport this approach to the problem. Those added to RECA in 2000 are \nnow legally entitled to compensation and should have their claims paid \nalong with original beneficiaries.\n  We simply must do a better job of funding RECA in the future. Last \nyear, many beneficiaries received IOUs from the Federal Government \nbecause inadequate funding was available to pay their claims. To ensure \nadequate funding over the long term, I already have cosponsored \nlegislation to make funding for RECA mandatory. I am committed to \nworking with my colleagues to secure the passage of this legislation in \nthe near future.\n  I appreciate the willingness of the chairman and ranking member to \naccept my amendment. I also want to thank Senators Bingaman, Domenici, \nHatch, and Reid for their support of this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I had intended to offer an amendment to \nthe Commerce, Justice, and State appropriation bill regarding the Title \nXI Loan Guarantee Program. However, in light of the events of the last \nseveral days, I believe the Senate needs to quickly move onto the \nconsideration of legislation that will aid our Government in addressing \nissues resulting from the devastating attacks on our Nation earlier \nthis week. Therefore, I am going to reserve the amendment for another \ntime.\n  I am very concerned that the Title XI Loan Guarantee Program is in \nfiscal peril due to recent loan defaults and ongoing construction \nproblems with other guaranteed projects that could soon lead to further \ndefaults that will cost the American taxpayers billions of dollars. I \nencourage all my colleagues to review the merits and cost of this and \nall programs which provide taxpayer-funded support to special \ninterests. We should carefully weigh the needs of those interests \nagainst the needs of our Nation as a whole. We are going to have to \nmake some very difficult budget choices in the weeks ahead and I hope \nthat we can come together to ensure those choices are in the best \ninterest of all Americans.\n\n\n                noaa laboratory in lafayette, louisiana\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. First, I'd like to thank Senator Hollings and Senator \nGregg for all of their help over the last four years in trying to \nestablish a strong NOAA presence in Lafayette, Louisiana. Their efforts \nare most appreciated by me and by the State of Louisiana.\n  Many of my colleagues may not realize that Congress appropriated \nclose to $14 million in the 1991 Commerce, Justice, State \nappropriations bill to build a much needed multi-agency, federal \nlaboratory in Lafayette for the study of coastal problems in the \nNorthern Gulf of Mexico. While the building was completed long ago, it \nis still eighty percent vacant because of a political disagreement. \nReport language was included in 1995 C,J,S appropriations report that \nNOAA says prevents it from ever occupying or using these state-of-the-\nart facilities. I have worked since 1998 to remove this restriction \nwith little success.\n  In the intervening years, the problems in the Gulf of Mexico \noriginally identified for study at this facility have grown \nprogressively worse and are having greater and greater negative impacts \non Louisiana and the nation. Our wetlands continue to disappear, many \nimportant marsh lands have mysteriously died, and the size of the so-\ncalled ``Dead Zone'' has grown to 8,000 square miles.\n\n[[Page S9387]]\n\n  With over 3 million acres, Louisiana is home to 40% of the coastal \nwetlands in the United States and is experiencing over 80% of the \nnation's wetlands loss. Our state is lowing 25-35 square miles of \ncoastal wetlands per year. The United States loses one acre of \nproductive coastal wetlands in Louisiana every 24 minutes. In the next \nten years, Louisiana will lose wetlands equal to the size of San Diego.\n  These wetlands play a critical role in our national and local \neconomy. As much as 28% of the nation's fisheries harvest comes from \nLouisiana's coast. These shrimp, crab, crawfish, oyster and finfish \nfisheries (over 1.1 billion pounds per year landed in Louisiana alone) \nare dependent on our coastal wetlands. Louisiana's fisheries alone are \ncomparable to the annual catch on the entire Atlantic seaboard.\n  Louisiana's coast also provides wintering habitat for over 5 million \nwaterfowl every year, nearly 20 percent of the entire winter population \nof ducks and geese in the United States. The extensive coastal oil and \ngas infrastructure that this nation relies so heavily on is also at \nrisk as it becomes increasingly exposed to greater storm energies \nwithout the protection of the marsh.\n  The national economic benefits of Louisiana's coast include:\n\n       $30 billion per year in petroleum products;\n       $7.4 billion per year in Natural Gas (21% of the nation's \n     supply);\n       $400 million tons per year of waterborne commerce;\n       $2.8 billion per year in commercial fishing;\n       $1.6 billion per year in recreational fishing;\n       $2.5 million per year in fur harvest (40% of the nation's \n     total; and\n       $40 million per year in alligator harvests.\n\n  In the years that we have been waging the political fight over the \nNOAA laboratory in Lafayette, my state has experienced a number of \nother devastating problems which have a major impact on these resources \nand desperately need to be fully studied. Last year we lost more than \n30 square miles of salt march grass in an unprecedented phenomenon that \ncould mean an advanced rate of loss for our coast in the years to come. \nThese threats to our coastline and our fisheries are compounded by the \nhorrific growth in the hypoxic zone, or Dead Zone, where extremely low \nlevels of oxygen suffocate shellfish and drive out all other forms of \nmarine life. Each summer, the Dead Zone increases in size and covers an \narea off of Louisiana's coast that is roughly the size of the State of \nNew Jersey. I'd like to submit for the record to following Times-\nPicayune story which shows that this oxygen-deprived zone continues to \ngrow.\n  While this issue has attracted attention and resources from the \nfederal government, there remains a serious shortage of research in the \nNorthern Gulf. The problems are astounding and solving them is critical \nto the economic and cultural future of the State of Louisiana and this \nnation. However, these problems are not fully understood and we will \nnot be able to effectively solve them until we do.\n  That is why I rise today to respectfully request that $1.5 million be \nadded in the FY 2002 C,J,S appropriations bill for planning and design \nof a new research facility in Lafayette, Louisiana to be occupied by \nNOAA for the study of coastal and fisheries problems in the Northern \nGulf of Mexico. Let me be clear, I would prefer for NOAA to occupy the \ncurrent facility. I want to thank Senators Hollings and Gregg again for \nhelping me to try to do this, but time is running out. Louisiana and \nthe nation can not wait yet another year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for the interest of all Senators, we are \nabout to have final passage on this bill. I congratulate our two \nmanagers. This has been quite an ordeal. I congratulate them on their \nsuccessful completion of the bill.\n  We have a number of nominees I want to be able to consider and, if \nnecessary, have votes on the nominations. During this vote, we are \ngoing to be consulting with certain Senators about whatever \nrequirements there may be on a couple of these nominations. If \nnecessary, I would like to have these votes tonight if they are going \nto be required, but we will be able to make that announcement shortly \nafter the vote, or perhaps during the vote, for those who are \ninterested.\n  The other outstanding piece of business I would like to be able to \ncomplete before the end of the week is, of course, the supplemental \nappropriations bill. If the House acts, we will then be in a position \nto act on this side. I do not know yet the status of that particular \npiece of legislation. That may require a vote tomorrow morning.\n  As I said in our joint caucus this afternoon, my hope is that we can \navoid having votes after the memorial service tomorrow afternoon. That \nis not only my hope, my expectation, with the caveat, of course, we \nhave been able to resolve these matters successfully.\n  I urge colleagues not to leave after this vote until we are \nabsolutely certain that no rollcall votes are going to be required on \nthe nominees that I would like to consider yet tonight. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

The clerk will report the amendment by number.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg), for Ms. \n     Collins, proposes an amendment numbered 1563.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1563) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide funding for the Rapid Response Program in \n                Washington and Hancock Counties, Maine)\n\n       On page 34, line 5, after ``Act'' insert ``, of which \n     $250,000 shall be for a grant to the Rapid Response Program \n     in Washington and Hancock Counties, Maine''.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee for \nthe tremendous effort he has done on this bill and for his very \ncourteous approach to the Republican membership as we brought this bill \nforward.\n  I thank his staff, led by Lila Helms, who did a superb job. I \nespecially thank my staff who worked hours, nights and days in many \ninstances, led by Jim Morhard, who has done an extraordinary job to \nbring this bill to its present status. It is an excellent bill.\n  I appreciate the support of the Senate. I thank the Members who \nsupported this bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Hampshire. We could not have passed this bill without his \nleadership and without his cooperation, and particularly without his \nvision with respect to terrorism. The Senator from New Hampshire was \nour chairman back in May. He held 3 days of hearings that got this \ncomprehensive provision in the particular State-Justice-Commerce \nappropriations measure.\n  Let me also thank his staff: Jim Morhard, Kevin Linskey, Katherine \nHennessey, and Nancy Perkins; and, of course, my own staff: Lila Helms, \nJill Shapiro Long, Dereck Orr, and Luke Nachbar.\n  I thank particularly the staff that really gets it done: Lula Davis, \nMarty Paione, Peter Arapis, Gary Myrick, and Tim Mitchell; the \ndistinguished majority leader; and, most of all, the distinguished \nassistant majority leader who has been working around the clock. He is \nstill working. I want him to hear my words of praise because Harry Reid \nof Nevada really got us moving and got these things accomplished. I \ncouldn't feel more personally indebted to him for his leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was at the White House today with the \nPresident discussing all aspects of this present crisis. In the course \nof the conversations, he specifically referred to the fact that America \nmust be understanding of those of Arab dissent, especially those who \nare American citizens, and indeed others who are here for various \nreasons. This terrible crisis should not reflect across the board on \nthat culture. For it, I think, will eventually be seen as a very small \nfraction. I commend the President for our meeting today.\n  I have for over 40 years had the privilege and the opportunity to be \nin the Oval Office. I started with President Eisenhower as a young \nperson in the White House. I have been in that office with every \nsuccessive President on a variety of matters. Our President, in the \nbrief meeting of about 20 minutes or so with the two Senators from New \nYork, my colleague, George Allen, myself, Condoleeza Rice, and Andrew \nCard, his chief, was absolutely calm. He was comfortable. He was \nknowledgeable. You got the feeling that he is a President who knew \nprecisely what was going on and what has to be done. He was resolute \nand spoke with clarity about how he will take certain steps to right \nthe criminal wrongs that have been done against our country in due \ncourse. He is going to do it on his own timetable--nobody will pressure \nhim--when he has the facts in hand to hold those accountable for these \ncrimes against our country.\n  I am very proud of our President. Indeed, he said that this is going \nto take time. It might not be one; it might be two; who knows how many \nactions we will have to take. But let there be no doubt that this \ncountry is resolute in its determination, and that our citizens will be \nproud of the manner in which men and women of the Armed Forces and all \nother portions of our Government will respond to this crisis and do \nwhatever we can to see that it doesn't happen again.\n\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/13/senate-section/article/S9388-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           A DAY OF EMOTIONS\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, as we wind up this \nextraordinary day, it has been a day of tremendous emotional swings. \nEarlier this morning, I came to this floor grief stricken having just \ntalked to a family from Florida who had lost one of their members. \nLater on in the day, I talked to a police officer, now a widower of the \nflight attendant on the airliner that crashed in Pennsylvania who \ncalled her husband telling him that it had been hijacked and that she \nwanted to tell him that she loved him and she wanted their boys to know \nthat she loved them. That is the flight that we have heard so many \nreports was targeted coming into Washington. It had made a 180-degree \nturn, having left Newark, westbound, and was headed to Washington. In \nfact, we have heard so many stories of other cellular telephone calls \nfrom the airplane that would indicate that the passengers, who were the \nreal heroes, had indicated they knew that the hijackers were intent on \nharm to the Nation, and they were going to overcome the hijackers. In \nfact, they did--at their own peril, at their own demise, but being \ntremendous heroes to this country.\n\n  So it has been that kind of day. We have gone from the swings of the \nemotion of the lows, with those kinds of grief-stricken experiences, to \nthe highs of where we have never seen this place so unified. We have \nnever seen both sides of the aisle come together as they have in recent \nAmerican political history. We have never seen the unity of the \nlegislative branch of Government and the executive branch.\n  So it has been an extraordinary day. It has been an extraordinary 3 \ndays. I am just grateful to be one participant, along with my colleague \nfrom Minnesota, who is the Presiding Officer.\n  I will defer to the great leader we have from the State of Nevada, a \nman who is the glue that pulls us all together, who gives the support \nthat is the right hand to our great majority leader. It is my privilege \nto relinquish the floor so he might speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID.

I didn't \nknow that myself when I saw those planes flying. I can tell you, they \nmade an awful lot of us feel much more secure when we saw F-16 fighter \nplanes in the air protecting Washington, DC. So imagine my surprise and \nmy pride when I learned that those were North Dakota National Guard \nfighter planes.\n  This is the group we affectionately call in North Dakota the Happy \nHooligans. The Happy Hooligans are America's best. The Happy Hooligans \nhave been called the best fighter unit on the planet Earth. They have \nbeen called that because the Happy Hooligans have been recognized in \ncompetition after competition as America's best. Not only have they won \nthe competitions--the William Tell award, for example--as the best \nactive fighting unit in the United States, but they have not only been \nin competition with other National Guard units but the regular Air \nForce. The Happy Hooligans come out No. 1.\n  So not only are we incredibly proud in North Dakota that a key part \nof this\n\n[[Page S9389]]\n\nNation's defense at this time of tragedy and attack was from North \nDakota but that we sent our very best and that our very best are \nAmerica's very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/13/senate-section/article/S9389-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    GROWING PROBLEM OF PIRACY AT SEA\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the \ngrowing problem of piracy at sea. The days of Blackbeard and Captain \nKidd may be gone, but pirates are still with us.\n  In February 2001 the International Maritime Bureau, IMB, of the \nInternational Chamber of Commerce reported that piracy attacks jumped \n57 percent from 1999 to 2000. The IMB reported a total of 469 attacks \non ships either at sea, at anchor, or in port. Today's pirates prowl \nthe sea in speedboats, armed with automatic weapons, satellite phones, \nand global positioning devices. They are often backed by organized \ncrime syndicates, making use of forged registration documents and bills \nof lading to offload hijacked cargo. Rarely are hijacked ships \nrecovered or pirates arrested.\n  We should be concerned with this because U.S. trade and national \nsecurity depend upon maritime transportation. Ninety percent of the \nworld's cargo is carried over the seas. In addition to its role in \nforeign commerce, our Nation's merchant shipping fleet provides vital \nnational security sealift in the event of war or other crisis. Crews \nand cargo are coming under increasing attack from pirates. Through \nviolence or the threat of force, pirates are boarding vessels and \nlooting cargo. Last year, there were 72 reported deaths of mariners and \n99 injuries due to pirate attacks.\n  Maritime crime, in general, can take many forms including low-level \nassaults, thefts, armed robbery, organized hijacking, environmental \ncrimes, and smuggling of humans or contraband. Criminals use violence \nor the threat of violence to target seafarers, cargo, and ships. \nAttacks may occur while at dock, in territorial waters, or on the high \nseas. Piracy can result in immediate loss of life and property and may \npresent a threat to navigational safety.\n  Under international law, piracy is defined as theft or other illegal \nacts of violence committed on the high seas for private gain by the \ncrew of a private ship against another ship, or the persons or property \non board. The phrase ``on the high seas'' is a legal term of art. It is \nany area not within the territorial sea, or sovereignty, of another \nstate. Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a \nstate's territorial sea extends 12 nautical miles from its coastline. \nPiracy on the high seas is considered a crime against all nations. \nAccordingly, under international law every state has the right to seize \npirate ships on the high seas and arrest pirates who are subject to the \njurisdiction of the courts of the state which carried out the arrest.\n  The true scope of the piracy problem, however, is not known. Despite \nnumerous press reports, current sea piracy statistics are incomplete. \nThere is no consensus among reporting organizations on what constitutes \na reportable piracy attack. Although the definition under international \nlaw requires that the attack occur on the high seas, some organizations \ninclude attacks at port. In addition, it appears that instances of \npiracy among noncommercial vessels such as yachts and regional \nfishermen may be significantly underreported.\n  Although the risk of attack on U.S. flag ships is not significant, \npiracy is a problem for our trading partners in Asia. The nations of \nthis region account for more than $435 billion in trade with the U.S., \nmore than any other region in the world. Approximately 98 percent of \nthis commerce moves by sea. The Malacca Straits, separating the Malay \nPeninsula with the island of Sumata, is one of the most important \nshipping lanes in the world. Surrounded by the nations of Indonesia, \nMalaysia, and Singapore, it is the shortest route between the Indian \nOcean and the South China Sea. Asian allies, dependent on oil imports \nfrom the Arabian Gulf, rely upon ships passing safely through the \nstraits. It also happens to be a pirate hot spot.\n\n  The piracy problem in Southeast Asia has resulted in several regional \nresponses. In July 2000 Indonesia set up a special court to try piracy \ncases. In November 2000 the Japanese sent a coast guard vessel to India \nand Malaysia to participate in joint exercises. In January 2001 \nMalaysia launched an operation to reduce piracy in the Malacca Straits \nin cooperation with Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. In June 2001 \nthe Japanese Coast Guard announced that it is planning to send patrol \nboats to the region periodically to participate in joint training \nexercises.\n  The U.S. has also responded to this issue through the U.S. Coast \nGuard, USCG. The Coast Guard's Deepwater Program is responsible for \nconducting operations 50 miles or more out to sea. The Coast Guard is \nleveraging its maritime law enforcement expertise by providing training \nto foreign maritime law enforcement agencies to combat sea piracy. For \nexample, in June 2001 the USCG led a cooperation afloat readiness and \ntraining, CARAT, exercise on maritime law enforcement techniques with \nthe Royal Thai Navy. CARAT is an annual series of bilateral exercises \nbetween the American military and that of several Asian nations \nincluding Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and Brunei. \nAlthough well-suited for this mission the Coast Guard is currently ill-\nequipped. It is in the process of modernizing its aging fleet to carry \nout more deepwater missions. The current plan calls for the replacement \nof approximately 100 cutters and more than 200 aircraft in the \nDeepwater Program.\n  The rise in the number and seriousness of pirate attacks has drawn \nthe attention of the United Nations' International Maritime \nOrganization, IMO. The IMO encourages cooperation among governments in \nthe area of regulations and standards concerning maritime safety. Since \n1998, the IMO has sponsored a series of seminars around the world to \nstudy the piracy problem and heighten awareness. At a June 2001 meeting \nthe IMO renewed its call for all governments and industry to intensify \ntheir efforts to eradicate sea piracy and encouraged regional \nagreements supported by appropriate national piracy laws and adequate \nenforcement and prosecutorial capabilities. The IMO also approved a \ndraft resolution for submission to the U.N. General Assembly session in \nNovember 2001.\n  As the Bush administration reviews its policy on the issue of sea \npiracy, I strongly encourage consideration of the following points: (1) \nWe need better statistics on pirate attacks to assess the national \nsecurity risks. More detailed reporting and analysis is needed to \ndetermine the appropriate response to this problem. (2) The U.S. should \ncommend those nations in the region that are attempting to police the \nwaters within their jurisdiction and reduce the number of pirate \nattacks. (3) The U.S. should encourage further regional cooperation, \nsuch as the recent agreement between Japan and Southeast Asian nations \nregarding joint training exercises. (4) Finally, the U.S. should \ncontinue to support the actions of the United Nations in addressing the \nissue of sea piracy. This would include determining the scope of the \nproblem, whether regional actions are adequate, whether further \nlegislation is needed in some countries, and how the U.N. can be of \nassistance in drafting these new laws and encouraging more effective \nenforcement capabilities.\n  Modern-day piracy must be stopped, and the United States can and \nshould be an active partner in the fight against pirate attacks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/13/senate-section/article/S9389-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9389-S9390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred August 26, \n2001, in Portland, OR. Lorenzo Okaruru, according to detectives, died \nafter being savagely beaten about the head and face with a blunt \ninstrument, most likely by a man who picked up someone he thought was a \nwoman and was angered to find out Okarura was a man. Law enforcement \nofficials have said they believe Okaruru was killed based on sexual \norientation or gender identity. The Washington County Sheriff's Office \nlast week classified\n\n[[Page S9390]]\n\nOkaruru's August 26 beating as a hate crime, the first such killing in \nthe county.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/13/senate-section/article/S9390-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMENDING THE SERVICE OF NANCY T.

After having graduated from the United States Naval \nAcademy, Nancy began her service to the country as a Naval Officer and \naviator flying the C-130 aircraft. Among the positions she held during \nher military career, she served as a pilot instructor for the E-6A \naircraft and flew worldwide logistic support missions for the \nDepartment of Defense, including those in support of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff in and around the Pacific Theater. Later, Nancy served as a \nCongressional Liaison Officer and a Department of Defense Legislative \nDetailee in the offices of Senator Susan Collins and former Virginia \nCongressman Norman Sisisky.\n  After a time in the private sector, Nancy returned to public service \nas a member of my staff. She has been a tremendous asset to me as she \nbrought her integrity and professionalism to every task she undertook. \nAll of the members of my staff join me in wishing her every success in \nthe next chapter of her career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/13/senate-section/article/S9390-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n TRIBUTE TO ALBUQUERQUE COOPERATIVE STUDIES PROGRAM CLINICAL RESEARCH \n                  PHARMACY COORDINATING COUNCIL CENTER\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

The \nCarey Award honors VA offices that demonstrate organizational \neffectiveness and high-quality service to our Nation's veterans. The \naward encourages efficient management by prominently honoring the VA's \nhighest performing offices.\n  The Albuquerque Pharmacy Coordinating Council Center truly deserves \nthis great honor. The center was founded in 1972 as a part of VA's \nCooperative Services Program. This program is responsible for planning \nand conducting the large multicenter clinical trials within VA, and the \nAlbuquerque center manages all of the pharmaceutical aspects of these \ntrials. The center plays a critical role in planning VA's clinical \ntrials, packaging clinical trial materials, and monitoring the \nimplementation of clinical trials. These trials have benefitted not \nonly our Nation's veterans, but have improved the health of our entire \nNation, by contributing to the rapidly increasing body of medical \nknowledge.\n  The center has a staff of over 60 highly trained and experienced \npharmacy and management professionals and technicians. Through the \nefforts of these outstanding employees and under the excellent \nleadership of Director Dr. Mike Sather, the center has developed a \nsolid reputation within the medical research community. In fact, the \ncenter has contributed to ground-breaking medical research in \ndeveloping treatments for a wide range of diseases from cancer to heart \ndisease to mental illness. The center has also demonstrated its \nproficiency in its successful collaborations with such institutions as \nthe National Institutes of Health, specifically the National Heart, \nLung and Blood Institute and the National Institute of Mental Health, \nas well as the centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  The recognition of the Albuquerque center by the VA should come as no \nsurprise to anyone familiar with its history. In fact, the center has \npreviously been recognized for its achievements by Quality New Mexico \nand has received both the Roadrunner Recognition and the Pinon Award. I \ncongratulate the exceptional leadership and the devoted staff of the \nAlbuquerque Pharmacy Coordinating Council Center on this fine \nachievement, and I look forward to their future accomplishments in \nimproving the health of our Nation and demonstrating our continued \ncommitment to our Nation's veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/13/senate-section/article/S9390-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:35 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S.J.

A bill to direct the Federal Aviation Administration to re-\nimplement the sky marshal program within 30 days; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, the bill I am introducing today, and \nfor which I will soon have cosponsors because I want everyone to have \nthe opportunity to join me in this effort, will address one part of our \naviation security issue. It is not the only one that I will look for us \nto address in the long term.\n  I do want the flying public to know that we have a safe and secure \naviation system. However, last Tuesday, the terrorists who perpetrated \nthis heinous crime found a vulnerability in that system. There are \nseveral things we will be able to do to correct this situation.\n  I was Vice Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. I \nhave been dealing with aviation security for a long time. Today I am \nthe ranking member of the Aviation Subcommittee of the Commerce \nCommittee. This is my area of interest.\n  The bill I am introducing today would order the FAA to implement and \naugment within 30 days a sky marshal program that would allow for peace \nofficers to be put in random airplane flights for domestic commercial \nair passenger flights and for international flights that would be \ncoming into or out of America on U.S.-based airlines.\n  What I am trying to do is provide an extra measure of security which \ntoday is the responsibility of pilots. Many people may not realize it, \nbut it is the pilot and the copilot who are responsible for dealing \nwith unruly passengers, or with any kind of security threat to the \npeople on an airplane.\n  We can no longer afford to allow pilots to have the dual \nresponsibility of keeping the plane safe in the air and at the same \ntime be responsible for handling disruptions in the cabin.\n  The FAA, which has a very limited program, can train people on how to \nhandle a breach of the peace in an airplane. It is a unique kind of \ntraining. It is not like military training certainly. It is not like a \nU.S. marshal on the ground. It is a different set of circumstances. An \nair marshal must be able to disarm a threat to the aircraft while \noperating in the confined space of the cabin.\n  No longer can any passenger carry on even the smallest knife. The FAA \nhas issued a ruling that not even a penknife will be allowed on an \nairplane by a passenger or in any kind of carry-on baggage. Our \npassengers will be disarmed. We want to make sure they are protected in \nsome way.\n  I am introducing this legislation, which will be a temporary program \nfor 1 year. Then the FAA will report to Congress to determine if they \nbelieve it has been successful, if it should be continued, or if it is \nno longer necessary.\n  I am allowing the FAA Administrator to assess up to $1 per passenger \nticket for every segment of the flight. I talked to the FAA \nAdministrator this morning. I told her that I wanted her to have the \ndiscretion to implement this program to deal with the security threats \nfacing our passenger aviation system. I do not expect her to charge the \nfull $1 if she does not feel that it is necessary. I do not expect her \nto do it for every leg of the flight if she does not think it is \nnecessary. I do think we need to act quickly and there needs to be a \nresource.\n  I can't imagine any airline passenger who would object to the payment \nof $1 for this kind of onboard security. This would be required to be \nput in place within the next 30 days.\n  We need swift action to assure the flying public that we will do \neverything possible to make them secure in the air. The Administrator, \nJane Garvey, told me this morning that she has already talked to the \nairlines about the possibility of sky marshals. My bill requires the \nairlines to provide a seat for the sky marshal regardless of \navailability. She said the airlines have already said that this is fine \nwith them.\n\n  I am very hopeful that we will be able to enact this common-sense \nmeasure on an expedited basis. I want the people of our country to know \nthat we are not going to leave any stone unturned to protect the \npublic.\n  Having said that, I also want to say that this is not the end. This \nis a beginning. It is only one part of what I believe Congress and the \nPresident need to accomplish, working together to assure the safety of \nthe people of our country. Clearly, this hijacking operation that was \nso well orchestrated is one facet of domestic terrorism. It highlighted \na weakness in our aviation security, and we are going to clamp down in \nevery way to assure the security of our flying public and the security \nof anyone in America who would be attacked by a weapon of mass \ndestruction which, in this case, was an airplane.\n  They found a vulnerability and they exploited it. We must assure that \nwe have addressed every such vulnerability for our citizens, not only \nfor the aviation security of our country, but we need to look at the \npublic works in our country, the water systems, the tunnel systems we \nhave for highways and trains and for mass transit, for our subway \nsystems. We need to be ever vigilant over the public works of our \ncountry.\n  Secondly, we need to establish a missile defense system for our \ncountry. We must not let any terrorist in the world believe that now we \nhave addressed the issues of domestic terrorism within our own public \nworks systems or our infrastructure but we would be vulnerable to an \nincoming ballistic missile. This should be part of our domestic \nterrorism effort.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to take this first step. I hope it is \none of many. I know my colleagues will work with me, with the \nPresident, all of us working together, Democrats and Republicans, to \ntake the extra steps that our people expect us to take to make sure \neveryone in the world knows that we are committed to freedom and nobody \nis going to dash the spirit of America.\n  Madam President, these tragedies have stunned the nation. Moreover, \nthey revealed that our passenger air system was vulnerable to this \ncowardly attack. Preliminary reports indicate that the hijackers were \narmed with nothing more than knives. Horrifically, these simple weapons \nwere apparently used to murder members of the flight crew as they \nbravely attempted to alert the FAA, and even change the course of at \nleast one of the doomed flights, taking it away from population centers \nand our priceless national symbols.\n  From these early reports, it is clear that the men and women who \nstruggled to provide this information performed heroic feats while \ncertainly knowing that they would not survive. We stand in awe of their \ndeeds, but we lament that it was necessary. I also want to commend the \nFederal Aviation Administration for somehow managing to quickly ground \nthousands of airborne flights to remove any further threats to our \nNation. Now, our attention must turn to finding those responsible for \nthis act of war and making sure that we do everything in our power to \nprevent such a tragedy from occurring again. Airline passengers should \nnot be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to avert an \neven greater tragedy.\n  Since the hijacking of TWA flight 847 in June 1985, the FAA has been \nauthorized to train and deploy sky marshals. There is already in place \na training facility in Atlantic City, New Jersey. However, the FAA has \nnever revealed the number or identity of the marshals, the details of \ntheir training, nor\n\n[[Page S9397]]\n\nthe routes that they fly. We appreciate the need for secrecy in this \nprogram, but clearly, the sky marshal deployment needs to be \nsubstantially expanded.\n  Toward that end, I am introducing the Emergency Aviation Security Act \nof 2001. The bill will require an increased random deployment of sky \nmarshals on both domestic and international flights. These peace \nofficers will be hired and trained under guidelines set by the FAA, \nbut, at a minimum, they will undergo thorough background checks and be \ntrained to deal with situations such as the ones onboard the four \nhijacked aircraft.\n  The program may, at the FAA's discretion, be paid for with a ticket \nfee of not more than one dollar on every domestic segment. The program \nwill be instituted on a temporary basis for one year, after which the \nFAA will report to Congress on the success of the program and make \nrecommendations as to whether it should continue and if it should be \nchanged.\n  Last year, more than 600 million people flew through U.S. airports. \nIf we only charge the fee on domestic flights, one dollar would \ngenerate between $400-$500 million in one year. That is enough to hire, \ntrain, supervise and deploy thousands of sky marshals.\n  The American public needs to have the kind of security that an \nonboard peace officer would provide. Under current procedures, the \npilot and copilot are charged with the responsibility of dealing with \nunruly passengers, as well as more serious threats. I believe that the \npilots should fly the plane. Period. A sky marshal would relieve the \npilot and copilot of this additional responsibility.\n  The FAA should have the flexibility to determine training \nrequirements and qualifications. However, these guidelines must be \nprepared within 30 days of enactment of the legislation. This tight \ntime frame is necessary to protect the public.

A bill to establish hospice demonstration projects and a \nhospice grant program for beneficiaries under the medicare program \nunder title XVIII of the Social Security Act, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Medicare Hospice \nImprovement Program Act, which is supported by the National Hospice and \nPalliative Care Organization. The purpose of this bill is to provide \nfor at least three demonstration projects within Medicare to improve \nthe delivery of the hospice benefit to seniors. This legislation would \nallow us to find new ways to: (1) Allow people to enroll in hospice \neven though they may want to continue trying curative treatment for a \nlimited time; (2) modify the requirements to decrease the strain on \nrural hospice providers; and (3) revise reimbursement rates to more \nadequately cover comfort care. In addition this bill would provide a \ngrant program to help defray the costs of providing education of the \npublic, the medical community and patients about hospice care.\n  The Medicare hospice benefit has not been revised since it was first \ncreated nearly two decades ago. Too often patients and their families \nare unaware of the Medicare hospice benefit or they seek hospice care \ntoo late to get the full benefit of hospice services. This legislation \nis important because it would help us find ways to assure that the \nMedicare hospice benefit is better integrated into medical care, as \nwell as improve patient access to the pain and symptom management, \ncounseling, and other comfort care services provided by hospice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/13/senate-section/article/S9397-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9397-S9398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1551.

Mr. President, in this time of tragedy, there are a few \nthings Congress can do to provide immediate assistance. Passage of this \nlegislation is one of them.\n  This bill restores the `S' visa, which Congress created as part of \nthe 1994 Violent Crime Control Act. The visa allows foreign nationals \nwith critical information about criminal cases, especially events of \nterrorism, to remain in the United States legally for the purpose of \ncooperating with law enforcement. An application for the visa must be \nmade by a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency or by a \ncourt.\n  The provision authorizing the `S' visa expired yesterday, so without \nthis legislation law enforcement will be unable to take advantage of \nit. The State and Justice Departments have requested that we \nreinstitute the `S' visa. I urge the Senate to grant this request and \nto give law enforcement the support it needs in this area.\n  This is a limited program, but it serves an important purpose. The \nnumber of `S' visas granted in a year is limited to 200 for those \nproviding information about crimes and an additional 50 specifically \ndevoted to those who can provide information about terrorism.\n  Our law enforcement officials face a terrible responsibility in \nseeking out the perpetrators of these evil acts. I am pleased to \ncosponsor this legislation, and hope that it helps in this search.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, today I rise to urge passage of S. 856, the \nSmall Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program Reauthorization Act \nof 2001. This legislation reauthorizes the Small Business \nAdministration's highly successful Small Business Technology Transfer \n(STTR) Program for an additional eight years. Absent legislative action \nto reauthorize the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, \nit will expire on September 30, 2001.\n  On July 19, 2001, the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship (Committee) considered S. 856, the Small Business \nTechnology Transfer (STTR) Program Reauthorization Act of 2001, \nunanimously reported the bill and recommended its passage. This \nlegislation also makes changes to the STTR program to facilitate more \neffective collaboration between small businesses and research \ninstitutions.\n  The STTR program funds research and development (R) projects \nperformed jointly by small companies and research institutions as an \nincentive to advance the nation's technological progress and the \ngovernment's research and development goals. It complements the Small \nBusiness Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which was reauthorized \nlast year. Whereas the SBIR program funds R projects at small \ncompanies, STTR funds cooperative R projects between a small company \nand a research institution, such as a university or a Federally funded \nR lab. Like SBIR R projects, STTR projects help participating \nagencies achieve their missions in the research and development arena. \nIt was also designed to convert the billions of dollars invested in \nresearch and development at our nation's universities. Federal \nlaboratories and non-profit research institutions into new commercial \ntechnologies.\n  The STTR program was started as a pilot in 1992, and the first grants \nwere made in 1994. The program was reauthorized in 1997 for four years. \nThe program is not funded out of the Small Business Administration's \n(SBA) budget, but out of the extramural R budgets of Federal agencies \nor departments with extramural R budgets of $1 billion or more. Such \nagencies must award at least .15 percent of that money for STTR \nprojects. Five agencies currently qualify: the Department of Defense \n(DoD); the National Institutes of Health (NIH); the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); the National Science \nFoundation (NSF); and the Department of Energy (DoE).\n  There are three phases of the program. Phase I is a one-year grant \nfor $100,000, and its purpose is to determine the scientific and \ncommercial merits of an idea. Phase II is a two-year grant for \n$500,000, and its purpose is to further develop the idea. Phase III is \nused to pursue commercial applications of the idea and cannot be funded \nwith STTR funds. Only private-sector and non-STTR Federal funds may be \nused in Phase III.\n  At the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship hearing on S. \n856 we heard from Dr. Anthony N. Pirri, Director of the Division of \nTechnology Transfer at Northeastern University in Boston, Mass.; Mr. \nClifford C. Hoyt, Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of \nCambridge Research and Instrumentation in Woburn, Mass.; Dr. Barna \nSzabo, Founder and Chairman of Engineering Software Research and \nDevelopment Inc. in St. Louis, Mo.; Mr. Kirk Ririe, President and CEO \nof Idaho Technology, Inc. in Salt Lake City, Utah; Mr. Maurice Swinton, \nAssistant Administrator for the Office of Technology at the Small \nBusiness Administration; and Mr. Jim Wells, Director of Natural \nResources and Environment at the General Accounting Office.\n\n  There was consensus that the program is meeting its objectives, \nshould be continued, and the Phase II award amount should be increased. \nExamples were given of technological advances which improved \nindustries, grew businesses, created jobs and more than returned the \nFederal government's investment. One comment, in particular, from Mr. \nKirk Ririe of Idaho Technology Inc., which started modestly in a potato \nshed and now has locations in Idaho and Utah, demonstrates the power of \nthe STTR program:\n\n       We were a tiny company--six people working with the \n     university group. We were able to, within two years, launch \n     (with about $100,000 in funding) a product that basically \n     filled a hole in biotechnology research and development . . . \n     that has gone on to generate over $100 million in sales . . . \n     The GAO figures may not [reflect this, but] I guarantee that \n     we have paid a lot more money back to the government in taxes \n     than we received in any of the funding . . . The program has \n     been absolutely crucial to us. If we had not had this \n     program, we would still be in the potato shed . . .\n\n  At the request of the Chairman and Ranking member of the Committee, \nGAO surveyed all companies which had received Phase II awards from 1995 \nto 1997. GAO chose these years because they were the first years of the \nprogram and it generally takes three to nine years for a company to \nprogress from basic research of a concept to commercialization of a \ndeveloped product. Though this program is still relatively young, the \nsurvey results indicate it is working effectively. Of the 102 companies \nparticipating in the survey, 53.5 percent had either commercialized the \ntechnology or received follow-on funding for the technology.\n\n[[Page S9408]]\n\nThese companies had approximately $132 million in sales and $53 million \nin additional funding. These STTR winners expect additional sales of \nmore than $90 million dollars by 2005. Putting this into perspective, \nthe Government's total awards to these companies were less than $60 \nmillion, less than half of the sales to date and about five percent of \nthe expected sales by 2005.\n  While S. 856 as reported reauthorized the program for nine years, the \nManager's amendment reduces this to eight years. This was done in order \nto reach consensus promptly and enable the bill to pass both houses--\nbefore the expiration date of the program.\n  In FY2004 and thereafter the bill increases from .15 to .3 percent of \nFederal extramural research and development funds going to this \nprogram. Recently the program was made $65 million annually for STTR \nawards. Based on that amount, increasing the percentage to .3 percent \nwould make $130 million available annually for small business \ntechnology transfer. The Committee originally reported language that \nwould have increased the percentage to .5 percent in 2007. In order to \nreach consensus, we agreed to delete the final incremental increase \nfrom the bill until we have more experience and information.\n\n  The bill also raises the Phase II grant award amount from $500,000 to \n$750,000. This change was intended to address concerns by the small \nbusinesses and the research institutions that $500,000 typically is no \nlonger enough for this stage of research and development. As Dr. Pirri \nof Northeastern said at the hearing, ``By expanding the STTR program, \nfunding levels will become more adequate to take technologies through \nthe prototype stage and increase their probability of commercial \nsuccess.'' Raising Phase II STTR awards to $750,000 makes them \nconsistent with the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program's \nPhase II awards.\n  GAO reported that only about 250 universities have participated in \nthe program so far. The Committee believes, and GAO concurs, that there \nis tremendous potential to involve more universities in partnering with \nsmall businesses to convert research into new technologies. One of the \ngoals of the STTR program is to create economic development around \nuniversities, Federal laboratories and non-profit research institutions \nacross the country are attempting to duplicate the successful clusters \nsimilarly developed along Massachusetts' Route 128 and in California's \nSilicon Valley. In order to increase participation by a larger number \nof universities, S. 856 includes a provision encouraging the STTR \nagencies to reach out to universities to raise awareness of the program \nand to provide information to their faculty members.\n  S. 856 also strengthens the data rights protection for companies and \nresearch institutions that conduct STTR projects. The change in data \nrights is important because it clarifies that STTR companies, like SBIR \ncompanies, retain the data rights to their technology through all \nphases of a STTR project. Unfortunately some agencies have been \ninterpreting the law to mean that STTR companies only retain their data \nrights through Phases I and II.\n  This clarification helps protect STTR companies from losing control \nof their research so that they have a greater chance of commercializing \ntheir technology themselves. This clarification is important because \nthe Committee has learned some agencies are providing the data to \nbigger contractors for development, thereby cutting out the small \nbusiness. This unfortunate situation not only robs small businesses of \nrevenues, but it also results in expensive legal costs for small \nbusinesses to protect their data rights.\n  As last year's legislation did for the SBIR program, this bill \nstrengthens the data collection requirements regarding awards and the \ndata rights for companies and research institutions that conduct STTR \nprojects. The goal is to collect better information about the companies \ndoing the projects, as well as the research and development, so we can \nmeasure success and track technologies. The Manager's amendment expands \nthe reporting requirements to include reporting on HUBZones small \nbusinesses under the SBIR and STTR programs. The amendment also \nrequires the SBA and the agencies to develop a model agreement for \nintellectual property rights. Finally, the Manager's amendment includes \na provision that requires SBA, when considering proposals under the \nrecently enacted Federal and State Technology Partnership Program \n(FAST), to consider whether the proposals address the needs of small \nbusiness concerns: (I) owned and controlled by women; (II) owned and \ncontrolled by minorities; and (III) concerns located in areas that have \nhistorically not participated in the SBIR and STTR Programs.\n  This bill will ensure that this successful program is continued and \nexpanded. It will also provide Congress with important information and \ndata on the program and encourage more outreach to small businesses and \nresearch institutions.\n  Mr. President, I want to encourage my colleagues to learn about this \nprogram, to find out the benefits to their state's hi-tech small \nbusiness, research universities and labs, and to join me in passing \nthis legislation in the Senate. To my friend from Missouri, Senator \nBond, I want to thank you and your staff for working with me and my \nstaff to build this country's technological progress. I especially want \nto thank one member of Senator Bond's staff, David Bohley. Dave has \nworked tirelessly and effectively for the technology and small business \ncommunity. He is leaving the Committee, and we will all miss working \nwith him. I wish him well in his new job at the Federal National \nMortgage Association (FNMA). I also want to thank all of the members of \nthe Committee for their work on this legislation and for helping small \nbusiness. All 19 members of the Committee voted for and supported this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to pass S. 856, as amended.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to lend my strong support to S. 856, \nthe Small Business Technology Transfer Program Reauthorization Act of \n2001. The Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship has closely \nreviewed the STTR program this year and found the STTR program to be \nhighly successful. This important bill acknowledges that success by \nexpanding the program.\n  This bill, like most bills considered by the Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee, was crafted in a bipartisan manner and \napproved by a unanimous vote. I would like to thank Senator Kerry, and \nchairman of the committee, for his leadership and cooperation in this \neffort. I am pleased to have worked closely with him on this bill, and \nI trust our colleagues will overwhelmingly support this legislation.\n  The STTR Program was created in 1992 to stimulate technology transfer \nfrom research institutions to small firms while, at the same time, \naccomplishing the Federal government's research and development goals. \nThe program is designed to convert the billions of dollars invested in \nresearch and development at our nation's universities, federal \nlaboratories and nonprofit research institutions into new commercial \ntechnologies. It does this by joining the ideas and resources of \nresearch institutions with the commercialization experience of small \ncompanies.\n  To receive an award under the STTR Program, a research institution \nand a small firm jointly submit a proposal to conduct research on a \ntopic that reflects an agency's mission and research and development \nneeds. The proposals are then peer-reviewed and judged on their \nscientific, technical and commercial merit.\n  Numerous benefits result from the Federal government fostering \ncollaborations between research institutions and small firms. Small \nfirms have shown themselves to be excellent at commercializing research \nwhen they are provided the opportunity to take advantage of the \nexpertise and resources that reside in our nation's universities. A \nrecent report by the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy \nreviewed the rate of return for research and development by large and \nsmall firms both with and without university partners. When these firms \ndo not have university partners, their rate of return is 14 percent. \nWhen a collaboration is formed between universities and small firms, \nhowever, the rate of return jumps to 44 percent. By contrast, the rate \nof return only increases\n\n[[Page S9409]]\n\nto 30 percent when large firms and universities collaborate.\n  Moreover, partnerships between small firms and universities have led \nto world-class high-technology economic development. Numerous studies \ncite the emergence of Silicon Valley and the Route 128 corridor in \nMassachusetts as directly resulting from the partnerships and \ntechnology transfer that occurred, and are still occurring, among small \nfirms, Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology. The cooperation between industry and these universities has \nstrengthened considerably our economic competitiveness in the world. \nThe STTR Program seeks to foster this same type of economic development \nin the hundreds of communities around the country that contain \nuniversities and federal laboratories. Further, the STTR Program has \nproven to be immensely successful at growing small firms from these \ntypes of partnerships.\n  In a Committee hearing this year on the STTR Program, the General \nAccounting Office (GAO) reported on the commercial success of small \nfirms participating in the STTR program between 1995 and 1997. The \nGAO's findings are truly remarkable. Of the 102 projects surveyed in \nthat time-frame, over 53 percent had either resulted in sales or \nfollow-on developmental funding for the technology. Through 2000, these \nprojects had resulted in $132 million from sales and $53 million in \nadditional developmental funding. Moreover, the GAO reported that the \ncompanies that received the STTR awards are projecting an additional \n$186 million in sales in 2001 and an estimated additional $900 million \nin sales by 2005. These numbers are even more outstanding since it \ntypically takes between 7 to 10 years to commercialize new technologies \nsuccessfully.\n  In addition to proving to be an amazing commercial success, the STTR \nProgram has also provided high-quality research to the Federal \ngovernment. The GAO has reported in the past that Federal agencies give \nhigh ratings to the technical quality of STTR research proposals. The \nDepartment of Energy, for example, rated the quality of the proposed \nresearch in the top ten percent of all research funded by the \nDepartment.\n  A good example of the benefits that the STTR Program provides to \nsmall firms and universities is the experience of Engineering Software \nResearch and Development, Inc. in St. Louis, Missouri. The chairman and \nfounder of that company, Dr. Barna Szabo, testified on the STTR program \nbefore the Committee in July of this year. Engineering Software, in \npartnership with Washington University in St. Louis, received a phase \ntwo award from the Air Force to develop an innovative method of \nanalyzing the stresses placed on composite materials. While this \ntechnology is currently being used in the aeronautics industry, it has \nmany other practical applications.\n  The STTR Program permitted Dr. Szabo, who had originated an algorithm \nhe developed at Washington University, to transfer the technology to \nEngineering Software, which had the software infrastructure to \ntransition the technology from an academic to a practical commercial \napplication. According to Dr. Szabo, Engineering Software has received \nan estimated $1.25 million in sales and follow-on developmental funding \nresulting from the technology funded by the STTR award and that the \nSTTR Program was of great assistance in transferring the technology \nfrom the academic environment to actual use and application.\n  Based on the proven success of the STTR Program to date this \nlegislation increases the funds allocated for the program from .15 \npercent to .3 percent of an agency's extramural research and \ndevelopment budget. This increase will not require any additional \nappropriations but merely will reallocate funds in the participating \nagencies to this successful program. I thank Senator Levin and Senator \nWarner on the Armed Services Committee for working closely with Senator \nKerry and me to make such an increase possible. When a program is \nworking as well as the STTR Program, it would be a mistake if Congress \ndid not build on its success.\n  This is especially true for Federal investment in small business \nresearch and development. Despite report after report demonstrating \nthat small businesses innovate at a greater rate that large firms, \nsmall businesses receive less than four percent of all Federal research \nand development dollars. This number has remained essentially unchanged \nfor the past 22 years. Increasing funds for the STTR Program sends a \nstrong message that the Federal government acknowledges the \ncontributions that small businesses have made and will continue to make \nto government research and development efforts and to our nation's \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, Senator Kerry and I have worked together to produce a \nsound, bipartisan bill. This legislation is good for the small business \nhigh-technology community and will ensure that our Federal research and \ndevelopment needs are well met in the next decade. I trust that the \nbill will receive the overwhelming support of my colleagues.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 2882, just received from the \nHouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2882) to provide for the expedited payment of \n     certain benefits for a public safety officer who was killed \n     or suffered a catastrophic injury as a direct and proximate \n     result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty in \n     connection with the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the Senators from New York for \ntheir leadership on this legislation to streamline the Public Safety \nOfficers' Benefits application process so that the family members of \nfire fighters, emergency medical technicians and rescue workers who \nperished or suffered great injury in the aftermath of the tragic \nterrorist events of this week. I am proud to be an original cosponsor \nof S.1422. I applaud Congressman Nadler and Congressman Sensenbrenner \nfor their work on H.R. 2882, which we are passing today.\n  Earlier today, I received a call from Congressman Sensenbrenner, \nChairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who asked me if the Senate \nwould consider and pass H.R. 2882 without delay. I thank our leaders, \nSenator Daschle and Senator Lott, for bringing this legislation before \nthe Senate so quickly, and urge the Senate to support it.\n  We have before us a unique opportunity to provide much-needed relief \nfor the families of the brave men and women who sacrificed their own \nlives for their fellow Americans. Senator Clinton and a number of other \nmembers of the Senate and House have proposed this bill to amend the \nPublic Safety Officers' Benefits Act of 1976 for the purpose of \nspeeding the process by which the Office of Justice Programs at the \nDepartment of Justice processes applications for death benefits for \nfamilies of public safety officers killed in the line of duty in New \nYork City, Washington, D.C., and Western Pennsylvania, on September 11.\n  The Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program provides $150,000 in \nbenefits for each of the families of law enforcement officers, firemen, \nemergency response squad members, ambulance crew members who are killed \nin the line of duty. Current regulations, however, require the families \nof public safety officers who have fallen in the line of duty to go \nthrough a cumbersome and time-consuming application process. In the \nface of this national tragedy, it is important that we begin to process \nquickly this measure of relief for the families of these brave \nAmericans who selflessly gave their lives so that others might live \nthrough the attacks of September 11.\n\n[[Page S9410]]\n\n  Mr. REID.
