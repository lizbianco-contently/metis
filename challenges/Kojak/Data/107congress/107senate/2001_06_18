Mr. President, I would like to speak today about the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, or the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act, \nwhich we are going to be turning to beginning tomorrow morning in the \nSenate. This\n\n[[Page S6370]]\n\ndebate revolves around the development of for-profit health care and \nthe growth of big managed care organizations and what that has meant to \npatients and people around this country who seek medical help. For some \n4 years now we have been debating what has been happening with the \nexplosion of HMOs in our health care system.\n  All of us understand the basics of medicine. That is, we understand \nthat if you have a medical affliction, you need to go see someone who \nis trained in the field of medicine. Often, they perform certain tests, \nand if you have an acute problem, often they check you into a hospital \nto get the needed treatment in those circumstances.\n  But things have changed in recent years in this country. The \nemergence of for-profit managed care organizations that are now in \ncharge of health care for a good many Americans has changed the \ndelivery of health care. The delivery of health care to individual \npatients now does not just involve the delivery of health care advice \nfrom a doctor to a patient in an examining room. It is more than that. \nIn some cases, we now have someone in an insurance company office 1,000 \nmiles away perhaps, who is making a decision about what medical care \nthey will cover and what they will not cover with respect to this \nparticular patient.\n  In recent years, Congress began to get a great deal of mail from \npatients saying: I had a health care plan only to discover that, when I \nbecame very sick and needed the benefits of that plan, those benefits \nwere not available to me. Not only was I required as a patient to fight \na battle with cancer, I was also required, they write, to fight a \nbattle with cancer and then a battle with my managed care organization \nto give me the treatment I needed.\n  So we will soon have before us a bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights, \nor Bipartisan Patient Protection Act. Yes, it is bipartisan. Democrats \nand Republicans are together bringing a bill to the floor of the \nSenate, saying we need to change what is happening in the delivery of \nhealth care in a way that provides fundamental rights to patients.\n  Let me describe some of those rights. Patients ought to have the \nright to know all of their medical options for treatment, not just the \ncheapest medical option. Second, a patient ought to have the right to \n``medically necessary'' care without some arbitrary interference by an \nHMO or a managed care organization. Doctors and patients, not health \nplan executives, ought to determine the care that is needed.\n  Patients ought to have the right to choose the doctor they want for \nthe care they need, including especially specialty care.\n  Patients ought to have the right to emergency room care when they \nhave an emergency.\n  A patient ought to have the right to have access to prescription \nmedicine that the doctors say are medically necessary for the patient.\n  You ought to have the right to a fair and speedy process for \nresulting disputes with your health care plan or your managed care \norganization.\n  And, finally, you ought to have the right to hold that managed care \norganization or health care plan accountable if its decision results in \ninjury or even death.\n  As this debate gets underway, we will hear a lot of things about this \nbill. We will hear that this is ``a trial lawyer's bill of rights.'' \nGod forbid, they will say, that we should give patients the right to go \nto an attorney and seek redress against a managed care organization \nthat didn't do right by them.\n  I find this a fascinating description of this bill. I will talk a bit \nmore about it later. But those who will come to the floor of the Senate \nand talk about their concern about lawyers being involved are concerned \nonly for one side. They say: We don't want patients to have the ability \nto go to a lawyer to get legal help to demand that managed care \norganizations give them the care they need and the care they thought \nwas guaranteed to them; let's not allow patients to have a lawyer.\n  They don't say anything about the managed care organizations. Those \nbig organizations have all kinds of lawyers working for them. If a \npatient doesn't pay a bill, or a monthly premium, guess what? The \nmanaged care organization can certainly go a hire a lawyer. Right? They \nhave a battery of lawyers with whom to pursue their objectives. Those \nwho oppose this legislation say the patient ought not have the right to \nseek redress.\n  I would like to go through a few examples today and draw some \nconclusions. As I do that, I would like to point out that these \nexamples are real people. I have used some of them before, and some are \nnew. But let me describe the problems we are trying to address with \nthis legislation through the patients and the difficulties these \npatients have been forced to go through in order to get the medical \nhelp they thought they were going to get under their managed care plan.\n  Let me turn to James Adams. I have spoken of James Adams before on \nthe floor of the Senate. This is a picture of James Adams, the happy \nand healthy little fellow tugging on his sister's shirt sleeve to get \nher attention. He lost both of his hands and legs.\n  James Adams is now 7 years old. Because of his parents' HMO rules, \nwhat happened to him in March of 1993 when he was only 6 months old \nchanged his life forever. He was suffering from a 105-degree fever. His \nmother took him to the family's HMO pediatrician, who diagnosed a \nrespiratory ailment for this young fellow and a postnasal drip and \nprescribed saline drops, vaporizer use, and Tylenol. The pediatrician \ntold the mother not to worry, that high fevers in young children don't \nnecessarily mean a serious illness.\n  Late that night, his temperature was still rising and he was in great \ndiscomfort. His worried mother called the HMO. The nurse on duty \nrecommended bathing this young fellow in cold water. The pediatrician \nthen placed a follow-up call advising the parents to bring James to an \nHMO participating hospital 42 miles away, even though there were 3 \ncloser hospitals.\n\n  On the way to the furthest hospital, which was the HMO hospital 42 \nmiles away, this young boy suffered full cardiac and respiratory arrest \nand lost consciousness. The parents passed three hospital emergency \nrooms before they could finally reach the HMO hospital, which is where \nthey would have coverage, according to their HMO.\n  Upon James' arrival, doctors were able to return his pulse and \nbreathing. But the circulation to his hands and feet had been cut off \nand could not be returned, causing irreparable damage to his \nextremities. The result? Both of his hands and feet had to be \namputated. That rendered him into a situation he will have to live with \nfor all of his life. The delay in care caused by driving almost an hour \nto an affiliated hospital took its toll.\n  One asks the question: Is it a reasonable thing to have a young boy \nwith a 105-degree fever go to a hospital 42 miles away and pass 3 \nhospitals on the way? That is the way some HMOs work. That is not the \nway a plan should work. Any emergency room ought to be available to \nthis young fellow in an emergency.\n  Let me describe another story, dealing with another person who was \ndenied coverage to emergency room care.\n  Jacqueline Lee lives in Bethesda, Maryland. A lover of the outdoors, \nshe took a trip to hike in the Shenandoah Mountains in the summer of \n1996. While walking on one of the trails, she lost her footing, and \nplummeted off of a 40-foot cliff to the ground below. Luckily for \nJacqueline, she was quickly airlifted from the mountain to a hosptial \nin Virginia. Amazingly, she survived the fall, sustaining fractures in \nher arms, pelvis, and her skull.\n  After she survived and went through a convalescence, her HMO refused \nto pay more than $10,000 in emergency room bills because it said this \nwoman who was brought into an emergency room on a gurney, unconscious, \ndid not get preapproval for using emergency room services.\n  Because an unconscious patient falling off a 40-foot cliff, suffering \nsubstantial injuries, did not get preapproval, the managed care \norganization said it would not pay the emergency room fees. This is an \nexample of emergency room care that is needed by a patient who had \nprotection under her health plan only to be told later that she \nwouldn't be covered for emergency room treatment. Is that something \npatients should worry about? They shouldn't have to worry about that.\n  Our Patients' Bill of Rights says emergency room treatment is \navailable in emergencies under what is called a prudent layperson \nstandard of defining what an emergency is.\n\n[[Page S6371]]\n\n  Let's not have more delay and all kinds of shenanigans by the managed \ncare organization to see how it can withhold treatment. Let's say that \nif you have an emergency and you are covered by a managed care plan, \nyou deserve the right to be treated at an emergency room. It ought to \nbe true for Jacqueline Lee. It ought to be true for James Adams. It \nought to be true for every patient covered under a plan who needs \nemergency room treatment.\n  Let me describe the situation of Ethan Bedrick. I have spoken of \nEthan before.\n  The reviewing doctor never met with the family and never met with \nthis young boy, Ethan. He simply said: Only a 50-percent chance of \nbeing able to walk by age 5 is a ``minimal benefit'' and therefore his \ninsurance company would not continue the therapy.\n  Ethan Bedrick was born on January 28, 1992. His delivery went badly, \nand as a result of asphyxiation, he has suffered from severe cerebral \npalsy and spastic quadriplegia, which impairs motor functions in all \nhis limbs. Ethan was put on a regimen of intense physical, occupational \nand speech therapy to help him overcome some obstacles throughout his \ndevelopment.\n  At the age of 14 months, Ethan's insurance company abruptly cut off \ncoverage for his speech therapy, and limited this physical therapy to \nonly 15 sessions per year. This change was recommended by an insurance \ncompany doctor performing a ``utilization review'' of Ethan's case. The \nreviewing doctor cited a 50 percent chance that Ethan could walk by age \n5 as a ``minimal benefit'' of further therapy.\n  Ethan's parents appealed to the courts. The courts said:\n\n       It is as important not to get worse as it is to get better. \n     The implication that walking by age 5 . . . would not be \n     ``significant progress'' for this unfortunate child is simply \n     revolting.\n\n  Unfortunately, during the time of court action, Ethan lost three \nyears of vital therapy. And even then, the Bedricks were left with no \nremedy for compensation for Ethan's loss of therapy.\n  Does this child need patient protections? You bet your life. This \nchild and his family need patient protections.\n  Let me describe a young boy named Christopher Roe. I was holding a \nhearing one day in Las Vegas, NV, with my colleague, Senator Reid. \nChristopher's mother, Susan, came to the hearing, and she held, above \nher head, a picture the size of the one I have in the Chamber. Susan \nbegan to speak about her son Christopher and this subject of patients' \nprotection.\n  His mother said that Christopher Thomas Roe died October 12, 1999. It \nwas his 16th birthday. The official cause of Christopher's death was \nleukemia. But Susan said the real cause of Christopher's death was that \nthe family's health plan denied him the chemotherapy drug he needed. \nYes, it was investigational, but it would have given him a chance at \nlife; and it was denied at every step of the way.\n  Christopher was first diagnosed with leukemia in 1998. He at first \nachieved remission, only to develop an early relapse. His pediatric \noncologist recommended he receive a bone marrow transplant, which was \nhis only hope for long-term survival. But before he could receive a \nbone marrow transplant, he needed to go into a second remission.\n  Chris's oncologist felt that because of his early relapse, he needed \nan additional drug that the oncologist recommended. It was available at \nthe Hughes Institute in St. Paul, MN, but it had already proven \neffective in fighting the specific kind of leukemia cells young \nChristopher had.\n  The health plan denied treatment saying, no, this drug is \nexperimental, even though it wouldn't have had to pay for the drug \nitself, only the blood draws, physician visits, and blood products it \nwould have paid for had he received traditional chemotherapy.\n  Chris's family immediately appealed. The review, which was supposed \nto have taken 48 hours, took 10 days. Meanwhile, as the appeal dragged \non, Christopher's condition worsened, and his oncologist felt he had no \nchoice but to start Christopher on the more traditional chemotherapy. \nBut that did not work.\n  The National Bone Marrow Donor Program found six perfect matches for \nthis young boy, which is almost unheard of. Unfortunately, he was never \nable to make it to a bone marrow transplant because he was never able \nto achieve the second remission without the drug he needed in order to \ndo that. At a hearing that I held with my colleague, Senator Reid, his \nmother Susan stood up and held this picture of young Christopher above \nher head, and she began crying as she described her son's death. She \nsaid: My son was 16 years old. And he looked up at me from his bed and \nsaid: Mom, I just don't understand how they could do this to a kid.\n  This mother felt that her son deserved every opportunity, deserved a \nfighting chance against his disease. What she said was: My son and our \nfamily had to fight the cancer and fight the managed care organization \nat the same time, and that is not fair.\n  She is right about that. We ought not have this happen in our \ncountry. I hope that, in the name of Christopher Roe and so many \nothers, we can pass a patients' protection act in this Congress that \nsays to them and others like them: You have certain rights as patients. \nRight now the odds are stacked. We have the big interests over here, \nand they have all the money and all the lawyers; and we have the \npatients over here who, alone with their families, are left to fight \nthe battle.\n  We had a hearing in Washington, DC, about a year ago. A mother from \nNew York came to that hearing. Mary Lewandowski was her name. I will \nnever forget her because she came up to me after the hearing and gave \nme a big hug, and we talked about her daughter Donna Marie. Donna Marie \ndied February 8, 1997. Her mother Mary has made it a cause to try to \nsee if she can prevent from happening to others what happened to her \nchild. Mary comes to Congress at her own expense. Nobody pays her way \nhere. Every chance she gets, she comes to talk about her daughter.\n\n  The week of her daughter Donna's death, she had been to a doctor four \ntimes in 5 days. Despite her worsening symptoms, this young girl was \ntold that she had an upper respiratory infection, and she had panic \nattacks, her doctor said. She was 22 years old. On the evening of \nFebruary 8, Donna was in a tremendous amount of pain. Her mother called \nthe hospital, and was told she could not bring her daughter to the \nhospital unless it was a life-or-death situation, or unless she had a \ndoctor's referral.\n  Mary tried in vain to reach Donna's doctor. One hour later, Donna \nlapsed into a coma and died. She died from a blood clot on her lung the \nsize of a football.\n  Donna's doctor later told her mother that a $750 lung scan might well \nhave saved her daughter's life. But the test was not performed because \nit could not be justified to the HMO or the managed care organization.\n  Now I would like to turn, just for a moment, to a couple of other \nissues in this debate. The question of whether care is ``medically \nnecessary'' is often cited as a reason for lack of treatment by a \nmanaged care organization.\n  This is a picture of a young baby born with a horrible problem, a \ncleft upper lip: A terrible disfigurement. Surgeons tell me that--in \nfact, one Member of Congress, who is an oral surgeon confirms this--it \nis not unusual at all to be told that fixing this is not ``medically \nnecessary'' and, therefore, the health care plan will not cover it. It \nis not ``medically necessary'' to fix this. Can you imagine being told \nthat as a parent?\n  Let me show you a picture of what it looks like when you fix this \nproblem. This picture shows what that young child can look like when \nthat problem is fixed.\n  After looking at the results, can one really say it is not medically \nnecessary to fix this? This legislation begins to define what the \nrights of patients are with respect to what is ``medically necessary.''\n  Is it necessary for us to pass this legislation? In the name of all \nof these children, in the name of these patients and in the name of \nthese people who have to fight dread diseases and their managed care \norganizations at the same time, the answer clearly is yes. We ought to \ngive them those opportunities. And those opportunities exist in this \nlegislation.\n  This will be a long and difficult debate. I do not know whether the \nvotes will exist at the end of this debate to pass it.\n\n[[Page S6372]]\n\n  But I do know this: This debate has gone on for nearly 4 years now. \nThis is an iteration of an iteration of an iteration. It is a \ncompromise after a compromise after a compromise. It is a bipartisan \nbill brought to the Senate Chamber to say: Let us provide patient \nprotections against those HMOs that want to withhold needed treatments \nfor patients. Let's change the odds.\n  Let me hasten to say, not all insurance companies or HMOs are bad \nactors. Many of them are wonderful, and do a great job, and serve their \npatients very well. I commend them.\n  There are some, however, who look at a patient in the context of \nprofit and loss. A woman in the State of Georgia suffered a very severe \nhead injury. She was put in an ambulance, and on the way to a \nhospital--she was not quite unconscious--she had the presence of mind \nto tell the ambulance driver: I want to go to the following hospital. \nAnd it was the farthest hospital away, about another 10 minutes. They \ntook her there, but they later asked her why, with a brain injury, she \nwould want to take the extra 10 minutes to go to a further hospital. \nShe said: I know about the hospital that was closer. It is a hospital \nwith a reputation for taking a look at a patient who is coming in and \nseeing the dollars and cents, the profit and loss. I didn't want my \nmedical care to be the function of someone else's calculation of profit \nand loss.\n  This is from a woman in an ambulance with a brain injury. My point is \nvery simple. This country needs to have some basic protections for \npatients, and the patients want those protections. Especially with the \ngrowth of managed care organizations, many of whom do a fine job, but \nsome of whom do not, we need these protections.\n  We need to say, as a matter of public policy in this country, \npatients have certain rights. Yes, you have a right to know all of your \noptions for medical treatment, not just the cheapest one the managed \ncare organization might want to tell you about.\n  Yes, you have a right to an emergency room when you have an \nemergency. Yes, you have a right to be able to see the specialist you \nneed when you need to see one. Yes, you have a right, if your spouse is \nbeing treated for breast cancer and you have changed jobs, for your \nwife to see that same oncologist who has been working with for her for \nthe last 5 years to fight her breast cancer. You ought to have that \nright, and this legislation will give you that right.\n  We will have Senators who will assert that this is a bill about \ntrying to create more lawsuits. It is not that at all. It is about \ntrying to provide patient protections. As I said when I started, the \nmanaged care organizations have all the lawyers they need. They can \nhire all the lawyers they need and want unimpeded. No one is going to \ncome to the Chamber from the other side and talk about limiting the \nrights of the big managed care organizations or insurers to hire \nlawyers, are they? I don't think so. But they will say: We don't want \npatients to have access to attorneys to hold managed care organizations \naccountable.\n  This is all about accountability. The Red Cross can be held \naccountable. Boy Scouts can be held accountable. Everybody can be held \naccountable except, in these circumstances, managed care organizations. \nThis piece of legislation says everybody ought to be held accountable.\n  This is not about lawyers, this is about getting the right care to \npatients when they need it.\n  I suspect we will debate this for a couple of weeks. We have had this \ndebate before. This legislation has changed from that time. For \nexample, we hear from small businesses, who are now getting mailings \naround the country, saying: If Congress passes this Patients' Bill of \nRights, this is going to break our small businesses because we will be \nheld accountable. That is not true. In fact, this has changed so that \nwe use exactly the same language the majority party used in its \nsubstitute in 1999. This bill isn't in any way putting in jeopardy \nsmall businesses. We don't hold them accountable. They are not \naccountable at all in circumstances where they have not had direct \nparticipation in making decisions about patient care. They are not \naccountable in that circumstance and should not be accountable because \nthey were not making the decision.\n  This is about managed care organizations and patients and the \nrelationship between the two and the rights patients ought to have.\n  I have other pictures. I have other stories. I will at some point \nlater describe more of them in terms of what is ``medically necessary'' \nbecause by deciding what is medically necessary is another very \nimportant way in which HMOs can withhold treatment.\n  I am going to show a poster on the issue of medical necessity that is \na little more subtle than perhaps the other one I used but just as \nimportant. Brenna Nay was born in 1987. She has abnormal facial \nfeatures characteristic of what is called Hajdu-Cheney syndrome. The \nshape of her skull is distorted. She had no chin. The question is, is \nit medically necessary to treat this young lady?\n  Let me show the result after surgery. They built this young woman a \nchin. After surgery, does that improve that young woman's life? Is this \nsomething you ought to expect would be covered in a health plan? In my \njudgment, it should.\n  I have other pictures that are similar. I will use them later.\n  This ``medically necessary'' issue is critically important. I feel \npassionate about these health care issues. I have lost a member of my \nfamily. I have sat in intensive care day after day after day and know \nwhat it is like to lose a member of my family in a circumstance I can \nhardly begin to describe. In my case, my loss didn't have anything to \ndo with the managed care organization withholding treatment. But I \nunderstand the passion of parents. I understand the passion of people \nwho are fighting for their lives, who are struggling and fighting \nmightily against dread diseases and illnesses they know can kill them \nand then discover they not only have to waste the emotional energy to \nwage war against cancer or heart disease or so many other problems, but \nthey also have to try at the same time to fight a managed care \norganization that ought to be covering that which is in their health \ncare plan.\n  That is not right. That is not fair. These are the types of problems \nthis piece of legislation is designed to try to address. If we can pass \nthis legislation, the country will be a significant step ahead in \ndealing with patients' needs and protections.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mr. DORGAN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a true pioneer \nin public service, Colonel James Garrard Jones.\n  Colonel Jones was born in Paris, KY on July 3, 1814, but soon became \na resident of the great State of Indiana when\n\n[[Page S6373]]\n\nhis family moved there in 1819. This move was Indiana's good fortune, \nfor it did not take long for Colonel Jones to become involved in public \nlife.\n  The young Colonel Jones served as Surveyor and Deputy Recorder of \nVanderburgh County, leaving a lasting mark as the county's early field \nnotes and books of deeds and mortgages appear in his handwriting. He \nwent on to serve as Evansville Trustee and Evansville Attorney under \nthe town corporation. In 1847, Colonel Jones's efforts in the \nestablishment of a city government culminated with his election as \nfirst Mayor of Evansville. He won reelection as Mayor in 1850.\n  Colonel Jones took his service to the State level with his election \nas Attorney General of Indiana in 1860. But shortly thereafter he was \nappointed Colonel of the Forty-Second Regiment of the Indiana Volunteer \nInfantry, and he left office to serve with the regiment.\n  After hostilities ended, Colonel Jones practiced law until Governor \nBaker appointed him to his final position of public service in 1869 as \nJudge of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit.\n  Colonel Jones passed away on April 5, 1872. This public servant, \nhusband, and father to eight children is remembered not only for his \npublic service, but also for his intelligence, kindness, and geniality.\n  On June 23, 2001, the descendants of Colonel Jones, the current Mayor \nof Evansville, IN, Russell Lloyd Jr., the Friends of the Forty-Second \nRegiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and others will gather to remember \nColonel Jones with the placement of a new bronze marker at his grave \nsite in the Oak Hill Cemetery in Evansville. I am pleased to join them \nin honoring this fine man who contributed greatly to Evansville, the \nstate of Indiana, and our nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/18/senate-section/article/S6373-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRATULATING SHIRLEY M. CALDWELL TILGHMAN\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nShirley Tilghman on becoming the 19th President of Princeton \nUniversity. Dr. Tilghman comes to this revered post eminently \nqualified, having previously served as an exceptional teacher and a \nworld renowned scholar.\n  Dr. Tilghman has been a valuable member of the Princeton faculty for \nmany years. Arriving at Princeton in 1986, she served as the Howard A. \nPrior Professor of the Life Sciences. She has also served as the chair \nof Princeton's Council on Science and Technology from 1993 through \n2000, and in 1998 undertook the responsibilities of founding director \nfor Princeton's multi-disciplinary Lewis-Sigler Institute for \nIntegrative Genomics. The founding of the Lewis-Sigler Institute grew \nout of Dr. Tilgman's role as one of the architects of the national \neffort to map the human genome.\n  Harold R. McAlindon once said, ``Do not follow where the path may \nlead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.'' I am \nconfident that based on Dr. Tilghman's wealth of experience and \ninterests, she will continue in this spirit as she guides Princeton \nUniversity. I wish her all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/18/senate-section/article/S6373-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO KATHLEEN MOORE\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

I \ncommend her for the act of risking her own life to save the life of a \nfellow citizen.\n  While returning home after babysitting for children of a friend, \nKathleen spotted a burning automobile that had crashed into a tree. \nAlarmed by the sound of banging from inside the vehicle, Kathleen, a \npostal employee, risked her life while aiding Mark Renaud, of \nBarnstead, NH, who was trapped underneath the burning car.\n  Kathleen, who had lost a daughter and a son in an automobile accident \n12 years earlier, heroically pulled Mark Renaud out of the flaming \ninferno that had consumed the car. Thanks to the selfless actions of \nKathleen, Mark is alive today.\n  Kathleen Moore is a role model for the citizens of Goffstown, our \nState and country. I applaud her act of heroism and charity. It is an \nhonor and a privilege to represent her in the United States \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/18/senate-section/article/S6373-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CONGRATULATING THE MERCK INSTITUTE OF AGING & HEALTH\n\n Mr. CORZINE.

The 70-person contingent included small \nchildren and babies in strollers.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/18/senate-section/article/S6373-5", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6373-S6374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SPEARFISH HIGH SCHOOL ``WE THE PEOPLE . . .

The Citizen and the Nation,'' is an outstanding \nprogram directed by the Center for Civic Education and funded by the \nUnited States Department of Education by an act of Congress. The \nprogram's goal is to create an enlightened citizenry that\n\n[[Page S6374]]\n\nis well-versed on the principles and virtues of America's \nconstitutional democracy. To help meet this goal, students take part in \nan instructional curriculum that culminates with a simulated \ncongressional hearing that tests students knowledge and understanding \nof the history and principles of American government.\n  Spearfish, SD is a wonderful town located in the northern part of the \nBlack Hills, home to Mt. Rushmore, Crazy Horse monument, and other \nbeautiful landmarks and landscapes. I am proud that these students from \nSpearfish serve as such excellent representatives of our great State of \nSouth Dakota. I commend them for their talent and their commitment to \nlearning about our Nation's system of government.\n  For their contributions to the successful team effort, I congratulate \nclass members Ryan Aalbu, Jessica Barron, Ryan Batt, Chelsea Brennan, \nChristi Coburn, Doug Dodson, Johanna Farmer, Ryan Freemont, Christina \nHammerquist, Marie Hoffman, Matt Loken, John Martin, Cassie Parsons, \nFaith Pautz, Kara Peep, Danielle Peterson, Crystal Sachau, Amanda \nSchlepp, Jordan Schmit, Mindy Simonson, Mark Stratton, Erin Talsma, and \nAaron Varadi.\n  Mr. Patrick Gainey deserves special recognition for his role in this \naccomplishment. As the teacher of this class, he both taught and \ninspired these students, while leading them to the national finals \ncompetition. I also acknowledge State Coordinator Lennis Larson, and \nDistrict Coordinator Mark Rockafellow for helping to facilitate this \nevent for these students.\n  I am proud that South Dakota is home to such outstanding students, \nwhose desire and commitment to studying our constitutional government \nis clearly evident from this achievement. I thank you, for allowing me \ntime to share this outstanding accomplishment with my Senate \ncolleagues. Their performance in this national competition not only \nmakes all of South Dakota proud, but also serves as a model for other \ntalented and motivated students throughout our state to \nemulate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/18/senate-section/article/S6374-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN FRANK HOLDSWORTH\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

I have not been able to \nget clearance to proceed at 11:30 a.m. tomorrow.\n  Also, I understand the underlying legislation that will be the \nvehicle we consider was changed perhaps as late as Friday afternoon. We \nare trying to get a look at it and see exactly what\n\n[[Page S6379]]\n\nchanges have been made because that will determine what first \namendments might be offered or what the tone of the debate will be as \nwe open this legislation. I am sure we are going to be able to go to \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights in a reasonable period of time, but at \nthis time I have been asked to object. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say before my friend leaves that we have \ncopies of the legislation, and we will be happy to let anyone who wants \nlook at it. I hope, as the minority leader indicated, that we can move \nto this bill tomorrow. If not, of course, there are other procedural \nthings we can do to get to it eventually.\n  I have spent time with Senator Gregg in recent weeks, and he is a \npleasant man to be with. I know Senator Frist is well advised about \nthis legislation. This has been going on for years, and we hope we can \nfinally dispose of it one way or the other in the near future. I not \nonly appreciate what the Senator has said but the tone in which he said \nit. We look forward to seeing if we can work it out tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/18/senate-section/article/S6379-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JUNE 19, 2001\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, tomorrow I am very hopeful we will at \nlong last have the opportunity to consider, again, legislation to \nprotect American patients from HMO abuses. Across the country, we have \nseen abuses as a result of HMOs interfering with the decisions being \nmade daily by doctors, nurses, and family physicians. Health care \nprofessionals are seeing their decisions overruled by HMO accountants \nwho, in many instances, are many miles away. These accountants do not \nhave the professional training that the doctors and the nurses \ninitially making that judgment and decision have received. They are not \nseeing the patient and are more interested in the bottom line for the \nHMO rather than the good outcome for the patient.\n  This legislation has been out there for nearly 5 years. During that \nperiod of time, we have had some debate. We have had some votes in the \nSenate, but it seems to me we now have a chance to finally give \nAmericans the protections they want and deserve.\n  I will take a few moments this afternoon to review, once again, what \nthis legislation is about. This legislation recognizes that managed \ncare too often means ``mismanaged'' care. We have the opportunity to \nchange that. We should change it and establish a minimum standard of \nquality care. If individual States want to build on those standards, \nthat should be the decision for the States, but we ought to establish a \nminimum standard. That is what this legislation, before the Senate \ntomorrow, will do.\n  This legislation basically incorporates the protections which are \nalready in effect in the Medicare and Medicaid protections. Many of the \nprotections included in this bill have been recommended by insurance \ncommissioners who are not Democrats or Republicans. Actually, if you \nlooked, there are probably more Republicans than Democrats among this \ngroup. A few protections included in the bill are the result of the \nunanimous bipartisan commission, set up 3 years ago, that made a series \nof recommendations. The protections included here reflect a unanimous \nvote by the commission.\n  I will review them quickly. It is important we understand the \nintroduced proposal now known as the McCain-Edwards legislation. I am a \nstrong supporter. Senator Daschle is a strong supporter, as well as \nothers. Over the weekend, more than 44 State medical societies wrote \ntheir Senators indicating their strong support for this legislation. As \nof this afternoon, more than 600 health organizations from across the \ncountry support the McCain-Edwards legislation.\n  I would be surprised if the other side can find about 15 supportive \norganizations. Virtually the entire medical community--not only the \nprofessional doctors, nurses, consumers, but the advocates--understand \nthe importance of this legislation and support it, along with the \nsenior organizations. The disability community understands this \nlegislation. This bill provides care for children and others that have \nspecial needs as a result of their condition. Virtually every health \norganization supports it. This bill has bipartisan support.\n  Sixty-three Republicans effectively supported this legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives, and it has bipartisan support in the Senate. \nI daresay if one asks Republicans or Independents across the country--\nwhether in the upper parts of the State of Maine, southern Florida, \nCalifornia, or the State of Washington--this bill has common interest \nand common concern across the Nation. So many of the issues we deal \nwith in the Senate have support only in one region of the country among \none particular group, and they usually face strong opposition in other \nparts of the country.\n\n  The principal opposition--the singular opposition--is the insurance \ncompanies and the HMOs. If one looks at the breadth of support on our \nside, it is not just the bipartisan membership bringing this and \nsupporting this, Republicans and Democrats alike. Dr. Norwood in the \nHouse of Representatives, Congressman Ganske, and others in the House \nof Representatives--along with Congressman Dingell support the bill. In \nthe Senate, we have Senator McCain and others, including Senator \nSpecter, who is on the floor at this time, and other Members who \nsupport this concept.\n  It is understandable because this bill has compelling reason for \nprotections. They are commonsense protections. First, we want to \nprotect all patients. That is very fundamental and important. We don't \nwant legislation that alleges coverage for all, but creates sufficient \nloopholes so large numbers of our American families will not be \ncovered. President Bush has recognized this principle. He wants to make \nsure all families and all patients will be covered.\n  We talk about access to specialists. It includes out-of-network \nservice. I can remember in my own family situation, my son Teddy was 12 \nyears old,\n\n[[Page S6380]]\n\nand he had a particular type of cancer--Osteosarcoma. About 1,500 \nchildren have this kind of cancer every year. It took a child pediatric \noncologist who could understand his real needs and was able to make the \nrecommendations for treatment of that particular need. We want to make \nsure if other families have either children or loved ones who need the \nkind of specialty care that is outside of the network, then they will \nbe able to access the best of the speciality's trained medical \nprofessional. We want to make sure it is guaranteed. In too many \ninstances today, it is not guaranteed.\n  We want to make assure care coordination and standing referrals. This \nis especially important for individuals who have a disability, so they \ndon't have to go back every single time to their primary care physician \nfor a referral. We need care coordination and protections particularly \nbecause some patients have complicated, involved health care needs or \ndisabilities. This is enormously important. It is a feature the \ndisability community cares so much about. It makes sense and provides \nsavings for resources.\n  Next, this bill protects coverage for clinical trials. A lot of \nMembers say they support clinical trials. We voted on this issue in the \nSenate not along ago. We did not guarantee access to clinical trials. \nThere is a decline in the number of clinical trials at the present \ntime--at a time when we are supporting dramatic increases in the NIH \nbudget, and at the time of the century that we will see the greatest \nprogress in the life sciences that we have ever seen.\n  As the previous century was the age of engineering, chemistry, and \nphysics, this is the century of the life sciences. When we pick up a \nnewspaper each day, we find that new breakthroughs are taking place. \nThe only way we can get the breakthroughs from the laboratory to the \nbedside is through clinical trials. We have to make sure we encourage \nclinical trials. We are seeing a decline in the number of clinical \ntrials because the industry will not continue to support these \nprograms.\n  We will have a chance to get into this in greater detail. Obviously, \nwhen we debate clinical trials, the additional kinds of health care \ncosts that are entailed should be covered by the clinical trials. But \nthere should be basic coverage for that individual who has a health \ncare need that should be continued by the insurance company.\n  It is always amazing to me why insurance companies or HMOs will not \nsupport it. If the person gets better as a result of the clinical \ntrials, it is going to save the health plan resources, and it is not \ngoing to put them at greater risk.\n  Next, coverage for emergency care. In too many instances, if patients \ngo to another emergency room or another emergency care facility or \nhospital, the HMO will not cover it. That makes absolutely no sense.\n  Direct access to OB/GYN providers and pediatricians is enormously \nimportant. It is an issue that is of primary concern to women, so they \ncan have the OB/GYN as their primary care doctors. Certainly for \nprimary care physicians, the need for pediatricians for children ought \nto be very clear and supported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair wishes to advise the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts that the standing order of the day is \nlimiting Senators to 10 minutes during this period of morning business.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my friend from Pennsylvania. Could \nI go for 10 more minutes? I ask unanimous consent for 10 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We want to make sure the patients receive the \nprescription drugs that their doctors prescribe. This is not always the \ncase. It is difficult to believe, but it is not the case in too many \nHMOs.\n  The list goes on. This bill prohibits clauses which frequently gag \nmedical professionals and doctors from recommending what is best for \npatients. This bill also prohibits financial incentives to deny care.\n  It is difficult for most of us to believe what exists in many HMO \ncontracts at this time. Many have major financial incentives for \ndoctors--if they do not prescribe certain care, doctors can enhance \ntheir financial situation. Any legislation ought to have that \nparticular protection, as well as protections for the providers who \nadvocate for patients.\n  We want to make sure we have a good internal appeals process \nconducted in a timely way. So if there is a question of getting the \ntreatment, it is done in a timely way. We also need a timely \nindependent external appeals process.\n  There are those who think if the HMO makes a recommendation on \nappeal, then that is good enough. Recommendations should be \nindependent. In States with the external appeals process, it is done \nindependently. We should do no less. We will have a chance to debate \nthat. Surprisingly, it is debatable, but the protection makes a good \ndeal of sense.\n  Health plans should be held accountable in Federal court when \ncontract disputes result in injury or death. Plans should be held \naccountable in State courts when a disputed medical judgment results in \ninjury or death. The judicial conference has made these \nrecommendations, and it is, by and large, the situation we have in the \nState of Texas at the present time. Since 1997, we have seen only a \nhandful of suits take place.\n\n  If the Chair will let me know when I have 1 minute left, please?\n  Let's take a look here, once again, why it is so important to pass \nthis bill. I will do this very quickly. Every day we fail to act, this \nis what it means in terms of American patients being hurt. The number \nof patients affected every day from health care abuse--from delay in \nneeded care--is 35,000; from delay in specialty care, the number of \npatients affected every day is 35,000; and from HMOs forcing patients \nto change doctors, 31,000 patients are affected each day. As a result \nof that, 59,000 patients every day have added pain and suffering, and \n41,000 patients every day experience worsened conditions. That is \nhappening every single day. That is why we believe it is so important \nto provide protections.\n  Doctors know that congressional delay means patient suffering. That \nwas the result from a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation. It \nillustrates that 14,000 doctors each day see patients suffering from \nserious decline in their health because of abuses by health plans. It \nhappens from health plans denying coverage of physician recommended \nprescription drugs.\n  Each day, 14,000 doctors prescribe prescription drugs, and patients \ndo not receive these necessary drugs.\n  There are 10,000 doctors every day recommending various diagnostic \ntests so they can analyze the health care needs of their patients, but \npatients are denied coverage for these tests. And there are 7,000 \ndoctors who are recommending specialty care for their patients. They \nhave made the decision and have found it necessary, but the specialty \ncare is being denied. There are 6,000 doctors who say patients ought to \nstay overnight in the hospital, but it is being denied. And there are \n6,000 doctors who see their referral for mental health or substance \nabuse treatment denied--every single day, that is happening.\n  This is why we need to address this situation across this country--\nnorth, south, east, and west. We ought to establish a basic floor of \nprotections. We ought to have accountability, because when we have \naccountability, HMOs do the correct thing.\n  If we look at what has happened, we just finished 8 weeks on the \nfloor of the Senate where rarely a speech was made about education when \nwe did not hear about accountability. Remember that? We are going to \nhave accountability for children, third grade through eighth, for \ntaking tests. We are going to have accountability for schools. If they \ndon't shape up, they will be restructured and reorganized. \nAccountability on the parents, accountability on the States--\naccountability, accountability, accountability.\n  This is all we are saying--when we have accountability, which means \nwhen a decision is made by an HMO that overrides a doctor's decision, \nand that decision results in harm, death, or injury to a patient, the \nHMO should be held responsible for its decision.\n  When we include this protection in HMOs, we find the number of \nharmful decisions falls. If you look at the State of Texas where they \nhave had this protection in effect for 3\\1/2\\ years, they\n\n[[Page S6381]]\n\nhave had about a dozen cases. If you look at the State of California--\nwhich has a very tough protection not dissimilar from what we are \ntalking about, but also has accountability--they have no cases to date. \nNone, zero. This has been a surprise to the industry and to other \nhealth observers in California. There have been 200 appeals out there. \nMr. President, 65 percent of those appeals have been decided in favor \nof the HMO, but they still have not had those cases brought to court. \nBut what you do have is guarantees to patients, such as the ones we \nhave outlined here in this particular list. That has been true.\n  Finally, we have about 50 million Americans through their own \ncontract--State and county workers--who have the opportunity to sue the \nHMOs under that particular contract.\n  We don't find the kind of abuses the naysayers will talk about in \nterms of this legislation, and we find their premiums are very much \nalong the lines of the others.\n  We are looking forward to this debate tomorrow. I welcome the \nopportunity to finally bring this bill up. I am grateful to the \nleadership of Senator Daschle who has urged us to move on this in a \ntimely way. In the past, we haven't been able to bring this up in the \nway we will tomorrow--as a free and open debate. We have had to bring \nit up in other circumstances, at other times, using the rules of the \nSenate to insist that the Senate address it. Now we will have the \nchance for a free and open debate. We want progress on this \nlegislation. It is necessary.\n  In the last week, we were able to work out--with the administration \nand others--a very solid result for education reform. I am still not \nsatisfied it will benefit all the children it should because although \nthe authorization will ensure that all children will benefit, we are \ngoing to have to make an issue on those questions. I wish we had that \nsame opportunity on health care as well because this protection is of \nsuch enormous importance to families across the Nation.\n  I look forward to the debate. I hope we can get to this bill in a \ntimely way. We had a full opportunity to examine and look at the \nvarious provisions. We already debated and acted on most of these \nprovisions 2\\1/2\\ years ago. This is a substantive matter with which \nMembers should be familiar. The need is paramount.\n  I look forward to working with our colleagues on all sides of the \naisle. I look forward to, hopefully, working with the administration so \nwe can enact legislation that will make sure that when doctors make a \ndecision with a family, it will be a decision that will stand. Doctors \nneed that kind of protection. Health professionals need that \nprotection. Importantly, patients need that protection.\n  That is what this legislation is really all about. We look forward to \nworking with our colleagues to make sure we get the job done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to deliver my remarks at my seat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS.

JONES CO.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Virginia \n(Mr. Allen) last week emphatically called the hands of various media \nfor having inaccurately reported the Senator's position on the World \nWar II Memorial and the American firm (and its German parent company) \nselected to build the memorial.\n  I feel obliged to comment as well, not only to commend the able \nSenator from Virginia for speaking out, but to emphasize that the lead \ncontractor for the World War II Memorial is a distinguished North \nCarolina company.\n  J.A. Jones Construction Company is a 112-year-old Charlotte \nenterprise which deserves better than to have bitter fringe groups try \nto impugn the integrity and historic citizenship of such a well-\nestablished firm.\n  Business is business, and it's understandable that losing bidders on \nany project will be disappointed. But for such a prestigious U.S. \ncompany as J.A. Jones to be unjustifiably criticized certainly is an \ninappropriate exercise on the part of the losing bidders.\n  For the purpose of rejecting the activities by fringe groups, I feel \nit appropriate that the Congressional Record reflect the specific role \nthat J.A. Jones Construction Company has played in supporting the \nUnited States and its national defense during the 112 years that J.A. \nJones Company has been in business.\n  While this is not a complete list, it is sufficiently detailed for me \nto make clear the kind of corporate citizen J.A. Jones Construction \nCompany has been:\n  The construction of nine American military bases that trained U.S. \ntroops for World War II;\n  The construction and operation of the Navy Shipyard in Panama City, \nFL, and the operation of the Navy Shipyard at Brunswick, GA. Between \nthe two facilities, J.A. Jones employees built more than 200 Liberty \nClass warships during World War II;\n  Selection as one of the first American companies to work in a war \nzone, constructing air bases and other facilities in and around Saigon \nduring the Vietnam war;\n  Construction of the Washington Mall Reflecting Pool, the West Wing of \nthe White House, the East Wing of the National Gallery of Art, the East \nand West Fronts of the Capitol, the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, \nthe Natural Museum of History addition and renovation, and the National \nGallery of Art Sculpture;\n  The continued involvement in building and maintaining military bases \nand facilities across the country; and\n  The current reconstruction of the two U.S. Embassies in Africa \ndestroyed by terrorist bombings.\n  Considering the circumstances, I feel it only fair that a statement \nissued by the president of J.A. Jones Construction Company be made a \npart of the Record at this point. President John D. Bond III identified \nsignificant aspects of his company's service to America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the statement be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Statement of John D. Bond III\n\n       J.A. Jones' 112-year history is an important and classic \n     case study in corporate patriotism and dedication to a free \n     world. In the military buildup in the 1930s before the U.S.'s \n     involvement in World War II, J.A. Jones built nine military \n     bases, from the ground up, in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, \n     North Carolina and South Carolina. These bases provided \n     everything our troops needed to prepare for their crucial \n     role in saving the world.\n       During the war, J.A. Jones built and then operated the Navy \n     Shipyard in Panama City, Fla., and took over operations of \n     the Navy Shipyard at Brunswick, Ga. At these two crucial \n     locations, J.A. Jones employees built more than 200 Liberty \n     Class warships at an incredible rate of 12 per month. In 1943 \n     and 1944, workers donated their time on Christmas Day to \n     continue working and get the ships to the Allied and U.S. \n     Armed Forces who so desperately needed them to win the war.\n       Scores of J.A. Jones employees served in the war, including \n     Edwin Jones, Jr., who would later become chairman of the \n     company after serving with the Marines and taking part in the \n     deadly fighting at Iwo Jima.\n       J.A. Jones' commitment to our nation and its men and women \n     in uniform has continued over the years. In Vietnam, J.A. \n     Jones was one of the first American companies to actually \n     work in a war zone when it built air bases and other \n     facilities in and around Saigon. J.A. Jones' close ties with \n     the U.S. military remain just as strong today as our \n     employees continue to build and manage bases and facilities \n     around the world.\n       In discussing the relationship between Philipp Holzmann and \n     J.A. Jones, it also is important to look at history. The two \n     companies first worked together in the mid-1970s on U.S. Army \n     Corps of Engineers projects in Saudi Arabia. J.A. Jones was \n     looking to expand its global presence, and Philipp Holzmann \n     saw potential in the U.S. Philipp Holzmann bought J.A. Jones \n     in 1979. Edwin Jones Jr., the World War II veteran who fought \n     at Iwo Jima, was chairman of J.A. Jones at the time of the \n     sale.\n       We are in fact a global economy. The very fact that Germany \n     has become a free capitalistic country and trusted American \n     ally is testament to the United States' and post-World War II \n     Allied commitments to rebuilding the free world. \n     Unfortunately, in the discussions of where the World War II \n     Memorial will be built and who will build it, we have lost \n     sight of the true purpose of this project: to honor the \n     veterans who saved the world. I believe the history of J.A. \n     Jones Construction and its people makes it the ideal choice \n     for the historic project.\n\n[[Page S6382]]\n\n       I am extremely proud that J.A. Jones will play an important \n     role in the building of the World War II Memorial. When we \n     break ground this summer, I will be there with my father, who \n     was paratrooper in World War II, and my son, whose generation \n     must recognize and understand the sacrifices that America's \n     Greatest Generation made for freedom. I could not look either \n     of them in the eye if I had any question about J.A. Jones' \n     commitment to American and a free world.\n       Today, I can say unequivocally that no company is more \n     committed than J.A. Jones to the principles that have made \n     America the leader of the free world.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hatch). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is just by accident that I happened to \nbe on the floor to listen to my distinguished friend and colleague \nrecount the history of this really remarkable construction firm. But I \nmust say I have some concerns about the problem. I have not reached any \ndetermination. I don't know if there is anything that this one Senator \nor other Senators can do to try to clarify what I perceive as a \nlegitimate concern not only held by this Senator but many across the \nUnited States for these reasons.\n  My dear friend and colleague from North Carolina has recounted the \nhistory of J.A. Jones. I don't question for a minute the distinguished \npatriotic service this firm has rendered to the United States, as the \nSenator has recounted very clearly, from World War II to date.\n  It also brought up the Charles Tompkins firm here in Washington, DC. \nI had some knowledge of that firm, and that firm also had an impeccable \nrecord, so far as I know, of patriotic service and built many \nstructures here in Washington.\n  Indeed, if I may indulge, at one time I was a young sort of engineer \nof types. After my last year of college before going to law school, I \nworked in the construction business here in the Nation's Capital as the \nsupervisor of heavy concrete and steel construction. And all of us knew \nabout the Charles H. Tompkins Building Firm.\n\n  But I think it is important for the Record to show that these two \nfirms were then bought out--Tompkins was first bought by the Jones \nCompany, if I understand it, and then the Jones Company, the \ncontrolling interest, was bought out by a German firm. Am I correct on \nthat, I ask my distinguished colleague?\n  Mr. HELMS. That is correct. But the presidency resides in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. But what year, to refresh my recollection? I have \nread it, but I simply don't have my papers here. But how many years ago \nwas it when the German firm bought this----\n  Mr. HELMS. I don't recall.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will place that in today's Record. But I think it is \nimportant. I feel a duty to put in the Record also that this parent \nfirm in Germany has just recently concluded a resolution of what \nappears to be a longstanding dispute about its record during World War \nII as it related to certain persons in the European area and the use of \nthem as forced labor during the war, which, unfortunately, was \nprevalent with a lot of German firms that have survived to this day.\n  Then just several hours ago I got a report that some evidence is \ncoming to the forefront--I will have to try to put this in the Record; \nI am sorry I don't have my papers, but I think it is important--that \nthe firm just paid a penalty to the U.S. Government for some \nsettlement, again, of a claim between the U.S. Government and this \nfirm.\n  But I say to my distinguished friend--and I have no better friend in \nthe Senate. Both of us served in World War II in the U.S. Navy. My \nservice was very modest, but I do remember that period of time very \nwell as a young 17-year-old sailor. I think it is important that at \nleast the Record state the facts. Then the people of the United States, \nparticularly those who served in World War II, and their families--\nbecause this memorial is as much a tribute to the families as it is to \nthose who served, particularly the families who lost their loved ones \nin that conflict.\n  As the Senator knows, there were over several hundred thousand who \nlost their lives. There were many, many more hundred thousands who \nsuffered wounds. Then, of course, the Senator remembers the tremendous \nunity here at home during that entire period between all citizens who \nserved their Nation in many ways.\n  But I just point this out. I think this Record should be complete. I \nfeel an obligation to do it. I do it out of respect for my colleague. \nBut I will put into the Record today additional facts relating to your \nstatement, Senator, because I think the Record should be complete, and \nthen the citizens simply have to make up their own mind on this. I do \nnot know that there is any action that can be taken or should be taken, \nbut the Record, in my judgment, should be complete.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. HELMS. I think the Record should be clear as to the German firm. \nI don't know anything about that. But the allegations were made about \nJ.A. Jones Construction Company, and it is that North Carolina firm \nthat I came to defend this afternoon.\n  I welcome anything that the distinguished Senator from Virginia, who \nhas been my friend for a long time, can add about the German firm. But \nI want the Record to be clear about J.A. Jones Construction Company. \nThat is the reason I came to the Senate Chamber this afternoon.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think it is important that you undertook \nthis because you do so not only out of loyalty to your State and to \nyour constituents, but, indeed, by your distinguished record in World \nWar II, having served in the Navy, and by your strong support \nthroughout your entire Senate career for all those who participated in \nmilitary conflict, and their families, and particularly for your \nsupport for this memorial.\n  I thank the Senator for the opportunity to engage in a colloquy with \nhim.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may have printed in the \nRecord certain additional material that could be pertinent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my good friend, so we will all know, our beloved \ncolleague, and former majority leader, Robert Dole, who has an \nextraordinary record of heroism in World War II, was, indeed, \ninstrumental in the building of this memorial; that is, raising the \nfunds and putting the infrastructure in place financially for this \nmemorial to go through. There are some hundred thousand dollars that \nhave been raised--almost all of it in the private sector. I was \npleased, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, to bring to the \nSenate an amendment of some $6 million of taxpayers funds which was \nincorporated into last year's authorization bill and appropriated to \nadd to the many hundreds of thousands of gifts contributed towards the \nbuilding of this memorial so as to raise the final total to the $100 \nmillion to allow construction to go forward.\n  So I say to my good friend from North Carolina, again, I feel an \nobligation, having instituted that funding requirement, and asking \ncolleagues to support--indeed, the Congress as a whole--I feel I have \nan obligation to put in the Record such facts as I know about this \ncase. And I will include a communication I have just received from \nSenator Dole which in many ways recites the history of the \ndistinguished firm to which you refer.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. HELMS. I say to the Senator, I commend you for the position you \nhave taken. And I join you in making clear all of the relevant facts \nabout this matter, specifically those involving the German firm.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. HELMS. But I want to separate the J.A. Jones Construction Company \nfrom that. Incidentally, I talked to Senator Dole right here on the \nfloor of the Senate last week about it. And it was he who called me to \nlook into the matter and to come here today.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague, and I appreciate \nthe forbearance of our distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, who \nhas been patiently waiting.\n\n[[Page S6383]]\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2001.\n     Hon.

Jones Reaffirms Long History of Supporting U.S. Military\n\n       Charlotte, NC, June 12, 2001.--J.A. Jones Construction Co., \n     whose subsidiary Tompkins Builders was chosen last week as \n     lead contractor for the prestigious World War II Memorial in \n     Washington, today reiterated its crucial role in supporting \n     the U.S. military and government during the company's 112-\n     year history.\n       Key contributions include:\n       The construction of nine American military bases that \n     trained U.S. troops for World War II.\n       The construction and operation of the Navy Shipyard in \n     Panama City, Fla., and the operation of the Navy Shipyard at \n     Brunswick, Ga. Between the two facilities, J.A. Jones \n     employees built more than 200 Liberty Class warships during \n     World War II.\n       Selection as one of the first American companies to work in \n     a war zone, constructing air bases and other facilities in \n     and around Saigon during the Vietnam War.\n       Construction of the Washington Mall Reflecting Pool, the \n     West Wing of the White House, the East Wing of the National \n     Gallery of Art, the East and West Fronts of the Capitol, the \n     Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, the Natural Museum of \n     History addition and renovation, and the National Gallery of \n     Art Sculpture.\n       The continued involvement in building and maintaining \n     military bases and facilities across the country.\n       The current reconstruction of the two U.S. Embassies in \n     Africa destroyed by terrorist bombings.\n       The following is a statement from John D. Bond III, \n     president of J.A. Jones Construction:\n       Let me make this as clear as I can make it: Anyone who \n     questions the patriotism of J.A. Jones Construction Co., its \n     employees, and our historical commitment to a free world, is \n     misguided and misinformed.\n       J.A. Jones' 112-year history is an important and classic \n     case study in corporate patriotism and dedication to a free \n     world. In the military buildup in the 1930s before the U.S.'s \n     involvement in World War II, J.A. Jones built nine military \n     bases, from the ground up, in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, \n     North Carolina and South Carolina. These bases provided \n     everything our troops needed to prepare for their crucial \n     role in saving the world.\n       During the war, J.A. Jones built and then operated the Navy \n     Shipyard in Panama City, Fla., and took over operations of \n     the Navy Shipyard at Brunswick, Ga. At these two crucial \n     locations, J.A. Jones employees build more than 200 Liberty \n     Class warships at an incredible rate of 12 per month. In 1943 \n     and 1944, workers donated their time on Christmas Day to \n     continue working and get the ships to the Allied and U.S. \n     Armed Forces who so desperately needed them to win the war.\n       Scores of J.A. Jones employees served in the war, including \n     Edwin Jones Jr., who would later become chairman of the \n     company after serving with the Marines and taking part in the \n     deadly fighting at Iwo Jima.\n       J.A. Jones' commitment to our nation and its men and women \n     in uniform has continued over the years. In Vietnam, J.A. \n     Jones was one of the first American companies to actually \n     work in a war zone when it built air bases and other \n     facilities in and around Saigon. J.A. Jones' close ties with \n     the U.S. military remain just as strong today as our \n     employees continue to build and manage bases and facilities \n     around the world.\n       In discussing the relationship between Philipp Holzmann and \n     J.A. Jones, it also is important to look at history. The two \n     companies first worked together in the mid-1970s on U.S. Army \n     Corps of Engineers projects in Saudi Arabia. J.A. Jones was \n     looking to expand its global presence, and Philipp Holzmann \n     saw potential in the U.S. Philipp Holzmann bought J.A. Jones \n     in 1979. Edwin Jones Jr., the World War II veteran who fought \n     at Iwo Jima, was chairman of J.A. Jones at the time of the \n     sale.\n       We are in fact a global economy. The very fact that Germany \n     has become a free capitalistic country and trusted American \n     ally is testament to the United States' and post-World War II \n     Allied commitment to rebuilding the free world. \n     Unfortunately, in the discussions of where the World War II \n     Memorial will be built and who will build it, we have lost \n     sight of the true purpose of this project: to honor the \n     veterans who saved the world. I believe the history of J.A. \n     Jones Construction and its people makes it the ideal choice \n     for the historic project.\n       I am extremely proud that J.A. Jones will play an important \n     role in the building of the World War II Memorial. When we \n     break ground this summer, I will be there with my father, who \n     was paratrooper in World War II, and my son, whose generation \n     must recognize and understand the sacrifices that America's \n     Greatest Generation made for freedom. I could not look either \n     of them in the eye if I had any question about J.A. Jones' \n     commitment to America and a free world.\n       Today, I can say unequivocally that no company is more \n     committed than J.A. Jones to the principles that have made \n     America the leader of the free world.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Statement of the American Battle Monuments Commission Regarding the \n  Construction Contract for the National WWII Memorial, June 11, 2001\n\n       The joint venture of Tompkins Builders and Grunley-Walsh \n     Construction was awarded a $56 million contract last week to \n     build the National World War II Memorial on the Mall in \n     Washington, D.C.\n       The award was made by the General Services Administration \n     (GSA), acting as agent for the American Battle Monuments \n     Commission (ABMC). The agency conducted the general \n     contractor procurement and selection under the GSA \n     Construction Excellence program.\n       The selection was based on price, experience on comparable \n     projects, and past performance. The evaluation of all these \n     factors allowed the government to select the offer\n\n[[Page S6384]]\n\n     representing the overall ``best value'' in terms of risk. \n     While price was not the sole factor considered, the joint \n     venture of Tompkins/Grunley-Walsh did submit the lowest \n     price.\n       Tompkins Builders, an American company established in the \n     District of Columbia in 1911, is the third largest general \n     contractor in the Washington Metropolitan area. The company \n     has earned a reputation for quality construction.\n       Tompkins is owned by J.A. Jones Construction Company, a \n     subsidiary of J.A. Jones, Inc., which is an American company \n     founded in 1890 in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n       J.A. Jones, Inc., in turn, is owned by the Philipp Holzmann \n     Company, a large German construction firm. In today's global \n     economy, international ownership relationships are common. \n     Three of the five largest construction companies in America \n     are foreign-owned.\n       Neither ABMC nor GSA has the authority to discriminate \n     against American firms based upon the nationality of parent \n     or grandparent corporations. Moreover, such discrimination \n     would be inconsistent with the principles for which the WWII \n     generation sacrificed.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 13, 2001]\n\n         Global Conspiracy on Construction Bids Defrauded U.S.\n\n                          (By Kurt Eichenwald)\n\n       A group of international construction companies defrauded \n     the American government out of tens of millions of dollars \n     earmarked for Egyptian water projects undertaken as part of \n     the Camp David peace accords, according to government \n     officials and court documents.\n       One participant in the wide-ranging conspiracy, a unit of \n     ABB Ltd., the Swiss engineering giant, pleaded guilty \n     yesterday to its role in the scheme, agreeing to pay $63 \n     million in fines and restitution.\n       The conspiracy, which lasted more than seven years, \n     involved the rigging of contract bids submitted in the late \n     1980's and early 1990's to the United States Agency for \n     International Development, which was financing Egyptian water \n     projects that resulted from the Middle East peace accords \n     reached during the Carter administration.\n       Contracts were supposed to be awarded through competitive \n     bidding. But the construction companies subverted the process \n     through payments of bribes and kickbacks to other possible \n     bidders, fraudulent billing to the government and the \n     laundering of cash through Swiss bank accounts, court records \n     in related cases show.\n       The conspirators included at least six international \n     construction companies, which collectively referred to \n     themselves as the Frankfurt Group, according to people \n     briefed on the case. At the time of the bidding, the \n     companies were either American or American subsidiaries of \n     European concerns. The name of the group came from the fact \n     that some of the largest companies were based in Frankfurt.\n       The investigation of the conspiracy began almost six years \n     ago, after a top financial officer at one company noticed a \n     series of improper wire transfers and other transactions. \n     That executive then brought those matters to the attention of \n     the Justice Department, which has been investigating ever \n     since.\n       According to court records, companies involved in the \n     conspiracy were able to obtain profits of as much as 60 \n     percent on the Egyptian water projects--a return that would \n     be almost certainly impossible to obtain under competitive \n     bidding. Indeed, some of the companies went to great lengths \n     to hide their profits, charging fictitious expenses from \n     related companies to decrease the returns shown on their \n     books.\n       All told, about a dozen contracts have been awarded under \n     the program, totaling more than $1 billion. To date, three \n     contracts have been found to involve fraud, and the others \n     remain under investigation.\n       The investigation has already resulted in two other guilty \n     pleas, entered last fall by other construction companies. But \n     until yesterday the full scope and implications of the \n     criminal investigation were not publicly known.\n       In the plea entered yesterday in Federal District Court in \n     Birmingham, Ala., ABB Middle East and Africa Participations \n     A.G., a Milan-based subsidiary of the engineering company, \n     admitted to taking part in a conspiracy to rig the bid for a \n     project known as Contract 29. The original participant in the \n     conspiracy was SAE Sadelmi USA, another ABB subsidiary, which \n     was based in North Brunswick, N.J., and later became part of \n     the Milan subsidiary.\n       Under the terms of the illegal agreement, the ABB unit met \n     with other potential bidders on Contract 29 and agreed to pay \n     them $3.4 million to submit inflated bids for the project. \n     The ABB unit was then able to inflate its own bid on the \n     project, knowing the offer would still beat other \n     submissions. The value of the awarded contract, which was to \n     pay for building a wastewater treatment plant in Abu Rawash, \n     Egypt, was about $135 million.\n       ``Although the construction work that is the subject of \n     this case was performed on foreign shores, the U.S. \n     government paid the bill and the U.S. taxpayers were the \n     victims of the scheme,'' John M. Nannes, acting assistant \n     attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's \n     Antitrust Division, said in a statement.\n       An ABB spokesman, William Kelly, said the company had been \n     cooperating with investigators since 1996, and first learned \n     that it was a target of the inquiry last fall. He said the \n     crimes were conducted by a small group of employees, all of \n     whom have since left the company for reasons unrelated to the \n     case.\n       ``We deplore and deeply regret the behavior that led to \n     these charges,'' Mr. Kelly said. ``It stands in sharp \n     contrast to the high standard of business ethics practiced by \n     the great majority of ABB employees.'' He added that in the \n     year since the bid rigging occurred, ABB has expanded \n     internal compliance programs ``to let employees at all levels \n     know that ABB has zero tolerance for illegal or unethical \n     business behavior.''\n       According to court records in related civil cases, the $3.4 \n     million payment was made to an unincorporated joint venture \n     formed by Bill Harbert International Construction, based in \n     Birmingham, and the J.A. Jones Construction Company, a \n     Charlotte, N.C., subsidiary of Philipp Holzman A.G. of \n     Frankfurt.\n       Phillipp Holzman pleaded guilty to a criminal complaint \n     filed under seal last August. A spokesman for Harbert did not \n     return a telephone call.\n       According to court filings by the government in related \n     cases, the Jones-Harbert venture was at the center of other \n     bid-rigging efforts involving the Egyptian water projects. \n     For example, American International Contractors Inc., a \n     construction company based in Arlington, Va., and owned by \n     the Archirodon Group of Geneva, pleaded guilty last September \n     to accepting payments in exchange for a commitment not to bid \n     on a project known as Contract 20A. That contract was awarded \n     to the Jones-Harbert joint venture, court records show.\n       Indeed, irregularities in Contract 20A led to the discovery \n     of the broader bid-rigging scheme. The irregularities were \n     first discovered by Richard F. Miller, who worked first as a \n     controller and then as treasurer of Jones from 1986 through \n     1996.\n       During the course of his work, Mr. Miller discovered a \n     series of improper transactions involving the joint venture \n     with Harbert, and pieced together that a bid-rigging scheme \n     had been used in Contract 20A, a $107 million sewer project \n     in Cairo.\n       Among the evidence eventually discovered by Mr. Miller, \n     according to court records from a federal whistle-blower suit \n     he filed, were wire transfers for $3.35 million from the \n     joint venture to a related company for fictitious \n     ``preconstruction costs.''\n       The most complex transaction, according to the court \n     records, was a bogus ``sale-leaseback'' arrangement involving \n     a Jones-related company called Sabbia. Under the terms of the \n     deal, Sabbia was to purchase the construction equipment for \n     the project, then lease it back to the joint venture.\n       Yet while $14.4 million in lease payments were sent to \n     Sabbia, the $4 million to purchase the equipment was never \n     paid by that company. Instead, according to court records and \n     lawyers involved in the case, that money remained in a Swiss \n     bank account and was used as a fund to disburse payments to \n     other co-conspirators.\n       ``This was an example of a transaction that was done to \n     reduce the apparent profitability of Contract 20A,'' said \n     Robert Bell, a lawyer from Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering who is \n     representing Mr. Miller in his whistle-blower suit. ``If you \n     skim almost $15 million off the top, it's easier to make it \n     look like the joint venture wasn't making all that much \n     money.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout the legislation which is due to come to this Chamber tomorrow. I \nthought it might be useful to focus on a Dear Colleague letter which I \nsent out last week, which reads as follows:\n\n       A key point of controversy on legislation now pending in \n     the Senate is whether patients will be permitted to collect \n     damages from insurance companies without a statutory \n     limitation. Under more than 200 years of common law \n     precedents, a harmed plaintiff has been able to recover \n     compensation as set by a jury for economic losses and pain \n     and suffering when a defendant is negligent and punitive \n     damages for gross, malicious or intentional misconduct.\n       The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy Bill, of which I am a co-\n     sponsor, provides for Federal court jurisdiction on the issue \n     of whether a claim is covered by the contractual provisions \n     of a health care plan and for state court jurisdiction on \n     medical malpractice claims.\n       Serious concerns have been raised to that bill because of a \n     history of very high verdicts in state courts on personal \n     injury claims which could significantly raise the cost of \n     health care in the United States. There is substantial \n     experience that Federal court trials result in a more \n     reasoned and judicious result in malpractice cases.\n       I intend to offer a compromise amendment which would \n     maintain Federal court jurisdiction under McCain-Edwards-\n     Kennedy for coverage claims (which have also been referred to \n     as quantity or eligibility decisions) and extend Federal \n     court jurisdiction, excluding state court jurisdiction, on \n     medical\n\n[[Page S6385]]\n\n     malpractice claims (which have also been referred to as \n     quality or treatment decisions) which would preserve \n     plaintiffs' traditional common law remedies in a more \n     reasoned judicial setting.\n\n  The consequences of ERISA have been extremely complicated. Enacted in \nthe early 1970s, it has been held in many, many cases to bar plaintiffs \nfrom recovering for personal injuries. Cases brought under ERISA, \nsection 502, are governed by the doctrine of complete preemption, which \napplies when Congress so completely preempts a particular area of law \nthat any civil complaint raising this select group of claims is \nnecessarily Federal in character.\n  Under section 514, a plaintiff's claim is barred if the claim relates \nto an employee benefit plan. If a plaintiff's claim does not relate to \nan employee benefit plan, then the claim is not barred and is heard in \nState courts. There is a growing line of cases finding that State \ncauses of action, States' Patients' Bill of Rights, do not relate to an \nemployee benefit plan and, therefore, are not preempted if they address \nthe quality of services to be provided.\n  There have been many cases in this complicated field, and they are \nreferred to by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in a case \ndecided slightly less than a year ago on June 20, 2000, in a case \ncaptioned Aetna Health Plans of Texas, Inc., v. the Texas Department of \nInsurance. There the Fifth Circuit noted that the courts have \n``repeatedly struggled with the open-ended character of the preemption \nprovisions of ERISA'' and also the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nAct.\n  The Fifth Circuit goes on to say:\n\n       The courts have faithfully followed the Supreme Court's \n     broad reading of ``relate to'' preemption under 502(a), in \n     its opinions decided during the first twenty years after \n     ERISA's enactment. Since then, in a trilogy of cases, the \n     [Supreme] Court has confronted the reality that if ``relate \n     to'' is taken to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy, \n     preemption will never run its course, ``for really universal \n     relations stop nowhere.''\n\n  There has been a succinct summary of the key issues raised by ERISA \npreemption in a case decided earlier this year on March 27, 2001, by \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, captioned \nPryzbowski v. United States Health Care Incorporated. In Pryzbowski, \nthe court noted prior Third Circuit opinions where the court \ndistinguished between claims directed to the quality of the benefits \nthe plaintiff received versus claims that the plans erroneously \nwithheld benefits, that is, claims that seek to enforce plaintiff's \nrights under the terms of their respective plans or to clarify their \nrights to future benefits. In Pryzbowski the Third Circuit went on to \nsay that:\n\n       We stated that claims that merely attack the quality of \n     benefits do not fall within the scope of section 502(a)'s \n     enforcement provisions and are not completely preempted, \n     whereas claims challenging the quantum of benefits due under \n     an ERISA-regulated plan are completely preempted under \n     section 502(a)'s civil enforcement scheme.\n\n  The Third Circuit then went on to note:\n\n       Though the quality-quantity distinction was helpful in \n     those cases, we have acknowledged that the distinction would \n     not always be clear.\n\n  From Pryzbowski and other cases, it is apparent that if a Patients' \nBill of Rights is enacted which gives the Federal courts jurisdiction \nover the scope of the plan, or the so-called quantity decision, and the \nState courts jurisdiction over the quality or the treatment decision, \nthen there will be a plethora of nearly endless litigation as to what \nbelongs in which court. The court decisions are replete with cases \nwhere the facts have been analyzed. It is frequently very difficult to \ndistinguish between the two categories, quantity or quality, and it \noften ends up with the case remanded for other facts to be determined.\n  It is my suggestion that the Federal court retain total jurisdiction \nover both category of cases, whether they are the quantity decisions, \nwhich relate to eligibility decisions, or the quality decisions, which \nrelate to treatment decisions. My suggestion is that it would be much \npreferable to have exclusive jurisdiction vested in the Federal courts.\n  There is considerable concern about excessive verdicts in State \ncourts when contrasted with the more judicious decisions in the Federal \ncourts. What my compromise suggests is that by giving exclusive \njurisdiction to the Federal courts, traditional plaintiff's damage \nclaims could be retained without so-called caps or limitations.\n  There has been enormous concern about what would happen if the \nPatients' Bill of Rights refers to the State courts these medical \nmalpractice cases without any limitation on damages.\n\n  Last year, the Judiciary Committee considered amending diversity \njurisdiction in class action cases because diversity jurisdiction was \nso easily defeated when a class of plaintiffs would sue a defendant. If \nthere was a single plaintiff residing in the same State as the \ndefendant, then diversity was defeated.\n  This legislation, which amended diversity jurisdiction and was passed \nout of the Judiciary Committee, was sought by so many defendants who \nfelt unfairly treated by State court decisions. The report of the \nJudiciary Committee on the Class Action Fairness Act of 2000 (S.R. 106-\n420) contains some statements which are relevant to consideration of \nhaving medical malpractice cases tried solely in the Federal courts \nrather than the State courts.\n  This is what the Judiciary Committee report said at page 15:\n\n       The ability of plaintiffs' lawyers to evade Federal \n     diversity jurisdiction has helped spur a dramatic increase in \n     the number of class actions litigated in State courts--an \n     increase that is stretching the resources of the State court \n     systems.\n\n  Then on page 16, the Judiciary Committee majority report goes on to \npoint out the concern of unfairness in State court actions saying:\n\n       The Committee finds, however, that one reason for the \n     dramatic explosion of class actions in State courts is that \n     some State court judges are less careful than their Federal \n     court counterparts about applying the procedural requirements \n     that govern class actions. Many State court judges are lax \n     about following the strict requirements of rule 23 (or the \n     State's governing rule), which are intended to protect the \n     due process rights of both unnamed class members and \n     defendants. In contrast, Federal courts generally do \n     scrutinize proposed settlements much more carefully and pay \n     closer attention to the procedural requirements for \n     certifying a matter for class treatment.\n\n  Then the Judiciary Committee majority report goes on at page 17 to \npoint out:\n\n       A second abuse that is common in State courts class actions \n     is the use of the class device as ``judicial blackmail.'' \n     Because class actions are such a powerful tool, they can give \n     a class attorney unbounded leverage. Such leverage can \n     essentially force corporate defendants to pay ransom to class \n     attorneys by settling--rather than litigating--frivolous \n     lawsuits.\n\n  The majority report then goes on to say:\n\n       State court judges often are inclined to certify cases for \n     class action treatment not because they believe a class trial \n     would be more efficient than an individual trial, but because \n     they believe class certification will simply induce the \n     defendant to settle the case without trial.\n\n  Now, in citing these references to the Judiciary Committee report, I \ndo not seek to impugn all State court judges because most State court \njudges are careful and judicious and follow settled principles. But \nthere have been a considerable number of these certifications of class \nactions, and there have been many cases which involve forum shopping, \njudge shopping, which seek to go to specific counties or specific \nStates where there are excessive verdicts.\n  By contrast, the Federal courts have an established reputation where \nthere is different selection of judges. In many States, judges are \nelected--my own State of Pennsylvania. Here, again, I am not intending \nany broad condemnation, but in the Federal courts, where judges are \nselected for life tenure, it is fair to say that the caliber of the \njudiciary is superior. That, again, is a generalization.\n  Again, there are many fine State court judges. But the experience in \nthe State courts, as illustrated by this class action report, gives \ngrave concern to many who are worried that if the Patients' Bill of \nRights is enacted and there are unlimited damages possible in State \ncourt (medical malpractice cases), which is now the provision under the \nMcCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, that there will be widespread abuses. \nThose same concerns are not found with respect to these malpractice \ncases in the Federal courts.\n\n[[Page S6386]]\n\n  We are about to enter on to a difficult and protracted debate on a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. It is my view, and has been, as reflected in \nthe votes I have cast on the Senate floor for several years now, that \nAmerica needs a Patients' Bill of Rights and that the traditional \nremedies not be capped or limited. But a good tradeoff, in my judgment, \nwould be that exclusive jurisdiction would be vested in the Federal \ncourts. This is not really a problem for plaintiffs of ``forum non \nconveniens''--the Latin phrase which means an inconvenient court--\nbecause there are underlying Federal questions on ERISA. And even when \ncases are brought in the State court, invariably, they end up on \nremoval actions in the Federal court. When you start to try to make \ndistinctions under ERISA 502, ERISA 514, trying to distinguish between \nthe quantity of coverage versus the quality of coverage, they \nnecessarily overlap; and it will be a saving of judicial resources if \nall of those cases are heard in the Federal court. I ask my colleagues \nto consider this.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this time that the full text of my Dear \nColleague letter, dated June 13, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 13, 2001.\n       Dear Colleague: A key point of controversy on legislation \n     now pending in the Senate is whether patients will be \n     permitted to collect damages from insurance companies without \n     a statutory limitation.

My staff and I \n     are available to respond to questions and to amplify the \n     details of this proposed compromise since this is a \n     simplified statement on complex legal issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair for sitting late. It is not easy to \ncome in on a Monday afternoon. The distinguished Senator from Utah, a \nsenior Republican on the Judiciary Committee, has performed \nextraordinary service. I thought it not unfitting that I should cite \nhis report on class action cases since he was the author of those \npearls of wisdom I quoted.\n  I believe that concludes our business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
