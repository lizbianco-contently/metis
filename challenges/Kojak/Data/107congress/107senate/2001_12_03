We do not need to brief \nYou on the alternative possibilities for this week's decisions, for You \nalready know what is in keeping with Your best for us and will reveal \nthat if we ask You. What we do need is to linger in Your presence until \nwe are assured of Your love, regain true security, and are refortified \nby Your strength. Thank You for using this time of prayer with You to \nshow us Your faithfulness and to receive Your guidance.\n  In Scripture, You call us to pray for the peace of Jerusalem. We do \nthat this afternoon with the vivid pictures of the mall terrorist \nattack: jarring explosions, heart-breaking deaths and injuries, and the \nwail of sirens. Grant us Your strength in the battle with the evil of \nterrorism.

Mr. President, the order before the Senate is that until \nquarter to 5 today, we are going to spend time talking about matters \nbefore the Senate. The two issues about which we are going to vote deal \nnot with the railroad retirement, but rather with a moratorium on \ncloning and, in addition to that, legislation dealing with energy.\n  The Presiding Officer, of course, has spent a good part of his life, \nespecially the last several months, coming up with legislation on \nenergy for this country.\n  I have worked with the Presiding Officer in his capacity as chairman \nof the Energy Committee on a number of occasions. Of course, I, as most \neveryone else in the Senate, am impressed with his ability to \nunderstand issues.\n  Rather than moving forward on legislation in the normal fashion, we \nare now going to deal with this issue in a piecemeal fashion.\n  The majority leader has said we should have a full and complete \ndebate on this issue. He has stated we could take this matter up before \nthe month of February of next year, but prior to the President's Day \nrecess. We would have a debate, have the legislation before the Senate, \nhave the Republicans' proposal and the Democrats' proposal, and move \nforward on this legislation in the normal manner.\n  It appears they cannot take yes for an answer. They have said they \nwant a definite time. The majority leader said they have that definite \ntime. It is clear this is not an effort to get an energy bill, but \nrather to slow down what we are trying to do; namely, the railroad \nretirement bill.\n  I think everyone in the country acknowledges we should have an energy \npolicy and that is why we should have a time set aside to do an energy \nbill, but I am sorry to say this appears to be an effort to kill \nsomething that is extremely important to lots of people in America \ntoday; that is, management and labor on the railroad retirement bill.\n  In an effort to save face for the 74 people who have cosponsored \nthis, a number of people are saying: We like the railroad retirement \nbill, but not now; we will do it some other time.\n  Remember, it has passed the House. I believe the vote in the House \nwas 380 in favor and a few against. In the Senate, we have 74 \ncosponsors. This should be a lesson on how to move legislation, but it \nis a lesson on how not to move legislation. So I certainly hope we can \nmove forward on the railroad retirement bill, get rid of this \nextraneous material at the earliest possible date.\n  I oppose the Lott amendment for a variety of reasons. I will focus \nfor a moment on the issue of jobs. We have heard some Senators speak \nabout the job implications of drilling for oil in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge. I understand, without any question, Senator Murkowski \nand how important he believes this is for his State. It is important \nfor his State because there is no question that drilling in ANWR would \ncreate jobs. That is important for Alaska, which really needs jobs. The \nother oil they have is winding down, and they want not only the ongoing \njobs with the oil they have, with any field that has been demonstrated, \nbut also the exploration and development would mean thousands of jobs.\n  I appreciate Senator Murkowski feeling about this the way he does, \nbut in spite of his strong feelings, it is still wrong. As I have \nindicated, the railroad employees and the unions and management oppose \nthe Lott amendment. I will list a few examples of those unions. We \ncould have other organizations also who oppose the Lott amendment. For \nexample, we have lots and lots of environmental groups. I do not think \nthere is an environmental group in America that supports what Senator \nLott and Senator Murkowski are trying to do.\n  My friend from Alaska, the distinguished junior Senator, has given \nthe impression organized labor wants this in the worst way, but these \nare the unions that oppose the Lott amendment: The Association of \nAmerican Railroads opposes the Lott amendment; American Shortline and \nRegional Railroad Association; Family Railroad Organization; National \nAssociation of Retired Veteran Railway Employees; American Train \nDispatchers; Boilermakers and Blacksmiths; International Brotherhood of \nLocomotive Engineers; Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen; Firemen and \nOilers; Service Employees International Union, known as the SEIU; Hotel \nEmployees; Restaurants Employees; International Association of \nMachinists; International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; \nIronworkers Union; Seafarers International Union; Sheetmetal Workers \nInternational; Transportation Communications International Union; \nTransport Workers Union; United Transportation Union. Each of these \nunions is urging the Senate to vote against the Lott cloture motion on \namendment No. 2171 which adds energy and cloning legislation to the \nrailroad retirement bill. They know if this is attached, the bill is \ndead.\n\n  Some argue opening up ANWR to oil development would be a great \neconomic stimulus. As we know, the job numbers thrown around have been \ngrossly exaggerated. CRS estimates job creation from ANWR might be \nabout 60,000, but could go higher than that. Again, this assumes jobs \nare not shifted from the Gulf of Mexico or the Rocky Mountain region.\n  I agree, however, that creating jobs is very important given that our \ncountry has been in recession since March. As I noted last week, there \nare better ways to create jobs than by exploring, and some say \nexploiting, the National Wildlife Refuge.\n  For example, construction of an arctic natural gas pipeline would \ncreate\n\n[[Page S12277]]\n\nbetween 350,000 to 400,000 jobs in steel production, pipe \nmanufacturing, trucking and shipping, and construction jobs for 3 to 4 \nyears assembling the pipe. This pipeline would be a mammoth project, \nrequiring four times as much steel as used for all the cars produced \nglobally in 1999.\n  The potential natural gas resources could supply the American market \nfor 50 to 60 years as compared to the oil from ANWR which might yield 6 \nmonths' worth of America's petroleum supply.\n  There are other reasons, all of which are good, to oppose the energy \nprovisions in the Lott amendment--and we are going to vote on this \nmatter very shortly--but there is no reason to sacrifice the financial \nsecurity of these retirees who have an interest in the railroad \nretirement bill--not only the retirees but the widows who would \nbenefit.\n  Sadly, those who are pushing the Lott amendment are working against \nthe hard-working Americans who have retired from the railroads around \nour country and, of course, the widows of those hard-working railroad \nworkers. So I hope we will defeat soundly the Lott amendment.\n  Also, I have mentioned the provision dealing with the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge. I was in Las Vegas over the weekend, and somebody I \nhad not seen in several decades, somebody I used to go to high school \nwith, came up to me. We had not seen each other but, I, of course, \nrecognized him in a second: Claude, how are you? He said: I am fine.\n  I know his family. It is a very conservative family. He said: I want \nyou to know you have to do everything you can to make sure we can go \nforward with therapeutic cloning. Those were his words. Stem cell \nresearch.\n  Why did he care? Because he has two diabetic children, and it is \ngenetic; he believes there is hope. He is someone who has worked with \nhis hands all his life and does not have a scientific mind. His hope \ncomes from his heart, but hope is coming from the minds of people who \nare scientists. They believe therapeutic cloning could be the \nbreakthrough for diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and many of these \nother dread diseases.\n  If we could find a cure for the three diseases I mentioned, not only \nwould it be the right thing to do for the families and the individuals \nwith these diseases, but it would also be an economic boon to this \ncountry that would be unsurpassed. That people are in institutions \nbecause of Alzheimer's is really a drag on the economy of this country.\n  So I hope there will be a resounding vote to make sure we do not go \nforward on this legislation attached regarding ANWR and cloning. I am \nin favor of therapeutic cloning.\n  Maybe the word is wrong, ``cloning.'' We had scientists who came and \ntalked to us last Thursday. Maybe it is the wrong use of words, but \nthat is what has developed in the vernacular we are using. Scientists \nbelieve they need to go forward so they can do the stem cell research \nunfettered. Frankly, if we do not do it, it is going to happen \nsomeplace else anyway. Other countries are going to do it. So we who \nlead the world in scientific endeavors should make sure we also lead \nthe endeavors regarding therapeutic cloning.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we focused on the energy bill the \nRepublicans put forth and on ANWR, but there are other problems with \nthe bill. Time is short and we cannot spend too much time on it. For \nexample, one of the things that bill does not have included is vehicle \nfuel efficiency. It failed to provide an increase in fuel efficiency \nstandards for light trucks, sport utility vehicles, and minivans. I \nthink it should provide additional standards for passenger automobiles \nin general.\n  Dealing with just light trucks, sport utility vehicles, and minivans, \nthe provisions would reduce overall national gasoline usage by 1 \npercent. Closing the SUV loophole would substantially reduce air \npollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and save consumers billions at the \ngas pump each year. The current standard established in 1989 is 27.5 \nmiles for passenger automobiles, sports utility vehicles, SUVs, and \nminivans. A much larger increase in fuel efficiency would be paid for. \nI have no doubt that is the case in future fuel savings. That is \nsomething not addressed in the bill.\n  Also in the bill they provide $33.5 billion over 10 years in tax \nbreaks for electric utilities and oil and natural gas exploration. No \noffset was provided for the additional tax breaks, and only 17 percent \nis for energy efficiency and 83 percent for fossil fuels and nuclear \npower. While from a strict policy standpoint this is not good, from the \nsense that we need not give them any more tax breaks than they have, \neven if you disagree with that statement, you should be concerned about \nthe fact there is no offset for the tax breaks. Further, over 10 years, \nthis is adding $33.5 billion in deficit spending for our country.\n  We have to be very careful. There are many problems with this \nlegislation. It is more than the arctic wilderness. We have focused on \nthat. They are weakening environmental protections and drilling in \nnational forests. There are a number of things we cannot lose sight of \nthat include more than just the national arctic wilderness.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask during this quorum call that the time be charged \nequally against both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we continue to hear in the Senate a \npowerful argument put forth by the assistant majority leader. Yet I am \nstruck by the idea the Railroad Retirement Act under consideration now \nis a given. There are 70 cosponsors on that piece of legislation; I am \none of the cosponsors. Yet we are also denied the ability to move an \nenergy policy act that the Nation is demanding, as well as a stimulus \npackage which, again, the Nation favors.\n  I challenge my colleagues and Americans by asking why just a few can \ndeny a State such as Alaska its ability to develop and market its own \nnatural resources, not only for the good of the economy of Alaska but \nalso at a time when this Nation's economy is struggling and it would \ncontribute to the rebuilding of that economy. I find that \ndisheartening. This is important.\n  The season of Christmas is fast approaching. We should be finishing \nup our work. There are two things that have to be done: Finish the \nappropriations process to run this Government, and also develop an \nappropriation for our military in a time we are at war. By the way, \nthis is a war that will not be won at Camp Pendleton, Fort Bragg, or \nany other military installation, but will be won in every community \naround this country. Yet the military now is carrying the load to \ndestroy the core of terrorism.\n  Why deny those resources when just across the border, in the tundra--\nand one must remember, this is not a pristine wilderness when we talk \nabout ANWR, as one might envision wilderness in my State of Montana \nwhere we already have 3.5 million acres. This is tundra. It runs for \nmiles and miles and\n\n[[Page S12278]]\n\nmiles. It can be developed to the advantage of this country and to its \neconomy without disturbing hardly anything that far north.\n\n  At a time when the national economy is struggling, if you can provide \nany kind of a job, anything that would contribute to the rebuilding of \nthat economy and the infrastructure of it, that should not be denied.\n  What do we hear? We hear how much we need an energy policy, but we \nsee no action in the Senate. We hear the speeches about a stimulus \npackage, yet no action is forthcoming. We talk about conservation. It \nhas been a foregone conclusion of the task force that was put together \nunder the chairmanship of the Vice President, when they look at our \nenergy situation and assess it, that they will conclude we should then \ntake the proper actions so we can rely on our own ability to provide \nthe energy for our country. The conclusion was drawn that we cannot \nconserve our way out of this one.\n  This past weekend, I looked at the area with probably the greatest \nutilization of wind power that we have in this country. Yet it only \ncontributes less than 1 percent to the Nation's need for electricity. \nThat will not work.\n  I can tell you what spurs conservation faster and more efficiently \nthan any rule, law, or regulation that the Government could impose: \nHigh prices. All you have to do is ask those who live in California. \nThat is what spurs conservation. That is what spurs the imagination and \nthe inventiveness of this society. When the cost goes high from the \nlack of a supply of energy, that spurs us to deal with it.\n  So I say, yes, maybe the unions oppose the Lott amendment. They would \nnot oppose the Lott amendment if it was a stand-alone, though. It just \nhappens to be on a railroad retirement act. That act has the support of \nover 70 Senators in this body.\n  So I challenge my colleagues and I challenge Americans, when Canada \ndevelops their energy supply and a way to deliver it to their people, \nkeeping their energy costs so low that they are a very strong \ncompetitor in the global market, are we denied that? We have to look at \nourselves and say, why? Based on science? I do not think so. Based on \ntechnology? I know that is not true. So we have to conclude the reasons \nlie in other areas.\n  As we hear this debate about going forward, I want Americans to \nunderstand and realize this about the development of our energy \nresources. Conservation as we defined it and as it has always been \ndefined is the wise use of a natural resource. Why can't this move \nforward? It would but for a few who are opposed because of other \nreasons, other than science and technology.\n  So I hope the Lott amendment can be approved and we can move forward \non this issue, finish our work on appropriations, finish our work on \nthe stimulus, and go home for the holidays. I know there are those who \nwant to go home a little bit earlier. I am not one of those who say we \nshould leave with our work undone because the last time I looked, I \nthink I get a check for the month of December. So we might as well work \nif that be the choice of this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/03/senate-section/article/S12278-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12278-S12279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RAILROAD RETIREMENT REFORM\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nRailroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act. This is good, \ncommon sense legislation that will lower the program's costs and \nprovide greatly improved benefits to thousands of Utahns and hundreds \nof thousands of Americans who are spending or have spent their working \ncareers in the railroad industry.\n  With an impressive 73 Members joining Senator Baucus and me as \ncosponsors of this bill, and a vote on passage of 384-to-33 in the \nHouse earlier this year, this legislation enjoys tremendous support of \nour colleagues in both Chambers and on both sides of the aisle.\n  Other supporters of this bill have already spoken at length about the \nfeatures of the bill, so I would like to focus my remarks today on \nresponding to some of the criticisms made last week by a few of our \ncolleagues who oppose this legislation.\n  Specifically, during last week's debate on this bill, my colleague \nand friend, the senior Senator from Texas, spoke at length about what \nhe refers to as the ``pilfering'' of the Railroad Retirement Account \nthat he alleged would take place under this bill. While I agree \nwholeheartedly with the Senator on some of his statements, I could not \ndisagree more with his suggestion that this legislation is some kind of \nunderhanded attempt at wrongdoing by the retirees, workers, and \nemployers in this industry.\n  Let me first make clear that I agree with the Senator in his \nconviction that vast improvements would be made by changing the rules \nfor the investment of Railroad Retirement assets. Because of the long-\nstanding requirement that those assets can only be invested in \nGovernment securities, the railroad industry's retirement plan has been \nfar less efficient than those in other industries.\n  As a result, the rail industry's contributions to its pension plan \nare far higher than in other industries. This legislation would \neliminate that limitation and allow the investment of assets in the \nstock market, as well as in Government securities. Senator Gramm has \nstated that this would be a good change, and I am of the same mind. I \nagree with him on that.\n  I am also in full agreement with the Senator when he said that the \nassets of the Railroad Retirement system are the pension contributions \nof rail workers, retirees, and employers, as well as the earnings on \nthose contributions. However, I am perplexed when Senator Gramm alleges \nthat, under this bill, these contributors would be ``pilfering'' their \nown contributions.\n  I also take exception to the suggestion that the use of the increased \ninvestment returns projected under this bill is inappropriate. Because \nRailroad Retirement account balances will be less under this \nlegislation than they would under current law, even with greater \ninvestment returns, Senator Gramm concludes that there must be \n``pilfering'' going on. This analysis is highly misleading.\n  It assumes that the all balances projected under current law are \nnecessary for the fiscal health of the system, and that anything less \nwill subject the system to great peril. The reality is that, while \naccount balances will decrease for a time under the new legislation, \nthe Railroad Retirement Account is projected by the Railroad Retirement \nactuary to remain solvent for the next 75 years.\n  Last Friday, Senator Gramm used a chart that helped tell the story \nthat he wanted to tell. It was a very nice chart, but the chart was \nsomewhat truncated and failed to give the full picture. Let's look at \nwhy reducing the long term build up is neither ``pilfering'' or bad \nbusiness economics.\n  As you can see, this is the trust balance that will remain strong \nunder the Railroad Retirement program.\n  Under current law, the Railroad Retirement Board actuary projects \nthat the fund balance by 2074--this red line on the top--will grow to \n$702.8 billion as of 2074 under Employment Assumption II. Benefit \nobligations for that year would be approximately $15 billion. This is a \nratio of trust fund reserves to benefits of almost 47 years of \nbenefits. No wonder the industry wants to develop a more rational \nfunding approach.\n  Let me point you to chart No. 2.\n  Under Employment Assumption I, the more optimistic of the two \nassumptions most typically used to measure the system, the point gets \neven more dramatic. In this case, the actuary projects that the fund \nbalance by 2074 will grow to $1.5 trillion. That is trillion with a \n``T.''\n  Benefit obligations under this more optimistic employment assumption \nwould increase, of course--more workers equals more retirees. The \nbenefit obligation grows to approximately $21 billion. Under this \nemployment assumption, the ratio of reserves to benefits expands to \nmore than 71 times. Again, it is no surprise why the industry is \nworking to develop a more rationale funding approach.\n  As you can see by the blue line, if we pass this legislation, this \nwould be the balance under the current legislation--the balance that we \nwould be getting under this compared to current law, which means the \nretirees would not be\n\n[[Page S12279]]\n\ngetting nearly the benefit, nor will the industry be getting nearly the \nbenefit than they could with a more rational, meaningful approach \ntowards a pension.\n  Now, why would these balances be adequate but lower than now \nprojected, if we passed this bill? Is it because of ``pilfering?'' No, \nit is because the bill provides for modest, judicious tax cuts and \noverdue improvements in retiree benefits.\n  Under current law, the rail industry contributes three times more to \nRailroad Retirement than employers in other industries contribute to \nretirement programs. Under current law, widows of retirees have their \nbenefits reduced by two-thirds upon the death of their spouses. Under \ncurrent law, rail employees must wait 10 years to vest rather than the \nusual 5 or even 3 years common in other industries.\n  This legislation would simply reduce payroll taxes on rail employers \nto bring its contributions more in line with other industries--although \nat more than 13 percent it would still be much higher than the funding \nlevels of other industries--and make improvements in vesting, early \nretirement and widows' benefits.\n  Under this bill, unnecessary, enormous surpluses that would occur \nunder current law, indicated by the red line, would be avoided, while \nmaintaining more than adequate reserves in the system, which would be \nwhat this bill will do while taking care of widows, among others. The \nindustry has long been recognized as the most capital intensive \ncomponent of the industrial segment of the U.S. economy, according to \nstudies done by sources ranging from Fortune Magazine to the Department \nof Commerce. Under this legislation, the industry would be better able \nto deploy its scarce investment capital.\n  Senator Gramm and others have repeatedly asserted that the Railroad \nRetirement system will run out of money if this bill is adopted and the \nGovernment will have to make up the shortfall. As I mentioned a moment \nago, the Railroad Retirement actuary has reviewed this bill and found \nthat under it, as under current law, the system is solvent over the \nnext 75 years under both Assumption I and Assumption II. The \nassumptions behind this projection were accepted by the CBO which used \nthem for its analysis.\n  Moreover, the bill provides, for the first time, an automatic tax \nschedule that will raise taxes on rail employers if pension fund \nreserves drop below 4 years of benefits. This will require no action by \nCongress.\n  Senator Gramm and his staff must have had a lot of fun calculating \nwhat tax rates might be at some point in the future to get the fund \nbalances back to current-law levels under the bill. The reality is, \nhowever, we should not be trying to build up reserves that are between \n47 and 71 times annual benefit obligation outlays. That makes no sense.\n  But Senator Gramm declares that the industry will try to avoid higher \ntax rates that may even be triggered by the formula and, as a result, \nthe Government will have to step in. In this regard, I think past \nhistory is instructive. In the past, when financial problems have \narisen, Congress has chosen to raise taxes and reduce benefits, rather \nthan to provide bailouts for this industry.\n  Thus, even if Senator Gramm's doomsday scenario comes true, it is the \nplan participants who are likely to pay, not the Federal Government. \nThe industry knows this as well. This is why the railroads want the \nopportunity to manage this system, along with taking on more \nresponsibility.\n  I also want to respond to one other misunderstanding that has arisen \nin this debate--that by lowering the retirement age for Railroad \nRetirement to age 60, the bill gives railroad workers a benefit no one \nelse has, and that this benefit conflicts with the increase in the \nSocial Security eligibility age.\n  First, the earlier retirement age applies only to workers who have 30 \nyears of service in the rail industry. Second, the normal retirement \nage for Tier 1, the Social Security counterpart of Railroad Retirement, \nis not affected by this bill. It will rise to age 67 just as the Social \nSecurity retirement age will. Third, paying the cost of Social Security \nfor early retirees until they reach normal Social Security retirement \nage is a feature found in private sector pension plans.\n  These are known as ``bridge'' plans. Like these plans, the private \nportion of Railroad Retirement--Tier 2--pays the entire cost of this \nearly retirement option, just as it currently does for workers with 30 \nyears of service at age 62.\n\n  Keep in mind this is a dangerous industry in which to work. It is not \nuncommon for employees in the railroad industry who are working on the \nline to never be able to get their full 30 years in because of the \ndangers and the accidents that occur as a result of this industry. It \nis a tough industry. I used to represent railroad workers in some of \nthese cases. What happened to some of them was horrendous. Many of them \ndied trying to do their job. Others were mutilated. Legs were cut off, \nand arms were lost. Families were devastated.\n  These things do happen. It is not comparable to most other pension-\nbacked industries.\n  In conclusion, you may call this an opportunity for the rail industry \nto invest capital in infrastructure rather than excessive account \nsurpluses. You may call it an opportunity to improve benefits for \nwidows and for retirees who work 30 years in work that is often arduous \nand dangerous. You may call it an opportunity to bring Railroad \nRetirement investment practices into the modern era. But don't call it \n``pilfering.''\n  I know a lot about this industry. I know what a difficult industry it \nis. I know there are things that are wrong with the industry. I know \nthere are things such as feather-bedding in this industry that have \nexisted for a long time. But there are also a lot of loyal, decent, \nhonorable people working in these dangerous jobs to keep America's \ngoods and services moving across this country.\n  I can't imagine why we would not want to help these widows who have \nsuch a drastic automatic reduction in their benefits once their \nhusbands pass on. I think in most cases the husband is going to \npredecease the wife.\n  That is part of what we are trying to do here. Like everything else, \nnothing is perfect around here. And this bill is not perfect. But it is \na rational and reasonable attempt to allow this industry to invest in \ncapital infrastructure so that it can keep going and so that widows and \npensioners can be taken care of.\n  This is an industry that we have to keep going. An awful lot of bulk \ntransfers occur on our railroads in this country. We know there is \ngoing to have to be more investment as we upgrade high-speed lines and \nother effective approaches to transport materials, manufactured \nproducts, and other things throughout our country.\n  This is a great industry. It is an important industry. The people who \nwork in it deserve the best we can give them. I do not see the \nGovernment paying for the liability that could arise under the most \ndrastic pessimistic scenarios, as have been painted by some in this \nChamber: Not paying for it themselves. And I believe Congress will see \nthat that occurs. It is up to the industry to make sure they never have \nto do more than what is reasonable and rational under the circumstances \nby making sure that this pension program is viable, that it works, and \nthat it takes care of these people who need to be taken care of. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/03/senate-section/article/S12279-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12279-S12282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nECONOMIC STIMULUS, A COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY POLICY, AND FAST TRACT TRADE \n                               AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all, I listened to the remarks of \nmy colleague from Utah and thought they were interesting remarks, on \npoint, and I appreciate them.\n  I have heard some comments from colleagues this morning who are \nrepeating things we have heard previously in this Senate Chamber. I \nwant to comment about a couple of them and then talk about a vote that \nis occurring in the other body late this week and on which we expect to \nvote in the Senate at some point. It is a vote on something called \nfast-track trade authority.\n\n[[Page S12280]]\n\n  We had some discussion earlier today in the Senate about, the \nstimulus package referring, of course, to the package of legislation \nthat would try to provide some lift to this country's economy. The \nquestion was asked: Where is the stimulus bill?\n  The answer is very simple. The piece of legislation designed to try \nto stimulate this economy was brought to the floor of the Senate, and \nthen the Republicans decided to make a point of order against it, which \nthey did, and they took it from Senate consideration.\n  A point of order exists against the bill that Senator Daschle brought \nto the floor of the Senate. It would exist against the Republican bill. \nA point of order would also exist against the bill written by the House \nof Representatives. A point of order exists against all of the bills \ndesigned to try to stimulate this country's economy. But the point of \norder was made against the bill that was brought to the floor by \nSenator Daschle.\n  So those who now ask, Where is the stimulus bill? if they voted to \nsustain the point of order, need not ask that very loudly. The stimulus \nbill is where they put it. We were debating it on the floor. It was \nunder active consideration. And now it is not. Why? Because a \nsubstantial number of Members in the other party decided to take it \nfrom the floor of the Senate.\n  We need a stimulus bill. Our economy is in significant trouble, in my \njudgment. We ought to pass a piece of legislation providing lift to \nthis economy.\n  The President, and others, have asked the question, What is the \nSenate doing? The Senate is trying to pass a bill that provides \ntemporary and immediate help to this economy.\n  The House of Representatives, on the other side of this building, \ndecided they were going to do something quite different with respect to \nstimulus. They decided to pull out a bunch of old, leftover tax \npolicies, package them up, and call it a stimulus plan.\n  For example, one of their proposals to help this country's economy \nwas to give tax rebates, for taxes paid since 1988, for corporations \nunder the alternative minimum corporate tax. What does that mean? It \nmeans a rebate check for $1.4 billion will go to IBM, a rebate check \nfor $1 billion will go to Ford Motor Company.\n  The fact is, virtually all economists tell us we have substantial \novercapacity in our economy. Providing tax rebates for the biggest \ncompanies in the country is going to do nothing to help this economy. \nIt is just one more scheme to provide tax rebates, tax checks to the \nbiggest interests in the country, and it has nothing much to do with \nimproving this country's economy.\n  We do need a tax plan and a spending plan that stimulates this \ncountry's economy. Senator Daschle brought one to the floor of the \nSenate. But it is not here any longer because the minority party in the \nSenate decided they wanted to make a point of order and take it from \nthe floor. So I find it interesting that we have people coming to the \nfloor, again and again and again, saying: The stimulus package is \nimportant. Where is it?\n  I recall a story about raccoons once, that raccoons have a fastidious \nway of washing everything they eat. When they find something to eat, \nthey apparently go find water, and then they use their little hands to \nfastidiously wash what they intend to eat. It is just a habit raccoons \nhave. But sometimes raccoons cannot find water, so they pretend there \nis water. They go through the same motions, acting as if they are \nwashing their food, despite the fact there is no water.\n  We have some of that pantomime activity in the Senate. It is an \ninteresting thing to watch. Saying, Where is the stimulus package? is \nalmost exactly like that. It is sort of a pantomime piece of \ninformation: Where is the stimulus package? Those who ask the question \nknow exactly where the stimulus package is. They are the ones who took \nit from our consideration in the Senate. It is on the calendar but not \non the floor because a point of order was made against the stimulus \npackage.\n  Another point made this afternoon was about the energy policy. We do \nneed to develop a new energy policy in this country. Last week, Senator \nDaschle came to the floor of the Senate and made a commitment. He said \nin the first work session after we come back next month, we are going \nto be considering the energy package: a comprehensive energy package, \nnot just one piece, but a comprehensive energy package that deals with \nsupply and conservation, efficiency, renewables, as well as energy \nsecurity. That bill is going to come from a number of different \ncommittees in the Senate. It makes sense, to me, to do it that way.\n  Energy policy is not just--any longer--about supply and demand. It is \nalso about security. Especially since September 11, we now understand \nthe issue of energy security must be discussed and debated when we \nconstruct a new energy policy. The security of nuclear energy \nproduction plants, the security of transmission lines, the security of \nthe thousands of miles of pipelines: All of that is important in the \ncontext of energy policy as well.\n  So we will have an energy bill on the floor of the Senate. Senator \nDaschle is committed to that. But he wants to do it the right way. The \nright way is to consider all of the elements of good energy policy. \nPart of it is production, part of it is conservation, dealing with \nsupply and demand.\n  It is important to point out, with respect to that piece of an energy \npolicy, that some in this Senate and some in Congress would counsel \nthat our energy policy for the future should be yesterday forever, just \ndo what we did yesterday and keep doing it tomorrow--dig and drill--and \nsomehow that will represent a comprehensive energy policy for this \ncountry.\n  I happen to believe we need additional production of energy. There is \nno question about that. We can, should, and will, in my judgment, \nproduce more oil, natural gas, and coal, and do so in an \nenvironmentally acceptable way, to extend our country's energy supply. \nBut if that is all we do, we have miserably failed the American people. \nIt is, as I said, a policy that says yesterday forever.\n  We need to do much more than just expand our supply through digging \nand drilling. We need, it seems to me, to pay great attention to \nconservation. Conserving a barrel of oil is the same as producing a \nbarrel of oil. We can achieve substantial savings through thoughtful \nconservation, the right kind of conservation. We can and should adopt \nthat as a policy as well.\n  For example, we should look at the efficiency of appliances. We can \nalso make great progress with respect to the efficiency of those \nappliances we use in our everyday lives. And then there are renewable \nand limitless sources of energy: Fuel cells, ethanol, biomass--a whole \nseries of technologies that represent policies for the future that can \nreally promote new and exciting forms of energy, many of them renewable \nand some of them limitless.\n  That is what a comprehensive energy policy can and should be. It has \nto be much more than just a policy that says let's just provide some \ntax breaks to those who are going to dig for coal and drill for oil.\n  That doesn't make any sense. That is not a substitute or an excuse \nfor a policy. That is one part of a series of things we ought to \nconsider as we consider a new energy policy.\n  One of the interesting things to me about energy policy is that we \ndon't have a long-term strategy precisely because of the thinking of \nsome who have expressed on the floor that we have to have something now \nthat opens up ANWR. That is exactly the attitude that has put us in the \nposition of not having a long-term strategy.\n  If Members come to the Chamber to talk about Social Security, \neveryone talks about what the expectations are 30 and 50 years from \nnow. Everyone says what is the situation 25, 30, and 50 years from now \nwith respect to the Social Security system. I asked the Energy \nDepartment, when they testified, what kind of expectations we have 25 \nand 50 years from now with respect to energy. What will energy use be? \nWhat kind of energy will we use? What are we promoting? What kind of \npolicies do we have with respect to energy usage that would allow us to \nbecome more independent? The answer was: We don't have a plan.\n  There is no one who can say: Our aspiration, as a nation, is to have \na certain mix of energy production, of renewables and other forms of \nenergy that will extend our energy supply.\n\n[[Page S12281]]\n\n There is no such plan. Nobody thinks out 25 or 50 years.\n  As I indicated the other day with respect to my own circumstances, my \nfirst car was one I restored. As a young boy, I bought an old Model T \nFord and restored it. Interestingly enough, a 1924 car is gassed up the \nsame way you do a 2001 car. You pull up to the pump, you take the cap \noff and stick a hose in it, and you pump gas. Nothing has changed in 75 \nyears. Everything else in our life has changed. But you still gas up a \nModel T Ford the way you gas up the newest car on the road today.\n  You would think perhaps something could change or would change or \nwill change if we embrace and adopt thoughtful energy policies, and \nthat is what Senator Daschle wants to do. He wants to bring to the \nfloor a broad, comprehensive package of energy policies that will \nreally advance this country's long-term energy and economic interests. \nThat is what we will do in the first work session after the first of \nthe year. That makes good sense.\n  So those who come here day after day asking where is the stimulus \npackage, it is where you put it. You knocked it off the floor of the \nSenate. We want to bring it back with a package that is really \ntemporary, immediate, and gives real help to the American economy. When \nthey ask the question, where is the energy policy, it is coming to the \nfloor in the first work session after we get back in January, and it is \ngoing to be much more than the limited notion of digging and drilling \nforever. It is going to be a comprehensive energy policy that does \nadvance this country's energy and economic interests.\n  The subject of fast-track trade authority is one I have spoken about \nwithout great effect on the Senate floor for many years.\n  Apparently, on Thursday of this week, the House of Representatives is \ndetermined to bring to the floor of the House something called trade \npromotion authority, which is a fancy way of saying ``fast-track trade \nauthority,'' by which an administration can go off and negotiate a \ntrade agreement, bring it back to the Congress, and the Congress is \nprevented from offering any amendments. We are then required then in \nboth the House and the Senate, to vote up or down on these trade \nagreements.\n  The House may well have the votes to provide fast-track trade \nauthority to this President. I do not know. I don't know what the votes \nare in the Senate. I do know that if the House of Representatives \npasses fast-track trade authority, it will be slowed dramatically when \nit gets to the Senate.\n  I did not support giving fast-track trade authority to President \nClinton. I do not support giving fast-track trade authority to \nPresident Bush.\n  Why? Let me show with a chart what has happened with this country's \ninternational trade. Some say this is going well for America. It is \nhard for me to see how that is the case when we have a ballooning trade \ndeficit reaching alarming proportions--a $452 billion merchandise trade \ndeficit last year alone. That is nearly $1.5 billion a day that we take \nin more in imports than we are able to export.\n  It weakens this economy to run up these kinds of trade deficits year \nafter year. We can talk about the different trade rounds. We could talk \nabout the Tokyo round and GATT and this round and that round. Every \ntime we have another trade agreement, we seem to have a larger trade \ndeficit. Some say it is because the dollar is too strong; or we have \ntoo big of a Federal budget deficit. It doesn't matter what the excuse \nis. Economists will give an excuse of the moment. None of them really \nwashes. Every time we have a new trade agreement, we tend to see larger \ntrade deficits.\n  What is the circumstance of international trade? Fast track says we \ngive an administration the ability to go negotiate an agreement, bring \nit to Congress, and Congress must vote yes or no without any \namendments.\n  The Constitution says, article I, section 8, Congress shall have the \npower to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several \nStates and with the Indian tribes. So the responsibility is really with \nthe U.S. Congress. Fast track abridges that responsibility.\n  I could talk for an hour on the subject of international trade and \nwhat has happened to us. I understand that we need to expand trade. We \nwant to expand trade. We want to broaden our opportunities in trading \nwith other countries. I agree fully with that. But I insist that part \nof this country's effort with respect to trade policy ought to be to \ndemand fair trade rules with our trading partners.\n  In the first 25 years after the Second World War, we could trade with \nanybody in the world with one hand tied behind our back, and it didn't \nmatter because we were bigger, better, stronger, and more capable of \ntrading than anybody else in the world. We could do that. And most of \nour trade at that point was foreign policy. It was not economic policy; \nit was foreign policy. We created trade agreements that represented our \nforeign policy initiatives with those for whom we wanted to provide \nsome help.\n  In the second 25 years after the Second World War, when others became \nsmarter, better, tougher, with stronger economies, it wasn't quite as \neasy for us to compete. So now we have a circumstance where we have a \ngrowing number of trading partners that are very shrewd and very \nstrong. Over many years Japan, European countries, Canada, and others \nhave become, in many cases, formidable trading partners and with whom \nwe have experienced very large trade deficits. China is another \nexample.\n  What has happened with these countries with whom we have these trade \nrelations? With respect to Japan, we have had an $50 to $60 billion \ntrade deficit every year, every year forever. It has recently grown to \n$80 billion. Should that be the case? I don't think so. They ship us \nall of their goods. We say: Good for them; our market is open to all of \ntheir goods.\n  But did you know that 12 years after we reached a beef agreement with \nJapan, every pound of American beef going to Japan has a 38.5-percent \ntariff on it? Twelve years after our beef agreement, every pound has a \n38.5-percent tariff on it. Send a T-bone steak to Tokyo, it has 38.5 \npercent tariff. Is that fair, 12 years after our agreement, with a \ncountry with whom we have a huge trade deficit? I don't think so.\n  See how much luck you have sending pork chops to Peking, or how about \npotato flakes to Korea. Try shipping durum wheat to Canada. You could \nspend a long time talking about the abysmal trade circumstances we have \nas a result of improperly negotiated agreements.\n  Let me give you one more example. This happens to be Korea. Last \nyear, we shipped into this country 570,000 cars from Korea. Korea \nbought 1,700 from us. Let me say that again. It is important to \nunderstand the one-way relationship we have: 570,000 automobiles were \nshipped into the United States from Korea. Korea purchased 1,700 from \nus.\n  A mid-priced car, a pretty decent car, costs twice as much in Korea. \nThey don't want American cars in Korea. They don't buy them. The result \nis a one-way trade relationship with respect to automobiles in \nKorea. But I can describe the circumstances with fructose corn syrup \nwith Mexico, potato flakes with Korea, beef in Japan. The list is \nendless. The question for this country is: When will our trade \nnegotiators begin showing some understanding that they are negotiating \non behalf of the United States of America and that they are trying to \nprotect our country's interests? When will we send trade negotiators \nwho will say to the Canadians that they can't ship all their durum \nwheat to the United States and not allow one little load of ours into \nCanada? That is not fair to durum producers in the United States.\n\n  The point is this: Fast-track trade authority is a moniker for ``do \nyou support American business?'' The business that wants fast track is \ninternational business. They want to buy from themselves and sell to \nthemselves. In fact, what I want for this country is fair trade--\nexpanded, yes, but fair trade. I want negotiators who will negotiate \nfair trade agreements with other countries that will begin reducing \nthis ballooning trade deficit that injures our economy. My hope is if \nthe House of Representatives decides to pass the fast-track trade \nauthority this week, the Senate will slow that down. I and others in \nthe Senate--at least a dozen and more--will certainly want to have our \nway to be sure that we are not going to pass very quickly trade \npromotion authority for this President.\n\n[[Page S12282]]\n\n  As I said, I didn't support fast-track authority for President \nClinton. I don't support it for President Bush. What I support is for \nthis country to be hardnosed, to have a backbone, some nerve, some \nwill, and to insist with China, Japan, Europe, Canada, Mexico, and \nothers that we want trade agreements that are fair to American \nproducers and to American workers. If the trade agreements are not \nfair, then they ought not be made. I know my colleague from New Mexico \nis waiting. Let me make a final comment to describe the circumstances. \nIf I might ask if my time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kerry). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me describe the last big trade debate \nbefore the vote on GATT; it was NAFTA, the North American Free Trade \nAgreement. Is there anybody left in this Chamber who thinks that made \nany sense? We were promised 350,000 new jobs in a study that all of the \nbusiness interests held up to say look at how great this is going to \nbe. We passed the NAFTA trade agreement, and we turned a trade surplus \nwith Mexico into a huge growing deficit very quickly. We turned a \ndeficit with Canada that was not so awfully large into one that was \nvery large.\n  So NAFTA--the U.S. trade agreement with Canada and Mexico--turned \nboth of these trade relationships into huge deficits. How can that be \nin this country's interest? We were told, well, the situation with \nMexico will be simple. We will be the beneficiaries of the products of \nlow-wage, low-skilled labor from Mexico. Guess what the three largest \nimports from Mexico are to the United States? Automobiles, automobile \nparts, and electronics. All are the products of high-skilled labor--all \nof them.\n  In fact, those who sold us on NAFTA were dead wrong. I am hoping if \nwe ever have a debate on trade promotion authority--which I hope we can \ndefeat--that we can hear from some of the same folks who extolled the \nvirtues of a trade agreement that was so bad for this country and \nAmerican producers and workers. My point is, I don't want a harmful \ntrade agreement to happen again. We have done the United States-Canada \nfree trade agreement, NAFTA, and GATT, all of which led to bigger and \nbigger trade deficits year by year. The trade deficit has grown to $452 \nbillion. Every day, over $1.5 billion more in goods are coming into \nthis country than we are able to export. No country will long remain a \nstrong economic enterprise if it sees its manufacturing base \ndissipating. That is exactly what is happening as a result of these \ntrade deficits.\n  My point is that the House can have another celebration at the end of \nthis week if they pass trade promotion authority, but they should not \nthink it is going to happen quickly in this Congress. I and others will \nsteadfastly oppose trade promotion authority in the Senate.\n  What I want is negotiators who might decide to put on a uniform. We \nsend people to the Olympics with uniforms. They actually wear a jersey \nthat says ``USA.'' It would be nice to have a trade negotiator put on a \njersey so they understand who they are representing when they get \nbehind closed doors in a negotiating room, and it would be nice if the \nnext agreement is fair to this country, fair to our producers, and fair \nto our workers. It has been a long time. I hope we might see that in \nthe future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes on the \nmain legislation that is pending before the Senate, the Railroad \nRetirement and Survivors Act of 2001. The procedures that we follow in \nthe Senate sometimes obfuscate or make it impossible to determine \nexactly what it is we are debating. We have so many different issues \nthat we are debating all at the same time. I wanted to bring the focus \nof the Senate back for a minute to the main issue that we should be \ndebating, and that is the pending railroad retirement legislation.\n  There is an amendment that has been offered to the railroad \nretirement legislation by Senator Lott, and it involves an effort to \npass the House-passed energy bill, H.R. 4, and also an effort to have \nthe Senate on record on the issue of so-called therapeutic cloning. \nSomeone might ask, How do therapeutic cloning and an energy bill relate \nto each other, and how do those two items happen to be related to \nrailroad retirement?\n  Well, there is no relationship. Essentially, what we are going to \ndecide shortly after 5 o'clock is, Are we in fact going to pursue \npassage of this railroad retirement bill and keep these extraneous \nmatters to the side so they can be dealt with under different \ncircumstances, with full debate, later in this Congress, or are we \ngoing to get sidetracked and essentially get off track on dealing with \nrailroad retirement?\n  It is very important, in my view, that we deal with railroad \nretirement. This is the opportunity, this is the chance we have. There \nare 74 cosponsors. I know that has been mentioned several times on the \nfloor. I am one of those cosponsors. This legislation did pass the \nHouse of Representatives by 384 votes in favor, 33 against. While \nclearly I respect the rights of colleagues to express the concerns and \ninterests of other Senators in bringing other matters forward, I think \nit is high time we went ahead and passed this bill and sent it to the \nPresident. A great deal has changed since we began providing benefits \nto railroad employees back in the 1930s. We have tried to update this \nretirement system to reflect some of the changes in the cost of living \nand lifespans of former employees and their spouses.\n  Several years ago, Congress told the railroad companies and the \nunions to sit down and work out their differences on this legislation \nso that we could get a set of proposals that Congress could consider.\n  This bill--the railroad retirement bill before us today--is the \nproduct of those negotiations. It deserves our attention and our \nsupport. The country owes a great deal of the growth and dominance we \nhave had in the industrial and agricultural sectors to the railroad \nindustry and to the employees of that industry. We need to be sure that \nthese men and women receive retirement and disability benefits to \nreflect what they have accomplished, what they have done for this \ncountry.\n  This legislation tries to allow those employees with 30 years of \nemployment in the industry to retire at age 60 without a reduction of \ntheir benefits. It would also provide the surviving spouse of a \nrailroad worker with a benefit that appreciates the cost of maintaining \na household and is not cut in half when the first spouse dies. Under \ncurrent law, a widow or widower receives half of their tier 2 annuity, \nwhich, in most cases, will not be enough to pay for the basic \nnecessities of life.\n  This legislation also allows current railroad employees to have their \nretirement benefits vested after 5 years rather than after 10 years, \nwhich is the current law.\n  Finally, the legislation repeals the maximum benefit ceiling that is \ncurrently in place and allows the amount of benefit to be based solely \non the existing formula of the highest 2 years of income over the past \n10 years.\n  These are reasonable changes, they are fair changes. I believe very \nstrongly we should in these final days of this first session of the \n107th Congress pass this bill. We should send it to the President for \nhis signature, and we should resist the efforts we are seeing in this \nChamber today to bog this down by attaching other very controversial \nlegislation by the amendment process.\n  I hope cloture will be invoked on the amendment that Senator Lott has \noffered and that it can be withdrawn. We can then proceed to vote on \nthe railroad retirement bill and pass it and have that one piece of \nvery constructive legislation sent to the President before the week is \nout.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S12283]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/03/senate-section/article/S12283-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12283-S12284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   EXPLORATION FOR OIL AND GAS IN THE ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nopposition to exploration and drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, region of Alaska. On two occasions, \nI have visited this remote and rugged wilderness region. In the summer \nof 1996, my then-16-year-old son Eric and I joined my good friend, Will \nSteger, an internationally renowned Arctic explorer, and two other men, \non a two-week expedition in the Brooks Mountain Range of ANWR.\n  On the evening of June 30, we pitched our tents on the icy tongue of \nan enormous glacier. The next morning, we awoke to find ourselves in a \nsnowstorm. We trekked through fresh snow above our knees through near-\nwhite out conditions to the top of the Continental Divide. Then we slid \ndown the other side, frequently using our backpacks as toboggans and \nour boot heels as runners. It was an adventure I will always remember.\n  The northern slope of this mountain range initially resembled a lunar \nlandscape. Giant boulders and other, smaller rocks covered the surface, \nwhich was otherwise devoid of plants and wildlife. As we continued, \nhowever, we reached the beginning of the grassy plains, which are the \nhomes of millions of wildlife.\n  What impressed me most is how vast and untouched the ANWR region is. \nFrom the time we were dropped off by one bush pilot until the time we \nwere picked up 2 weeks later by another, we encountered only one other \ngroup of human beings. For the rest of our time, our companions were \none bear, a few caribou, who had not moved on to the coastal plains, \nand several quadrillion mosquitoes. This region is totally untouched by \nhuman beings and by their industrial and technological intrusions. It \nis there for anyone and everyone who wish to encounter it on its terms, \nrather than on their own.\n  My second visit to the ANWR region occurred last March, at the \ninvitation of my distinguished colleague, Senator Frank Murkowski of \nAlaska, who was then the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. Senator Jeff Bingaman, then the ranking member and now the \nchairman of the same committee, and I joined Senator Murkowski, along \nwith Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton; Ms. Mary Matalin, special \nassistant to the Vice President; and several committee staff.\n  We flew first to Anchorage, where we were greeted by Alaska's \nGovernor, Tony Knowles, a college classmate of mine, and other Alaskan \ngovernment and business leaders who outlined to us the enormous \neconomic importance of oil production to Alaska. We then flew to \nValdez, the southern end of the trans-Alaskan oil pipeline, where I \ngazed in awe at magnificent snow-covered mountains, which arose from \nsea level to encircle us, and viewed enormous oil tankers being \ncarefully escorted into and out of their ports.\n  From there, we flew up to the Prudhoe Bay region on Alaska's northern \ncoast, where about one and one-half million barrels of oil a day flow \ninto the trans-Alaskan pipeline. After viewing some of the first \ndrilling sites, we traveled to the nearby Alpine field, which is the \nnewest and most technologically advanced of the Alaskan drilling \noperations. The Alpine field, which was only discovered in 1996, is \nlocated to the west of Prudhoe Bay, right on the coast of the Beaufort \nSea. At 365 million barrels of recoverable reserves, it is one of the \nlargest discoveries in the United States in recent years. We toured \nthis very modern and technologically advanced facility, and I could not \nhelp but be impressed by the extensive efforts made to assure its \nsafety of operation and its ecological compatibility. It was obviously \nbuilt to be much more compact than the earlier operations, so as to \nleave a smaller ``footprint'' on the terrain. In fact, one of the \nAlaskan government officials, knowing that I come from Minnesota, had \nthoughtfully taken the time to investigate and discovered that the size \nof the Alpine complex was almost exactly the same as our famous \nshopping mall, the Mall of America. Alpine encompassed 97 acres, 1 acre \nsmaller than Minnesota's mega-mall.\n  Our trip concluded with our final night in Barrow, AK, which is the \nnorthernmost town in our United States of America. We awoke Sunday \nmorning, April 1, to an outdoor temperature of -35 degrees, which \ndropped to a -65 degrees, with the wind chill. I felt like an April \nFool, as I walked the outdoor airport tarmac to our plane for our \nreturn flight.\n  This trip gave me an invaluable opportunity to see firsthand the \nregion about which there has been so much debate in this Senate in \nrecent months. I thank Senator Murkowski for inviting me, while knowing \nthat I was an announced opponent of oil exploration and drilling in \nANWR. Yet he and our other Alaskan hosts were most respectful, as well \nas most persuasive, as they presented their case.\n  The debate over whether to open ANWR to oil and gas exploration and \ndrilling pits two enormously important national interests against each \nother. One is our need to find and develop domestic energy resources. \nMuch more is unknown than is known about the full extent of ANWR's oil \nreserves. The U.S. Geological Survey has produced a range of estimates \nof the amount of oil which is technically recoverable. Their mean \nestimate is 7.7 billion barrels.\n  As we were informed on our trip last March, the oil industry's \nproposal to drill for and extract these reserves involves the \nconstruction of up to 20 drilling complexes, each one approximately the \nsize of Alpine, along the coastal plain of ANWR. Thus, the legislation \nwhich passed the House last summer permits 2,000 acres of ANWR's \ncoastal plain to be open for oil drilling. However, as I understand the \nHouse version, these 2,000 acres are not limited to one area. Rather, \nthe legislation permits what the oil industry described to us last \nMarch: a chain of up to 20 Alpine complexes connected by oil pipelines \nextending along the coastal plain for as far as discovered and \nrecoverable oil reserves are found.\n  In my visualization, this enormous and vast industrial project would \nresemble 20 Mall of America-sized structures being built at various \njunctures along the coastline of this wilderness area. That, remember, \nis the size of one of these drilling facilities.\n  Now, for those who have not yet visited our Mall of America--and I \ncertainly encourage you to do so--it is the largest shopping mall in \nNorth America and, perhaps, the world. Tourists fly into Minnesota from \nall over our country and from cities throughout the world to shop \nthere. Each of its four quadrangular concourses extends for slightly \nmore than a mile, and its four shopping levels rise to the height of a \ntypical seven-to-eight-story building. Like Alpine, it is a relatively \ncompact structure; however, it is by no means a small ``footprint'' on \nthe landscape.\n  So, I ask myself, how would the construction of up to 20 of these \nMall of America-sized drilling complexes, each one encompassing almost \n100 acres, connected to one another by a large oil pipeline, which also \nmust be built and maintained along this corridor--how would this affect \na wildlife refuge, with its hundreds of thousands of migrating caribou, \nand all the other wildlife that has existed here in ecological balance \nfor thousands of years without the intrusion and interference of all \nthe rest of us?\n  I must conclude that, however well-designed and constructed, however \ncarefully and safely operated, and however environmentally well-\nintended, this project could be, it will have an enormous and \nirrevocable impact upon the essential purpose for which ANWR was \ndesignated and for which it must be protected: as a National Wildlife \nRefuge. In fact, by its very definition, a national wildlife refuge \narea is antithetical to the 20 large and interconnected industrial \ncomplexes, which this oil drilling would entail. As such, a vote to \npermit oil drilling in ANWR is a vote for the destruction of ANWR.\n\n  I returned from my trip last March wondering if there was any way to \nreconcile these two choices: To develop domestic oil reserves and to \nprotect this valuable national preserve. Upon reviewing the maps \nprovided on our trip, I was surprised to notice for the first time a \nlarge region located to the west of Prudhoe Bay and Alpine, called the \nNational Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. This area was scarcely mentioned \nduring our visit to ANWR, and we visited none of it. Upon further \nresearch,\n\n[[Page S12284]]\n\nhowever, I discovered that this National Petroleum Reserve, \nencompassing 23 million acres, was established by Congress for oil and \ngas development. Why, I wondered, given all the controversy over oil \ndrilling in ANWR, haven't the oil reserves in the National Petroleum \nReserve been first explored and extracted? Wouldn't it be a far better \nenergy policy to first extract the oil from a 23-million-acre area \nwhich has been established for that purpose?\n  Furthermore, oil production from the National Petroleum Reserve could \nbegin several years before anything from ANWR. Under President \nClinton's direction, in 1997, the Bureau of Land Management within the \nDepartment of the Interior conducted a study of a 4.6-million-acre \nsection in the northeast portion of the National Petroleum Reserve, \nwhich is the area immediately to the west of Alpine and Prudhoe Bay. \nThe Bureau prepared an environmental impact statement leading up to \nlease sales in May 1999, which drew 174 bids from six different \ncompanies on 3.9 million acres. More than 130 bids were accepted, at a \ntotal revenue to the Government of $104.6 million. This spring, \nPhillips Alaska, Inc., and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation reported \ndiscoveries of oil or gas, and Phillips indicated that these \ndiscoveries might be commercial. By early October of this year, \nAnadarko was in the process of securing permits to drill two additional \nprospect sites. The Interior and Related Appropriations Act for fiscal \nyear 2002 provides $2 million in funding for planning and preparation \nof another EIS, in anticipation of holding a lease sale in 2004 for \ntracts in the northwestern area of the National Petroleum Reserve.\n  The U.S. Geological Survey has estimated that the National Petroleum \nReserve could hold technically recoverable resources of 820 million to \n5.4 billion barrels of oil. However, these are only rough estimates. \nWhile these estimates are not as large as the current estimates of \nANWR's potential, they are the equivalent of between 2 and 12 of the \nAlpine field. Thus, the choice which some would force upon us, whether \nto protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or to continue the act \nof exploration for and development of our Nation's oil reserve is a \nfalse one. We can do both. We can, and we should, continue the \nenvironmental assessments and appropriate leasing of those sections of \nthe 23-million-acre National Petroleum Reserve until those discovered \nand recoverable oil supplies have been mostly extracted. Then, and only \nthen, would we possibly have either the need or the possible \njustification to turn our attention to possible sites in ANWR. However, \nit will take many years, probably a couple of decades, before we have \ncompleted the oil production out of the National Petroleum Reserve. \nUntil then, we have no reason to permit oil drilling in ANWR.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/03/senate-section/article/S12284-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12284-S12297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SENATE VOTES\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about two \nimportant votes we will have in a few hours, one on the Railroad \nRetirement Act and the other on the amendment introduced by the Senate \nRepublican leader, which is an energy plan that includes authorization \nto drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  I thank and congratulate my friend and colleague from Minnesota for \nthe outstanding statement he made on this issue. I believe the debate \nthus far on the question of drilling in the Arctic Refuge has revealed \na record that is not quite what the proponents of drilling have argued \nand portrayed. That, at least, shows we should not be pressured to pass \nsuch significant legislation in a hurried or cursory fashion. It is not \nwise for the Senate to rush into a decision that will have a permanent \nimpact and, in fact, do permanent damage to our environment, our \nnational energy strategy, and our national values while at the same \ntime being of little value to the American people.\n  I will discuss some of the contentions made by proponents of drilling \nour refuge and offer some comments.\n  Proponents of drilling have argued that the Inupiat Eskimos in the \ntown of Kaktovik are being deprived of their right to drill on refuge \nland that they own in fee simple. I was struck by that argument when it \nwas made Friday when I was in the Chamber.\n  I have done a little research over the weekend. I find that the \nInupiat Eskimos have rights to the surface of lands adjacent to the \ntown of Kaktovik. The Eskimos also were granted subsurface rights by \nSecretary of the Interior Watt to over 90,000 acres that are adjacent \nto their town. But those rights were speculative--only granting the \nright to drill if Congress authorized oil and gas drilling under the \nsurface of the Arctic Refuge.\n  A 1989 GAO report investigating the transfer of these subsurface \nrights found that the transfer actually resulted in a profit for \nKaktovik even without any oil and gas development.\n  The point I am making is that no promises have been broken to the \nInupiat people. In fact, they were never granted the right to drill in \nthe refuge. That has been clear from the beginning.\n  I will work with all of my colleagues, as I know the occupant of the \nchair does, to do everything I can to ensure that the Inupiat people \nare able to continue to sustain and improve their quality of life. But \nwe have to do so in a manner that is in our national interest and does \nnot sacrifice one of our great national treasures. We must also realize \nthat other Native Americans in Alaska strongly oppose any drilling.\n  Last Friday I mentioned the plight of the Gwich'in of Arctic Village \nwho depend on the Porcupine caribou herd to sustain their lives and \ntheir culture. Today I will read from a letter by the city of Nuiqsut, \nsitting in the shadow of the Alpine oil field on the North Slope. I ask \nunanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              City of Nuiqsut,\n\n                                      Nuiqsut, AK, April 11, 2001.\n     Letter from City Council to Cumulative Effects Committee \n         Members.\n\n     Patricial Cochran,\n     Representative/Member, National Research Council, National \n         Academy of Sciences.\n       Dear Sir or Madam: Thank you for coming to Nuiqsut and \n     seeking our input on the cumulative effects of oil and gas \n     development on our community and the North Slope. Your tight \n     schedule did not allow us to fully share all of our comments \n     with you, so we write today to summarize our thoughts and \n     supplement our comments. This summary is not meant in any way \n     to be a substitute for the heart felt comments you heard at \n     the meeting or the written testimony that was carefully \n     prepared for you and submitted to you at the meeting. It is \n     only a supplement to those thoughts and comments and a \n     request for further consideration of our views in the report \n     that you prepare.\n       The impact of oil and gas development on our village has \n     been far reaching. As you now know first hand from your \n     visit, we are literally surrounded by the infrastructure to \n     produce oil and gas. This has affected our day-to-day lives \n     in several ways. Our ability to hunt and gather traditional \n     foods has been severely impacted by development, as you heard \n     from everyone who spoke at the meeting. You were provided \n     many examples of how various species have been affected, and \n     how we have had to react and adjust to those changes. You \n     were also told how the land that we consider ours and from \n     which we subsist has in some cases been lost because we did \n     not fill out the right paperwork and/or look at the right \n     maps.\n       Additionally, oil and gas development has brought many more \n     people to our village that is not permanent residents, but \n     instead come and goes for work. Very few of these individuals \n     have integrated well into our community. There are widespread \n     feelings of distrust and frustration amongst villagers and \n     the workers who come from outside the community, despite \n     efforts to develop trust with one another. We do not fully \n     understand each other's cultures and we resent each other \n     still, despite our mutual efforts to get to know one another \n     and to get along.\n       Development has increased the smog and haze in our air and \n     sky, affecting our health as well as the beauty of our land, \n     sea, and air. Drugs and alcohol traffic have increased as \n     development has grown; the ice road that reduces our freight \n     costs also increases the flow of illegal substances into our \n     community. The stress of integrating a new way of life with \n     generations of traditional teachings has led some to alcohol \n     and drug abuse, a phenomenon unknown before white people came \n     to Alaska and greatly exacerbated by the recent spate of \n     growth associated with North Slope oil and gas development \n     and for us in Nuiqsut, even more exacerbated by growth \n     associated with Alpine.\n       However, like all Alaskans, we have also benefited from oil \n     and gas development. The State and Borough have more money to \n     spend on community facilities, schools, modern water and \n     sewer system, and similar projects. The City has also \n     received funds to mitigate some of the impacts of \n     development. At the individual level, we each receive a \n     permanent fund dividend every year that is funded by \n     excellent investment of\n\n[[Page S12285]]\n\n     state money, some of which came originally from oil and gas \n     royalties and taxes. We hope to have low cost natural gas \n     heating our homes and running our electric plant in the near \n     future because of a unique arrangement between Phillips, \n     Kuukpik--our local village corporation, the City, and other \n     community interests.\n       But money and modern amenities are not in and of themselves \n     significant enough trade offs. We urge the Committee to \n     appreciate the reality that, in the eyes of most of us, to \n     date, the negative effects of oil and gas development have \n     equaled or outweighed the positives. We encourage you to \n     include with your findings information that will encourage \n     policy makers to work harder to shift the balance of much \n     more to the positive side. As was stated at the meeting, we \n     do not reject the cash economy and know that the clock of \n     time cannot be turned back. We wish instead to become fuller \n     participants in the cash economy and in the decisions that \n     are made about future development, while maintaining our \n     cultural ties to the past through our subsistence lifestyle. \n     This is the essence of self-determination.\n       With that in mind, we urge you to include as a finding in \n     your report that one cumulative effect of development has \n     been that subsistence resources of local residents have been \n     displaced and altered, based on the information provided to \n     you at our meeting as well as testimony you have received \n     from state and federal agencies and other sources.\n       Another cumulative effect that should be included in your \n     report is that we have not been provided with enough well \n     paying, highly skilled North Slope oil and gas jobs. Although \n     some steps have been taken to increase local hire, a lot more \n     needs to be done. Very few villagers are employed at Alpine \n     or even on the entire Slope. A long-term commitment needs to \n     be made to train villagers to get the skills to get and--\n     importantly--to keep those jobs. Villagers and industry \n     representatives need to work together to develop a jobs \n     program in which villagers commit to working regular hours on \n     a long-term basis and industry commits to allow villagers to \n     take time off for subsistence activities without losing their \n     jobs.\n       Further, we urge you to include as a finding in your report \n     that villagers have not been fully integrated into decision \n     making regarding where development has occurred and what \n     facilities will be used to extract the oil and gas from the \n     ground. We need to be consulted more often and more fully on \n     decisions that are made regarding permitting, the impacts of \n     development on the land, sea, air and animals, and choices \n     for placement of pads, roads, mines, pits, pipelines, and \n     other aspects of infrastructure development. If we are \n     consulted and listened to, we will work to get future \n     pipelines underground and/or well above the antlers of the \n     tallest caribou, to end use of fish bearing lake water for \n     ice roads, to prohibit seismic scaring of the tundra, to \n     prohibit offshore and other outer continental shelf \n     development, and to take other measures in response to the \n     cumulative effects that have already occurred to the land, \n     sea, air, and people of the North Slope.\n       In conclusion, we again thank you for your interest in the \n     issues we face, and look forward to your findings. We \n     respectfully reiterate that we practice subsistence as a \n     lifestyle, not as a sport. We wish to continue to do so for \n     generations into the future. Only with careful consideration \n     of our input into future oil and gas development will that be \n     possible. We sincerely hope that a longer-term cumulative \n     effect of oil and gas development on the Slope is not the \n     total destruction of our subsistence way of life.\n           Sincerely,\n         City of Nuiqsut Council Members:\n     Eli Nukapigak,\n       Mayor.\n     Rosemary Ahtuangaruak,\n       Vice Mayor.\n     Ruth Nukapigak,\n       Member.\n     Mae Masuleak,\n       Member.\n     Hazel Panigeo,\n       Member.\n     Rhoda Bennett,\n       Member.\n     Frank Long,\n       Member.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. According to the Native Americans, the impact of oil \ndrilling has been ``far reaching.'' They provide some specific \nstatements:\n\n       Our ability to hunt and gather traditional foods has been \n     severely impacted. Development has increased the smog and \n     haze in our sky, affecting our health as well as the beauty \n     of our land sea and air.\n\n  Obviously, the people of Nuiqsut do not believe they have benefited \nfrom oil exploration, and they hope we will learn a lesson from their \nexperience.\n  We have also been asked to conclude that the wildlife in the reserve \nwill interact happily with oil pipelines if they are built there. A \npicture was shown the other day of bears. I was advised that the bears \nin the pictures were not stuffed animals. Indeed, they were not. Unlike \nstuffed animals, they need real wilderness habitat to survive.\n  I received a letter over the weekend from Mr. Ken Whitten, a retired \nAlaska State fish and game biologist who worked 24 years on the North \nSlope. Mr. Whitten felt compelled to respond to the proponents of \ndrilling and specifically to the picture of a mother bear and cubs \nshown last week. I quote from the letter: Most bear cubs that have \ngrown up in the oil fields have eventually been shot as problem bears, \neither in the oil field support area or at isolated villages and camps \noutside the oil field.\n  Thus, the story of the three bears in the photo does not have a fairy \ntale ending. Three different bear groups, each consisting of a sow and \ntwo cubs, have been seen walking pipelines in the oil field recently. \nAll three bears in one group and two cubs in another had to be shot \nlast summer after they became habituated to human food and repeatedly \nbroke into buildings and parked vehicles.\n  I ask unanimous consent Mr. Whitten's comments be printed in the \nRecord in full.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Comments of Kenneth R. Whitten on Remarks by Senator Murkowski\n\n       As a retired state fish and game biologist who worked 24 \n     years on Alaska's North Slope, I am once again disappointed \n     that Senator Murkowski has misinformed his fellow senators \n     regarding the effects of oil development on the wildlife and \n     wilderness environment of the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge. In this regard, I'd like to comment on the Senator's \n     statements about bears and caribou and also on his continued \n     misuse of a photograph I took myself.\n       On the floor of the Senate last Thursday, Senator Murkowski \n     showed a photo of three grizzly bears walking on top of an \n     elevated pipeline at Prudhoe Bay. What the Senator failed to \n     point out is that most bear cubs that have grown up in the \n     oilfields have eventually been shot as problem bears, either \n     in the oilfield support area or at isolated villages and \n     camps outside the oilfield. Thus the story of the three bears \n     in the Senator's photo doesn't have a fairy tale ending. \n     Three different bear groups, each consisting of a sow and two \n     cubs, have been seen walking pipelines in the oilfield \n     recently. All three bears in one group and two cubs in \n     another had to be shot last summer after they became \n     habituated to human food and repeatedly broke into buildings \n     and parked vehicles. The bears in the third family are all \n     currently alive, but unfortunately it is highly probable that \n     the remaining cubs, at least, will get into trouble next \n     summer and have to be killed. The major oil companies may do \n     a good job of keeping garbage away from bears and thus \n     avoiding conflicts, but bear problems are rampant in the \n     industrial support area where workers and visitors are not as \n     well regulated.\n       Caribou are not attracted to the oilfields, despite Senator \n     Murkowski's assertion that caribou flock to Prudhoe Bay and \n     thrive there because they are protected from hunting. Caribou \n     generally avoid the oilfields during their calving period. \n     Later in the summer, larger groups occasionally enter the \n     fields, but have trouble moving through the maze of pipes, \n     roads, and industrial activity. Hunting is legally restricted \n     in the Prudhoe Bay oilfield only, and not in other North \n     Slope fields, although oil company policies discourage \n     hunting. Hunting occurs on state and federal lands around the \n     oilfields, but is conservatively regulated so as not to harm \n     the caribou populations. The caribou herd around Prudhoe Bay \n     has increased because of generally favorable environmental \n     conditions over the past 25 years, as have other caribou \n     herds on the North Slope. During a brief period of bad \n     weather in the late 1980s, caribou near the oilfields had \n     poor calf production compared to caribou in areas away from \n     the oilfields. The population declined at that time.\n       Also on the Senate floor last Thursday, Senator Murkowski \n     showed a photograph over which he said he had previously \n     gotten into an argument with Senator Boxer. I took that \n     photograph. At various times Senator Murkowski has stated \n     that the photo is a fake or that it was not taken on the ANWR \n     coastal plain. In fact, that was the gist of his argument \n     last year with Senator Boxer. The photo was taken from a \n     rooftop at an abandoned DEWline station at Beaufort Lagoon on \n     the ANWR coastal plain. It looks across the lagoon to the \n     coastal plain filled with caribou and with snowcapped peaks \n     in the distance. After the dispute with Senator Boxer, \n     Murkowski had to admit that the photo was indeed from the \n     coastal plain, but he told reporters that the fact it was \n     taken from an old military site proves that the coastal plain \n     is not pristine wilderness (he was apparently unaware that \n     the site had been removed and no longer existed when he made \n     those remarks). Murkowski now claims he has confirmation from \n     the photographer that the photo was taken from a window in \n     Kaktovik village. The Senator just can't seem to get it \n     right. He now emphasizes that the mountains are not on the \n     coastal plain. The point he keeps trying to make is that the \n     ANWR coastal plain is a barren hostile place, with no \n     beautiful mountains or pretty scenery, and we should \n     therefore just go ahead and drill it. He can't seem to deal \n     with the fact that the plain is rimmed on the south by the \n     highest peaks of the Brooks Range, that many people find it \n     beautiful, and that during summer the coastal plain teams \n     with abundant wildlife.\n\n[[Page S12286]]\n\n       Senator Murkowski seems willing to go to any length to \n     convince us that we can improve national security and protect \n     wildlife by drilling the coastal plain, but there is \n     overwhelming evidence to the contrary. We can reduce our \n     dependence on foreign oil and protect wildlife through energy \n     conservation. The evidence for that is irrefutable.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I also contest a characterization of support for this \nproposal. Contrary to what has been said, it is clear that the American \nlabor movement is not universally enthusiastic about this bill. In \nfact, the well of union support is drying up. Many unions, including \nthe largest union in America, SEIU, and the United Steelworkers of \nAmerica, see more jobs in investing in the technologies of the future.\n  Why are the union members lining up in opposition to the drilling \nplan? The fact is a broad range of union members and leaders understand \nthat a strategic long-term energy strategy is a much more effective way \nto help spur the production not only of energy but of permanent jobs in \na wide range of economic sectors. Drilling in the Arctic Refuge \nrepresents a distraction from the real needs of our economy and the \nreal needs of the working people of America.\n  The other alternatives I cite: investments in efficiency, \nconservation, and alternative energy sources, are realistic, strategic, \nand ready to go. It is disappointing to me that in this era of dramatic \ntechnological progress in so many areas of human activity, we readily \ncelebrate the advances, including in the fields of oil exploration, but \nfail to see the promise of this next age of alternative efficient \nenergy technologies.\n  According to a recent study by the Tellis Institute, investments in \nnew energy technologies could result in a net annual increase in jobs \nin America of over 700,000 by 2010, rising to approximately 1.3 million \njobs in 2020. Those are the technologies of the future, providing high-\npaying, permanent jobs to America's workers.\n  There is also another proposal for the North Slope of Alaska that \nwill bring more jobs and more economic stimulus than drilling for oil \nin the refuge. That is the building of a natural gas pipeline to bring \nthat energy source to the lower 48 States. According to estimates from \nthe oil industry and from the State of Alaska, this project would bring \nhundreds of thousands of jobs to American workers and is far preferable \nto the proposed oil drilling in the refuge. In one sense, this is \nperhaps the first plan I have seen that is myopic and hyperopic. It may \nneed bifocals. It fails to take the long-term interests of our economy \nand environment into consideration and simultaneously fails to deliver \nany immediate benefit to the American people. In fact, it is a short-\nterm distraction in what should be our real energy program strategy and \na long-term danger.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter from the Secretaries of the Interior under Presidents Kennedy, \nJohnson, Carter, and Clinton.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                November 30, 2001.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       [Senator Akaka]: In this time of national crisis, we urge \n     the Senate to focus on the most important issues to the \n     country. Railroad retirement legislation and economic \n     stimulus packages are the wrong forum to be debating complex \n     energy legislation or deciding the fate of one of our \n     country's greatest wilderness and wildlife treasures--the \n     coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. \n     Majority Leader Tom Daschle has pledged to bring energy \n     legislation to the floor in the near future.\n       We hope you will oppose efforts to attach energy provisions \n     to economic or national security legislation, and we strongly \n     urge you to vote against drilling in the Arctic Refuge \n     regardless of the legislative vehicle.\n       Each of us, as former Secretaries of the Interior, made \n     decisions balancing the goal of developing the energy \n     resources of our public lands with that of conserving and \n     protecting the wildlife and wilderness resources of those \n     same public lands for future generations. In the case of the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we continue to believe that \n     the value of its unique wildlife and wilderness resources far \n     outweighs the potential benefits of development.\n       It is worth noting that protection of this unique resource \n     was first proposed by our colleague Fred Seaton, who headed \n     Interior under President Eisenhower. Secretary Seaton \n     stressed the unique wilderness values of this `biologically \n     irreplaceable land,' which was ultimately set aside under \n     President Eisenhower's order `for the purpose of preserving \n     unique wildlife, wilderness, and recreational values.'\n       In the forty years since the establishment of what was then \n     known as the Arctic Wildlife Range, the case for protecting \n     its wildlife and wilderness resources has only become \n     stronger. We have opened major portions of the Arctic slope \n     to oil development, which now dominates the landscape from \n     the Canning River all the way to the Colville. Most recently, \n     leasing in the National Petroleum Reserve has resulted in a \n     number of successful exploration wells west of the \n     Colville. Although industry practices and oil field \n     technology have both improved over the years, anyone who \n     has been to the Prudhoe Bay complex will tell you that oil \n     development there has permanently changed the character of \n     the land. In this context, protecting the biologically \n     richest and most pristine part of the coastal plain is the \n     right thing to do. Nowhere else on the American continent \n     can be found such a wealth of wildlife in an undisturbed \n     environment. The annual migration of the Porcupine River \n     Caribou Herd, on which the Gw'ichin communities of Alaska \n     and Canada depend for subsistence, remains one of the last \n     great wildlife spectacles on earth.\n       Our park, refuge, and wilderness systems are a living \n     legacy for all Americans, present and future, and are widely \n     envied and emulated around the world. The Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge is one of the greatest of these treasures and \n     is clearly the most precious of the crown jewels of Alaska. \n     It must be protected.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bruce Babbitt.\n     Cecil D. Andrus.\n     Stewart L. Udall.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Secretaries point out the value of the land in \nquestion here, the Arctic Refuge. They quote the Secretary of the \nInterior under President Eisenhower. It was Eisenhower who originally \ncreated this refuge.\n  That letter states that the area was:\n\n     biologically irreplaceable land that should be put aside for \n     the purpose of preserving the unique wildlife wilderness and \n     recreational values.\n\n  As the signatories' letter points out, the 40 years since Secretary \nSeaton's comments have only strengthened the case that this is a unique \nwildlife and recreational area of our country and deserves to be \npreserved. I ask my colleagues to please vote against cloture on the \namendment, the Lott amendment to the railroad retirement bill.\n  In summary, drilling in the refuge pales in comparison to more \nenvironmentally sound and strategic energy alternatives. Drilling in \nthe refuge will do nothing to provide energy independence, providing a \nmere 6-month supply of oil that will not come on line for a decade. \nDrilling will do almost nothing to stimulate our economy, providing \nsome short-term jobs when we can provide a much greater, longer term \nstimulus for our economy by undertaking projects such as the natural \ngas pipeline from Prudhoe Bay and increasing our investment in new and \nemerging technologies.\n  Finally, our values teach us that not every available natural \nresource should be exploited. Our values encourage us to respect the \nEarth, the treasures that the Good Lord gave us here in America, and to \napproach them with some humility, not to try to squeeze every last \nounce of energy or anything else out of every square foot of Earth, \nregardless of the cost or the loss that is engendered thereby.\n  Nature reminds us of our humanity. It inspires us. It helps to \ncomfort us when we are hurt. It gives us opportunities for recreation.\n  This is a time not to ignore but to recall the great American spirit \nof conservation which seeks, in every generation, to preserve the great \nnatural places in America so those generations that follow us will \nenjoy them, have the right and opportunity to enjoy them as much as we \nhave.\n  I believe this expresses the interests and the values of the American \npeople. I hope my colleagues will stand with those interests and values \nin voting against cloture on the Lott amendment when it comes up later \nthis afternoon.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if my friend will yield for a question.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I believe my time is up, but I will certainly yield \nfor a question.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Does the Senator from Connecticut have any idea how \nlong this issue has been before the Senate, how many hearings we held \non this matter over the years?\n  I think it is important because I believe the statement was made we \nshould not be rushing into anything.\n\n[[Page S12287]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Let me clarify that the time of the Senator \nfrom Connecticut has expired. This will be charged to the time of the \nSenator from Alaska, who is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Factually, if the Senator doesn't know, I would like \nto advise him.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I can tell the Senator respectfully, I have been here \n13 years and I know it has been an issue all that time, and I know it \nwas debated for some time before that. My point was, though, that I \nthink some of the contentions made on the floor in the back and forth \nof the debate in the last several days at least leave uncertainty. In \nthat spirit of uncertainty, we do better to come back and debate this \nproposal in full, as I guess we will, after the first of next year.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. For the edification of my friend from Connecticut, \nthere have been 50 bills introduced on this topic. There have been over \n60 hearings. We have had 5 markups of committee jurisdiction, in the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources. Legislation authorizing the \nopening of ANWR has passed the House twice. A conference report \nauthorizing the opening of ANWR passed the Senate in 1995. It was \nvetoed by President Clinton.\n  If you review the history, I think it is a little misleading to imply \nthat suddenly we are rushing into this matter without a good deal of \ndebate and thought. It is the same exact argument that was used in the \n1970s, prior to the authorization of opening up Prudhoe Bay and \nbuilding the pipeline. It was fostered by America's extreme \nenvironmental community which is again fostering the debate. There has \nbeen no sound science to suggest that opening Prudhoe Bay has resulted \nin an economic disaster or resulted in the decimation of the caribou \nherd, the central Arctic herd. These are alarmist tactics we have heard \ntime and time again and it is evident Members are soliciting the \nsupport based on America's environmental community.\n  Years ago, we had a full EIS on the opening. Still, at a time when we \nare looking at calamities in the Mideast--the situation in Israel, the \ndanger associated with our national security--I find it extraordinary \nthat Members would look for excuses rather than sound science in \naddressing the merits of this legislation.\n  Had President Clinton not vetoed that legislation in 1995, ANWR would \nbe on line now. When the Senator continues to use the ``6-month supply \nof oil,'' he is really misleading the American public. He knows that \ndefinition is only applicable if there is no other oil coming into the \nUnited States, imported or produced in the United States. I think we \nshould keep the debate on a factual level as opposed to a misleading \nlevel.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask the Chair, it is my understanding we each have \n10 minutes, is that correct, in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I certainly understand the pro-\nponents----\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Excuse me, Mr. President, may I interrupt. I think we \nhave time remaining on either side; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I beg your pardon?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I believe there is time remaining on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The Senate will be in morning business \nuntil the hour of 4:45, at which time there will be 30 minutes equally \ndivided on either side to debate the Lott amendment. Until then, \nSenators may proceed for 10 minutes each, time to be designated between \nthe sides.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. May I ask the Chair how much time is remaining on this \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In total? One hour sixteen seconds remain.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am sorry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I repeat, 1 hour 16 whole seconds--16 minutes, \nI am advised.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am sorry. I did not hear. On the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 minutes remaining on the other \nside.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will start again. I know the proponents--and \ncertainly the Senator from Alaska stands out in this matter of drilling \nin the Arctic Wildlife Refuge--feel strongly about their position. But \nthere are those of us who feel just as strongly the National Wildlife \nRefuge should remain, as it has always been, our Nation's last \nprotected Arctic wilderness.\n  The Senator from Alaska was asking the Senator from Connecticut about \nhow long this has been going on. I have been here 11 years. I remember \nthe first filibuster I was involved in was against this. We were \nsuccessful. I think we will be successful again.\n  In the last 11 years, I have heard a lot of arguments about why we \nshould drill, but none of them hold up to scrutiny.\n  In 1991, we had the debate on the energy bill, and we were told that \nthe Trans-Alaska pipeline would run dry by the turn of the century \nwithout drilling the refuge. Today, even the oil companies acknowledge \nhaving enough oil to keep the Trans-Alaska pipeline flowing for at \nleast another 30 years and perhaps another 40 years.\n  In 1995, we were told drilling the refuge was necessary to balance \nthe Federal budget. But we managed to balance the budget without these \nspeculative revenues, and by the way, it would have stayed that way \nwithout the irresponsible tax cut passed earlier this year. Instead, \nwhat do my Republican colleagues do? It is not part of this amendment--\non the House side, $30 billion of tax credits for oil companies that \nmade about $40 billion last year in profits.\n  What other arguments have we heard? Earlier this year, we were told \nthat we should drill the refuge to deal with California's electricity \ncrisis. Never mind the fact the State gets less than 1 percent of its \nelectricity from oil.\n  Then we were told to drill to bring the prices down at the pump. \nNever mind the fact the prices are set on the global market and that as \nthe Governor of Alaska has even acknowledged, there is a zero sum \nrelationship between Alaskan oil and prices paid by working families \nfor gasoline or home heating oil.\n  I find it ironic that the same Senators who call for drilling in the \nArctic Refuge have nothing at all to say about the wave of oil company \nmergers. I say to my colleagues, if you were so concerned about \nconsumers and about the prices that working families pay at the pump, \nwhere were you when Exxon and Mobil merged? When BP took over Amoco? \nWhen BP took over Arco? And now when Phillips and Conoco are seeking \nGovernment approval?\n  So what is today's flavor? What's today's argument? The Senator from \nAlaska says we need to drill the refuge as part of our campaign to \ncombat terror--as a way to reduce our dependence on imported oil. Let \nus look at the facts:\n  According to the oil industry's own testimony before the Senate \nEnergy Committee, it would take at least a decade to tap even a drop of \noil from the refuge. Furthermore, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated, \nwith oil prices at $20 per barrel, there is only 3.2 billion barrels of \ncommercially recoverable oil in the refuge--not in one field, but \nspread out in potentially dozens of small pockets all across the \nDelaware-sized Coastal Plain.\n  I know the Senator from Alaska argues there's alot more than that. \nBut here is what the USGS said in its report: ``We conclude that there \nare no Prudhoe Bay-sized accumulations in the 1002 area. . . .''\n  The bottom line is this: Drilling the Arctic Refuge, even under the \noptimistic estimates, would be unlikely to ever meet more than 1-2 \npercent of our oil needs, even at peak production. In fact, we could \ndrill every national park and wildlife refuge in America and we'd still \nbe importing the majority of our oil.\n  The answer, clearly, is to look to the future. What can we do \ninstead? By increasing the fuel efficiency of our cars and trucks by \njust 3 miles per gallon, we can save more than 1 million barrels of oil \na day or five times the amount of oil the refuge might produce. This \nwould do far more to\n\n[[Page S12288]]\n\nclean the air, reduce prices for consumers, and make us less dependent \non imported oil.\n  The fact is a focus on renewable energy and saved energy is our \nfuture: Households that generate electricity from rooftop solar arrays, \nfarmers who harvest an additional ``crop'' by the winds that blow over \ntheir fields, or the biomass waste that is generated, and city streets \ninhabited by quiet and pollution-free electric vehicles.\n  Do we want real energy security? Former CIA Director James Woolsey \nrecently testified that the Trans-Alaska Pipeline is one of the more \nvulnerable parts of our energy infrastructure; that, even if you had no \nenvironmental objection, it would not make a whole lot of sense to \nbecome more dependent on the pipeline.\n  I don't know whether he is right or wrong. But I do think we need to \nbecome much less dependent on oil as a resource and that doing so will \nenhance our security, help consumers, and provide for a healthier \nenvironment.\n  Renewable energy, alternative fuels, and increased efficiency are the \nkeys to the future. They are, as Woolsey testified, less vulnerable to \nterrorism. They also make America less vulnerable to the wild price \nswings caused by the OPEC cartel. I certainly look forward to this kind \nof energy policy for our country.\n  In conclusion, let me say this: the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nis a national treasure worth far more as a lasting legacy for future \ngenerations than plundered for a short-term speculative supply of oil \nthat will not enhance our security or help consumers. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on cloture and help us move onto the Railroad \nRetirement bill and other important matters at hand.\n  There is a marriage we can make, and it has to do with this nexus \nbetween how we produce and consume energy and the environment. We can--\nno pun intended--barrel, not down the oil path, we can barrel down the \npath of renewable energy: wind, solar, biomass, electricity, \nbiodiesel--clean alternative fuels, safe energy, efficient energy use, \nsmall business, clean technology, keep capital in our community, stop \nacid rain in lakes, stop polluting the environment: the air, the water, \nand the land.\n  This is a marriage made in heaven, and it should be made right here \nin our own country.\n  I know the oil companies do not like this. I know that is not their \nfuture. But it is the future for consumers in our country. Coming from \nMinnesota, a cold-weather State at the other end of the pipeline, it is \na no-brainer. When we import barrels of oil and natural gas, we export \nbillions of dollars from our State--probably about $12 billion a year. \nThat is not our future.\n  We have an answer. A lot of it comes from rural Minnesota, it comes \nfrom farm country. It is a far better path. Put the emphasis on \nrenewable energy policy and safe energy. Put the emphasis on small \nbusiness, on technology, keeping capital in our community, and on the \nenvironment. As the Catholic bishop said 15 years ago, we are all but \nstrangers and guests on this land. That is the direction in which we \nshould be going.\n  That is why I am strongly opposed to this amendment introduced by the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am continually amused and continually \nastounded by the general statements by my colleagues on the other side \nwho have never taken the time, despite the invitations that have been \nextended, to visit this area themselves and to talk to the Native \npeople and see indeed that they, too, have hopes and aspirations for a \nlifetime opportunity of jobs, of health care, and education.\n  The Senator from Connecticut made a comment about the letter he \nreceived. What he didn't tell you is that every child in that village \nhas an opportunity to go to college. Believe me, that child would not \nhave that opportunity without the oil activity associated with Alpine.\n  This whole debate is a smokescreen. It is a smokescreen promulgated \nby America's environmental community, which uses this as a tool for \nmembership and dollars. These are the same arguments that were used 27 \nyears ago against opening up Prudhoe Bay: You can't build an 800-mile \npipeline across the length of Alaska because you are putting a fence \nacross Alaska; the moose and the caribou won't be able to move from \nside to side; it is a hot pipeline; it is in permafrost; it is going to \nmelt; it is going to break.\n  Where would we be today without that particular project and Prudhoe \nBay that has supplied the Nation with 20 to 25 percent of its total \ncrude oil for these 23 years? We would be importing more oil. We would \nbe importing it to the west coast and to the east coast in foreign \nships, not U.S. flag vessels.\n  I am just amazed at the general condemnation that somehow it is a 6-\nmonth supply of oil. That is the falsehood. Everybody in this body \nknows it. They can figure it out. The estimate by USGS on the oil that \nis anticipated to be in ANWR is somewhere between 5.6 billion and 16 \nbillion barrels. Why don't they know? They do not know because only \nCongress can authorize exploration in the area.\n  If there is no oil, which sometimes does occur, nothing is going to \nhappen. But to say it is a 6-month supply is terribly misleading \nbecause it is totally inaccurate.\n  If you cut off all the oil imports and if you didn't produce a drop \nin any other State, then it might last 6 months. But remember that \nPrudhoe Bay was 10 billion barrels of oil. It has produced over 10 \nbillion barrels of oil. ANWR is 5.6 billion to 16 billion. It is one-\nhalf the median of 10 billion barrels; it would be as big as Prudhoe \nBay.\n  I am getting kind of tired of hearing these slanted stories relative \nto facts. They say it is going to be 10 years. That is absolutely \nridiculous. We have the pipeline built. We need about 70 miles of \npipeline over to ANWR. It is a matter of putting up the leases and \ndoing the updating on the permits.\n  Incidentally, that whole area has had a full environmental impact \nstatement by the Interior Department.\n  This is more effort to simply throw cold water on reality.\n  I am sorry my friend from Minnesota is not here because he and I \ndon't go out of this Chamber or leave Washington, DC, on hot \nair. Somebody has to put the fuel in that airplane or that train or \nthat car. That is absolutely all there is to it. I wish we had other \nmeans of energy to move us around, but coal, gas, nuclear, and wind do \nnot do it. We have to have oil. The whole world operates on oil. This \nis important, particularly at a time when we are seeing such grave \ncircumstances associated with activities that affect the entire world \noccurring in Israel and the Mideast.\n\n  So what are the arguments? One, I guess, is that it is a 6-month \nsupply. I think we have addressed that adequately for the time being. \nThe 10-years is out of the question. The Porcupine caribou herd is \nanother. Clearly, most of the Gwich'ins who follow the Porcupine \ncaribou herd are in Canada. There are about 800 in Alaska. Canadians \nare leasing their lands. They are developing their own corporation \nbecause they are looking for jobs.\n  When we talk about caribou, since we are on the subject of these \nmigratory animals, let's look at the experience we have had in Prudhoe \nBay. That particular herd was 3,000 to 4,000 animals 15 years ago. It \nis 26,000 animals today.\n  Every single issue on the other side can be countered, but that does \nnot stop the opponents. The opponents simply want to kill this for the \ntime being until it can come up again. But eventually it will pass \nbecause it is the right thing to do.\n  I think it is fair to say that some do not want to see our President \nprevail on a few issues. Trade promotion is one. Energy is another. We \nare talking about stimulus in this country. You name a better stimulus \nthan ANWR, creating 250,000 jobs, creating, if you will, revenue for \nthe Federal Government of about $2.5 to $3 billion from lease sales, \nnot costing the taxpayer one cent.\n  What about other jobs? Nineteen double-hull tankers will have to be \nbuilt. Some will be built on the east coast, the west coast, and the \ngulf, because under the law the old tankers have to be retired. These \nare double-bottom tankers. It is estimated it would pump about $4 \nbillion into the U.S. economy. It would take 17 years to build those\n\n[[Page S12289]]\n\nships. That is what we are talking about when we talk about jobs.\n  What about our national security? The more we become indebted to the \nMideast oil-producing nations, the more leverage they have on us. It \nseems to me it is quite clear that there are a few people on this issue \nwho clearly fail to recognize what is best for America.\n  Our President has asked, time and time again, for an energy bill. The \nveterans: The American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, AMVETS, \nthe Vietnam Vets, the Catholic War Veterans; organized labor: The \nSeafarers International, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; \nthe maritime labor unions; the operating engineers, the plumbers and \npipefitters, the carpenters and joiners; the Hispanic community: The \nLatin American Management Association, the Latino Coalition, the United \nStates-Mexico Chamber of Commerce; the 60-plus Seniors Coalition, the \nUnited Seniors Association; Jewish organizations, including the \nConference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, and the Zionist \nOrganization of America--I think we have a couple more that came in \ntoday that represent the opinions of America's Jewish lobby also there \nis the National Black Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Alliance for \nEnergy and Economic Growth.\n  There are a few people whose voices ought to be heard who have \nexpressed their opinion that it is in the national interest, the \nnational security interest, to open up this area. I further refer to \nAmericans for a Safe Israel. This is a letter dated November 13:\n\n       Americans for a Safe Israel is strongly in support of your \n     amendment which would permit drilling for oil in the ANWR \n     area of Alaska. . . .\n       We at Americans for a Safe Israel would be pleased if you \n     would include our organization among American Jewish \n     organizations in support of your amendment regarding oil \n     exploration in the ANWR.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  Americans for a Safe Israel,\n\n                                  New York, NY, November 30, 2001.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: Americans for a Safe Israel is a \n     national organization with chapters throughout the country \n     and a growing membership including members living in other \n     countries. AFSI was founded in 1971, dedicated to the premise \n     that a strong Israel is essential to Western interests in the \n     Middle East.\n       We have many Middle East experts on our committees, who \n     have authored texts on Israel and the Arab states and have \n     appeared in television interviews, forums, and on newspaper \n     op-ed pages. U.S. senators and representatives have been \n     guest speakers at AFSI annual conferences.\n       Americans for a Safe Israel is strongly in support of your \n     amendment which would permit drilling for oil in the ANWR \n     area of Alaska. Your eloquence in addressing the Senate \n     yesterday and this morning should have convinced the \n     undecided that the arguments offered by senators in the \n     opposition, or by environmental activists, are not based on \n     the facts or realities in the ANWR and of our need for energy \n     independence.\n       We at Americans for a Safe Israel would be pleased if you \n     would include our organization among American Jewish \n     organizations in support of your amendment regarding oil \n     exploration in the ANWR.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Herbert Zweibon,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, you have the Teamsters. I will read you \na press release put out by the Teamsters today.\n\n       (Washington, D.C.) The International Brotherhood of \n     Teamsters today renewed their call for a fair vote on a \n     comprehensive energy plan before the U.S. Senate. The action \n     came as the Senate was preparing to consider a series of \n     procedural votes related to petroleum exploration in the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Minority Leader Trent Lott \n     has proposed an amendment to railroad retirement legislation \n     that would allow for ANWR exploration while also banning \n     human cloning for six months. . . .\n       ``Teamster members in the railroad industry have worked \n     hard for a secure retirement,'' said James P. Hoffa, \n     Teamsters General President. ``It is unfortunate that Senator \n     Daschle is jeopardizing [Senator Daschle is jeopardizing] \n     this important legislation by denying the ANWR exploration a \n     separate floor vote. These two pieces of legislation deserve \n     to be passed on their own merits.''\n\n  I certainly agree with him.\n  He further states:\n\n       ``Exploring in the ANWR is clearly the right thing to do,'' \n     Hoffa said. ``It will reduce our reliance on foreign oil \n     while creating thousands of jobs for working families. A vote \n     on the energy package must not be delayed any longer.''. . .\n       Unfortunately, the Democratic Senate leadership has \n     attempted to thwart the will of the majority by refusing to \n     allow an energy vote to come to the Senate floor.\n\n  That is the factual reality. The Democratic leadership has precluded \nus from having an up-or-down vote on an energy bill. So here we are \ntoday on a Monday afternoon arguing the merits of a very complex \nprocedural situation involving railroad retirement as the underlying \nbill with amendments for cloning and amendments for H.R. 4, the House \nenergy bill.\n  For reasons unknown to me, the majority leader has indicated he is \nwilling to take up a bill when we come back after the recess, but he \nwill not tell us that he is willing to conclude it. If he were willing \nto, say, take it up when we come back, with the assurance that we would \nhave an up-or-down vote, and preclude any situation where they would \nsimply pull the bill down and not bring it up again, I would find that \nacceptable. If he would give us a time certain, such as when we come \nback to take up the bill, and then perhaps have a final vote on it \nprior to the February recess--we have suggested that to him, but so far \nhe has declined.\n  I encourage, again, the majority leader to consider the merits \nassociated with getting up an energy bill because the more time that \ngoes by the more difficult it is to simply ignore the issue.\n  We have seen the national farmer support groups--and I just read \nhere: The National Energy Security Act low-income fuel programs and a \nprovision for oil exploration and production of a tiny portion of the \nCoastal Plain in the Arctic Wildlife--the Senate needs to pass this act \nthis year.\n  There is more and more heat coming on this issue as the general \npublic recognizes the reality associated with developing this \nparticular area where there is a likelihood of a major oil discovery.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I see the senior Senator from Alaska is in the \nChamber. He may wish to be recognized at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut was in this Chamber addressing the Senate concerning \nthe days that President Eisenhower and his administration considered \nlands in Alaska. That is of particular importance to me because I was \nthere. I was the assistant to Secretary of the Interior Fred Seaton. I \nwas in the meetings with President Eisenhower. And I am happy to tell \nthe Senate what the President did and what the Secretary of the \nInterior did. Unfortunately, Senator Lieberman has been misinformed.\n  The Eisenhower administration withdrew 9 million acres of the \nnorthwest corner of Alaska as the Arctic Wildlife Range. It was the \nArctic wildlife range, not a refuge.\n\n  At that time the order specifically provided that oil and gas \nexploration and development would be permitted under stipulations to \nprotect the flora, fauna, fish, and wildlife of that portion of Alaska. \nSubsequent administrations did not issue such stipulations so no oil \nand gas exploration took place. However, as time went by and I then \nbecame a Member of the Senate, we dealt with the settlement of the \nAlaska Native land claims. Those claims were settled by an act of \nCongress in 1971. In that basic law, which we called the Alaska Native \nClaims Settlement Act, there was a provision in section 17(d)(2) that \nrequired the study of national interest lands in Alaska.\n  That was one of the requirements that was demanded of us, that we \nagree to the study of which lands should be set aside in the national \ninterest because the statehood act of Alaska gave the right to the \nState of Alaska to select 103.5 million acres of public land, vacant, \nunreserved and unappropriated land. And the 1971 Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act gave the Native people of Alaska the right to take 40 \nmillion acres of Alaska land, plus some additional lands that would add \nup to about 45 million acres.\n\n[[Page S12290]]\n\n  The Congress, at the time the Native Claims Settlement Act was \npassed, was worried that such selections might impede the national \ninterest. And there was a review undertaken of what lands should be set \naside in the national interest.\n  We worked for several years to try and get the Alaska National \nInterest Lands Conservation Act passed. In the Congress ending in 1978, \nwe did achieve the passage in both the House and Senate of a bill to \nsatisfy the requirements for the 1971 Act, that section 17(d)(2), as I \nmentioned.\n  Unfortunately, at the last minute of that Congress, just prior to \nadjournment, my former colleague Senator Gravel objected to the \napproval of the conference committee on that bill and required the \nreading of the legislation which was an extremely long bill. We had \nalready agreed to an adjournment resolution and, in effect, that killed \nthe bill for that period of time.\n  In 1979, when we returned, we started working again on the Alaska \nNational Interest Lands Conservation Act. And by the time we finished \nit, the bill had been changed substantially from what it was in 1978. \nOne thing did remain the same: The Arctic National Wildlife Range was \nchanged from a range to a national wildlife refuge, and it was more \nthan doubled in size. Of the original 9 million acres, that land was to \nbe part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. But a section authored \nby Senators Henry Jackson of Washington and Paul Tsongas of \nMassachusetts provided a compromise to meet the Alaska objection about \nthe denial of the right to continue to explore the Arctic Plain.\n  That is what we call section 1002 of the 1980 act. It provided for \nthe right to proceed to explore that 1.5 million acres to determine if \nit had the potential for oil and gas and to have an environmental \nimpact statement presented to the Congress and approved by the \nPresident and by the Secretary of Interior.\n  That has happened. As a matter of fact, there has been more than one \nenvironmental impact statement. Presidents Reagan and Bush asked for \nthe right to proceed for the exploration. That was denied by the \nCongress at that time.\n  When President Clinton was in office, the Congress approved \nproceeding with the leasing of oil and gas on the 1.5 million acres, \nand President Clinton twice vetoed the bill. So where we are today is \nwe are still trying to fulfill a commitment that was made to Alaska by \ntwo Democratic Senators in 1980 that we would have the opportunity to \ncontinue to explore for and develop the vast potential of the Arctic \nPlain. We have been trying since that time, of course, to obtain \napproval of it.\n\n  The area we have now, the 19 million acre Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, originally contained just 9 million up here in the corner. As I \nsaid, that was opened to oil and gas leasing. It included the coastal \nplain. It was part of the original Arctic wildlife range. What we are \ntrying to do now is to once again fulfill the commitment made to us in \nsection 1002 of the 1980 act that the analysis and exploratory \nactivities may proceed.\n  Unfortunately, this has become the icon of the radical environmental \nmovement in the United States. People insist on coming to the floor and \ntrying to tell the American people that this area was never intended to \nbe explored. The commitment was made to us, and it was made to me \npersonally, specifically, by Senator Paul Tsongas and Senator Henry \nJackson that it would remain open. That was one of the reasons we did \nnot object to the passage of the bill in 1980. The two of us who were \nhere in 1978 were still here in 1980 when this bill passed. Senator \nGravel and I agreed, because of the representations made to us by the \ntwo managers of the bill, that this land would remain open and could be \nexplored. And if oil and gas was discovered, it could be produced from \nthat area.\n  It is probably the largest source of oil area in the United States. \nIt is a sedimentary basin. It is the largest, probably, that we will \never see in the North American continent. Yet it goes unproduced \nbecause of the opposition of radical environmentalists who try to tell \nthe American public something that is not true. This land has not been \nclosed. It has never been closed to oil and gas exploration. But in \norder to proceed with the development in terms of production activity, \nit takes approval of an act of Congress signed by the President.\n  We have been after that now for 21 years--even more if you go back to \n1971. It is 30 years we have been telling the American public: This is \nprobably the greatest place on the North American continent to produce \noil to meet our needs.\n  I, for one, hope we will have an opportunity to debate it and vote on \nthe merits of this bill during this Congress. I congratulate my friend \nand colleague Senator Murkowski for all he is doing to bring it to the \nattention of the American people.\n  When the time comes later on this afternoon, I will talk about some \nof the opportunities we have to meet our needs. Too many people \nconsider oil solely as gasoline. Less than half of a barrel of oil \nbecomes gasoline. As a matter of fact, the barrel of oil goes into \neveryday products. Fifty-six percent of a barrel of oil that comes out \nof the ground becomes other products besides gasoline: home fuel, jet \nfuel, petrochemicals, asphalt, kerosene, lubricants, maritime fuel, and \nother products. Everything from Frisbees to panty hose comes from oil. \nYet people talk about how to have alternative supplies of energy.\n  Where do you get the 56 plus percent of the barrel of oil that goes \ninto products other than gasoline? You just can't get it. Look at this, \nitems made from oil: toothpaste, footballs, ink, lifejackets, soft \ncontacts, fertilizer, compact discs. As a matter of fact, there is no \nquestion that one of the most versatile products known to man is \npetroleum. A barrel of oil is a barrel of gold for our economy. We need \nto talk more about what it means to open up the Arctic wildlife area, \nthe 1002 area, which was guaranteed to be made available to us for oil \nand gas development.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If nobody yields time, time will be charged \nequally to both sides.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining for the \nopponents of the Lott amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 21 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto proceed for such time as I may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will speak to some of the comments we \njust heard. I must say, I am a little bit disturbed that the quality \nthe debate is already, to some degree, seeming to move into sort of a \npersonal characterization about who is representing whom. I heard one \nSenator from Alaska suggest that all this is is an effort to \nsmokescreen, that it is a membership drive for environmentalists. My \nvery good friend, the senior Senator from Alaska, suggested that \nradical environmentalists are driving this issue. Well, I don't know \nwho he is talking about. I haven't talked to any radical \nenvironmentalists. In fact, the fundamentals of my decision on this \nissue are not based on environmental choices; they are based on energy \nchoices, based on economics, and they are based on the realities of the \nchoices we face in this country about oil.\n  I completely agree with the Senator from Alaska that some wonderful \nproducts that all of us use every day are oil-based. Indeed, we are \ngoing to continue to make those products. There is nobody here who is \ntalking about eliminating one of those products--not one of them. Those \nproducts don't spit out emissions from the exhaust on the back of a \nvehicle that is contributing to the problem of global warming. Those \nproducts are used and manufactured--many of them--in very different \nways. No one that I have heard in this debate is talking about not \ndrilling for oil or not using oil. This country faces--I don't know--a \n40- to 50-year transition in order to begin to be able to really shift \naway from our dependency on oil.\n  It happens that that 50-year curve also coincides very precisely with \nthe problems we face on global warming. Ask any of the leading \nscientists in the\n\n[[Page S12291]]\n\nUnited States--not Senators, not people who go out and do fundraising \nand represent interests in the U.S. Senate--what they can tell you \nabout what we face in terms of potential catastrophic--and I underscore \nthat they use the word ``catastrophic''--climatic shifts about 50 years \nfrom now. That is precisely the amount of time we face with respect to \nthe potential for weaning ourselves from the dependency on oil.\n  Now, I hope we can stay away from these characterizations. I don't \nrepresent any group. I represent the State of Massachusetts. I \nrepresent my oath of office as a Senator to uphold the Constitution and \nlook out for the welfare of our country. I believe the welfare of our \ncountry is better served when we begin to create a true, independent \nenergy policy--a policy that brings us to independence from reliance on \noil. That is going to take a long time. I have no illusions about that.\n  There is no windmill that is going to substitute for that tomorrow. \nThere is no renewable or biomass that is going to substitute tomorrow. \nIt will take a period of transition and work. It is important that we \ndeal with the realities of this debate. The Senator from Alaska is \nabsolutely correct when he says that a 6-month supply is not the \nappropriate way to talk about this issue because that represents if the \nUnited States were cut off from all fuel. He is absolutely correct. A \n6-month supply--if you indeed have the amounts of oil some people \nsuggest might be there--is only a viable number if there were no other \nsuppliers from other places in the rest of the world. None of us are \npresuming, given our relationship with Great Britain, Venezuela, \nMexico, and other countries in the world, including our increasingly \nrenewed relationship with Russia, and our own production--nobody is \nreally looking at that as the potential.\n\n  This is a phony debate. The reason I say that is that I heard my \ncolleagues trying to scare Americans into believing that they ought to \nsomehow start digging in the Arctic because we are at war in \nAfghanistan, we have a threat in the Middle East, national security is \nat stake, and the military is at stake.\n  We have heard veterans groups recited here. I am a cofounder of the \nVietnam Veterans of America. I am a proud veteran. I am proud of my \nservice. I know enough about the military and the military needs, the \n300,000 or so barrels a day the military might consume under these \ncircumstances, to recognize that the 8 million barrels we produce in \nthe United States is going to satisfy the needs in an emergency of the \nmilitary.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, let me suggest to you why this is such an \nartificial debate. There are more than 7,000 leases for oil and gas \ndevelopment in the Gulf of Mexico open for exploration and for \ndevelopment today. As I stand here on the floor of the Senate tonight, \n7,000 leases are open for exploration, more than 80 percent covering 32 \nmillion acres, and are not producing oil. They are not drilling for \noil. They could be. Anybody who comes to the Senate floor and says that \ntoday you have to drill in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge because the \nUnited States is threatened is not telling the truth to the American \npeople because the fact is that there are countless millions--32 \nmillion, precisely, not countless. It is not just because they don't \nhave oil that they are not drilling. They are not drilling because they \nare being mapped for future production or they are simply sitting idle \nby choice because the economics drive that choice.\n  Individual companies that own leases have decided, for business \nreasons and most likely because of the oil price or infrastructure \nlimitations, they are not going to develop those leases now. They are \nwaiting for the price of oil to maximize profits. In fact, some \ncompanies--Exxon, to be precise--are letting their leases in the United \nStates sit idle while they invest in Saudi Arabia and other countries.\n  So don't let any Member of the U.S. Senate be cowed or stampeded into \nbelieving that this has anything to do with the current national \nsecurity issue of Afghanistan or the Middle East. We have oil we could \nbe drilling today.\n  Moreover, 95 percent of the Alaska oil shelf is open for drilling--95 \npercent of it.\n  Here is an article from The Energy Report, July 30, 2001:\n\n       Responding to increased industry interests in North Slope \n     gas, the State of Alaska plans to open up new acreage in the \n     North Slope foothills. . . .\n       Governor Tony Knowles recently announced that beginning \n     next May the State would include additional acreage in the 7 \n     million acre Foothills region in area-wide oil and gas lease \n     sales in its 2002-2006 leasing schedule. . . .\n\n  Moreover:\n\n       The Bureau of Land Management expects to hold a second oil \n     and gas lease sale in the northeast corner of the National \n     Petroleum Reserve-Alaska in June 2002. The agency will \n     reoffer approximately 3 million acres made available, but not \n     leased in the prior NPR-A sale in May 1999.\n\n  There it is. So there is no rush here. In effect, what we have in the \nground in the Alaska Wildlife Refuge, should the United States ever be \npushed to a corner and our back is up against the wall, we are at war \nor there is some circumstance where our allies have forsaken us, and we \nhaven't been smart enough as a government to make the choices that we \nhave today to move to alternatives and renewables and other forms of \npower, then we will have the most God-given ready natural Petroleum \nStrategic Reserve. Rather than buying it and putting it in the ground, \nit is in the ground, and we leave it there for that moment when the \nUnited States might need it.\n\n  I believe the reason I am here opposing this--not at the behest of \nany group--is because I have for 30 years been watching the United \nStates procrastinate. I remember as a young law student sitting in line \nat gas stations studying my torts and contracts while I was waiting an \nhour and a half to get gas. That was 1973. We were told: We have to be \nenergy independent; we have to work at this.\n  Then we imported 30 percent of our oil from other countries. Today we \nare over 50 percent. The fact is, there is one simple reality that our \nfriends from Alaska avoid: 25 percent of the oil reserves of the world \nare in other countries. We use 25 percent. The United States of America \nuses 25 percent of the oil reserves, but we only have 3 percent. Any \nschoolkid can figure out that if you only have 3 percent of something \nand you are using 25 percent, you either stop using it or you are going \nto have to get it from those other people. That is exactly what we are \nstuck in today.\n  No matter what figure we give the Senator from Alaska--if I take the \ntop figure of the Department of the Interior--and say it is $16 billion \nand you amortize that out, 1 million barrels a day, 365 days a year, so \nit is 1 billion barrels every 3 years or so----\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. KERRY. I want to finish what I am saying. We have very little \ntime. We are going to have weeks to debate this when we come back in \nJanuary, and I look forward to that debate to a great extent because \nthat is when we are going to help America view the possibility of \nalternatives.\n  For instance, in Europe, they have diesel engines. Their cars get 60 \nmiles to the gallon with a diesel engine. It is exactly as powerful as \nmany of our cars. The cars can go as fast. If you want to break the \nspeed limit with your 60-miles-per-gallon diesel, you can break the \nspeed limit, but you get 60 miles doing it.\n  We are going backwards. We used to get 27 miles per gallon. Now we \nare down to 22. We are doing worse than we were doing in 1973 when we \nsaid we would have to be energy independent.\n  Mr. President, there is a long litany, all the way through the years, \nthat world consumption of oil is about 70 million barrels a day. We \nproduce 8 million barrels. The amount that we produce, even if we \nincluded additional oil from Alaska, will never be sufficient to impact \nthe price of oil in the world market. So when my colleagues come to the \nChamber and suggest we are going to somehow change the price or \nincrease the supply on a long-term basis, that is not true, and I will \ndocument it.\n  From 1972 to 1975, America produced more than 70 percent of our oil \ndomestically. Oil prices climbed more than 400 percent when we produced \nit domestically. From 1979 through 1981, America produced more than 50 \npercent of\n\n[[Page S12292]]\n\nits oil, and oil prices more than doubled. That spike was set off by a \nnumber of events: OPEC, the Iranian revolution, the Iranian hostage \ncrisis, Middle Eastern production cuts, and the onset of the Iran-Iraq \nwar.\n  Through all of 1991, we produced 50 percent of our oil domestically. \nOil prices doubled. In 1999, we produced slightly less than 50 percent \nof our oil. Oil prices tripled from the historic flows.\n\n  The reverse has also been true. We have had low oil prices, and we \nhave had high imports. When oil reached a near record low in the late \n1990s, guess what. Imports climbed over 50 percent.\n  The fact is that U.S. production will not lower and stabilize the \nglobal price. Look at Great Britain. Great Britain is surplus in oil. \nGreat Britain produces enough oil to export. They do not affect the \nglobal price as a consequence of even being independent. There is no \nBritish market for oil. Prices rise and fall in Britain with the world \nprice, and we all know that for reasons of history, allegiance, \neconomics, and national security, they are enmeshed in global affairs \nas we are.\n  I will quote Lee Raymond, chairman and chief executive of \nExxonMobile:\n\n       The idea that this country can ever again be energy \n     independent is outmoded and probably was even in the era of \n     Richard Nixon. The point is that no industry in the world is \n     more globalized than our industry.\n\n  The conservative Cato Institute has said:\n\n       Even if all the oil we consumed in this country came from \n     Texas and Alaska, every drop of it, assume we didn't import \n     any oil from the Persian Gulf, prices would be just as high \n     today, and the main reason is that domestic prices will rise \n     to the world prices.\n\n  That is the Cato Institute. Do not tell us in this Chamber this is \ngoing to affect independence. It is not. We cannot produce enough oil. \nDo not tell us it is going to affect world price because there is not \nan economist who suggests it will. Then the question is: So why are we \ndoing this?\n  There is a better way than this alternative. We need to wean \nourselves from oil, and we need to engage in a program--H.R. 4 is an \nextraordinary giveaway program that does not do any of the things we \nneed to do in energy policy to create a truly independent nation.\n  I suggest this debate is going to be long, it is going to be \ninteresting, and we are going to provide this country with a set of \nalternatives. I am all for helping the folks in Alaska. I admire the \nway both Senators are fighting for the people of their State, but we \ncan find a better way to help the people in Alaska. There is an awful \nlot of oil. We should be building the natural gas pipeline tomorrow. If \nwe want to help the people of Alaska, that is the best way we can \ncreate jobs.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am glad to have been here when the \nSenator from Massachusetts was speaking. He is a friend. We have \nvisited one another and have shared the privilege of having wives who \nare great friends.\n  I say to my friend from Massachusetts, I hope if I ever stand on the \nfloor of the Senate and make a pledge on behalf of the people of Alaska \nto do something for Massachusetts that my successors will honor that. I \nstood here and debated with the predecessor of the Senator from \nMassachusetts for a long period of time in 1977, 1978, and 1979. We \nfinally ended up in Senator Jackson's hideaway for 3 days around the \nclock, and I mean around the clock.\n  We reached a conclusion, and that conclusion was an offer from the \nSenator from Massachusetts to me. It was: We will set aside 1.5 million \nacres up there so you can go ahead with that oil and gas development, \nbut let us create this system of withdrawals in this State. Almost 100 \nmillion acres in Alaska were set aside at that time.\n  For 9 years in this Chamber we debated what was a national interest \nof Alaska's land. Nine years, Mr. President, and the Senator from \nMassachusetts, God rest his soul, Paul Tsongas, said in Senator \nJackson's office: We can work this out. If you are willing to be \nreasonable, we will be reasonable. We will guarantee you that 1.5 \nmillion acres will be explored. Look at his record. In fact, when the \ntime comes to get down to debating whether or not this bill will pass, \nI hope it will be considered by the Senate as the Alaska pipeline was, \nas that 1980 act was: without filibuster. The pipeline was made \navailable to people in the United States by one vote. Vice President \nAgnew broke the tie and gave us the Alaska pipeline, which has brought \n13 billion barrels of oil to the United States.\n  I hear the estimates that we have nothing more than a 6-month supply \nin ANWR. That is ridiculous. At the time we were debating the Alaska \npipeline, they told us there would be approximately 1 billion barrels \nof oil, if you are successful. We have already produced 13 billion \nbarrels of oil, and we have a 15- to 20-year supply at the current \nrate, but that is not keeping the pipeline full.\n  People say: Why do you want to go ahead with ANWR now? During the \nPersian Gulf war, there were 2.1 million barrels a day of oil sent to \nthe south 48 from the Alaska pipeline. Today, it is 1.2. The pipeline \nis no longer full. The cost of Alaskan oil is going up because it is \nnot full. We know there is oil to be produced.\n  This 6-month supply theory is a very interesting thing. I will stand \non the other side of my chart so my friend can see it perhaps. This is \na chart that shows what happens with increased production. If we have \nno new production in Alaska, this is the flow of oil out to 2050. If we \nproduce in the Central part of Alaska, this is the flow of additional \noil. If we go through the National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska--which \nis another area set aside, by the way, by President Harding after the \nTeapot Dome. It has never really been produced. Again, my friend does \nnot like to be called a radical environmentalist. I think that is \nbetter than extreme environmentalist. In any event, this oil is not \navailable to us because we cannot get in there to drill, either.\n  The important thing is, this is ANWR. If ANWR comes in, this is the \nincrease in oil over this period between now and 2050 to the United \nStates. Look at it. It is more than what is there now. We believe there \nis more oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge area which is 1.5 \nmillion acres that was set aside for oil and gas production than we \nhave in all of Alaska's remaining lands now.\n  This area is the most important area for our energy sufficiency. I am \nnot talking about energy independence. It may be we could not get to be \nenergy independent, but think about this: This area is basically not \navailable to us. Access to the major pieces of the Outer Continental \nShelf is not available to us. The entire NPRA is not available to us, \nand ANWR is not available to us. Look what would happen in the next 20 \nyears if we did have it available to us. We would get up to the point \nwhere we are producing a great deal more, more than twice as much oil \nas we have available today from domestic production. Now that is energy \nsufficiency and it is energy independence in the sense of being able to \nexist through a period of crisis with our own production.\n  My friend wants to ask a question. I am glad to answer any question \nhe has.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, that very large increase \nof blue is based on the best assumption of what might be findable, am I \ncorrect?\n  Mr. STEVENS. No, that is not correct. That is the medium assumption.\n  Mr. KERRY. How many billions of barrels does that assume would be \npresent?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is 10.3 billion barrels.\n  Again, I point out to my friend from Massachusetts, the estimate for \nthe existing area of Prudhoe Bay was 1 billion barrels. We have \nproduced 13 billion so far.\n  The mean estimate is 10.3. We believe it is a lot bigger than that. \nIf oil is there, it is big. It is the biggest sedimentary basin on the \nNorth American continent if it contains oil. We do not know yet, but we \nwill not know until we drill.\n  The real point is, though, we can have a decided improvement in our \nability to rely upon our own sources in the event of a crisis if we \nreally go in and open up this area and it is producible. Remember, it \ntakes an act of Congress to open up. It is the only place in the United \nStates where the Mineral Leasing Act was qualified by a provision of \nCongress, and I agreed to that. That was a Tsongas provision. It will\n\n[[Page S12293]]\n\ntake an act of Congress, passed by both Houses and signed by the \nPresident, to do this oil and gas exploration.\n\n  The area remains subject to oil and gas exploration until it has been \nexplored. This will not become part of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge until it is explored. It is reserved for oil and gas \nexploration, in effect, until we get permission to go in to see if it \nis there or not.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Will my good friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. INOUYE. When we speak of ANWR, what are we talking about?\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are talking about the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge.\n  Mr. INOUYE. How large is that acreage?\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is 19 million acres. It was 9 million acres before \n1980 as the Arctic Wildlife Range.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Of that, how much is proposed to be set aside?\n  Mr. STEVENS. This entire 19 million acre area is the size of South \nCarolina. Of that, 1.5 million acres was set aside as the Coastal Plain \nfor oil and gas exploration. Of that 1.5 million acres area, we need \njust 2,000 acres to reach the vast amounts of oil and gas.\n  Mr. INOUYE. It is a small part of it?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Hawaii asked a very good question. At \nthe time that Prudhoe Bay was developed, we did not have today's \nadvanced technologies, such as horizontal drilling. We can access the \noil and gas from the entire 1.5 million acre area of this sedimentary \nbasin from just 2,000 acres.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I recall during the pipeline debate many of my colleagues \nand friends were suggesting the pipeline would decimate the caribou \nflock. I gather now that it has increased tenfold.\n  Mr. STEVENS. In parts of the State, it has increased nearly tenfold. \nIn the area of the pipeline, this 800-mile pipeline, without question \nevery one of the herds has increased by at least a magnitude of 4, some \nas much as 9 times. In fact, two of the herds now stay nearer to \nproduction areas because the food and the improvement of their habitat \nhas been so great.\n  By the way, because of acts of the oil industry, they went to our \nuniversity and developed new strains of grasses and new approaches to \nvegetation, and those caribou herds do not migrate at all. The one that \ncomes to the plain of the Arctic area into this 1002 area each year, it \ncomes in from Canada. It migrates up. It spends 6 weeks up in the \nsummertime. The Senator's question is very pertinent.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The pipeline has not decimated the caribou flock?\n  Mr. STEVENS. It has not, and this will not either because we do not \ndo oil and gas exploration in the summertime when they are there. We \nhave committed to be certain there would be no interference with the \ncaribou migration.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator for his questions.\n  What I think is important to do is to make sure the people understand \nthat because of the decline in the through-put of that pipeline, the \nTrans-Alaskan oil pipeline, we now are sending less than half of the \namount it was designed to carry on an average day to the Lower 48. It \nwas filled because of the discovery of the great Prudhoe Bay oilfield, \nand there was a second field discovered at Kuparuk. This area has \nproduced, as I said, 13 billion barrels of oil so far. One of the \nsadnesses I have, as I have already indicated, is that we had a \ncommitment. That 1980 act would not have become law if the Senators \nfrom Alaska had opposed it. The whole Congress knew that. It had almost \nbecome law in 1978 and my colleague objected, and we went back through \nthe process. The process came to fruition at the end of 1980. The act \npassed before the election. President Carter did not sign this bill \nbefore the election. After the election but before leaving office, \nafter President Reagan had been elected in the fall of 1980, President \nCarter signed it. In fact, he invited me to come to the White House at \nthe time. President Carter signed that bill, and he and others now \nraise objection to the provisions of the law he signed into law.\n\n  It is the feeling that one Congress cannot bind another, but the \nstatement of a Senator representing a State and a party ought to be \nbinding upon the Senate. We had exchange after exchange over the 1980 \nAlaska National Interest Conservation Lands Act, and I thought those \ncommitments were worth believing. I believed it when the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Tsongas, said he would stand by this concept of \na promise that this area would be explored and developed if it proved \nto have oil and gas. I trusted my late and dear friend Senator Henry \nScoop Jackson of Washington when he called us up to his office and said \nwe have to listen to Senator Tsongas because he is making an offer that \nis real; it was real.\n  Twenty years later, I am still in the Senate arguing for the Senate \nto observe the commitments that were made to our State and to the \npeople of the United States.\n  While I have this chart, I hope everyone will understand--the Senator \nfrom Hawaii asked about it--this is the State of Alaska, obviously. \nAlaska is one-fifth the land mass of the United States, 20 percent. It \nextends from one end of the Lower 48 to the other. It is almost as wide \nas the United States, and from Barrow down to Ketchikan it is like \ngoing from Duluth to New Orleans. This is an enormous area.\n  People ask: Why don't they go out here to NPRA and develop leases? \nBecause there is no transportation system. It takes a monstrous \ndevelopment of oil to support an 800-mile pipeline and run it a full \n365 days a year. Currently, we are running half full.\n  The wilderness area is the area colored in brown, the 1002 area on \nthe Coastal Plain is in green. It was guaranteed to Alaska to be \navailable for oil and gas exploration. With new technology, we propose \nto use just 2,000 acres. It is impossible to believe there is such a \nbattle over that. I point out, in this we call the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge Coastal Plain, set aside for oil and gas exploration, \nis a native village, the village of Kaktovik. Adjacent is the Sourdough \nOil Field. And 100 miles west are the two largest deposits of oil and \ngas on the North American Continent today and they are both producing.\n  Why do we do this? What is the national interest now? If ANWR is \nopen, 735,000 jobs will be created throughout the United States to get \nparts, people, produce--everything that is necessary to develop an area \nand support its development that far away from what we call the \ncontiguous 48 States.\n  This is a forecast made and relied upon by the great labor unions of \nthis country that I am proud to say are supporting our position that \nthis area ought to be opened to oil and gas development. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts said we should build a gas pipeline. Yes, we should. \nHowever, a gas pipeline is more affected by price than the oil \npipeline. Gas in our country fluctuates in great variation. Just 18 \nmonths ago we saw rolling blackouts in California and record high \nnatural gas prices. Now that is not going on because of a different \nprice structure and infrastructure for delivering the resource and \nvarying market conditions.\n  What we do not have is another enormous areas in the United States to \nexplore and develop with the same potential of the Arctic Plain.\n  Despite everything I have said, I will oppose the cloture vote for \nthis amendment. I believe the underlying bill, the Railroad Retirement \nAct, is essential to a great portion of the families of our working \npeople who have retired. I deplore the fact we have to have a cloture \nvote to get this bill acted upon. Having our own bill up there will \nmean, because of the passage of time, now we have to the end of this \nCongress. When we first started this we thought we had time to get H.R. \n4 considered and the Railroad Retirement Act passed, too. I don't see \nthat happening now. I intend to vote against cloture, although our \nprovision is in it, even though the ANWR provision is in H.R. 4. We \nought to get down to the business that is very meaningful to a great \nnumber of families. There are some families in Alaska affected by \nrailroad retirement issues, but only a few.\n  The families of former railroad workers should be assured we are \nconsiderate of their needs and understand their position. I hope that \nbill will pass, go to conference, and be approved after a conference. I \nunderstand there are a couple of provisions to which the administration \nhas objected. I hope they can be resolved. I don't think they\n\n[[Page S12294]]\n\naffect the basic provision of the retirement system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I comment relative to the statement by \nthe senior Senator from the State of Alaska. Our President has asked \nspecifically that the Democratic leadership pass three bills: Trade \npromotion, energy, and the economic stimulus bill. It seems to me the \nleadership has been reluctant to do so. The justification for that is \nbeyond me other than, clearly, it is fair to say the objections, to a \nlarge degree, are centered around the energy bill.\n  I will continue my dialog relative to what we are doing. It is Monday \nafternoon and we have an underlying railroad retirement bill with two \namendments: One is cloning and the other is H.R. 4, the energy bill. To \nmake sure anyone that perhaps has misunderstood the statements on the \nother side relative to the tax portion, in our bill there is no \nprovision for tax increases. That $33 billion in the House bill is not \nin this version of H.R. 4. The inconsistency is because the Democratic \nleader has refused to negotiate on the requests of our President: Trade \npromotion, energy, and the economic stimulus. Instead, he is moving \nahead, now with the railroad retirement and the farm bill next.\n  Is it not rather interesting that we cannot at this time get an \nenergy bill up when, clearly, we have a crisis in the Middle East? It \nis interesting to reflect on the comments associated with the \nleadership in the Senate. It is clear that the Senator is blocking a \nvote precisely for one reason. He knows Alaskans have the votes to pass \nout an energy bill in this body if given an opportunity. Has he given \nthis opportunity to us? Clearly, he has not. He has indicated in \nseveral statements: My comment is we will raise the issue, debate it, \nand have a good opportunity to consider energy legislation prior to the \nFounders Day break in mid-February.\n  If the leader would conclude by suggesting we would resolve it by \nthen, in other words, by Founders' Day, or at some specific time, then \nI think we could have a fair vote. All we are asking is for a fair vote \non the issue.\n  He indicated further: There will be votes on ANWR, but I'm not at \nthis point ready to commit to an up-or-down vote.\n  He is saying we will have to overcome a cloture vote. We cannot have \na simple majority vote. The inconsistency goes further. Senator Stevens \nreferences several items; I go back to a personal item, the attitude of \nthe people living in the North Slope of Alaska. Those who have gone up \nthere and taken advantage of the invitation have come back with the \nsincere appreciation and understanding that these people are Americans, \nthey have a right to life, they have a right to look towards a future \nbased on reasonable economic development prospects, health benefits, \nand so forth.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record upon completion \nof my statement a letter from the president of the Arctic Slope \nCorporation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. He indicates:\n\n       Dear Representative: The decision to allow oil and gas \n     development in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife has significant impacts on our effort to make a \n     success of the very directive of Congress in ANCSA. Our self \n     determination is at stake. It is fundamentally unfair, \n     dishonest, and potentially unlawful to deny us the right to \n     see our land and the small area of the Coastal Plain opened \n     to exploration of development. Congress made a deal with our \n     people and we have tried hard to play by the rules.\n  Now it is denying us that progress.\n\n  Here is a picture of a building in Kaktovik, including the community \nhall. There are two people, the boy on the bicycle and the older man on \nthe snow machine, which represents the significance of the picture. We \nhave some other pictures here showing some of the kids. I do this so we \ncan get a feel for the real, warm, personal association of what this \nmeans to the people of Kaktovik.\n\n  The letter further states:\n\n       By locking up ANWR, the Inupiat people are asked to become \n     museum pieces, not a dynamic and living culture. We are asked \n     to suffer the burdens of locking up our lands forever as if \n     we were in a zoo or on display for the rich tourists that can \n     afford to travel to our remote part of Alaska. This is not \n     acceptable.\n\n  I think that is an appropriate comment.\n  Further:\n\n       The Inupiat of the North Slope have lived and subsisted \n     across the Arctic for thousands of years. Learning not only \n     to survive, but to develop a rich culture, in the harsh \n     environment of the Arctic has instilled a deep respect and \n     appreciation in the Inupiat Eskimo people for that \n     environment and the animals that inhabit our area. We don't \n     need outside ``environmentalists'' telling what to do with \n     our homelands. Our own development standards and the controls \n     imposed by our locally controlled borough government will \n     ensure that these lands are protected. It is our people that \n     live in ANWR, particularly the Coastal Plain of ANWR. . . .\n\n  He concludes this letter by saying:\n\n       I beseech you to search in your heart to do what is right \n     for my people. Do not let the misguided intent of a few do \n     harm to the Inupiat Eskimo. Do not defeat the very Act you \n     passed a generation ago. Support the passage of legislation \n     to open the Coastal Plain of ANWR to oil and gas development. \n     I and my people--the real people--thank you for consideration \n     of our request.\n\n  That is the reference in the reflection from the people who are \naffected by this action.\n  We have little notes here, many of them supporting opening the ANWR \ndevelopment because it gives them opportunities. These are \nopportunities that your children and my children perhaps take for \ngranted. What are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to be \nisolated? They have a landmass of about 95,000 acres I can show you on \nthis chart. There it is, right in the middle of the 1002 area, right in \nthe middle of the 1.9 million acres of land we are talking about. But \n95,000 is private land, owned by these Native people. Until Congress \ngives them the right to initiate exploration, they cannot even drill \nfor natural gas on their own lands to heat their own homes. That is an \nabsolute injustice. None of the speakers talks about the people of the \narea. They ignore the people. They do not want to acknowledge that \nthere is any existence of a footprint of man up there. That is a rather \nblatant and I think inappropriate way to simply dismiss this matter.\n  The assumption is this area has never been touched. It has been \ntouched. There is the village of Kaktovik, the people who live there, \ntheir homes, their generators. They have a dependence on a way of life. \nBy putting a fence around them and not allowing the appropriate \nopening, we clearly are disenfranchising them as some other class of \nAmerican citizens. I find that terribly offensive.\n  I think each Member should reflect a little bit on the realities. I \nhave to acknowledge my expertise based on having visited the area, \nhaving met with the people, and having an understanding. But my \nopponents can just generalize and brush it off, that the concerns of \nthe people of the area do not amount to anything.\n  Furthermore, as we look at some of the statements that have been made \nabout the coastal area--I am going to put up a chart. The statement has \nbeen made that 95 percent of the coastal area is open for leasing. That \nis absolutely wrong. That is absolutely wrong. Mr. President, 14 \npercent of Alaska's arctic coastal lands are open for oil and gas \nexploration. There it is. It covers the entire breadth from the \nCanadian boundary, past Point Barrow, around to Point Wales.\n  The fact is, only 14 percent of Alaska's arctic coastal lands are \nopen to oil and gas exploration. These are the lands that are owned by \nthe State of Alaska between the Colville and Canning Rivers. If the \nANWR Coastal Plain were open to exploration, the total would only rise \nto 25 percent.\n  The breakdown on that is that the ANWR Coastal Plain is 11 percent, \nANWR is about 5, the National Petroleum Reserve is 52 percent. That \narea is not open. If you look at the area, you can see numerous lakes. \nThere is legitimate environmental concern associated with activity in \nthose areas, and that is why leases have not been granted by the \nDepartment of the Interior.\n  As we look through the general discussion on this issue, all we want \nis an up-or-down vote on the issue of an energy bill. That energy bill \nshould contain ANWR.\n  The position we have been put in is rather extraordinary. As a \nSenator, I\n\n[[Page S12295]]\n\nresent it. The authority has been taken away from the committee of \njurisdiction, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. It has been \ntaken over by the Democratic leadership; they say they will introduce a \nbill very soon, perhaps this week. But that bill has not had a hearing, \nit has not gone through the Energy Committee.\n\n  We have had 14 years or more of ANWR in the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. We have had over 50 witnesses. We have had over 14 \nhearings. We are ready to go with a bill that has already passed the \nHouse of Representatives. That is H.R. 4. That is what is before us \nnow.\n  As a consequence, what the Democratic leadership has decided to do is \nsimply take away the authorization from the committee process and \ndirect it simply from the office of the majority leader to the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  I do not know whether that is the kind of debate he is talking about \nat a later date, but I am not going to sit by and lose opportunities to \nobject to unanimous consent request until we get some kind of agreement \nfrom the Democratic leadership that we can have an up-or-down vote on \nan energy bill in a time sequence that reflects the ability to complete \nit.\n  The idea of coming in when we come back in January and starting a \ndebate on the issue, and then pulling it down, is just not good enough.\n  I think the support associated with this issue has gained a broad \nenough base that we could simply demand it, and the political downside \nto it, from those who are in opposition to it, I think is significant. \nWhat you are going to have to do is vote on what is right for America. \nIf we do not develop this area in Alaska, we are going to bring in oil \nto California, Washington, Oregon--the west coast of the United States. \nDo you know how it is going to come in? It is going to come in foreign \nvessels, not come down in U.S. flagged vessels, as Alaska oil must come \ndown under the Jones Act. It is not going to result in 19 new double-\nhulled tankers being built to bring Alaska's oil down to the west \ncoast. It is going to come down in foreign tankers with foreign crews. \nSo we are looking at a stimulus package. We are looking at jobs.\n  To suggest it is a 6-month supply, Senator Kerry already acknowledged \nthat was not a fair association. To suggest it is a 10-year process is \ntotally unrealistic. We could have oil flowing within 18 to 24 months \nbecause we only have to put in a lateral pipeline. To suggest the \nPorcupine caribou herd is going to be impoverished is absolutely \nwithout foundation, based on our experience with the central arctic \nherd that has grown from 3,000 to 26,000.\n  Take them down the line. The emotional arguments used are based on \nenvironmental groups that use this issue for membership and dollars, \nand it has been great for them. The American public is starting to wake \nup now and say: Hey, wait a minute, why can't we open there? Don't we \nneed the jobs? Don't we have a recession in jobs? This is going to \ncreate 240,000 jobs. We need to have jobs in this country. We need to \nbuild ships in our shipyards.\n  I grant we are not going to eliminate our dependence on imported oil, \nbut we can reduce it. Isn't that good for America? Isn't that good for \nthe balance of payments? These are positive. That is why the unions are \nfor it. The environmentalists are saying, no, you can't do it, but they \ngive different reasons, none of which holds water or oil. They simply \nare a flash in the pan.\n  When you start looking at the groups that support this, it is a broad \ngroup. It is the veterans. It is the unions. It is the senior citizens. \nIt goes right down the line, on and on. These people are saying: Let's \nwake up to a reality. The reality is we need this action in the United \nStates, and we need it now, and we should have it.\n  As we look at the general list of those who support it, it is growing \nall the time. We have all the major Jewish organizations.\n  Let's reflect on their individual interests. The Jewish organizations \nlook at the future of Israel, as they should. They look at it very \nmeaningfully because of what has happened in that part of the world. \nThey know what funds terrorism. It is oil. The wealth of OPEC and the \nwealth in areas associated with that part of the world is accumulated \nprimarily by one thing. That is the accumulation of oil. What funds bin \nLaden? Where did his association with Saudi Arabia and his background \nwith those things come from? Those things came, very frankly, from the \nassociation with oil.\n  As we look at the current situation with Saddam Hussein, how ironic. \nHow inconsistent can we be? I have said this in this Chamber time and \ntime again. I know the Chair recalls it. We are buying a million \nbarrels of oil from Saddam Hussein. We are using his oil to go back and \ntake out his targets. He uses our cash for an obvious purpose: To take \ncare of his Republican Guard, and perhaps develop missile capability \nand aim it at Israel.\n  What has happened? This should bear on the conscience of every \nMember. Within the last 2 weeks, we have lost two American sailors. \nThey were doing their job. They were boarding a ship coming out of one \nof the ports in Iraq that was smuggling illegal oil. It was apprehended \nby the U.S. Navy. The ship sank, and two of our sailors drowned.\n  Talk about connections and interactions. I will not make a direct \nlink. But the pathetic part of this is that should never have happened. \nWe should not be buying oil from Saddam Hussein. The U.N. in their \noversight of that particular process should not be allowing blatantly \nillegal exports of oil out of Iraq. It is happening every day. It has \ncost us two lives.\n  When we get down to voting on these measures, we have to look at what \nis right for the environment, right down the line: Can we open it \nsafely? What is the footprint? It is 2,000 acres out of 19 million \nacres. It was said the other day Robert Redford has an 11,000-acre farm \nin Utah, as a matter of comparison. Can we protect the caribou? Yes. Do \nwe need the oil? Yes. Do we need the jobs? Yes. Does it affect the \neconomy of this country? Yes. Does it affect our balance of payments? \nIt is a plus-plus-plus. Almost everybody can figure it out, except some \npeople who are wedded to the dictate of America's environmental \ncommunity.\n  The most pathetic part of it is, with one exception, the speakers \ntoday have never chosen to visit the area. They have never chosen to \ntalk to the people who live in the area. They have never thought to \nconsider the personal relationship of these people and their own hopes \nand aspirations.\n  As we look at the coming situation, I can honestly say I fear for the \nwest coast of the United States because if they don't get their oil \nfrom Alaska, California, Oregon, Washington, and Utah are going to get \ntheir oil directly from overseas in foreign flagged vessels built in \nforeign yards with foreign crews. It seems to me the most secure source \nyou can get it from is a little north of the west coast. That happens \nto be in my State of Alaska.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  I think it is important for Members to recognize just what my \nposition is in this rather awkward situation with railroad retirement \nand the energy bill.\n\n  I regret that the majority leader has placed us in the situation we \nare now in, but we are here. I want to explain why I will oppose \ncloture on both the Lott amendment and the substitute amendment the \nmajority leader offered. As a consequence, I will be voting against \ncloture.\n  I will oppose cloture on the Lott amendment for two reasons.\n  First, I have always said our national energy security demands a \nfull, open, and honest debate. We have been precluded from having a \nfull debate on this issue. The time may come when cloture needs to be \ninvoked on the legislature on a particular amendment, but not at the \noutset. Cloture on the Lott amendment would limit that full, open, and \nhonest debate. I don't believe it should be limited.\n  Second, the authorization text of H.R. 4 was filed--the House-passed \nenergy measure. This is not the text that I believe the Senate should \nenact without change.\n  There are a variety of amendments that I believe the Senate should \nconsider. One is an extension of Price-Anderson. That will be \nforeclosed as nongermane if cloture is invoked.\n  As you may know, I am more than a little frustrated that we have been \nsitting around here when we could have\n\n[[Page S12296]]\n\nbeen debating an energy bill from the Energy Committee. But that \nopportunity was taken away by the Democratic leader.\n  I am going to vote against cloture on the Daschle substitute because \nhe has offered no other alternative apparently for the remainder of \nthis year. If cloture is invoked, the Lott amendment falls as \nnongermane.\n  Once again, the majority leader has frustrated the Senate and the \nAmerican people in dealing with the energy policy. When I say \n``frustrated,'' I mean not allowing it to come up--taking it away from \nthe authority of the Energy Committee, which has jurisdiction.\n  Until we get this matter resolved, there is the only way that the \nSenate can debate energy policy--by defeating both cloture motions. If \nboth cloture motions are defeated, where will we be? H.R. 10, the House \npension reform bill, will be before the Senate, and the Daschle \nsubstitute on railroad retirement will remain intact. Pending will be \nthe Lott amendment that adds energy legislation to the Daschle \nsubstitute, and that amendment will be open to a second-degree \namendment.\n  I fully support dealing with railroad retirement. In fact, I am going \nto vote for it.\n  If the majority leader would stop this charade with our national \nsecurity and provide an opportunity for the Senate to work its will on \nenergy and proceed to conference with the House on H.R. 4, I would be \nhappy to take my charts out of the back office. As it is, the closest \nwe seem to get to the consideration of an energy bill is perhaps a lump \nof coal in the majority leader's stocking.\n  The only way for the Senate at this time to have a full, open, and \nhonest debate on energy policy is to defeat both cloture motions and \nbegin that debate, which we are ready to do.\n  I apologize again for the manner in which this has come up, but the \nmajority leader has given us no alternative. Apparently he intends to \nproceed that way. We will have to use whatever parliamentary precedents \nare available to get this bill up, or get a commitment from the \nmajority letter that he will allow an energy bill to be taken up at a \ncertain time and conclude it by a certain time. I will not agree to \nsimply take it up and not giving us some kind of inclusive date on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n\n                                  Arctic Slope Regional Corp.,\n\n                                     Anchorage, AK, July 30, 2001.\n       Dear Representative: I am writing this letter on behalf of \n     my people--the indigenous residents of the North Slope of \n     Alaska. Thirty years ago the U.S. Congress put us on a path \n     to modern corporate development with the passage of the \n     Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) and establishment \n     of our regional corporation--the Arctic Slope Regional \n     Corporation. Congress essentially told us (we rally had no \n     choice) to take some cash and land, in exchange for our \n     aboriginal land claims, and ``have a go at'' making those \n     assets into an economic enterprise. Despite the fact that \n     most of the potentially valuable lands for resource \n     development were off limits to our initial selection of \n     lands, we made the best of it and put together a land \n     portfolio with resource and habitat values. We now find \n     ourselves with our fate once again in the hands of Congress.\n       The decision to allow oil and gas development in the \n     Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife has significant \n     impacts on our effort to make a success of the very directive \n     of Congress in ANCSA. Our self determination is at stake. It \n     is fundamentally unfair, dishonest and potentially unlawful \n     to deny us the right to see our land and the small area of \n     the Coastal Plain opened to exploration and development. \n     Congress made a deal with my people and we have tried to play \n     by the rules--now it is denying us that promise. The \n     corporate model imposed by ANCSA was an intentional decision \n     by Congress to avoid the path pursued with Native American \n     tribes in the lower 48 states and their history of broken \n     treaties. Now, however, we find ourselves in a situation of \n     having the commitments made in the potential benefits of \n     ANCSA for the Inupiat people being ``broken''.\n       We have tried to keep our side of the bargain, even if we \n     did not have a choice and gave up many, many times the value \n     of what was received in return. The Inupiat people have taken \n     the values of the western culture and corporate America and \n     the traditional values of our people to blend them into a \n     culture that will survive far into the future. Our \n     subsistence lifestyles and ties to the land and sea continue \n     while we also participate in a cash economy. We have \n     made strides in educating our people and providing basic \n     services that simply did not exist in any form in our \n     communities when ANCSA was passed. ANCSA was a great \n     social experiment that has had many successes. But it now \n     appears that Congress does not want to keep its side of \n     the deal; it wants to defeat the very experiment it \n     mandated must be followed. By locking up ANWR, the Inupiat \n     people are asked to become museum pieces, not a dynamic \n     and living culture. We are asked to suffer the burdens of \n     locking up our lands forever as if we were in a zoo or on \n     display for the rich tourists that can afford to travel to \n     our remote part of Alaska. This is not acceptable. But, \n     maybe we shouldn't be surprised.\n       The Inupiat people that live in ANWR, the residents of the \n     village of Kaktovik, are no stranger to the heavy hand of the \n     federal government. It was not that many years ago that the \n     U.S. military came to the village of Kaktovik and bulldozed \n     homes of people without the smallest amount of human dignity \n     or respect for the people living there. There was no \n     explanation, no compensation and no apology to the families \n     that were literally thrown out of their homes--and it \n     happened more than once. Anecdotal comments after the fact \n     indicated that the officials involved considered the Eskimo \n     people's homes ``just shacks'' anyway and the people \n     themselves hardly due treatment as human beings. These are \n     well documented but seldom told stories. This history hardly \n     gives the Inupiat people faith that they can expect fair \n     treatment at the hands of the federal government. To have the \n     purposes of ANCSA so boldly frustrated only makes this worse.\n       The Inupiat of the North Slope have lived and subsisted \n     across the Arctic for thousands of years. Learning not only \n     to survive, but to develop a rich culture, in the harsh \n     environment of the Arctic has instilled a deep respect and \n     appreciation in the Inupiat Eskimo people for that \n     environment and the animals that inhabit our area. We don't \n     need outside ``environmentalists'' telling what to do with \n     our homelands. Our own development standards and the controls \n     imposed by our locally controlled borough government will \n     ensure that these lands are protected. It is our people that \n     live in ANWR, particularly the Coastal Plain of ANWR, because \n     we are traditionally a marine coastal and nomadic people. We \n     are fully capable of balancing development and environmental \n     protection for the long term value of the entire nation. For \n     us it's a matter of life or death; we do not eat without the \n     animals. Our life and our culture are tied to the land, the \n     sea and the animals. Even with the changes brought about by \n     ANCSA and a developing cash economy, our people maintain \n     these ties. But, do not ask us to give up all chances for \n     realizing the promises of ANCSA and bear the burden of \n     supposedly preserving an area for the entire nation. That is \n     patently unfair and misguided because it is not threatened by \n     the small amount of development that would actually occur for \n     oil and gas activities. Furthermore, none of this development \n     would take place in the areas of ANWR that are classified \n     already as wilderness where so many of the scenic vistas are \n     located that have been used to cloud the issue about \n     development on the more northern Coastal Plain.\n       Much has been said about who are the ``real'' people of \n     ANWR that are at risk by potential oil and gas development. \n     It is the residents of Kaktovik that live there. While the \n     Gwichin to the south also use the caribou that migrate \n     through the ANWR area, they are not Inupiat which is \n     literally translated as the ``real people.'' Years ago we \n     might have feared development, but we have learned that \n     development and subsistence can coexist. The Gwichin chose to \n     opt out of the provisions of ANCSA, that was their choice. \n     Their position, which we still feel is fundamentally flawed, \n     should not be allowed to frustrate the commitments of ANCSA \n     that we did choose to accept.\n       I beseech you to search in your heart to do what is right \n     for my people. Do not let the misguided intent of a few do \n     harm to the Inupiat Eskimo. Do not defeat the very Act you \n     passed a generation ago. Support the passage of legislation \n     to open the Coastal Plain of ANWR to oil and gas development. \n     I and my people--the real people--thank you for consideration \n     of our request. Quanukpuk.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Jacob Adams,\n\n                                                        President,\n                                Arctic Slope Regional Corporation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today's vote on the Lott amendment will be \nthe beginning of the debate on two very important issues. One of them \nhas to do with an energy bill, which, as we all know, our majority \nleader has scheduled for debate in less than 60 days.\n  This particular version contains drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge, as my colleague has discussed for many days now.\n  My view is that if there are other ways to have an energy policy that \nleaves the wildlife refuge intact, I am for it. I will point out ways \nto avoid drilling in such a refuge.\n  The second issue that is combined with it deals with stem cell \nresearch.\n  In our vote, we will answer the question: Should we in this single \nvote not only say yes to drilling in ANWR but also say yes to derailing \nstem cell research by stopping it dead in its tracks, really, without \nlooking at it?\n\n[[Page S12297]]\n\n  I don't see any problem in banning human cloning. I think we would \nget 100 to 0 on that one. It is a very easy thing that we can do. But \nwhy would we want to derail stem cell research?\n  I am certainly willing to vote no on the Lott amendment that contains \nboth of these issues: Drilling in the Alaska wildlife refuge and \nstopping stem cell research.\n  The Senator from Alaska is quite open on the point of drilling and \nmakes the case very well.\n  He brings up a number of issues. First of all, he criticizes people \nwho are for retaining the wildlife refuge if they have not actually \ngone to see it. Let me say that many of us have and some of us have \ntried. I sent one of my top environmental aides there and got a full \nreport on it.\n  The bottom line is, the Senator from Alaska and others have not seen \nevery single national park, have not been into the Sierras in my State, \ninto every little town. Yet they weigh in on logging debates. So that \nis a bogus issue.\n  The issue is, How do we have better energy independence? I think I \nspeak with some authority--a little bit, in any event--because in our \nState of California, we were hit with a horrific shortage of \nelectricity, and it was even predicted we would have brownouts and \nblackouts and there would be rioting in the streets. The bottom line \nis, because the people in my State understood this, they began to be \nenergy efficient, making very small changes in their daily lives that \nnever even impacted on their comfort, really. We have saved about 11 \npercent in our energy use. We avoided all of these problems.\n  My friend talks about the creation of jobs. This is an important \nissue. I know some of the unions are backing drilling because of that. \nLet me say to my friend, the fact is, if you produce energy-efficient \nappliances, you create many jobs. If you produce energy-efficient \nautomobiles--hybrid vehicles; so many other ideas; electric cars--you \nwill produce jobs. Alternative energy in itself produces jobs, whether \nit is solar power, wind power, whether it is biomass--all of these \ncreate jobs, and not only good jobs, but the whole green technology is \na technology that we can export around the world as the whole world \nlooks for ways not to choke on gasoline fumes. We can do it. We can do \nit and meet our energy needs and become independent of imported oil.\n  I find it so interesting when my friends from Alaska talk because \nthey fought me when I wanted to make sure there was a ban on exporting \nAlaskan oil. We used to have that in place because I made the point, as \nmany of my colleagues did at the time, that we needed that oil to stay \nhome in America because we wanted energy independence. But both my \nfriends fought to allow us to export Alaskan oil. I find it very \ninteresting.\n  So we have so many ways we can win this energy battle. One way is to \nraise the fuel economy standards of automobiles. Just take SUVs. If the \nSUVs met the same standard as a regular sedan, in 7 years we would save \nas much oil as there is in ANWR.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me repeat that. If we simply did one thing, and that is, got the \nSUVs to have the same fuel economy as a sedan--and, by the way, that is \nquite doable--we would, in 7 years, have ``produced'' enough oil to \nequal that of ANWR by saving it. By the way, that happens \nexponentially. In the next 7 years, there is another ANWR. Every 7 \nyears you save another ANWR.\n  So to stand in this Chamber and say the only way to become energy \nindependent is by drilling in a refuge I just do not think stands the \nlight of scrutiny.\n  I am looking forward so much to having the debate on the energy bill, \nas Senator Daschle has promised. He is very interested in having that \ndebate, as well, but he does not want to have that debate up against \nthe December timeframe when we have so much to do relative to economic \nstimulus, when we are looking at bioterrorism. We must get the vaccines \nin place for smallpox. There is so much we need to deal with, including \nthe appropriations conference reports. So I think Senator Daschle has \ndone the right thing by setting aside a time, within 60 days, when we \ncan have this debate.\n\n  The President, using his Executive powers, overturned a rule that \nPresident Clinton put in place that said that air-conditioners should \nbecome more efficient. That particular rule was even supported by many \nof the people in the industry itself. By canceling that, we are again \nbeing beholden to Middle East oil. So there are so many things I want \nto talk about when that energy bill comes before us.\n  In California, I drive a hybrid vehicle. If people look at you and \nsay that sounds very strange, well, you fill it up with gas, just the \nsame way you do any other car, and the computer within the car knows \nwhen it is more efficient to be running on gas or running on \nelectricity. When you step on the brake, it charges the battery. So we \nare getting about 50 miles to the gallon.\n  As someone who has been sharply critical of the increase in oil \nprices, finally they have come down. I am convinced regulatory agencies \nwill not do a thing about high prices. We had them cold on what I \nbelieve was very close to price fixing. We had them cold on harassing \nindependent station owners who wanted to lower prices. We had them cold \non that. But we could not move the regulatory agencies.\n  One way you fight back is you drive a car that gets 50 miles to the \ngallon. You can do it. You can buy it pretty cheaply. I encourage \npeople to do that. So I do look forward to taking up the energy bill.\n  On the issue, again, of stem cell research, this is one that is so \nimportant. I have seen a list of the groups that oppose Senator \nBrownback's 6-month moratorium. I think it is very important because \nsometimes you learn a lot from supporters and opponents.\n  Let me read to you the list of opponents to the 6-month moratorium on \nstem cell research: Alliance for Aging Research, Alpha One Foundation, \nAmerican Academy of Optometry, American Association of Cancer Research, \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics, American Infertility Association, \nAmerican Liver Foundation, American Physiological Society, American \nSociety for Reproductive Medicine, American Society for Cell Biology, \nAmerican Society of Hematology, Association of American Medical \nColleges. All of these, and more, oppose, very strongly, a 6-month \nmoratorium on stem cell research.\n  Here are some others: Association of Professors of Medicine, \nBiotechnology Industry Organization, Coalition of National Cancer \nCooperative Groups, Cure for Lymphoma, Genetic Alliance, Harvard \nUniversity, Hope for ALS, the International Foundation for Anticancer \nDrug Discovery--and it goes on--the Juvenile Diabetes Research \nFoundation International--those folks came to visit many of us in our \noffices--the Kidney Cancer Foundation, Medical College of Wisconsin, \nMount Sinai School of Medicine, National AIDS Treatment Advocacy \nProject, National Patient Advocate Foundation, Research America, \nResolve, Society for Women's Health Research, and it goes on.\n  So the bottom line is, we have a chance today, by voting against the \nLott amendment, to send two very important messages: Yes, we want an \nenergy policy, but we want it to be well thought out. There can be \ndifferences on whether the Alaska Wildlife Refuge is pristine, whether \nit is worth saving. I am willing to get into that debate. That is a \nfair debate. But wouldn't it be an interesting debate to find out what \nour other options are and then to decide if it is truly worth the \ngamble? People I know and respect say it isn't worth the gamble. And on \nstem cell research, clearly, it is time to continue this research while \nwe ban human cloning. The Brownback amendment does not do that.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am aware that the other side has until \n4:45. I ask unanimous consent to speak as though we had reached 4:45, \nwhich starts the time running for our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/03/senate-section/article/S12298-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12298-S12299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12298]]\n                           REMEMBER NEW YORK\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today, as I did several times \nlast week and before, to remind all of us, and especially my \ncolleagues, of the destruction and devastation that took place on \nSeptember 11, and persists today, nearly 12 weeks after.\n  Tomorrow will be the 12th week since we were attacked on September \n11. The New York City Partnership and Comptroller estimate that the \neconomic impact of the attack will near $100 billion in damage for New \nYork's economy. Today, 83 days after the attacks on our Nation, \nthousands of the businesses and residents who were physically displaced \nby the destruction, by the loss of power and telephone access, by the \ndebris removal efforts, by the poor air quality, by the crime scene \ndesignation, are still awaiting some help, any help from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Our Constitution guarantees to protect every State against invasion. \nThe President said in his joint address to Congress just 10 days after \nthe attacks:\n\n       We will rebuild New York City.\n\n  That same day earlier, my colleague, Senator Lott said, while \nvisiting New York:\n\n       We are here to commit to the people of New York City . . . \n     that we will stand with you.\n\n  Congressman Gephardt, the House minority leader, said in his weekly \nradio address:\n\n       We will work to make the broken places right again. We will \n     rebuild New York.\n\n  Eighty-three days since the terrorists chose to attack America by \nattacking New York and having lost thousands and thousands of innocent \nlives, we are still taking stock of the damage that we, as a city, a \nState, and a country have suffered. We know we can't get those innocent \nlives back, and every day I and my staff work with the families who \nlost their loved ones trying to make sure that they do get the help \nthey need.\n  In addition to the lives that were so brutally taken, those attacks \nalso took many livelihoods. We can do something about that. Yes, we did \nlose 15 to 20 million square feet of office space; nearly one-third of \nall space in Lower Manhattan, either completely destroyed or seriously \ndamaged. Yes, we did have extensive damage to our transportation \nsystem, and it has been devastating for thousands of people trying to \nget to work not to have those subway lines, not to have that PATH train \ncoming in right under the river, underneath the World Trade Center. We \nknow the kind of damage that our small business owners have been \nsuffering has been devastating.\n  What has happened is the attacks, because of the loss of \ntransportation and because of the crime scene designation, have \ndisplaced over half a million commuters who travel to Lower Manhattan. \nWe have 10 subway stations that usually handle about 40 percent of the \ndowntown commuters that have been closed throughout most of October. \nThat is why we recognize we can't possibly do this without the help of \nAmerica.\n  Estimates to rebuild the 1,700 feet of collapsed tunnel on the 1 and \n9 subway lines directly beneath the World Trade Center are in the \nbillions of dollars. The same is true of the estimates to rebuild the \nPATH train station that brings commuters from New Jersey into Lower \nManhattan. We also have been told it will take up to $250 million to \nrepair the damaged streets around the World Trade Center. And still, as \nwe speak, almost one-third of Lower Manhattan permits only restricted \nvehicular access because of the crime scene designation.\n  These are cost estimates only of direct impact and damage, not future \nlosses, not lost revenues. These are the costs for hazardous material \nremoval, for site remediation, for capital costs for rebuilding.\n  New York City, it is estimated, is likely to lose 125,000 jobs in \nthis fourth quarter. We already lost 79,000 jobs in October alone.\n  These are staggering numbers, but they only tell half the story \nbecause I could literally fill this Chamber with people who have seen \ntheir businesses devastated, who have lost their jobs. The quotes we \nsee from so many of our leaders have been comforting and very \nsupportive, but we know that we need more than comfort. We need more \nthan rhetoric. We need tangible support. It is imperative that we get \nas much of that support as possible.\n  I personally think it is very similar to the other devastating crises \nthat have hit our country. Most of them were natural disasters, but we \nalso can't forget Oklahoma City. We can't forget the New Mexico fires. \nIf you look at past disasters, the Federal Government, through our \nCongress, responded appropriately and swiftly. The Congress came \ntogether in a time of need, whether it was Hurricane Hugo or the \nNorthridge earthquakes or Oklahoma City.\n  This chart illustrates the level of Federal response after just a few \nof a sample of major disasters. In each case, the Federal response was \nnearly 40 percent of the estimated economic loss. In New York City, a \ncomparable amount would be 40 percent of the approximate $100 billion \nof economic damage. Yet we haven't received, in as timely a manner, the \npercentage share that others have.\n  The appropriated assistance that came within 3 to 4 months after the \nMidwest floods was more than 40 percent. After the Northridge \nearthquake, 26 days after, more than 30 percent of the total loss had \nalready been appropriated; after the Oklahoma City bombing, within 99 \ndays, more than 40 percent.\n  What do we have? We have a few billion dollars that have been sent to \nFEMA to help pay for the costs that have been incurred, and that is it. \nWe don't have a special appropriation that has been passed. We don't \nhave an emergency supplemental. We are counting on getting that in the \nnext few days because we want to be sure that New York gets the money \nappropriated that we need to have to count on to get about the business \nof rebuilding and restoring. And 79 days later, when this chart was \nmade--now we are at 83 days--we were below 5 percent, far below the \npace of what was done for other major disasters in our country.\n\n  If you look at the headlines from other major disasters, ``One Month \nAfter Hurricane Andrew''--which I visited in 1992, the site of that \ndevastation, ``Bush,'' the first President Bush, ``approves $11.1 \nbillion in Hurricane Aid.'' It didn't take long at all to get that \nmoney flowing. Compare where we are with the damage done to New York.\n  After the 1993 Midwest floods, 7 months after, ``Families Pour Out \nPraise For Flood Agencies.'' They not only got the money appropriated, \nthey got the money delivered. And people were satisfied their needs \nwere being met.\n  The Northridge earthquake, 24 days after that devastating earthquake, \n``$8.6 billion Quake Aid Ok'd by Senate.'' We are nowhere near that \npace. We are at 83 days, and although we did--and I am grateful for \nit--appropriate dollars in the immediate aftermath, we haven't gone \nback to appropriate them to actually get them out and be spent to take \ncare of the problems we have.\n  The Cerro Grande fire, which was a fire set by the Federal \nGovernment, a fire that was meant to stop other fires--of course, we \nknow the results were disastrous--44 days after that fire, ``Los Alamos \nWelcomes Federal Aid.''\n  I was pleased, both as a citizen and as an onlooker with a great deal \nof interest over 8 years, to see how well our country came together to \ndeal with our emergencies. Compare those headlines with where we are \nright now in New York: ``New York Needs Help Now to Rise from the \nAshes,'' November 19; ``New York Financial Core Wobbles from Attacks' \nEconomic Hit,'' November 26; since September 11, ``Vacant Offices and \nLost Vigor,'' November 21; ``Terror Attacks Have Left Chinatown's \nEconomy Battered,'' November 25; ``A Nation Challenged: Small Shops \nFeel Lost in Aid Effort.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The time controlled by the \nmajority has expired.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Thank you, Mr. President. Again, I hope that we will \nrespond with equal vigor and expeditious treatment to deal with the \nproblems in New York, as our country always has in previous disasters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I inquire as to the time agreement. It \nis my understanding there are 30 minutes on each side remaining; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this point in time, until 5:10, it is \ncontrolled by the minority.\n\n[[Page S12299]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Until 5:10?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The majority leader, then, has 5 minutes \nwith which to close.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let's run through that one more time. At 5:10, the \nminority time expires.

Mr. President, let me again reflect on where I think \nwe are. We have chosen to try to get an energy bill before this body \nall year. We introduced an energy bill late in January in the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee. Hearings were held. We had a little \nchange of leadership that resulted in a situation where we could not \nget the bill brought up in committee. In the meantime, of course, the \nHouse of Representatives did its work. It passed H.R. 4, which was an \nenergy bill. It was a good energy bill. It had virtually everything \nthat we felt should be addressed in the body of the bill because it \naddressed, if you will, not only renewables but alternatives, as well \nas new sources of energy.\n  H.R. 4 is the bill that is before us right now, but it is coupled \nwith a cloning bill, and it is on a railroad retirement bill. But I \nthink we should focus on the reality here, which is that the President \nhas asked for an energy bill. The House has done its job. The Senate \nhas yet to do its job.\n  The ultimate disposition of this vote today is not going to be very \nmeaningful because different Members are going to be able to respond in \ndifferent ways. Those who are particularly attuned to the cloning \nissue, obviously--and I share the position of Senator Brownback that we \nshould not be rushing into this. There should be some evaluation on its \nethical and moral aspects. On the other hand, the fact that it is on \nthe railroad retirement bill, which I happen to support, means there is \ngoing to be different interpretations--whether the vote is contrary to \nsupport for railroad retirement, support for energy, or support for \ncloning.\n  I want to focus on the void that will be left after we are through. \nWe are not going to be able to have resolved getting an energy bill up \nbefore the Senate. So we are going to have to search for other means, \nwhether it be the Agriculture bill or stimulus bill or holding up a \nunanimous consent agreement, which I am prepared to do. We have talked \nabout Christmas Eve, about the stockings, and odds and ends; but we \nhave no assurance that the Democratic leadership which controls this \nbody is going to give us a time certain to take up an energy bill and \nvote up or down on it. That is within the broad support of America's \nspecial interest groups--whether it be the labor unions that we have \nheard from relative to the value of it as a stimulus, or others.\n  Mr. President, when we look at stimulus bills, where are you going to \nfind a better stimulus? It would create 250,000 jobs, generating $3 \nbillion in revenues from lease sales, and would not cost the taxpayer a \ndime. What about the national security interests and America's veterans \nwho fought overseas? I am reminded of my good friend from Oregon who \nindicated that he would rather vote for an ANWR bill any day than send \nour men and women overseas to fight a war over oil. That was Senator \nMark Hatfield.\n  So the President has called for an energy bill. We are disregarding \nour popular President's wish in not addressing it. We have heard from \nthe Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the \nSecretary of Labor, who all recognize the importance of this. The \nDemocratic leadership says, no; we are not going to take it up. We are \ngoing to take it up later. When? Will he give us a time certain to \nconclude it and allow amendments and an up-or-down vote? That is all we \nwant.\n  What is happening here is they are talking on, if you will, the \nprevailing attitude of America's veterans, organized labor, Teamsters, \nsenior organizations, Jewish organizations, who all understand what \nnational security is all about in relation to the Mideast. We have a \nbill--H.R. 4--that reduces demand, increases supply, and enhances \ninfrastructure and energy security. So we are very positive. Yet we are \ngoing to go out of here today with another situation where we have not \nreached a resolve. We have talked about energy, and if there is any \nplus to this, it is that we got the energy bill up for discussion but \nin such a convoluted way that it is very difficult to address it on the \nmerits for on an up-or-down, clean vote, which it deserves.\n\n  The Democratic leadership has chosen to ignore, if you will, the \nresponsibility that this body has to address a request of the \nPresident. We are going to go off now and simply look for another day. \nWell, I am going to look for another day. I don't want to disrupt the \nbody, but I am telling you that we have to have assurances that we are \ngoing to get an energy bill up, under some time agreement of some \nconsequence that would be meaningful to dispose of the issue once and \nfor all. Any Member can justify his vote today, not on the issue of an \nup-or-down vote on energy but on cloning or his particular position on \nthe issue of railroad retirement.\n  We need to have the Members stand up and be counted on whether or not \nit is in our national security interest to have an energy bill and have \nan up-or-down vote and have amendments and include, if you will, the \nANWR issue.\n  This isn't a vote on an energy bill today. It is not a vote on ANWR. \nThis is a vote to address a procedural process that is very gray in the \ninterpretation because nobody is going to be able to clearly define \njust what they are for and what they are against.\n  I see my friend from Kansas who wants to speak on the cloning. We \nhave little time remaining. I will reserve 5 minutes of my remaining \ntime and allow Senator Brownback to have the difference.\n  I inquire of the time remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 11\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/03/senate-section/article/S12299-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12299-S12301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MORATORIUM ON CLONING\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am caught in a position similar to \nthat of the Senator from Alaska. I support what he put forward on the \nenergy bill. It is of utmost urgency. We are so dependent upon \nunreliable sources of energy that we will look back and say we wish we \nhad done something when we had a chance to do it. We are not doing it.\n  I have put forward the moratorium on cloning. To clarify, where some \nhave said this is about stem cells, it is not about stem cells. It is \nabout cloning--taking a human individual and creating them by cloning \ntechnology, similar to what was used with Dolly the sheep. That is not \nstem cells. That is about cloning. It is a moratorium on cloning--a 6-\nmonth timeout. Let's wait a little bit and think about what we are \nactually getting into as the world contemplates this matter. Yet \ntechnology is diving into it in the United States, as we saw announced \na week ago the first human clone ever in the world by a Massachusetts \ncompany.\n  Let's think about this. That is why we brought up this issue on this \nprocedural vehicle, saying lets get a clear vote on a 6-month \nmoratorium. It is not an outright ban on everything for all time. It is \n6 months where we hold hearings, do a thoughtful process. The House \nalready has voted on the issue by over a 100-vote margin. They voted to \nban cloning altogether. The President is pleading for a bill on banning \ncloning altogether. We weren't even going that far. We are saying a 6-\nmonth moratorium while we think about it, instead of letting private \ncompanies basically decide a huge issue for humanity.\n\n  Right now we are letting private companies decide if they think it is \nOK to clone humans or not by their own privately hired ethics board. Do \nthey think it is fine we clone humans or not. They are making the \ndecision when this is something that should be in the public purview \nand public domain after thoughtful conversation.\n  We are pleading for the time to do that. That is why I put the \namendment together with the energy bill. We are getting toward the end \nof the session, and we need some discussion and clarity on this issue. \nWhere the House has acted and the President is seeking a bill, we are \nin difficulty getting the bill done.\n\n[[Page S12300]]\n\n  We are going to look for other vehicles and other ways and means to \nget this moratorium so we can have that pause, that thoughtful bit of \ntime when we can contemplate this issue of human cloning. It seems to \nme far superior to say right now: Let's wait for a little bit, rather \nthan wait until there are more clones out there and then say: OK, I \nguess it is too late; the decision has already been made for us. That \nis not the way a responsible, deliberative body should act.\n  I point out to my colleagues as well that this is a broad-based \nissue. In the House, the vote was broad based. Republicans and \nDemocrats voted for the bill. We have sponsors from the left and the \nright of various groups--environmental groups, technology groups--that \nare questioning where some of the technology is taking us. We have \nsponsors forming conservative groups. There is a broad-based group \nsupporting a moratorium or even an outright ban on human cloning.\n  I know a number of my colleagues have questions and difficulties \nabout the issue of genetically modified organisms. I count 12 of my \ncolleagues who are opposed to GMOs, genetically modified organisms. \nThat is where one takes two different species and crosses them to get a \nhybrid of sorts. They are taking a bit of genetic material from one and \ninserting it into the other. Some of my colleagues have real questions \nabout where this is going.\n  If some of my colleagues have questions about genetically modified \norganisms in plants and animals, what do they think about a genetically \nmodified human? Is that something we want to let drift out there?\n  We put a huge number of regulations on agricultural biotech companies \nthat are developing genetically modified organisms. Yet if someone \nwants to do that to the human species, fine, go ahead, there is no \nregulation on it. Is that a thoughtful way for a deliberative body to \nwork?\n  We put limits on what one can do to eggs in other species. One cannot \ndestroy a bald eagle egg. There is a Federal penalty for doing that. In \nthis legislation, we are talking about creating and destroying. We are \nsaying: Fine, go ahead.\n  Do we give less weight to the human species than we do an eagle? Is \nthat a way for a thoughtful, deliberative body to work? When we have \nthis technology rushing, should we not be saying let's really consider \nwhat this technology is doing and what it means to us and what it means \nto the future of our country and our species?\n  This 6-month moratorium seems to me to be a very modest step. I \npleaded with the Democratic leadership: Let us bring this up on a \nseparate stand-alone vote. They have not been willing to do so. This \nbody now stands in the way of speaking on this as a country, when many \nother countries, 28 other countries have put forward laws and rules on \nhuman cloning.\n  That is what we are talking about. Others may call it stem cells, but \nthis is about human cloning. The issue of stem cells has been dealt \nwith by the administration and they have put forward rules and \nregulations. This is about human cloning.\n  That is why I sought to put this issue of human cloning on this \nparticular amendment because we will not have any other vehicle to \nbring this forward. I am a sponsor of the railroad retirement bill. I \nhave signed on to that bill. I am a cosponsor of the bill. I have heard \nfrom a number of my colleagues and constituents about it. I support the \nbill, but I also think we are at a unique point in human history where \nwe need to consider what we are doing about cloning. For that reason, I \nput forward this particular amendment, and I ask my colleagues to \nconsider it. I still want to find the time for us to consider this \nissue.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the 6 month moratorium \non human cloning which the Senate is now debating.\n  In recent years, science has progressed rapidly. In 1997, Ian Wilmut \nand a team of researchers successfully created an adult cloned sheep, \nDolly. With the specter of human cloning on the near horizon, the \nSenate nonetheless rejected legislation to ban this act based largely \non 2 arguments, that anti-cloning legislation would stop stem cell \nresearch, and that the science was not advanced enough to clone human \nbeings.\n  Three years later, history and science have proven these arguments \nfalse. Not only are a few scientists moving forward to clone humans, \nbut we also now know conclusively that a human cloning ban will not \nhalt research that could lead to cures for chronic and debilitating \nillnesses, including promising embryonic stem cell research which I \nsupport.\n  The President has called for a ban on human cloning, and the House of \nRepresentatives has passed legislation by an overwhelming bipartisan \nmargin. Now, it is up to the Senate.\n  The case against human cloning is compelling and comprehensive. But I \nunderstand the concerns some of my colleagues have expressed about \nmoving too hastily in this manner, and I therefore believe that the \nresponsible course of action stands before us today: A temporary \nmoratorium on human cloning that will give the Senate the time it needs \nto diligently consider this issue while ensuring that events do not \novertake us.\n  Let us act now to assure that next year's debate occurs in an \nenvironment where science has not moved ahead of the public interest. \nLet us give ourselves 6 months to deal carefully and responsibly with a \nmatter of profound importance.\n  The risks of not acting to halt cloning far outweigh any concerns \nabout impeding scientific progress. Cloning--and all its dangers--are \nupon us. Any possible medical advantage through cloning is far off at \nbest. In fact, such advantages are theoretical only.\n  Last week, a Massachusetts company claimed to have cloned a human \nembryo. Moreover, Dr. Severino Antinori has in recent weeks reiterated \nhis plan to produce cloned embryos by the end of the year, with the \nintent of impregnating up to 200 women.\n  The problem is simple. Failure to prohibit human cloning now speeds \nthe day that a human being will be cloned. If that idea troubles you, I \nsubmit that you must support the moratorium.\n  Why must we prohibit all human cloning? We need to ban it to prevent \nthe cloning and birth of a human. We need to prohibit it to safeguard \nthe health of the women who will be directly exploited as a side effect \nof the procedure. And we need to prevent it for the sake of research \nethics.\n  I know these issues can be confusing. Cloning issues intersect with \nstem cell research issues. It is complicated. One of my colleagues \nasked me: If I support embryonic stem cell research, can I be opposed \nto cloning? The short answer is ``yes.''\n  Human cloning is the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a \nhuman embryo genetically identical to a living or dead individual. The \nterms that are often thrown about, ``reproductive or therapeutic,'' \nrefer only to whether this is intended to create a new person or for \nresearch. The act of cloning, however, is the same in both cases.\n  There is near universal abhorrence to human reproductive cloning. \nScientifically, consensus exists that it is unsafe. More significantly, \nthe ethical and moral implications of cloning for ``replacing'' a lost \nloved one; re-creating persons with special attributes; developing a \nsource of transplantable organs are highly troubling to all of us. \nUnfortunately, there are scientists working actively to achieve those \nends.\n  Ultimately, if one wishes to prohibit human ``reproductive cloning,'' \nit is necessary to prohibit all human cloning. Once cloned embryos \nexist, despite the best intentions to the contrary, there will be no \nway to prevent a cloned embryo from being implanted in a woman. Once \nthat starts, there is no way to stop it.\n  We would not know when a cloned embryo is growing in a woman's \nuterus. Even if we know about such a pregnancy, we would not be able to \nstop it. We would not know until reproductive cloning experiments lead \nto spontaneous miscarriages, still births, or severely deformed babies. \nIf this sounds alarmist, consider the fact that Scottish scientists had \nmore than 270 failed pregnancies before they produced the cloned sheep, \nDolly.\n  Some maintain that even placing a short hold on human cloning will \nhalt research necessary to help sick, diseased, and injured persons. \nThese claims are not supported by the facts.\n\n[[Page S12301]]\n\n  They also say that therapeutic cloning is necessary to develop \nmedical treatments through embryonic stem cell research that will not \nbe rejected by the body's auto-immune response system. But this is by \nno means certain.\n  I strongly support embryonic stem cell research. As both a supporter \nand a scientist, I can tell you that this field remains in its earliest \nstages of basic research. At a hearing on stem cell research this fall, \nSecretary Thompson noted that clinical applications are years away. It \nis simply not the case that a ban on human cloning, particularly the \ntemporary moratorium we are discussing today, would in any way harm the \nprogress of stem cell research.\n  Perhaps someday a credible case will be made on the need for \n``cloned'' tissue. But that day, if it ever comes, will be far in the \nfuture.\n  The justifications to ban human cloning are strong. I have only \ntouched on one of the reasons today, and we will have ample time in the \ncoming months to further develop and explore these arguments, just as \nwe will have ample time to see the clear difference between cloning and \nstem cell research and understand that promising stem cell research \ncan, and will, go forward without human cloning.\n  But today's vote is even more simple than all of that. It is a vote \nto say ``slow down,'' and let us as a Senate have time to adequately \ninvestigate and debate this issue. It is a vote to ensure that the \nscience does not race ahead without the input of the public interest. I \nurge my colleagues to support the moratorium on human cloning. The \nmoratorium will give us breathing space to study a complex and \nprofoundly important matter. Additional time gives us the best chance \nof doing the right thing. In the meantime, we must take all possible \nsteps to do no harm.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Lott amendment \nto the railroad retirement bill. In addition to other provisions, this \namendment would enact a moratorium on a scientific process which holds \nthe potential to save millions of human lives. I cannot support such a \nprovision.\n  The final chapter of the Lott amendment deals with an issue that cuts \nto the core of our moral and ethical beliefs: human cloning.\n  I share the deep concerns that my colleagues and millions of \nAmericans have with the prospect of cloning human beings. These \nconcerns were born in 1997, when scientists in Great Britain announced \nthat they had successfully cloned a sheep. They were stoked again last \nweek, when a biotechnology company in Massachusetts announced that it \nhad taken the first steps towards producing human embryos through \ncloning.\n  Let me be perfectly clear on this issue. I am adamantly opposed to \nany scientific project aimed at creating a clone of a human being. The \nimplications of human reproductive cloning are morally repugnant. I do \nnot know of a single respected scientist, ethicist, or religious leader \nwho disagrees with me on this point.\n  The Lott amendment would impose a 6-month moratorium on this type of \nreproductive cloning, and I am fully supportive of this effort.\n  Unfortunately, the Lott amendment would also place a moratorium on a \nscientific procedure called somatic cell nuclear transfer. This process \nis closely related to the subject of stem cell research, which we heard \nso much about this summer. As you know, stem calls have the unique \npotential to grow into any tissue or organ in the body. Because of this \nproperty, stem cells may finally offer scientists the tools they need \nto cure diseases that have plagued humankind for centuries.\n  I strongly support scientific research into stem cells. I was \nheartened this summer, when President Bush and a bipartisan group of \nsenators joined me in this support.\n  But while stem cell research offers promising possibilities, it faces \nmany obstacles. One of these obstacles is the problem of rejection. If \nthe stem cells used to treat diseases contain genetic material that is \ndifferent from the genetic material of the patient, they may be \nrejected by the patient's body--in much the same manner as organs that \nare transplanted from one human being to another are often rejected.\n  Somatic cell nuclear transfer is a technique that may allow \nscientists to bypass this obstacle. In this process, stem cells are \ncreated using genetic material from a patient's own body. Because these \nnew stem cells are genetically identical to a patient's own body, they \nwould not be rejected.\n  This technique promises to speed up research into the treatment of \ncrippling diseases like juvenile diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's and \nParkinson's. I would venture to guess that all Americans have had \nfriends or family who have struggled with these devastating diseases; \nand millions of Americans would benefit by medical research that might \none day eradicate them.\n  But the Lott amendment would stop this research in its tracks. It \nwould bring a halt to research aimed at promoting life and relieving \nunspeakable suffering. For this reason, I cannot support this \nlegislation--no matter how well-intentioned it is.\n  A reasonable alternative to the Lott amendment would be to make the \nreproductive cloning of a human being a criminal offense, subject to \nsevere penalties. Such a solution would prevent the cloning of human \nbeings without standing in the way of promising research aimed at \npromoting human life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/03/senate-section/article/S12301-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12301-S12303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ENERGY SECURITY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is with extreme disappointment that I \nrise to oppose the amendment offered by the Republican leader on behalf \nof the junior Senator from Alaska Mr. Murkowski, and the senior Senator \nfrom Kansas, Mr. Brownback. I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment.\n  I am particularly troubled that this amendment was filed as work \ncontinues to have a bill drafted by the majority leader and brought to \nthe floor. Those who have said we need urgency in this matter have \nsucceeded. We are working on a bill. But that is not fast enough for \nsome, apparently, and this amendment seek to shortcut the process even \nfurther.\n  Energy security is an important issue for America, and one which my \nWisconsin constituents take very seriously. A national debate is \nunfolding about the role of domestic production of energy resources \nversus foreign imports, about the tradeoffs between the need for energy \nand the need to protect the quality of our environment, and about the \nneed for additional domestic efforts to support improvements in our \nenergy efficiency and the wisest use of our energy resources. The \nPresident joined that debate with the release of his National Energy \nStrategy earlier this Congress. The questions raised are serious, and \ndifferences in policy and approach are legitimate.\n  I join with the other Senators today that are raising concerns about \nthis amendment. As other Senators have highlighted, the amendment of \nthe Senator from Alaska's, Mr. Murkowski, is not comprehensive energy \nlegislation. It opens the refuge to oil drilling, subsidizes oil \ncompanies, and does little to address serious energy issues that have \nbeen raised in the last few weeks.\n  Though the Senator from Alaska will say that his amendment would only \nopen up drilling on 2,000 acres of the refuge. That is simply not the \ncase. The entire 1\\1/2\\ million acres of the coastal plain of the \nrefuge will be open for oil and gas leasing and exploration. \nExploration and production wells can be drilled anywhere on the coastal \nplain under this language.\n  The first lease sale, and, I stress for my colleagues that this \nrefers only to the first sale, has to be at least 200,000 acres.\n  I am assuming that when the Senator means that only 2,000 acres will \nbe drilled he is referring to the language in H.R. 4 which states, and \nI am paraphrasing,\n\n     the Secretary shall . . . ensure that the maximum amount of \n     surface acreage covered by production and support \n     facilities, including airstrips and any areas covered by \n     gravel berms or piers for support of pipelines, does not \n     exceed 2,000 acres on the coastal plain.\n\n  That limitation is not a clear cap on overall development, Mr. \nPresident. It does not cover seismic or other exploration activities, \nwhich have had significant impacts on the Arctic environment to the \nwest of the coastal plain. Seismic activities are conducted with \nconvoys of bulldozers and ``thumper\n\n[[Page S12302]]\n\ntrucks'' over extensive areas of the tundra. Exploratory oil drilling \ninvolves large rigs and aircraft.\n  The language does not cover the many miles of pipelines snaking above \nthe tundra, just the locations where the vertical posts that support \nthe pipelines literally touch the ground. In addition, this \n``limitation'' does not require that the 2,000 acres of production and \nsupport facilities be in one contiguous area. As with the oil fields to \nthe west of the Arctic Refuge, development could and would be spread \nout over a very large area.\n  Indeed, according to the United States Geological survey, oil under \nthe coastal plain is not concentrated in one large reservoir but is \nspread in numerous small deposits. To produce oil from this vast area, \nsupporting infrastructure would stretch across the coastal plain. And \neven if this cap were a real development cap, Mr. President, what would \nthis mean? Two thousand acres, is a sizable development area. The \ndevelopment would be even more troubling if they were located in areas \nthat are adjacent to the 8 million acres of wilderness that Congress \nhas already designated in the Arctic Refuge which share a boundary with \nthe coastal plain.\n  This amendment is controversial. Make no mistake, it will generate \nlengthy debate. I oppose it because it cuts short both the legitimate \ndebate about drilling for oil in the Arctic Refuge that this country \nneeds and the legitimate energy debate this country needs. Should this \namendment be adopted, it would force the national energy legislation to \nbe decided in the conference on pension bill--not in debate on an \nactual energy bill.\n  I have also heard concerns from the constituents in my State who have \npaid dearly for large and significant jumps in gasoline prices. \nDrilling in the refuge does nothing to address the immediate need of \nthe Federal Government to respond to fluctuations in gas prices and \nhelp expand refining capacity. My constituents experienced prices of \nbetween $3 to as high as $8 per gallon between September 11 and 12, \n2001. The Department of Energy immediately assured me that energy \nsupplies were adequate following the terrorist attacks. These increases \nare now being investigated as possible price gouging by the Department \nof Energy and the State of Wisconsin. With adequate energy resources, \nconstituents need assurances that these unjustified jumped can be \nmonitored and controlled.\n\n  And I, along with many other Senators, have constituents who are \nconcerned about the environmental impacts of this amendment, and what \nit says about our stewardship of lands of wilderness quality.\n  I also oppose this amendment for what it lacks. In light of the \ntragic events of September 11, 2001, a key element of any new energy \nsecurity policy should be to actually seek to secure our existing \nenergy system--from production to distribution--from the threat of \nfuture terrorist attack. Americans deserve to know that the Senate has \nprotected the existing North Slope oil rigs and pipelines from attack. \nAmericans deserve to know that the Senate has considered measures to \nreduce the vulnerability of above ground electric transmission and \ndistribution by providing needed investments in siting of below ground \ndirect current cables, in researching better transmission technologies, \nand in protecting transformers and switching stations. Americans want \nus to review thoroughly the security of our Nation's domestic nuclear \npower plant safety regimes to ensure that they continue to operate \nwell. Finally, Americans living downstream from hydroelectric dams want \nto know that they are safe from terrorist initiated dam breaching. \nUntil we can assure them that this existing infrastructure is secure, \nit seems hasty to add additional structures that we may not be able to \nprotect.\n  The people of my State, and the people of this country, heard the \nPresident's address to Congress and they are willing to help when \nasked. We also need to have a comprehensive bill to be sure that our \nnational energy conservation plans contemplate such contingencies as a \nfuture domestic need to reduce consumption of energy to help support \nour Armed Forces, if necessary.\n  These were issues that the House did not address on August 2, 2001, \nwhen it passed its bill, because the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n2001, were unthinkable at that time. These are issues that the \namendment of the Senator from Alaska doesn't address. But we are a \nchanged country in response to these tragedies, and these are very real \nissues today, issues that must be addressed.\n  In addition, there have been other significant technological changes \nin the last few months which energy legislation should consider. On \nSeptember 19, 2001, a model year 2002 General Motors Yukon which is \nable to run on either a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent \nconventional gasoline or conventional gasoline alone rolled off of the \nline in Janesville, WI. The 2002 model year Tahoes, Suburbans, and \nDenalis with 5.3 liter engines will be able to run on either fuel. But \nwhile my constituents could buy a vehicle which can run on a higher \npercentage of ethanol fuel, there isn't a place open today to buy that \nfuel in Wisconsin. We could go a long way to reducing dependence upon \nforeign oil by using domestic energy crops and biomass more wisely, and \nwe should develop a bill to reflect our new technological capabilities.\n\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, today the only way \nto isolate the U.S. economy from supply disruptions abroad would be to \nforbid the exportation of domestic oil to foreign markets and to \nprohibit domestic oil companies from raising prices. Since net oil \nimports have accounted for about 50 percent of U.S. consumption in \nrecent years, such a policy, were it to be implemented, would lead to \nshortages unless domestic oil prices were allowed to rise much higher \nthan at present. This is because oil extraction in the United States on \na large enough scale to meet our energy needs is much too costly to \ncompete with foreign producers. For this reason, energy independence in \nthe long run would likely result in a price that may be less volatile, \nbut certainly a price that is even higher than prices at their recent \npeak.\n  Even if the United States could implement such a drastic policy, \nmanipulations of oil prices by other oil producing nations could still \naffect the U.S. economy.\n  Finally, I oppose this amendment because there is a lingering veil of \nconcern that special corporate interests would benefit over our \ncitizens by this amendment, and I am prepared to speak on that issue at \nlength. I find it particularly troubling that at a time when we face \nthe need to provide financial assistance to workers and to sectors of \nour economy severely impacted by September 11 events, we would even \nconsider subsidizing the big oil companies. This amendment allows oil \ncompanies access to federal resources within a federal wildlife refuge. \nMy constituents paid the high gasoline costs on September 11 and 12, \nand oil companies profited. Before they get more help from the federal \ngovernment, I think we should be mindful of the help these industries \nare already getting.\n  If the Senate chooses to adopt this amendment behind the veil of \ntragedy, it will be an act that increases division in the country when \nwe most need unity. The Murkowski amendment should be opposed.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the pending \namendment and pledge my continued support for the protection of the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge from oil drilling. As most of my fellow \nSenators will attest, preserving the Alaska wilderness was one of the \nhighest priorities of my friend and former colleague from Delaware, \nBill Roth, and I was proud to join him in this fight.\n  Alaska's coastal plain is one of our Nation's last areas of unspoiled \nwilderness and it must be protected from oil development and all the \nactivity that comes with it. This practically untouched region is home \nto a wide variety of wildlife, such as polar bears, caribou, and \nhundreds of species of birds, and there is great concern that \ndevelopment of the area will threaten this fragile habitat. I urge my \ncolleagues to understand the consequences of permanently altering such \npristine landscape when at this point in time, the amount of oil that \nwould be economically developed is speculative at best. I do not \nbelieve that we should risk potentially irreversible impact on this \nrich environment for the sake of uncertain oil recovery.\n\n[[Page S12303]]\n\n  The most recent petroleum assessment report, conducted by the United \nStates Geological Survey in 1998, estimated that there was between 3 \nbillion and 16 billion barrels of oil in the area. But while the \nnumbers alone are promising, the issue is how much oil is economically \nrecoverable. At a market price of $24 per barrel, the United States \nGeological Survey estimates a 95-percent chance that 2.0 billion \nbarrels or more would be economically recoverable and a 5-percent \nchance that 9.4 billion barrels or more would be economically \nrecoverable.\n  In addition, the best estimates are that if we authorized drilling \ntoday, oil from ANWR will not be available for at least 7 to 12 years. \nLeasing agreements, geologic characteristics and transportation \nconstraints will most certainly affect development rates and production \nlevels. Assuming the best case scenario--peak production of oil at an \nincreased development rate--the most promising production rate is \n750,000 barrels per day. To put this in perspective, the United States \nconsumes about 19 million barrels of oil and refined petroleum products \na day. In the first 9 months of 2001, the United States imported 1.77 \nmillion barrels of oil per day from Canada, 1.73 million barrels of oil \nper day from Saudi Arabia, 1.58 million barrels of oil per day from \nVenezuela and 1.37 million barrels a day from Mexico.\n  Despite the fact that I stand here today in opposition to drilling in \nANWR, I do recognize the importance of our country moving forward with \na thorough review of our energy policy and I look forward to our \ndiscussions in the early part of next year. Our energy policy should be \ncomprehensive and balanced. In addition to examining our options for \nincreasing production of fossil fuels and stabilizing our supplies, we \nneed to explore viable conservation initiatives, make important \ninvestments into the research and development of renewable and \nalternative energy sources, and consider adapting our regulatory and \ntax structures to help achieve these goals. I know that we can modify \nour energy polices without undermining our longtime environmental \nobjectives.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nopposition to the Murkowski-Lott-Brownback amendment, which would open \nup the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--America's last untouched \nwildlife refuge--to oil development. It is both untimely to try to \ninclude such a controversial issue in an unrelated Railroad Retirement \nbill, and unwise to exploit this time of economic downturn and national \nsecurity challenges to open up ANWR for the sake of narrow and divisive \ninterests.\n  I believe there is no way to justify drilling in ANWR in the name of \nnational security. Oil extracted from the refuge would not reach \nrefineries for seven to ten years and would never satisfy more than two \npercent of our nation's oil demands at any one time. Therefore, it \nwould have no discernible short- or long-term impact on the price of \nfuel or our increasing dependence on OPEC imports. Put another way, the \namount of economically recoverable oil would increase our domestic \nreserves by only one third of one percent, which would not even make a \nsignificant dent on our imports, much less influence world prices set \nby OPEC.\n  Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would also set a \nterrible precedent. In the past 35 years, ever since Congress passed \nthe National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act, the government \nhas not approved a single oil or gas exploration lease on public refuge \nlands. My concern is that opening up ANWR in the name of a misleading \nand irresponsible national security argument will not only degrade one \nof America's national treasures, but will also expose other priceless \npublic lands to new drilling.\n  Mr. President, rather than drilling in ANWR, we must focus on \ncrafting a deliberative, comprehensive policy that will permanently \nstrengthen our national security. We need a bill that endows America \nwith a strong and independent 21st century energy system by recognizing \nfuel diversity, energy efficiency, distributed generation, and \nenvironmentally sound domestic production as the permanent solutions to \nour nation's enduring energy needs. The energy provisions included in \nthe Murkowski-Lott amendment fail to meet these goals and would instead \nprolong our antiquated over-reliance on traditional fossil fuels.\n  The Energy and Natural Resources Committee on which I serve held a \nseries of hearings earlier this year that highlighted particularly \npromising ways we can accomplish these crucial goals. For example, \nthese hearings revealed a broad consensus on the need to streamline \nregulatory approval of a privately funded natural gas pipeline from \nAlaska's North Slope to the lower 48 states. There are at least 32 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas in existing Alaskan fields and \nbuilding a pipeline to the continental U.S. would create thousands of \njobs, provide a huge opportunity for the steel industry, and help \nprevent our nation from becoming dependent on foreign natural gas, from \nmany of the same Middle Eastern countries from which we import oil.\n  Adopting energy efficient technologies is another way to \nsignificantly advance our national and economic security. For example, \nare my colleagues aware that automakers commonly use low-friction tires \non new cars to help them comply with fuel economy standards? Because \nthere are no standards or efficiency labels for replacement tires, \nhowever, most consumers unwittingly purchase less efficient tires when \ntheir originals wear out, even though low-friction tires would only \ncost a few dollars more per tire and would save the average American \ndriver $100 worth of fuel over the 40,000-mile life of the tires. Fully \nphased in, better replacement tires would cut gasoline consumption of \nall U.S. vehicles by about three percent, saving our nation over five \nbillion barrels of oil over the next 50 years. That's the same amount \nthe United States Geological Survey says could be economically \nrecovered from ANWR.\n  I believe that the only way to permanently ensure our nation's \nsecurity is to look beyond policies that continue our country's \ncentury-old reliance on the extraction and combustion of fossil fuels. \nNow is the time to launch the transition to a new, 21st century system \nof distributed generation based on renewable energy sources and \nenvironmentally responsible fuel cells.\n  Imagine if today a significant portion of American homes and \nbusinesses produced their own electricity from solar panels on their \nroofs, and powered their cars with home-grown biofuels. Our country \nwould no longer be at the mercy of OPEC, energy bills would be \ndramatically lower, our air would be cleaner, and our energy system \ncould not be devastated by terrorist attacks on centralized power \nplants or transmission lines.\n  Mr. President, the American people know this is the direction our \ncountry must take. Just last month a Gallup Poll showed that 91 percent \nof Americans believe we should invest in new sources of energy such as \nsolar, wind, and fuel cells. Ninety-one percent. How often do we see \nsuch universal support in our politically diverse country?\n  Mr. President, only these policies--which will be well represented in \nthe energy bill Senators Daschle and Bingaman will bring to the floor \nearly next year--will make our energy system truly secure and \nindependent. I recognize, along with probably all of my colleagues, \nthat inexpensive, reliable energy sources are the lifeblood of our \neconomy and higher standard of living. Because our national, economic, \nand environmental security depend on the United States becoming less \ndependent on imported fossil fuels, we must act to develop more diverse \nand environmentally responsible supplies of domestic energy. Neither \ndrilling in ANWR nor the rest of Murkowski-Lott energy provisions go \nfar enough to accomplish these goals, and I encourage my colleagues to \nvote against invoking cloture on this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/03/senate-section/article/S12303-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12303-S12304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RAILROAD RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am proud to come to the floor today as a \ncosponsor of S. 697, the Railroad Retirement and Survivors Improvement \nAct. Senator Baucus and Senator Hatch have worked hard on this bill \nwith railroad management and labor and have created a final product of \nwhich they should be proud. This bill will fundamentally improve the \neconomic situation for more than 400,000 American railroad employees \nand their survivors, while reducing the tax burden on rail employees \nand railroads.\n\n[[Page S12304]]\n\n After three long years of hard work, rail labor and management have \ncome together to create a new system to provide for rail retirees and \ntheir survivors. The Senate should ratify this proposal by adopting the \namendment today.\n  Let me recap quickly what this amendment does: Most importantly, we \nallow survivors of railroaders to receive 100 percent of the benefits \nearned by their spouse, or, in some cases, parent. In most cases, that \nmeans an immediate doubling of income for employees' survivors. We also \nreduce the time needed for a worker to become vested in the Railroad \nRetirement system from 10 years to five years. That's consistent with \n401(k) plans and similar retirement packages in other industries. \nFinally, we lower the tax burden on railroads and employees, while \nincreasing the return on funds invested in the system. That's good for \nworkers, and it's good for business. When income tax is factored in, \nsome of these railroad companies have a combined tax burden of 50 \npercent. That's unforgivably high for any company, especially for \nsmaller railroads, such as short lines, which are already struggling \nwith huge capital needs.\n  Unfortunately, some will allege that this legislation is only needed \nbecause the Railroad Retirement System needed an economic ``bailout,'' \nbut that is a false claim. Tier One benefits are funded by the same \nmechanism that we use to fund Social Security, employers and employees \neach pay a 15.3 percent payroll tax into a trust fund which is used to \npay current benefits. Since 1950, assets in the Tier One fund and \nSocial Security Trust Fund have been moved to ensure that railroaders \nwere not disadvantaged by changes in Social Security benefits and also \nto unify benefits for workers eligible for both Social Security and \nRailroad Retirement benefits. Unfortunately, between 1950 and 1974, \nmore than $3.5 billion flowed out of the Railroad Retirement Trust fund \nand into the Social Security Trust Fund. That money was finally repaid \nlast year, and I think it's important that everyone understands that \nthis bill does not in any way change Tier One benefits, which Railroad \nRetirement's equivalent of Social Security.\n  When this bill is enacted, more than 400,000 former employees, \nspouses and children will see an increase in benefits. More than 500 \ncompanies will see their overwhelming payroll tax burden decrease. That \nis a good deal for everyone, and there's no reason not to move forward \non this legislation today. I urge my colleagues to support cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next 5 minutes is reserved for the \nRepublican leader or his designee.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I believe there are 5 \nminutes reserved for the Republican leadership and then there are 5 \nminutes reserved for Senator Daschle and the Democratic leadership, and \nthen we will be ready for a vote; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader was to have from 5:05 \np.m. to 5:10 p.m. Roughly half of that has been used. Without \nobjection----\n  Mr. LOTT. I am not asking for additional time. I am trying to clarify \nhow much time I have and the approximate time we will have a vote. I \npresume we will try to vote by 5:15 p.m.; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senator has 2 minutes 10 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will use a portion of the time I have reserved.\n  Mr. President, it is unfortunate we are on the underlying bill at \nthis point, the railroad retirement bill. While obviously there can be \nsome arguments made for it and with some amendments it probably could \npass by an overwhelming vote because the concept does have a large \nnumber of supporters on both sides of the aisle, I wish the Finance \nCommittee had been able to bring this up in regular order, have \nhearings, have a markup, and report a bill. I believe the problems with \nthe bill could have been addressed. There have been other issues, \nobviously, that have distracted our attention this year, but I still \nregret it has come up in this particular way.\n\n\n                             Energy Policy\n\n  As to the pending issues, I believe there are fewer issues more \nimportant facing our Nation today than the fact we do not have a \nnational energy policy. We need to do it now, not later this month, not \nnext month, and not February or March. It needs to be done as soon as \npossible, and it needs to be broad based.\n  It needs to provide for additional production. It needs to provide \nfor alternative fuels and conservation. We need incentives for more \nproduction. We need to look at the transmission systems. We need to \nlook at nuclear power.\n  All of it should be done. For that reason, I offered this amendment \nto the substitute that would allow us to have a full debate and \nhopefully a direct vote on this issue of a national energy policy.\n\n\n                                Cloning\n\n  In addition, of course, we have coupled with this amendment the 6-\nmonth moratorium on the issue of cloning. We have heard from Senator \nMurkowski and Senator Brownback about the importance of both of these \nissues. Whether one thinks we should have some sort of research in this \narea of cloning, there is no question there is a lot of uncertainty \nabout what this really means and how it would affect this whole \nquestion of human cloning. So Senator Brownback--responsibly, I \nbelieve, in view of recent developments--has proposed a 6-month \nmoratorium to give us time to sort this out, to talk among ourselves, \nand to hear from experts, and in the meantime not to have this steady \nmarch toward this question of human cloning. That is why these two \nissues are before us.\n  I recommend and urge my colleagues to vote against cloture on the \nenergy bill and the cloning issue because we should not cut off debate. \nWe should have full debate. We should have amendments to these issues. \nI believe with proper debate and with some amendments being offered, we \ncould come up with an energy bill that would pass this Senate \noverwhelmingly, probably nearly unanimously. Would it be exactly the \nway I would write it or any Senator on either side of the aisle would \nwrite it? Probably not. Would it be a major step forward? Yes, it \nwould. Should we get a direct vote on the cloning issue? We should, in \nmy opinion.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote no on cloture, continue this debate, \nand then vote no on the substitute, because if my colleagues vote yes \non the substitute, invoke cloture, then they wipe this issue off the \ntable and they will not have an opportunity to have a full debate and \ndirect votes on the amendments.\n  Regardless of what happens, at some point we are going to get to the \nunderlying substance. The energy and cloning language does not replace \nthe railroad bill. It is on top of that. We are going to get to the \nsubstance, and there are going to be substantial amendments that will \nbe offered to correct some of the concerns or at least address some of \nthe concerns in this legislation. With some participation on both \nsides, I believe we could reach an agreement to pass this bill, with \nthe energy and cloning parts added, by the middle or the latter part of \nthis week.\n  The other side of it is, these issues are not going to go away. These \nare very important issues. In the case of energy, national security is \ninvolved. The economy of our country is involved. Supply is involved \nfor the energy needs and for the economy of our country. In the case of \nthe cloning issue, this is certainly a very important, very emotional \nissue. Both issues need to be addressed, and they will be addressed \nrepeatedly on other bills when the opportunity presents itself if we do \nnot do it. Let us do it on this bill. I believe we could facilitate \ngetting an early completion of these issues and complete our work for \nthe year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/03/senate-section/article/S12305-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12305]]\n                             STATE OF PLAY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have great respect for the Republican \nleader and appreciate very much his efforts at asserting his ability to \nbring his caucus's agenda to the Senate. When we were in the minority, \nwe tried to do that on many occasions, and I certainly do not deny him \nthe right to do it.\n  Let me make sure everybody understands the state of play. The current \nbill pending is the Railroad Retirement Act. Our Republican colleagues \nhave filed an amendment that actually combines the comprehensive energy \nbill with the question about whether or not we ought to drill in ANWR \nwith the question on whether or not we ought to allow cloning in this \ncountry.\n  I must say, in all my years, I do not recall a more unusual marriage \nof issues involving public policy than this one. What the Republicans \nare saying is not only should they have the right to offer this \namendment but they want to extend debate on their own amendment.\n  They actually are now advocating we not vote for cloture, which is \nthe Democratic position. We had expressed some concern about an \namendment of this kind on this bill, and we will have an opportunity to \nvote on cloture on the bill as soon as we dispose of the cloture motion \non this particular amendment. We may have a unanimous vote on this \namendment on cloture, which is an extraordinary situation given the \ncomplexity of these issues and the unusual juxtaposition of the two \nissues together.\n  I am confident there will be those who are going to be confused with \nour colleagues' strategy, but certainly that is their choice.\n  Let me simply say three things: First, these are very important \nquestions. Energy policy alone should dictate a debate in the Senate \nthat would require days, if not longer, to ensure we carefully consider \nall of the ramifications of energy policy, additional production, \nadditional efforts at conservation, additional ways in which to \nresearch alternative energy sources, our infrastructure, the \nenvironmental questions associated with where we draw our additional \nproduction. All of those questions will be addressed. Ought they be \naddressed as an amendment to the railroad retirement bill? Is this the \nbest forum within which to address something as complex, controversial, \nand as far-reaching? I think even our Republican colleagues would have \nto say it is not.\n  The question of cloning may also fall into that category. As complex, \nas difficult, as extraordinarily sophisticated as this whole question \nof public policy is, is this the right place, an amendment to the \nRailroad Retirement Act, to take up the issue of cloning? I think not.\n  It is for that reason I have said this Senate will take up, consider \ncarefully, and dedicate whatever time is required to both issues early \nnext year. We are trying to address railroad retirement now. We have to \naddress the farm bill soon. We have the Defense appropriations bill \nupcoming. We also have the economic stimulus plan in addition to \nterrorist insurance--all of those issues in what amounts to a few days \nremaining in this session of Congress.\n  Our colleagues have been demanding we take up energy, with all of its \ncomplexity, and cloning, with the controversies associated with that \nissue as well. That is virtually an impossibility unless we are in \nsession between Christmas and New Year's, and I do not think anyone is \nserious about a schedule of that kind.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture on this amendment, \nvote for cloture on the bill, so we can bring our debate on railroad \nretirement to closure. That is the way we can address these issues in a \ncareful, constructive, and meaningful way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I want to engage the two leaders in a \nbrief colloquy.\n  I have requested an opportunity to bring the two leaders into a short \ncolloquy relative to the urgency of trying to work out a schedule that \nis compatible with the business at hand of the Senate, and the \ninterests, of course, of our President relative to some of the items he \nhas decided are priorities, including energy and trade promotion, and \nrecognizing the vote we have before us, which is a convoluted vote \nbecause we are basically taking up three issues: Cloning, as well as \nenergy and, of course, railroad retirement.\n  What we had hoped to be able to negotiate was an up-or-down vote on \nan energy bill. As the leader knows, we had a good deal of debate \nwithin the committee prior to the change of majority. The House of \nRepresentatives passed H.R. 4. That is what is before us. The Senator \nfrom Alaska is now in the position of wanting to work with the majority \nleader in ensuring we can expedite the business of the Senate, and I do \nnot initiate undue delays by objecting to unanimous consent agreements.\n  I ask the majority leader, while on the one hand he assures us he is \nwilling to take up an energy bill as a priority sometime when we get \nback, to give us an indication that we will finish that bill, that we \nwill not be in a situation where he will pull it down because of \nobjection one way or another and we never get to an energy bill.\n  The rights I have as a Senator are obviously limited. It is not my \nintent to delay, but I must do whatever parliamentary opportunities I \nhave to encourage this.\n  As the majority leader knows, in July we entered into a unanimous \nconsent agreement. That was not granted for a time certain--when I say \n``time certain,'' I mean a day certain--on the issue of Iraq and \nwhether to terminate under the sanctions our sale of oil from Iraq. I \nunderstand the majority leader will respond to me soon. In view of the \nfact we have lost two American lives over there, with illegal smuggling \nof oil, this is a bit of a priority.\n  Can the two leaders perhaps get together and give some assurance we \ncould take up an energy bill when we come back after the first of the \nyear, and take it up in such a way to offer an opportunity for \namendments, an up-or-down vote, and resolve it and move on to the other \nmatters the majority leader believes are appropriate and necessary? \nFrom the view of broad interest, this matter should be resolved once \nand for all. Obviously, the House has done their job; the Senate has \nyet to do its job.\n  As the majority leader knows, the fact the authority has been taken \naway from the authorizing committee and left in the hands of the \nmajority leader leaves us in a bit of a bind as far as having any input \non whatever energy bill might come up. All I ask is the assurance to \ntake up an energy bill and dispose of it in a reasonable timeframe.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I could respond, I know some of our \ncolleagues are trying to catch airplanes. We need to get on with this \nvote.\n  I am very sympathetic to the Senator from Alaska. I have been in \nexactly his position three times now in the last month. I was in his \nposition when we tried to address the unemployment compensation bill on \nthe airline security legislation. I was in it when we tried to address \nthe firefighters legislation as an amendment. I was in it for the last \nweek as we have attempted to bring closure on an up-or-down vote on \nthis bill, the Railroad Retirement Act. In all three cases, of course, \nthe Senate has worked its will and Senators have used their \nprerogatives under Senate rules to extend debate. We have not had an \nup-or-down vote on my three priorities.\n  We all face these circumstances where as much as we would like to \nbring a particular bill or amendment to closure with an up-or-down \nvote, as I have attempted in the last month on those three issues, \nSenators have used their prerogatives as Senators under the rules to \ncontinue the debate. We will have to see how the energy debate plays \nitself out, especially with regard to ANWR.\n  I have already stated very emphatically my desire to bring up the \nenergy bill prior to the Founders' Day recess, to have a good debate, \nto talk about all of the issues, including those which are \ncontroversial. It is my expectation we will do just that. We will have \na good debate and have many votes on many of the issues that the \nSenator has so passionately addressed in the Senate Chamber.\n  I ask for regular order.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/03/senate-section/article/S12306-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12306-S12307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12306]]\n   COMPREHENSIVE RETIREMENT SECURITY AND PENSION REFORM ACT OF 2001--\n                                Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the current conference on \nthe reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nknown as the ESEA. In particular, I bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues the fact that last Friday the conference rejected the \nSenate's unanimous support for full funding of the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act, IDEA. I am deeply disappointed the \nconference would reject this very important legislation that has \nreceived unanimous support in the Senate.\n  IDEA has been an extraordinarily important legislative vehicle for \nstudents with disabilities throughout this country. Only 15 percent of \nstudents with disabilities were receiving any serious education prior \nto the enactment of IDEA in the mid-seventies. Today a free, excellent \npublic education is the rule of law for all children in America, \nincluding those with disabilities.\n  Today, IDEA serves approximately 6 million children, the majority of \nwhom are taught in regular classrooms in their neighborhoods. They are \nwith their classmates, and they are learning. They are making \nimpressive progress. High school graduation rates for special needs \nstudents have also increased dramatically.\n  In an interesting study between those students who are beneficiaries \nof IDEA and older adults who did not have this opportunity although \nthey did have disabilities, those younger students with IDEA are in the \nworkforce at a much higher rate. This is not simply a good thing to do \nin an altruistic sense, it is an important thing to do for our economy, \nfor our workforce.\n  We have made progress with IDEA. We have increased the number of \nstudents who are covered. We have made it a standard that all students, \nparticularly those with disabilities, would have access to classrooms, \nbut we have not lived up to the real promise we made back in the mid-\nseventies, and that is that we would, in fact, pay 40 percent of the \ncost of this education for children with disabilities.\n  Sadly, the Federal share is about 15 percent, leaving it up to the \nStates to make up the difference. As we all know, this has been a \nconstant source of contention between the States and the Federal \nGovernment. It is something we have the opportunity to correct in this \nconference, an opportunity we have not as yet seen, but it is an \nopportunity I hope in the days ahead we will be able to realize as we \nreturn to the conference and, once again, press for full funding of \nIDEA.\n  We have been in this body and the other body over the last several \nyears constantly talking about the importance of IDEA, strongly \nsuggesting our unwavering support for IDEA. But those were easy votes \nbecause they were simply about the concept.\n  The hard vote took place last Friday in the conference where we were \nactually going to put dollars to our words, to match our rhetoric with \nreal resources. Unfortunately, on that real vote, the conference \nfailed.\n  We have an opportunity to build on what we did in the Senate several \nmonths ago. Senator Hagel and Senator Harkin offered an amendment that \nwould fully fund IDEA and make it mandatory spending. The amendment \nwould increase in yearly increments of $2.5 billion until the full 40 \npercent Federal share is realized by the year 2007.\n  In the process of making IDEA funding mandatory, it would free up \nanywhere between $28 billion and $52 billion in funds for discretionary \neducational programs that the Federal Government supports.\n\n  This would be a win-win situation, clearly signaling to the States \nthat they can depend upon a robust stream of IDEA funding and at the \nsame time give us the opportunity to support other worthy Federal \neducational programs such as title I, such as professional \ndevelopment--all those programs that are so important.\n  The President has rightly made education an important priority in his \nadministration, and he has taken a very aggressive view toward tough \naccountability standards for testing, but the reality is, without \nresources, we cannot fully realize the potential of American students. \nWe can test and test and test, but we do not have the resources for \nprofessional development, for smaller class size, for better libraries, \nfor a host of programs.\n  The testing will show us what we know already: There are students \nwho, because of social circumstances, because of income circumstances, \nbecause of lack of resources in the schools, are falling behind. We \nknow we can simply divide districts based upon their income, the \naffluent versus the poorest, and we will see a startling difference in \nperformance of those children. We want to do better. We want to have \ntough accountability, but without resources we are not going to get the \nresults.\n  That, again, is why I am so disappointed we did not follow up with \nthe wisdom of the Harkin-Hagel amendment and in the conference adopt \nthe Senate position: full funding of IDEA, mandatory funding of IDEA. \nThat could be the most fundamental education reform we could ever \naccomplish this year. Again, we missed the opportunity last Friday, but \nI hope before this conference concludes we will have another chance to \nrevisit this issue and to seize this opportunity and fully fund IDEA.\n  Just ask every Governor, every legislative leader, superintendents, \nprincipals; they will all say the same thing: The biggest thing we can \ndo to help them provide good education for all students is to fully \nfund IDEA. That is what I hear when I go back to Rhode Island. I do not \nhear about more testing. I hear something about libraries and \nprofessional development, but what I hear consistently and constantly \nis: Please, fully fund the IDEA program; please. We are rejecting the \npleas of those people who are in the front ranks of education, those \npeople who have the most significant responsibility for education.\n  Again, I think it is a mistake and a missed opportunity. This issue \nbecomes very real in the lives of the children and the families who \ndeal with issues of disability, and the parents who have to deal with \nthis issue. It is not an academic one. It is not a budgetary issue. It \nis not an issue that is hypothetical we could debate. It is personal \nbecause every parent wants the best for their child. Some parents have \nto fight constantly to get what is owed their child through the special \neducation program.\n  In Rhode Island, I constantly meet parents and they contact me. One \nfamily, the Gulianos from East Greenwich, RI, wrote to me and told me \nabout their struggle, which is typical of families across this country. \nFrom their letter:\n\n       Time and time again, we have heard from very well meaning \n     people that there is just not enough personnel or hours \n     available to provide these kinds of services. We are told \n     that they just don't have the funding. Funding that should \n     have come from the legislation that entitles Jamie to receive \n     appropriate educational services in the first place--IDEA.\n\n  This school system, one of the best school systems in my State, is \nnot a school system that would do badly on examinations. This is not a \nschool system that lacks professional development or adequate class \nsize or good facilities, but when it comes to IDEA even this district, \nthis affluent community, lacks the resources to fully serve all the \nchildren it needs to serve, and this district is a home to families who \nare themselves typically college educated and very well off, and they \ncan\n\n[[Page S12308]]\n\nadvocate for their child. But go into a center city where families \nunder more economic stress and sometimes families are with one adult \nand several children. For these families it is virtually impossible to \nadvocate successfully for the programs as they do in some of the more \naffluent suburbs. There the crisis is even more severe, the stress of \nfunding more severe. We can alleviate some of those problems and that \nstress if we go ahead and make IDEA mandatory and free up not only \nfunds for IDEA but also for other educational programs.\n  I hear the same thing from school principals who say if they get more \nIDEA funding, they can have additional teachers, enhanced technology, \nall those things that we say are important to the educational process. \nThroughout my State, superintendents and principals have consistently \nand constantly come forward to say, give us more resources for IDEA.\n  I believe strongly and emphatically this is something we have to do. \nIt is not an option. We cannot put it off until next year or the \nfollowing year. If we truly want to make an impact on education in the \nUnited States today, fund IDEA, provide strict accountability, provide \nresources for other programs such as professional development and \nlibraries, and we will have educational progress. If we do not do that, \nthen I think all the testing and all the accountability and all the \nevaluation will simply tell us what we know already: Some students are \nfailing; other students are doing exceptionally well.\n  The other problem we face is the reality that our brave words about \nIDEA, and our brave words and authorization about what we want to do \nwith respect to funding education, will shortly collide with reality. \nLast week, OMB Director Daniels announced we have locked ourselves into \nseveral years of deficits, and in those deficits I do not think we are \ngoing to see the commitment in dollars to education we are hearing \ntoday in rhetoric. That is another very important reason why today we \nshould make IDEA funding mandatory, and I hope we do.\n  In my State of Rhode Island, our board of regents for elementary and \nsecondary education has asked for a 4.4-percent increase. Frankly, the \nGovernor is resisting because he has ordered every other department in \nthe State to cut spending 6 percent. That is the reality of the States. \nIf we want educational reform, if we want to assist and support every \neducational organization in the States, then we have to put real \nresources into the mix of educational reform.\n  I argue again that our task in the next several days as we conclude \nthis conference should be to, once again, bring to the conference the \nissue of IDEA, bring forth the Harkin-Hagel amendment, mandatory \nfunding, a full Federal share by 2007. If we do that, we will have \neducational reform that works, that is robust, that is well funded, and \nthat will make a huge difference in the lives of every student in \nAmerica, particularly in the lives of those students with disabilities.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to offer for the Record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring for the conference report to H.R. 2299, \nthe Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations \nAct for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  The conference report provides $15.3 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority, including $440 million for defense spending. That budget \nauthority, when coupled with the report's new limitations on \nobligational authorities, will result in new outlays in 2002 of $20.076 \nbillion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority and obligation \nlimitations are taken into account, discretionary outlays for the \nconference report total $52.744 billion in 2002. Of that total, $28.489 \nbillion in outlays counts against the allocation for highway spending \nand $5.275 billion counts against the allocation for mass transit \nspending. The remaining $18.980 billion in outlays, including those for \ndefense spending, counts against the allocation for general purpose \nspending.\n  By comparison, the Senate-passed version of the bill provided $15.575 \nbillion in discretionary budget authority, which, when combined with \nthe bill's obligation limitations, would have resulted in $52.925 \nbillion in total outlays, or $181 million more than the conference \nreport.

Because the contingent firewall\n  is for budget authority only, the appropriations committee did not provide a separate allocation for defense outlays. This table combines defense and\n  nondefense outlays together as ``general purpose'' for purposes of comparing the conference report outlays with the Senate subcommittee's allocation.\n2 Mass transit budget authority is not counted against the appropriations committee's allocation and is therefore excluded from the above numbers.\n3 For enforcement purposes, the budget committee compares the conference report to the Senate 302(b) allocation.\n \nNotes.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, let me begin my remarks on North Korea \nand Egypt with an expression of sympathy and solidarity with the people \nof Israel following the weekend's brutal violence that killed and \ninjured scores of innocent civilians. My thoughts and prayers are with \nthe victims and their families.\n  The fanatical suicide bombings by Palestinian extremists must end \ntoday. PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat must immediately and unequivocally \nprove that he embraces peace with Israel, and he can do this by taking \nconcrete action against those responsible for organizing and committing \nthese heinous attacks. Israel has already appropriately responded to \nthe Palestinian terrorism, and I do not doubt that further retaliation \nis possible.\n  North Korea today is a failed state. Its centrally planned economy is \nin shambles, and the people of North Korea are, at best, oppressed and, \nat worst, starving and dying. Borrowing a page from Mao Zedong and Pol \nPot, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il recently launched a new \nrevolutionary movement to build ``a people's paradise on this land at \nan early date.'' I would remind my colleagues that in the jargon of \ndictators, ``paradise'' is synonymous with ``purgatory.''\n  While the North Korean leadership poses a clear and present danger to \nthe welfare of its own people, state sponsorship of international \nterrorism and news reports of North Korean missile sales to Egypt \npresent wider challenges to democracies around the world, from Japan to \nIsrael.\n  I have stood on the Senate floor several times this year to express \nmy concern with reports of Egyptian insistence on buying North Korean \nmissiles and weapons technology. Last week, this issue surfaced once \nagain at the State Department's daily press briefing. When asked \nwhether the Department has concluded that a missile deal between \nPyongyang and Cairo has not occurred, Spokesman Richard Boucher stated \n``No, I wouldn't go that far.''\n  This should give pause to all of us who follow events in the Middle \nEast closely. According to a November 16 article in the Washington \nPost, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak publicly warned of an arms race \nbetween Israel and its Arab neighbors. The danger posed by North Korean \nweapons sales to the region is double-edged: hostile arsenals are \nbolstered while Pyongyang receives much-needed infusions of cash. Deny \nboth, and stability is strengthened in Asia and the Middle East.\n  Egypt must immediately and honestly answer whether the purchase of \nNodong missiles, that have a range of 1,000 kilometers, is the \nbeginning of that arms race. If this is the case, America has no choice \nbut to review new foreign military sales to Egypt. I know some of my \ncolleagues will disagree with me on this issue, but, to paraphrase that \nold car repair commercial, we can pay for our inaction now, or we can \nreally pay for it later.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/03/senate-section/article/S12309-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred January 9, \n1993 in Laguna Beach, CA. A gay Vietnamese man was assaulted behind a \nstring of beachside gay bars. Jeff Michael Raines, 18, and Christopher \nMichael Cribbins, 22, both of San Clemente, and a 16-year-old from San \nJuan Capistrano were arrested in connection with the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/03/senate-section/article/S12309-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12309-S12310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE GREATEST GENERATION\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor members of ``the \ngreatest generation''--those men and women who were at Pearl Harbor on \nthe infamous day of December 7, 1941. Those who followed coined this \nnickname we all widely recognize, for the men and women who fought in \nthe Second World War did not think they were committing acts of \nheroism, they only believed they were doing what was right by serving \nour Nation.\n  The generation of men and women, who survived the Second World War, \nepitomize the characteristics we all, as Americans, hold in such high \nesteem. As children of the Depression, these men and women grew up \nknowing the meaning of sacrifice. And during the war, they readily went \nwithout luxuries, ready to give up whatever it took to help in the war \neffort. These men and women are also some of the bravest that our \nNation has ever seen. For they gave more than just material goods to \nthe war effort: they offered their husbands, their sons, their \nbrothers, their fathers, and themselves. Without hesitation they \nenlisted to help our Nation fight the good fight, to rid the world from \ncruel and aggressive tyrants, and to secure the freedom and liberty on \nwhich our Nation was founded.\n  It was 60 years ago that these men and women unselfishly risked their \nlives to begin the defense of our country and to fight for freedom in \nthe world. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 gave Americans a \nglimpse into the tragedy that the men and women of Pearl Harbor \nsurvived. Now, more than ever, our entire country appreciates the \nheroism and leadership embodied by the men and women who served in the \nPacific. The courage they displayed is now a more tangible concept for \nus all, as we can now more fully realize the rarity of their instinct \nto charge forward and fight in the face of danger. We can only believe \nthat the actions displayed by these members of ``the greatest \ngeneration'' laid the foundation for the heroism and leadership we are \nseeing in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.\n  An important part of honoring the men and women of Pearl Harbor is \npreserving the stories of their experiences. We must record the \nexperiences of those who survived the attack as well as preserve the \nstories of those 2,403 men and women who did not live to tell of their \nencounters on December 7, 1941. I commend the National Museum of the \nPacific War in Fredericksburg, TX, for its continuing devotion to \neducating current and future generations of Americans on the grim \nrealities of war. It is the only museum in the world dedicated to \ntelling the entire story of the conflict in the Pacific during World \nWar II. Not only does this museum tell the complete story, it also \nprovides a thorough understanding of the causes, sacrifices, and \nresolutions of World War II in the Pacific. The men and women of this \nmuseum continue to keep the story of the attack on Pearl Harbor alive. \nIt is truly a National treasure with an outstanding collection of \nartifacts from the Pacific War.\n  While there are many ceremonies and events to commemorate this 60th \nanniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, this one, in Fredericksburg, \nTX, stands out for several reasons. To begin, this commemoration \nceremony is one of only two National events being staged by the Pearl \nHarbor Survivors Association. And of the two, it is the only one open \nto the public to join in the observance of this milestone anniversary. \nThis ceremony is particularly special because of the guests in \nattendance. The museum will host more than 300 survivors of the Pearl \nHarbor attack, and their families, who have traveled from their homes \nthroughout the United States to be here today. The location of this \nceremony is also of important note: Fredericksburg, TX, is the \nbirthplace of Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, who was Commander-in-Chief \nPacific during World War II. The location of the National Museum of the \nPacific War, previously known as the Admiral Nimitz Museum, was chosen \nto pay tribute to this great man.\n\n[[Page S12310]]\n\n  Texas is honored to have as the keynote speaker former President \nGeorge Bush. As the youngest pilot to fly in the Navy during World War \nII, Lieutenant Junior Grade George Bush flew TBM Avengers in combat off \nthe aircraft carrier U.S.S. San Jacinto.\n  Sunday, December 7, 1941 will forever live as an infamous day in our \nNation's history. But the response of the men and women we will honor \non December 7, 2001 to the surprise attack will also forever be \ningrained in the memory of America. Their bravery and heroism in the \nface of mortal danger, and their continuous determination to fight for \nthe existence of freedom in the world shaped our Nation and, indeed, \nthe world. To the men and women of Pearl Harbor we can only say thank \nyou. Thank you for preserving the tenants on which this country was \nfounded, thank you for risking your lives so that those who lived after \nyou could enjoy the same freedom and democracy that you knew, and thank \nyou for being at this commemorative ceremony so that we may show you \nour appreciation and admiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/03/senate-section/article/S12310-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        WHITE KNOLL STUDENTS BUY NEW YORK CITY A NEW FIRE TRUCK\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize White \nKnoll Middle School in Lexington, South Carolina for their wonderful \ndonation of a fire truck for the New York City Fire Department.\n  You might ask why, Mr. President, would Lexington, South Carolina be \ninterested in purchasing a fire truck for New York City. In 1867, after \nfire from the Civil War devastated our state capital of Columbia \nlocated just across the county line from Lexington, a group of New York \nCity firefighters raised money to buy Columbia a new fire truck, known \nthen as a hose reel wagon. Because the hose reel wagon was so much more \neffective in putting out fires than the bucket brigade, Columbia \nofficials pledged to return the favor some day.\n  With the devastation in New York City and the loss of dozens of \nrescue vehicles in the September 11th attacks, the students of White \nKnoll learned of the all but forgotten pledge and decided to take \nmatters into their own hands. They started raising money by selling \npatriotic buttons, T-shirts, and baked goods. They also solicited help \nfrom area businesses. The students' goal of $354,000 was the minimum \nneeded to purchase a new fire truck without any additional equipment.\n  Four students were selected to take the two day trip to New York City \nto award Mayor Rudolph Giuliani with an oversized check with the amount \nof $354,411. Thomas Dunn, Maurice Hallman, Staci Smith, and Leigh Tyson \nalso rode in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade with Mayor Giuliani and \nYankees manager Joe Torre.\n  South Carolina and New York have been reunited by generosity in the \nmidst of tragedy. I commend all the students at White Knoll Middle \nSchool for their inspiring community service and hard work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/03/senate-section/article/S12310-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING WILMINGTON ROTARY FOR PEACE CENTER INITIATIVE\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is with tremendous pride that I \nrise today to salute the Rotary Club of Wilmington, DE, for its \nleadership in the worldwide initiative of Rotary International to \nestablish eight Centers for International Studies in Peace and Conflict \nResolution.\n  Recently, the Chairman of the International Rotary Foundation, Luis \nGiay, visited Delaware and presented an award to the Wilmington Rotary \nClub for being among the very first Rotary Clubs in the world to raise, \nsua sponte, $50,000 for the International Studies in Peace and Conflict \nResolution project. The funds will be used to pay the two-year tuition \ncosts for a graduate student to attend one of the newly-formed Rotary \nPeace Centers.\n  In this time of war and strife, my colleagues might find it \ninteresting to learn more about these new Centers. The goals of the \nRotary Peace Centers are: Mediation, Conflict Resolution, and Peace \nwhere there is war; understanding where there is disharmony; food \nsecurity where there is hunger; health Care where there is disease; \neducation where there is illiteracy; conservation where there is \nenvironmental degradation; sustainable Economic Development where there \nis poverty.\n  As Rotary's major educational priority in the 21st Century, the \nRotary Centers for International Studies will provide opportunities for \nour next generation of leaders and scholars to focus on dealing \neffectively with obstacles to international cooperation and peace.\n  Educating such promising future leaders will help Rotary fulfill its \nlong-standing mission to promote global peace and understanding.\n  The Rotary Centers have partnered with some of the leading \nuniversities in the world. The eight Rotary Peace Centers are located \nat: Duke University and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill \nin North Carolina; the University of California-Berkeley in California; \nSciences Po in Paris, France; the University of Bradford in West \nYorkshire, England; the University of Queensland in Brisbane, \nQueensland, Australia; the International Christian University in Tokyo, \nJapan; and, Universidad del Salvador in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n  Like most big ideas, the fundraising initiative grew from a seed, in \nthis case a seed planted by a small group of Wilmington Rotarians. Past \nPresidents Joe Melloy and Bruce Beardwood knew that with the Wilmington \nRotary Club's 86-year history of service that its members would want to \nbe pioneers in the Rotary Peace Center project. Wilmington Rotarians \nthen set out to meet the $50,000 goal. They held a very successful \nsilent auction to raise nearly half of the money. Generous, individual \ncontributions put them over the top.\n  Even more impressive, the Wilmington Rotary Club then challenged the \nother 43 Clubs and 2,000 Rotarians in the Rotary District that \nencompasses Delaware and the Eastern Shore of Maryland to raise money \nfor the Rotary Centers for International Studies. I am proud to say, \nchallenge issued, challenge met.\n  I think it is appropriate and important to publicly recognize the \nefforts of the Rotary Club of Wilmington to do its part to help make \nour world a better, safer place to live. Not only is the Wilmington \nRotary Delaware's oldest and largest Rotary Club with about 250 \nmembers, it continues to be among the leading Rotary Clubs in the \nUnited States. Its leadership as a pioneer Club for the Rotary Centers \nfor Peace and International Studies is a great example of the Rotary \ntradition of service and of the part each one of us can play in \nadvancing the goal of world peace.\n  To the members of the Rotary Club of Wilmington, congratulations and \nthank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/03/senate-section/article/S12310-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar.\n\n       H.R. 3210.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na special rule for members of the uniformed services and Foreign \nService, and other employees, in determining the exclusion of gain from \nthe sale of a principal residence; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I along with Senator Lincoln am proud to \nsponsor this bill to allow members of the military service, Foreign \nService, and employees serving on assignment abroad to qualify for the \nsame tax relief on the profit generated when they sell their main \nresidence as other Americans. This bill does not create a new tax \nbenefit, it merely modifies current law to exclude the time living \nabroad when calculating the number of years the homeowner has lived in \ntheir primary residence. This bill will treat members of the military, \nforeign service officers and civilians living abroad fairly, by \ntreating them like all other Americans.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 gives taxpayers who sell their \nprincipal residence a much-needed tax break. Prior to the 1997 act, \ntaxpayers received a one-time exclusion on the profit they made when \nthey sold their principal residence, but the taxpayer had to be at \nleast 55 years old and live in the residence for two of the five years \npreceding the sale. This provision primarily benefited older Americans, \nwhile not providing any relief to younger taxpayers and their families.\n  The 1997 act corrected this flaw. Now, a taxpayer who sells his or \nher principal residence is not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit \nfrom the sale. Joint files are not taxed on the first $500,000 of \nprofit they make from selling their principal residence. The taxpayer \nmust meet two requirements to qualify for this tax relief: One, they \nmust own the home for at least two of the five years preceding the \nsale; and two, they must live in the home as their main home for at \nleast two of the last five years.\n  Unfortunately, the second part of this eligibility text \nunintentionally and unfairly prohibits men and women in the Armed \nForces, Foreign Service, and U.S. employees working abroad from \nqualifying for this beneficial tax relief. This was not the intent of \nthe 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n  This bill remedies the inequality in the 1997 law. The bill amends \nthe Internal Revenue Code so that military members, Foreign Service \nmembers, and U.S. employees working abroad are not penalized by \nsuspending the five-year determination period. The member is still \nrequired to own and live in the home for at least two years. This \nchange was previously passed by Congress as part of the 1999 Taxpayer \nRelief and Refund Act, which was vetoed by President Clinton for \nunrelated reasons.\n  The 1997 home sale provision unintentionally discourages home \nownership for U.S. members serving abroad which is bad fiscal policy. \nHome ownership has numerous benefits for communities and individual \nhomeowners. Owning a home provides Americans with a sense of community \nand adds stability to our nation's neighborhoods. Home ownership also \ngenerated valuable property taxes for our nation's communities.\n  We cannot afford to discourage U.S. citizens from working and living \nabroad by penalizing them with higher taxes merely because they are \ndoing\n\n[[Page S12313]]\n\ntheir job. Enacting this remedy will grant equal and fair tax relief to \nthose U.S. citizens working abroad.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1755\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize an additional permanent judgeship in the \ndistrict of Idaho, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation, on behalf \nof myself and my fellow Idaho Senator, Mike Crapo, creating a new \nFederal judgeship for the State of Idaho. This is a matter of great \nurgency to the citizens of Idaho, and our bill is aimed at heading off \na looming crisis for the Federal bench in our State.\n  Idaho has two Federal district judgeships, created in 1890 and 1954. \nIt is one of only three States in the Union with two Federal District \njudgeships. Because of he State's sheer size, its extraordinary \nincrease in population, and tremendous growth in caseload over nearly \nfive decades, the current situation is becoming increasingly \nunworkable.\n  For that reason, Senator Crapo and I are seeking an additional \njudgeship to ensure that there are adequate resources for the \nadministration if justice in our State. I am gratified to note that we \nhave the strong support of Idaho's sitting Federal judges in this \neffort.\n  Let me take a moment to explain my State's problem in greater detail. \nIdaho has three distinct and widely distant geographical areas: the \nSoutheast, the Southwest, and the North. A district judge must travel \nup to 450 miles between division offices. This distance is greater than \nthat traveled in other rural district courts, including those Montana, \nWyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, or eastern Washington. In fact, \nonly a district judge in Alaska has a greater distance to travel, when \ncomparing these rural district courts.\n  The sheer size of Idaho, the geographical barriers, and the \ndistribution of population make it a time-consuming, expensive and \nphysically draining process for two judges to serve the entire State. \nAs our current Chief District Judge B. Lynn Winmill has pointed out, if \nthere is a trial in southwest Idaho and a trial in southeast Idaho, \n``there is no district judge to serve the needs of northern Idaho.'' In \naddition, as Judge Winmill has stated, the ``mountainous terrain and \ntwo-land highway system in northern Idaho make [that] area particularly \ndifficult to serve.''\n  Some Federal districts have the advantage of being able to call upon \nsenior judges to help out by taking half-caseloads. Idaho has no senior \njudges and therefore does not have the flexibility that other districts \nhave in relation to managing cases. Consequently, for example, when \ndistrict Judge Edward J. Lodge was involved in a 6-month trial on a \ncomplex matter, Idaho was forced to request that the Ninth Circuit \nJudicial Council authorize the use of judges from the Eastern District \nof Washington. These judges assisted our district by handling close to \n50 cases in the last year. While this action may have eased Idaho's \ncrisis temporarily, it cannot reasonably be considered an acceptable \npermanent solution to borrow judges from another state and district.\n  The population of Idaho has increased 28.5 percent in the past \ndecade, giving Idaho the third fastest-growing population in the \ncountry. In the past year alone, Idaho was the fifth fastest-growing \nState in the Nation. Population growth is traditionally a controlling \nfactor in increasing a district's judgeships, and yet Idaho has not \ngained a judge in nearly half a century.\n  The District of Idaho's caseload continues to grow. During the 12-\nmonth period ending September 30, 2000, the District of Idaho's civil \nfilings increased 26.9 percent, ranking second in the country in the \npercentage increase. Our district also ranks 25th in the Nation in the \nnumber of trials completed. The gap between the number of new civil \nfilings and the number completed is spreading ever wider, and is \nalready a broad chasm into which too many cases are already dropping.\n  There are currently 23 assistant U.S. attorneys in Idaho, which is \nmore than Montana, Wyoming, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and \neastern Washington. With filings for the period ending September 30, \n2000 weighted at 447 cases per judge, this number exceeds the 430 which \nthe Judicial Conference uses to indicate the need for additional \njudgeships. Combining this excess number of cases with the travel \ndistances in Idaho makes the caseload even more burdensome for Idaho's \ntwo judges.\n  Additionally, according to Idaho's new U.S. Attorney Tom Moss, there \nhas been an increase in criminal cases initiated, and he is expecting \nthe ``caseloads to increase significantly,'' especially in Idaho's five \nIndian reservations.\n  Although this bill is being introduced late in the year, the effort \nto secure an additional judgeship has been underway for many months. We \nhave had member-to-member and staff-to-staff discussions with the \nSenate Judiciary Committee about including an additional judgeship for \nIdaho in any legislation that the committee considers, creating new \njudgeships. Indeed, Idaho's chief district judge even traveled to \nWashington, DC, to visit personally with members of the committee and \nmake the case for a new Idaho district judgeship.\n  I greatly appreciate the advice that we have received in this effort \nfrom Chairman Leahy, Senator Hatch, and their staff, as well as other \nJudiciary Committee members, and it is because they suggested it that \nwe are taking the step of filing this very simple bill, to put the \nissue formally before the Judiciary Committee and the Senate.\n  There should not be a waiting list for people to obtain justice in \nour courts, but there is in Idaho. This will continue to be the case \nuntil relief arrives\n\n[[Page S12314]]\n\nin the form of a third judge. I hope the Senate will support this \nmeasure and protect the interests of justice in the State of Idaho.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Miller, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Durbin, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1758. A bill to prohibit human cloning while preserving important \nareas of medical research, including stem cell research; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Senators Kennedy, Boxer, Miller, \nCorzine, Durbin, Clinton, and I are introducing legislation to make the \ncloning of a human being a crime. Unlike other bills, our bill would \nnot criminalize cloning that could provide treatments for diseases, \nknown as therapeutic cloning.\n  On November 25, scientists at Advanced Cell Technology, a \nMassachusetts biotechnology firm, announced that they had created the \nfirst human embryos ever produced by cloning. I believe that this \nannouncement raises serious concerns and we are proposing a bill to \naddress this development.\n  The bill we introduce today would: 1. permanently ban human \nreproductive cloning, the cloning of a human being; and 2. allow \ntherapeutic cloning, that is, allow the use of somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer or other cloning technologies to create stem cells for \ntreating diseases.\n  I support a ban on the cloning of human beings because I believe it \nis scientifically unsafe, morally unacceptable, and ethically flawed.\n  Our bill would allow cloning for therapeutic or treatment purposes. \nIt would not allow cloning for reproductive purposes, for creating a \nhuman being. Specifically, it prohibits the implantation of the product \nof nuclear transplantation into a uterus. Nuclear transplantation is \nalso known as somatic cell nuclear transfer.\n  There is broad agreement in the public, in the Congress, in the \nscientific community, in the medical community, and in the religious \ncommunity that the cloning of a human being should be prohibited. This \nbill does just that.\n  The view that we should not clone human beings is held by many groups \nand authorities, including the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, \nNBAC, which concluded that it is unacceptable for anyone in the public \nor private sector to create a child using somatic cell nuclear transfer \ntechnology. The Commission said,\n\n       At this time, it is morally unacceptable for anyone in the \n     public or private sector, whether in a research or clinical \n     setting, to attempt to create a child using somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer cloning.\n\n  The difference between our bill and several others including H.R. \n2505, the bill passed by the House of Representatives is whether the \nbills protect valuable medical research that some day could provide \ncures for many dreaded diseases, diseases like cancer, diabetes, cystic \nfibrosis, and heart disease; and conditions like spinal cord injury, \nliver damage, arthritis, and burns. This research may some day develop \nreplacement cells and tissues to restore bodily function and treat \ndiseases. Therapeutic cloning is particularly promising because the \nrejection of implanted tissues is less likely since the tissues would \nexactly match those of the person who donated the somatic cell nucleus.\n  To criminally prohibit this kind of research would be a big setback \nfor science. Here's what some of the experts say about the promise of \ntherapeutic cloning: The Association of American Medical Colleges:\n\n       Therapeutic cloning technology could provide an invaluable \n     approach to studying how cells become specialized, which in \n     turn could provide new understanding of the mechanisms that \n     lead to the development of the abnormal cells responsible for \n     cancers and certain birth defects. Improved understanding of \n     cell specialization may also provide answers to how cells age \n     or are regulated--leading to new insights into the treatment \n     of cure of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, or other \n     incapacitating degenerative diseases of the brain and spinal \n     cord. The technology might also help us understand how to \n     activate certain genes to permit the creation of customized \n     cells for transplantation or grafting. Such cells would be \n     genetically identical to the cells of the donor and could \n     therefore be transplanted into that donor without fear of \n     immune rejection, the major biological barrier to organ and \n     tissue transplantation at this time.\n\n  The Society for Women's Health Research wrote me on November 28:\n\n       Barring all therapeutic cloning would more likely drive \n     research underground and guarantee that only the most \n     unscrupulous would advance these technologies.\n\n  The National Health Council said:\n\n       Making reproductive human cloning unlawful must be done in \n     a way that does not deprive those suffering from debilitating \n     chronic diseases, potential relief and possible cures.\n\n  The Alliance for Aging Research wrote on November 28,\n\n       Scientists who utilized therapeutic cloning techniques in \n     the conduct of important scientific research would be labeled \n     as criminals. The consequence would be that important \n     research, research intended to save lives and reduce \n     suffering of tens of millions Americans, would be stopped in \n     its tracks.\n\n  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wrote on \nNovember 1, 2001:\n\n       Therapeutic cloning may hold the key for repairing or \n     creating new tissues or organs that could alleviate myriad \n     medical conditions: diabetes, heart disease, spinal cord \n     injury and Parkinson's, to name just a few. This technology \n     is key to the ability to create ``customized tissues'' using \n     a patient's own DNA to avoid rejection problems, and at this \n     time, appears promising.\n\n  Other bills would make it a crime to clone cells that are used for \ntherapeutic purposes that some day will save lives and suffering. I \ncannot support that approach, to criminalize legitimate medical \nresearch that could some day treat diseases and save human lives. That \nwould be very short-sighted.\n  In summary, I believe that the cloning of human beings is wrong and \nshould be outlawed. I believe that therapeutic cloning holds great \nmedical promise and should not be prohibited. This bill will make it a \ncrime to create human beings, but protect important scientific research \nthat can save human lives and relieve human suffering.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered printed in the \nRecord.\n\n          Summary of the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001\n\n       Findings: Cites findings by the National Bioethics Advisory \n     Commission and other respected bodies, which have recommended \n     that Congress enact legislation prohibiting anyone from \n     conducting or attempting human cloning but not unduly \n     interfering with important areas of research, such as somatic \n     cell nuclear transfer or nuclear transplantation.\n       Prohibitions: Makes it unlawful for any person: To conduct \n     or attempt to conduct human cloning; to ship the product of \n     nuclear transplantation in interstate or foreign commerce for \n     the purpose of human cloning; or to use federal funds for \n     these activities.\n       Definitions: ``Human cloning'' is asexual reproduction by \n     implanting or attempting to implant the product of nuclear \n     transplantation into a uterus.\n       ``Nuclear transplantation'' is transferring the nucleus of \n     a human somatic (body) cell into an oocyte (egg) from which \n     the nucleus or all chromosomes have been or will be removed \n     or rendered inert.\n       Penalties: Makes violators liable for a criminal fine and/\n     or up to 10 years in prison as well as a civil penalty of \n     $1,000,000 or three times the gross profits resulting from \n     the violation, whichever is greater.\n       Protection of Medical Research: Clarifies that the bill \n     does not restrict therapeutic cloning, stem cell research or \n     other forms of biomedical research such as gene therapy.\n       Ethics Requirements: Applies to nuclear transplantation \n     research the ethics requirements currently used by the \n     National Institutes of Health. These include informed \n     consent, an ethics board review, and protections for the \n     safety and privacy of research participants. Imposes a \n     $250,000 civil penalty for violation of the ethics \n     requirements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/03/senate-section/article/S12314-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12314-S12315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2214.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Change Risk \n     Management Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) human activities, namely energy production and use, \n     contribute to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases \n     in the atmosphere, which may ultimately contribute to global \n     climate change beyond that resulting from natural \n     variability;\n       (2) although the science of global climate change has been \n     advanced in the past ten years, the timing and magnitude of \n     climate change-related impacts on the United States cannot \n     currently be predicted with any reasonable certainty;\n       (3) furthermore, a recent National Research Council review \n     of climate change science suggests that without an \n     understanding of the sources and degree of uncertainty \n     regarding climate change and its impacts, decision-makers \n     could fail to define the best ways to manage the risk of \n     climate change;\n       (4) despite this uncertainty, the potential impacts from \n     human-induced climate change pose a substantial risk that \n     should be managed in a responsible manner;\n       (5) given that the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions from \n     human activities result from energy production and use, \n     national and international energy policy decisions made now \n     and in the longer-term future will influence the extent and \n     timing of any climate change and resultant impacts from \n     climate change later this century;\n       (6) the characteristics of greenhouse gases and the \n     physical nature of the climate system require that \n     stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at \n     any future level must be a long-term effort undertaken on a \n     global basis;\n       (7) the characteristics of existing energy-related \n     infrastructure and capital suggest that effective greenhouse \n     gas management efforts will depend on the development of \n     long-term, cost-effective technologies and practices that can \n     be demonstrated and deployed commercially in the United \n     States and around the world;\n       (8) environmental progress, energy security, economic \n     prosperity, and satisfaction of basic human needs are \n     interrelated, particularly in developing countries;\n       (9) developing countries will constitute the major source \n     of greenhouse gas emissions in the 21st century and the major \n     source of increases in such emissions;\n       (10) any program to address the risks of climate change \n     that does not fully include developing nations as integral \n     participants will be ineffective;\n       (11) a new long-term, technology-based, cost-effective, \n     flexible, and global strategy to ensure long-term energy \n     security and manage the risk of climate change is needed, and \n     should be promoted by the United States in its domestic and \n     international activities in this regard.\n\n     SEC. 3.
