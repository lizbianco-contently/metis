Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a memo from \nJohn Haycock of Haycock Petroleum, Las Vegas, be printed in the Record. \nThis is a memo to his employees. It is one of the best dissertations on \nour free market system I have seen, and it was done as a result of the \nevents of September 11.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Date: September 17, 2001.\n     To: Managers.\n     From: John Haycock.\n       The events of Tuesday, September 11th will have an effect \n     on every business in this Country. I believe it is the \n     responsibility of senior management to assess our specific \n     situation and develop plans to mitigate and minimize any \n     negative impact to Haycock Petroleum Company.\n       The following is a brief summary of what I believe to be \n     the areas of impact to our Company and our business routine.\n\n\n                            national economy\n\n       As I write this memo, the market is down 509 points. While \n     that is a significant loss, it is less than 5%, and certainly \n     not unexpected. If the market closes at around that mark, I \n     believe it will be a positive sign. If the market drops 10%, \n     trading will be stopped.\n       The Fed dropped interest rates \\1/2\\% this morning in a \n     logical and responsible move which seemed to put a stop to \n     the market drop.\n       I am a strong believer in the resiliency of a free market.\n       The National economy is headed for a tough time. There was \n     talk of a recession before the attacks on Tuesday, and those \n     events would seem to make a recessionary period more likely.\n\n\n                             local economy\n\n       There is an immediate hesitancy to travel--especially by \n     air. A significant drop in air travel will hurt our 2 major \n     markets. Las Vegas depends on tourism, and the majority of \n     our visitors arrive by air. Salt Lake depends on air traffic, \n     especially going into the winter months, to feed the skiing \n     industry, which is a huge part of that economy.\n       My opinion about the down-turn in air travel is that it \n     will be somewhat short lived, assuming there are no more \n     airline tragedies. Time normally heals, and 120 days from \n     now, travel will be somewhat normal.\n       The Olympics in SLC is a variable. Depending on what \n     happens between now and then, attendance could be \n     significantly affected both by the fear of air travel, and \n     the potential of Olympic venues as high profile targets for \n     terrorism.\n\n[[Page S9468]]\n\n       Meanwhile, it is likely that there could be an increase in \n     local unemployment as affected industries adjust to any drop \n     in business.\n       I don't believe that a short term drop in travel will have \n     a long term effect on sustained growth in Utah and Nevada.\n\n\n                                 SUPPLY\n\n       Currently, supply does not seem to be an issue. There is a \n     downward trend in the price of distillates, likely due to the \n     glut of jet fuel. Gasoline is moving upward but certainly not \n     abnormally. If there is a move from air travel to travel by \n     car, that would seem to encourage an increase in gasoline.\n       If however, there is bombing in the Middle East, pricing \n     and supply will be immediately affected. We've been there \n     before.\n\n\n                             WHAT ABOUT US?\n\n       This will undoubtedly have an impact on our business.\n       Supply volatility is something we know how to deal with if \n     necessary.\n       A downturn in the general economy will have effects on the \n     demand for the products that we sell, and if necessary we \n     will adjust our infrastructure accordingly.\n       Credit administration, which is a very big part of our \n     business, should be approached very conservatively even in \n     view of any decrease in demand.\n       The interest rate cut will help.\n       Economic conditions are cyclical, and do not last forever.\n       We can help our own cause within our Company and our \n     communities if we maintain a cautious optimism and do our \n     jobs well.\n       Again, I believe in the resiliency of a free economy and I \n     have a lot of faith in this Country.\n       This too shall pass.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I want to talk a little bit about the \nissue of how we as a government and how we as a people are going to \naddress what is clearly a threat that confronts us today in the area of \nterrorism.\n  Last week, the Commerce-State-Justice bill was on the floor, and a \nnumber of initiatives in the area of terrorism were included in that \nbill. I certainly thank the assistant leader for his strong support for \nthat bill, for the elements which were in that bill, and his speaking \non behalf of it at that time.\n  Let me review, so we can put in perspective where we stand as a \ngovernment, what we have been doing and what we need to do in a number \nof areas, certainly not a comprehensive review but at least a \npreliminary review of what has to be done.\n  The Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary, on \nwhich I am the ranking member and Senator Hollings is chairman, has \nheld innumerable hearings on this issue over the last 5 years in an \neffort to try to get our arms around what is obviously an issue that is \nextremely difficult to get our arms around. It seems a bit hollow now \nin light of what happened on September 11, but there was an attempt at \nleast to try to put some order into our effort at the Federal level.\n  Clearly, a dramatic amount still needs to be done, and the American \npeople need to understand this is not going to be a simple exercise, an \novernight exercise, or an exercise that can be completed in a week or a \nmonth or a year. Potentially it may take years before we as a nation \nare able to bring to the threat of terrorism some resolution which \nmakes us more comfortable with our ability to manage it and deal with \nit, especially when there are individuals willing to kill themselves \nand take innocent lives in order to accomplish their goals.\n  Let us begin with the basic threat and how we should address it. The \nissue of terrorism needs to be addressed on three basic levels. First \nis the intelligence level, both domestic and international. Second is \nthe apprehension, the catching, of people before they commit the crime, \nbefore they undertake the act. People need to understand this is \ndifferent from what is the traditional law enforcement exercise.\n  In most law enforcement undertakings, we wait until the event occurs, \nuntil someone has committed an act which violates our laws, before we \nundertake to capture them or attempt to bring them to justice. In this \ninstance, under the terrorism instance, the whole mindset must shift in \nthe area of apprehension to one of taking action before the event \noccurs because, as we have seen, when the event occurs it is so \nhorrific or can be so horrific that it simply cannot be accepted as a \nconsequence of not having taken action.\n  The third element is managing the crisis, managing the event. So it \nis intelligence, domestic/international; apprehension; and then, should \nan event occur, the managing of the event, both the immediate crisis \nand the aftermath, the consequences.\n  In the area of intelligence, it is very clear we have some \nsignificant needs. We can divide these needs fairly easily into the \nneeds that involve using people in the gathering of intelligence and \nthe needs that involve technology.\n  In the use-of-people area, we as a government in the 1990s, for a \nvariety of reasons, basically decided we would no longer hire unsavory \ncharacters in order to get information. That was a mistake. It was \nknown by a lot of people who were in the intelligence-gathering \ncommunity to be a mistake when it was done. The decision to rely \nprimarily on electronic surveillance and our capacity to use electronic \nsurveillance as the main way of gathering information was a belief in a \nsystem that simply did not work, as has been proven to us. The \npenetration of small cells, which are for the most part clannish-\noriented, usually family groups, is extremely difficult. It is \nextremely difficult under any scenario, but it is virtually impossible \nif we do not use people who are not necessarily persons of high \ncharacter by our definition.\n\n  Therefore, we as a government made a decision, which was wrong, and \nwe are trying to reverse it today. This Senate has actually spoken on \nthis point in the bill and said the policy of the Government, which up \nuntil Tuesday, September 11, was not to hire such individuals for the \npurposes of on-the-ground intelligence, should no longer be pursued. \nThe CIA and other agencies which have intelligence needs have the \nauthority to proceed with using human intelligence and people they need \nto hire to accomplish that. That is exactly what we should be doing \ntoday.\n  Unfortunately, and I think we have to understand this, it takes \nmonths, years, an inordinate amount of time to put these people in \nplace. These individuals with whom we are working in order to gather \nthe human intelligence have to gather their credibility within the \norganizations they are trying to penetrate, and it literally can take \nyears before those people will become effective. We can not suddenly \nturn a switch and say we have switched directions and we will be \nsuccessful in this area. We need to at least begin by turning the \nswitch and saying we are going to switch directions and start using \nhuman intelligence-gathering activities again, as we did through most \nof the cold war.\n  Second, in the electronics area it is very obvious that our \nintelligence-gathering communities, both domestic and foreign-oriented, \nwhether they are CIA or FBI, have severe problems because of the \nlimitations of law that have been placed on them in the area of \nintelligence-gathering capability and because of the way the commercial \ncommunity works today. The bill that passed as a result of the \namendment offered by Senator Hatch, Senator Kyl, and Senator Feinstein \nmade some progress in this area in the area of wiretaps and the ability \nto, rather than focusing on the piece of equipment, focus on getting a \ncourt order that allows monitoring of the individual.\n  But there is a great deal more that needs to be done, and I expect \nwithin the next day or so we will see a package of proposals sent up \nhere by the Attorney General. I hope we will act quickly. That package \nhas been represented to me to be a package which has what is needed and \nwhat can be done without undermining our constitutional protections of \nsearch and seizure and other rights we have. The simple fact is, we do \nneed to act in this area.\n  In addition, the area of encryption, time after time, for 4 years, we \nheard\n\n[[Page S9469]]\n\nin our committee was the single biggest concern the FBI had in its \ncapacity to adequately monitor what was going on among the terrorist \ncommunity, those people who wish to promote terrorism. In the area of \nencryption we need to have a new regime. We need to have the \ncooperation of the community that is building the software, producing \nthe software, and building the equipment that creates the encryption \ntechnology.\n  I have ideas how to do this so we do not undermine their activity to \nsell their product, and ideas that will allow us as a nation that wants \nto protect the civil rights of individuals and constitutional rights of \nindividuals to do that, yet still allow our law enforcement community, \nwhen it sees a need, to be able to break a code. It allows the \ncommunity to have the access to the keys to accomplish that under a \nstrict structure which is legal and judicially controlled and therefore \ndoes not undermine the rights of the individuals who are producing this \nproduct or using the product but simply gets at the bad guys. I have a \nproposal to do that.\n\n  More important, we have to recognize this is not a domestic problem. \nThese products are made internationally. I believe we have the right to \nuse the market of the United States as leverage for the purposes of \naccomplishing the protection of America. We have a huge economic market \nin the United States. The people making these products want to sell \ntheir products in the United States, whether it is this product or \nsomething else they make. I believe we should use the leverage of the \nAmerican market as a way to say, if you are going to sell this type of \nequipment anywhere in the world, and you want to sell something in the \nUnited States also, you have an obligation to comply with our needs for \nour national security under a strict legal judicial structure.\n  I am hopeful we can set up a regime that will be fair, that will be \nsubject to the judicial controls necessary to protect the \nconstitutional rights of people who are law-abiding but will also give \nour intelligence community the access to the information they need when \nthey know there is somebody out there using encryption technology for \nthe purposes of pursuing a terrorist act in the United States. There is \nno excuse for anybody to be underwriting that type of activity in our \ncountry. That is the intelligence level.\n  The second level, as I mentioned, was the apprehension level. \nApprehension is extremely difficult when you are dealing with the \nterrorist community. There is an entire law enforcement concept in this \nNation that says we apprehend after the act occurs. Yet if we wait \nuntil after the act occurs in the area of terrorism, the harm is so \nextreme, as we saw in New York and in Washington, that it becomes very \nhard to justify allowing the event to occur before we have declared \nthat the individual needs to be apprehended. We have to change our \nmindset and our approach, and in doing so we have to address our \nconstitutional protections so you do not end up undermining that \nbecause it will make the terrorist successful.\n  The simple fact is we are going to have to adjust our approach in the \narea of law enforcement to one of apprehending before the event \napproaches rather than after the event.\n  Second, we are going to have to face the fact that our borders are \nincredibly porous and we have to set up a new regime for managing our \nborders which allows the proper flow of individuals back and forth so \nwe can have the access that people, for example, from Mexico wish to \nhave to work in the United States. But we also have to have controls so \nwe know who is coming into our country.\n  Again, I think the Guest Worker Program discussed and in the works is \na way to address that. I have some thoughts in that area. This will be \na key element of the United States of how we apprehend individuals who \nare bent on committing acts of terror in our Nation, getting control \nover our borders.\n  The third element involved is crisis management and consequence \nmanagement. Here the Federal Government needs to get its act under \ncontrol. We have 46 agencies responsible for some element of terrorism \nor counterterrorism. There is tremendous overlap; that is, regrettably, \nturf issues. There is often indecision and lack of communication of \ninformation. In fact, in the instance we had in New York, there may \nhave been a specific lack of communication of information. We need a \ncentralized management structure within our Federal Government.\n  We have proposed in the Commerce-State-Justice bill it be divided for \nthe purposes of domestic terrorist acts--no military but domestic \nterrorist acts--into two areas. In the Justice Department, appointment \nof a Deputy Attorney General of Terrorism, with a cross-jurisdiction \nresponsibility. Unless you have budget authority for this individual, \nthere is no point in having such an individual.\n  The Justice Department for crisis management, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Administration for consequence administration, they would \nessentially be coordinators of the issue of how we handle domestic \nterrorist events here in the United States. They would function as \ncoequals, and would be sequential, however, in their response to an \nevent.\n  This is just one proposal for how to do it. It is one that passed \nthis Senate and has been strongly supported, for example, by the \nassistant leader, Senator Reid. I thank Senator Hollings for his \nsupport and Senator Warner and Senator Shelby, who participated in the \nhearings.\n  As I mentioned, this is just one approach to accomplishing this goal, \nbut we need to accomplish this goal, and we need to accomplish it \nquickly. The key to accomplishing it, as I mentioned, is whoever is \ngiven the responsibility for managing the terrorist portfolio, that \nindividual also has to have budgetary responsibility across \ndepartmental lines because the only way you control things in this \nGovernment is if you control the dollars. If you do not control the \ndollars, you are not going to be able to control the activity. With the \ndrug czar, we saw a complete failure of just naming someone to a \nposition and claiming he has responsibility when he never got the \nauthority to do the job. We cannot afford that on the issue of \nterrorism.\n  This cannot be a public relations event. This must be an individual \nwho has significant power and the responsibility and the capacity to \ncarry out that responsibility because he has the power to do it.\n  My time has run out. I know there are other people who want to speak \nso I will yield the floor, but I do intend to speak further on this \nissue of how we manage our house on the issue of terrorism. There is a \nlot we need to do and a great deal that needs to be thought about in \nthis area.\n  I especially thank the Senator from North Dakota for his courtesy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.

Madam President, I come to the floor today to speak about \nan issue of great importance to the State of Colorado. This is the \nnomination and confirmation of Federal judges.\n  I am pleased to announce that recently the President nominated two \noutstanding individuals to fill vacancies on the Colorado Federal \nDistrict Court.\n  The first is U.S. Chief Bankruptcy Judge Marcia Krieger of Denver, \nthe other is Colorado District Court Judge Robert Blackburn of Las \nAnimas. Both are extremely well qualified. Both are sitting judges with \nextensive experience managing a case load. Both have had distinguished \nlegal careers and are widely respected in our State. Both will make \nColorado and the Nation proud as Federal judges.\n  Judge Krieger has been a Federal bankruptcy judge for the District of \nColorado since 1994, and she was appointed Chief Judge for the \nBankruptcy Court for Colorado last year.\n\n[[Page S9470]]\n\n  Judge Krieger is a graduate of the University of Colorado School of \nLaw and she currently serves as an adjunct law professor at her alma \nmater.\n  Judge Krieger has extensive private practice and litigation \nexperience.\n  Judge Blackburn has been a Colorado State District Court Judge since \n1988. He is a judge in the 16th Judicial District, in the southeast \npart of Colorado, a largely rural and agricultural area of the State.\n  He is graduate of the University of Colorado School of Law, and he \nhas extensive experience in private practice and as a deputy district \nattorney. He has also been a cattle rancher in our State.\n  Earlier this year the President also nominated Mr. Tim Tymokovich of \nBroomfield to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. This appointment is \nimportant not only to Colorado, but also to the other five States in \nthe 10th Circuit--Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico.\n  Mr. Tymkovich is the former solicitor general for the State of \nColorado, he has extensive litigation experience in both Federal and \nState court, and he is currently a distinguished attorney in private \npractice in our State.\n  Mr. Tymkovich is a graduate of the University of Colorado School of \nlaw, he was a law clerk for the Chief Justice of the Colorado Supreme \nCourt, and he recently served as cochair of the Colorado Governor's \nTask Force on Civil Justice Reform.\n  Today I rise to speak not only of the tremendous qualifications of \nthese three individuals, but to also urge that the Senate move \nexpeditiously to confirm them as Federal judges.\n  The 10th circuit seat became vacant in October of 1999--nearly 2 \nyears ago. One of the district court seats became vacant in April of \n1998--over 3 years ago. The other seat became vacant in May of this \nyear.\n  Recently, I researched some of the history of appointments to the \n10th circuit and one of the things that really jumps out is how quickly \nFederal judicial vacancies were filled in the past in Colorado.\n  It was unusual for a seat to remain vacant for a long period of time. \nI hope we can get back to this tradition.\n  The Senate should carefully review all nominees, I have taken this \nresponsibility very seriously as a Senator. But when we get qualified \ncandidates that are not controversial, we should confirm them in a \ntimely manner.\n  That is why I am today asking that the Judiciary Committee begin the \nprocess of reviewing these three individuals. I look forward to \nhearings and confirmation this fall.\n  Colorado needs to have a full compliment of Federal judges. We are a \nfast growing State. We have a heavy case load in our Federal courts, \nand these vacancies need to be filled.\n  I have worked hard to support the selection of Federal judges of the \nhighest qualification.\n  That is why Senator Campbell and I have formed a Judicial Vacancy \nAdvisory Committee to screen candidates for district court vacancies in \nColorado. this is a non-partisan process.\n  This past spring, once we learned the process that would be followed \nby the President in selecting Federal judges, we appointed a six-member \nadvisory committee. This committee was made up of distinguished lawyers \nin our State. They reviewed dozens of candidates for the two district \ncourt vacancies in Colorado. They narrowed the list down to nine \nqualified individuals. I personally interviewed all nine, and I was \nvery confident that all nine would make fine Federal judges.\n  Senator Campbell and I then forwarded these nine names to the \nPresident and his legal counsel. The President announced his selection \nof Judges Krieger and Blackburn from this list. I am proud of these \nchoices, and I am proud of the prior choice of Mr. Tymkovich for the \n10th circuit.\n  I intend to work very hard to see that they are confirmed by the \nSenate in a timely manner.\n  In fact, I encourage the leadership in the Senate to move forward \nwith a number of other nominations that relate to law enforcement--for \nexample, U.S. marshals and the U.S. attorneys.\n  I hope that in a very expeditious and rapid manner we get these \npositions throughout the country filled and confirmed, particularly in \nlight of the events of the last week and a half.\n  Madam President, I conclude by saying I think it is important that we \nmove forward with all law enforcement nominations as quickly as \npossible and that we move forward with our judicial nominations as \nquickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/19/senate-section/article/S9470-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9470-S9477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nAppropriations Committee is discharged from further consideration of \nH.R. 2590, and the Senate will now proceed to its consideration.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2590) making appropriations for the Treasury \n     Department, the United States Postal Service, the Executive \n     Office of the President, and certain Independent Agencies, \n     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I will be joined in the Chamber in a few \nminutes by my colleague, Senator Campbell from Colorado, who is working \non other parts of this legislation.\n  This legislation is the product of the work of the subcommittee on \nappropriations dealing with Treasury, Postal and general government \naccounts.\n  In the last 2 days, President Bush has indicated it is time for \nAmerica to go back to work. And we must do that in the Senate.\n  This appropriations bill contains funding for counterterrorism, for \nactivities to allow us to track down terrorist activity. For example, \nin the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the Treasury Department we \nhave the financial crimes enforcement network. We have a \ncounterterrorism fund in the Treasury Department. We fund the Secret \nService. We fund the Customs Service. We have a substantial amount of \nresources in this piece of legislation to deal with the issue of \ncounterterrorism in tracking down those who committed the heinous acts \nof terror against our country last week.\n  Although we go back to work in the Senate now, the shadow of the acts \nof terrorists committed against our country last week remains. We go to \nwork now with a new purpose, a new resolve: to heal, to respond, and \nthen to prevent these kinds of acts of mass murder committed by madmen, \nto prevent them from ever happening again in our country or in the \nworld.\n  Madam President, before I talk about the specific bill, I wish to \nmake some comments generally about these days. I made some comments \nlast week, and I want to repeat some of them about where we are, what \nall of this means, and what we, as a country, must do.\n  There are unique moments in history, too often born of tragedy, when \nAmericans stand together with a relentless and fierce determination to \ntry to combat the forces of evil and to reaffirm that our freedom is \nsecure. This is one of those moments in the life of America.\n  A week ago yesterday cowards struck innocent men, women, and children \nin New York City, in Washington, DC, on airplanes, including on one \nairplane that went down in Pennsylvania. Their target was not just \nthose airplanes and those buildings. Their target was all of America. \nIt was an act of war committed by madmen directed against our country. \nIt deserves, and will get, a fierce, strong, and on-target response. We \nshould have no illusions about that.\n  The campaign to rid the world of terrorism will be long and \ndifficult; and our actions must be bold and strong, but not reckless. \nNow, even as we prepare to respond to terrorism, our country mourns the \ndeath of so many innocent Americans.\n  Shakespeare once wrote: ``Grief hath changed me since you saw me \nlast.'' The terrorist attacks last week in our country have changed all \nof us. We now carry a heavy burden of grief. We also carry the \nresponsibility to ensure that our response is swift, severe, and just.\n  But we also have an opportunity today to hold high the torch of \nfreedom, and to say to the world: We are heartbroken about our loss, \nbut America's spirit will not bend.\n  When I left the Capitol Building late in the evening of September 11, \nand drove past the Pentagon, there were\n\n[[Page S9471]]\n\nclouds of black and gray smoke billowing from the fire caused by the \nterrorists. And even today, over a week later, F-16 and F-15 Air Force \nfighter planes fly routine patrols over the skies of our country's \nCapital.\n\n  When I arrived home from the Capitol the night of the terrorist \nattacks, as I walked in the front door, my 14-year-old son, at about 11 \no'clock in the evening, heard the door close, got out of bed, and came \nto me, and said: Dad what happened? And who did this? I told my son: \nThis was an act of evil by deranged madmen. The President and Congress \nwill tell America that we will search for, find, and punish those \nresponsible for these acts of terrorism.\n  That is our pledge to us, to our children, and to the world: We will \nnot give in to terrorism. We are all Americans; and we will respond \nwith an iron resolve, anchored now by a new unity.\n  That unity, and the basic goodness of the American people, became \napparent to all of us in the hours immediately following the attacks, \nwhen people were reported to have waited in lines for 4 and 5 hours to \ngive blood.\n  So many heroes stepped forward and risked their lives to help others \nwho were the victims of these terrorist attacks. And amidst the carnage \nand the destruction grew a stronger bond among the American people. It \nis an understanding that we live in America but, more importantly, \nAmerica lives in us.\n  So now we begin to wage war on terrorism. And we ask all other \ncountries in the world to join us. Those countries that believe in \nfreedom must join us in our campaign to make the world safe from these \nacts of mass murder.\n  Terrorist training camps in foreign lands cannot be allowed to exist. \nCountries that harbor terrorists must, as the President said, pay a \nprice for harboring those terrorists. We must dedicate ourselves, as a \nnation, to those tasks.\n  Last week it was commercial airliners, full of passengers and jet \nfuel, used as a bomb. In the future it could be a small vial of deadly \nbiological agents or chemical agents that could kill a million people, \nor it could be a suitcase-sized nuclear bomb placed in the trunk of a \nrusty car parked at a dock in a major city. If ever we must understand \nour responsibility for world leadership to try to stop the spread of \nnuclear weapons, to reduce the threat of the spread of weapons of mass \ndestruction, and to combat terrorism, it must be now. That leadership \nis our responsibility. That mantle is on our shoulders.\n  Over a century ago, on the bloodstained ground of Gettysburg, Abraham \nLincoln said: ``* * * we here highly resolve that these dead shall not \nhave died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth \nof freedom. * * *''\n  Today, in this time, and in this place, we should consecrate those \nwords from nearly 140 years ago and let them again inspire our Nation's \nresolve that those who died did not die in vain.\n  Our response to the deadly crimes that took them from us will be \ndedicated to destroying the ability of terrorists to wage this kind of \nwar, and giving those who live a new birth of freedom from the fear and \nthe impact of terrorist acts.\n  To those who lost their lives, those who loved them--their relatives \nand friends--we say: Our country grieves with you. Our country reaches \nout to you. And you are not alone.\n  Last week, a couple days following the attack on the Pentagon, I \njoined some colleagues to go to the Pentagon. When I came back from the \nPentagon, I mentioned in this Senate Chamber an act by a young Marine \nthat was so inspiring.\n  A young Marine, as we were looking at the damage to the Pentagon, was \nhanging by a crane, in a bucket with a steel cable; and I was wondering \nwhat he was doing because they had hoisted this young Marine up to this \nopen gash in the Pentagon where the airplane had exploded. The fire had \nconsumed the building; and the building had collapsed.\n\n  The cable and the metal basket, and a young man standing in the \nbasket, was dangling from the crane up by the 4th floor. He was trying \nto get in a position to reach in. He reached in this cavernous hole \nthat had been caused in the Pentagon, and he pulled out a flag--a \nbrilliant red and gold U.S. Marine flag.\n  The crane then lowered the basket to the ground, and this young \nMarine got out and proudly carried that flag and walked to where we \nwere standing. As he walked past us, he stopped and said: I am going to \ngive this flag to the Marine Corps Commandant. I saw it in an office.\n  It was untouched, unburned. It was not something I could understand, \nthat a flag such as this could have survived that fire. But he said to \nus, as he held this flag: I am going to give this to the Marine Corps \nCommandant. He said: They couldn't destroy this flag; and they can't \ndestroy our country.\n  And I thought, in many ways he says it for all of us. I have no idea \nhow that flag survived. But that flag, and that young Marine, I think, \nsaid it for all of us: our determination, our resolve, and our \nendurance.\n  The road ahead is going to be difficult. The road ahead requires us \nto do a couple of things. And those items are going to be contained, in \nsome measure, in this legislation. The road ahead requires us to deal \nwith this issue of terrorism in a new way, a new aggressive way. It \nrequires us also now to turn to deal with the economy because the \neconomy was weak going into these terrorist attacks; and there is great \nfear in this country that the economy could grow much, much weaker. We \nneed to take effective action to give this country a chance to restore \nits economy and economic opportunity. Those are the two challenges we \nhave, and both are significant challenges.\n\n  This morning I met with the President of one of the major airlines. \nHe told me something most Americans and I have known from reading the \nnewspapers in the last day or so. The airlines are flying a schedule \nthat is much less than the one they had been flying before the acts of \nterrorism. It is also the case that many passengers are canceling \nreservations and deciding not to take trips they were previously going \nto take. The result is a dramatic drop off in the number of people who \nare flying on commercial airplanes.\n  This country and its economy cannot survive and grow without a \ncommercial air service network. We must take steps to make certain that \nwe rehabilitate the commercial air service network, the major airlines, \nand all airlines, the smaller regional carriers and the independent \nairlines as well, that serve our country. You cannot have a great \neconomy and an economy that grows unless you have commercial aviation, \ncommercial aviation that works and that connects all parts of this \ncountry.\n  It connects to everything. Last week, we saw the airplanes grounded. \nWe saw auto workers laid off in Michigan. Why? Because the new way to \nmanufacture is just-in-time inventory. If you are doing just-in-time \ninventory, you rely on the parts arriving just in time. If you shut \ndown transportation systems, and the parts don't come, those who were \nrelying on those parts for their jobs are laid off. It is all \ninterconnected. The system we have in this country to transport people \nand freight by air is a critically important element of our economy. We \nmust deal with that.\n  How does that connect to terrorism? The American people in many \ncircumstances are very leery about getting back into an airplane unless \nthey feel they are safe. We must move quickly to assure the safety of \nthe American people while they are flying. How do we do that?\n  No. 1, we will move very quickly to include the use of sky marshals \nin commercial airplanes. Those sky marshals are already being employed. \nI expect that will dramatically increase.\n  No. 2, security at American airports must increase in a very \nsubstantial way. We will have a discussion about having the Federal \nGovernment take responsibility for the airport security apparatus. We \nmust close those gaps that have existed, that we have known for a long \nwhile have existed in airport security.\n  There are a series of other recommendations as well. The Senate \nCommerce Committee will be holding hearings tomorrow on a range of \nthese issues. Dealing with the security of American airports and the \nsecurity of commercial aviation is critically important, as well as \ndealing with the economy generally. They are very much related.\n\n[[Page S9472]]\n\n  The economy was soft prior to the acts of terrorism last week, and \nall indications, from the newspapers this morning and all of this week, \nare there will be more and more layoffs. We must act decisively and we \nmust act quickly to forestall the further softening of the economy and \ngive people confidence that the economy can be restored and can be \nvibrant and can grow once again. There isn't anything much more \nimportant than the Congress and the President joining together to do \nthat, to give the American people the confidence this economy can have \na strong and vibrant future.\n  I studied and taught economics in college. One of the things most \npeople forget about economics is, No. 1, there is naturally a business \ncycle. It has a contraction and expansion side. No one has been able to \nrepeal the business cycle, nor will they. No. 2, even though we were \ngoing through a contraction side of the business cycle, there is some \nbelief among people in Washington and elsewhere--in some cases a belief \namong economists--that the economy is made up of an engine room of the \nship of state in which there are massive amounts of dials and gauges \nand levers. If you can just turn them all right and adjust them all \nright--the quantity of money, tax cuts, spending, all of these things, \ninterest rates, adjust them just right--the ship of state will move \nforward.\n  It is not that at all. It just is not that at all. This economy moves \nforward when people are confident about the future. When people are \nconfident about the future, they make decisions that express that \nconfidence. They will buy a home. They will buy a car. They will take a \ntrip. They will do a whole series of things that express confidence \nthat have in their impact the opportunity to create an expanded \neconomy.\n  Exactly the opposite happens when people are not confident. If people \nare not confident about the future, the economy tends to contract \nbecause they defer decisions. They don't take the trip. They decide not \nto buy the home. They don't buy the car. They don't make the decisions \nas consumers that they might otherwise make because they are not \nconfident about the future.\n  This economy has always and will always rest on a mattress of \nconfidence. Do the American people have confidence about the future or \ndon't they? If they do, this economy will grow and expand. If they \ndon't, it will contract. It is that simple.\n  This is not like making some sort of economic stew where we have a \nrecipe and we put in certain doses of this, that, or the other thing. \nIt is about instilling confidence in the American people that this \neconomy can and will grow and expand.\n  There are a series of things we can do to offer that confidence. The \nPresident and the Congress can work together on a series of public \npolicies that can employ that confidence building in a way that is very \nconstructive. It is critical that we begin that immediately.\n  Let me turn briefly to this appropriations bill which has elements \nthat deal with both the counter terrorism issue and also the issue of \nhow to instill confidence with respect to the economy. This is an \nappropriations bill dealing with the Treasury Department. But it is \nmuch more than that. About one-half of all Federal law enforcement is \nin this bill. It deals with the Office of Management and Budget, the \nWhite House, the Secret Service, U.S. Customs, GSA, and a whole range \nof Federal agencies.\n  I will talk a bit about what this bill does and why it is brought to \nthe floor in the manner we have brought it to the floor.\n  First, let me again say that central to this bill is the funding of a \nrange of issues that are important to the current discussion we are \nhaving about counter terrorism. The counter terrorism fund within the \nTreasury Department is critical. We have increased that fund in this \nappropriations bill, as well as the funding for the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, which has the capability and the expertise to track \nterrorists. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Center is the same. It has \nthe important capability of tracking the finances and the banking \ntransactions these terrorists use.\n  The U.S. Customs Service is a very large agency that has the \nresponsibility of protecting our borders. That is obviously critical to \nthe counter terrorism efforts. If we are not able to have some basic \ncontrol over our borders, we don't have the capability of keeping \nterrorists out.\n\n  We all understand the role of the Secret Service in protecting the \nPresident and vital public officials in our country, the many other \nduties they perform. So this legislation is important legislation. It \nis timely. We have brought it to the Senate today hoping we could, in \nthis new spirit of unity, move this legislation as quickly as possible.\n  The subcommittee has worked on this bill. We brought it to the full \nAppropriations Committee. That committee has marked this bill up, and \nthis bill now is a recommendation of the full Appropriations Committee \nof the Senate. I am pleased to offer it today.\n  This bill contains a total of $32.3 billion in new budget authority. \nOf that amount, $15.6 billion is for mandatory accounts. The committee \nrecommendation is within the 302(b) allocations which come from the \nbudget we passed. It strikes a balance between our priorities, the \nadministration's initiatives, and the agencies requirements.\n  My colleague, Senator Campbell, who will be in the Chamber in a bit, \nis now working on a range of these things to try to get them cleared; \nassisted by his staff, Pat Raymond and Lula Edwards, in putting this \nbill in the condition we now have it, as well as my staff, Chip \nWalgren, Nicole Rutberg, and Matthew King, who is detailed to us from \nU.S. Customs. It is a collaborative bipartisan piece of legislation \nwhich reflects both congressional and administration priorities.\n  The bill consists primarily of salaries and expense accounts for a \ngood many agencies. The majority of the increases in this legislation \nare for agencies to allow them to maintain current levels. The \ninitiatives I will highlight are just a few initiatives that are very \nimportant.\n  (Mr. BAYH assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in this legislation we have doubled the \namount of funding to $10 million that the Customs Service would have to \ncombat the issue of forced child labor practices.\n  All of us understand what is happening with respect to child labor \naround the world. It is not fair competition. It is not fair for people \nto use child labor and ship their products to our marketplace in the \nUnited States and call it fair trade. We have had testimony at hearings \nin the Senate in years past of young children, 8, 10, 12 years old, \nworking in carpet factories in some parts of the world, in which those \nwho run the carpet factories have actually taken gunpowder and burned \nthe fingers of these young children. They burn the fingertips of the \nchildren in order to create burn scars so that the children who use \nneedles to work on these carpets and rugs will not injure themselves. \nIt won't hurt because now they are scarred and burned from these \ndeliberate burns caused by their employers.\n  Is that something we want to allow to happen in this world? I don't \nthink so. Do we want to buy from people making products by employing \n10- and 12-year-old kids whose fingers they have burned so they can sew \nrugs and ship them to America to be bought in Pittsburgh, Fargo, \nMinneapolis, and other cities? No. It is not the right thing.\n  So we double the amount of money to deal with child labor. We need to \ninvestigate child labor and prohibit the import of goods from other \ncountries into this country when those goods are made by forced child \nlabor.\n  We add $25 million in this piece of legislation for a new northern \nborder initiative to hire additional Customs Special Agents, \ninspectors, and canine enforcement teams to enforce our trade laws and \nto protect our borders. In light of the tragic events a week ago \nyesterday, this is merely a down payment, I am sure, on a much larger \nrequirement for the Customs Service with respect to security on all of \nour borders. But I fully expect many of these needs will be addressed \nby the emergency appropriation we enacted last week.\n  We are very concerned about the security of America's borders. We \nknow there are known terrorists around the world who try to move \nthrough our\n\n[[Page S9473]]\n\nborders and become part of terrorist cells in our country. We also know \nthat, for example, on New Year's Eve in the year 1999, as we entered \nthe new millennium, at one of our border points on the northern border \nin the State of Washington a terrorist was apprehended who apparently \nwas intending to hijack planes in Los Angeles. Part of the plot was, as \nI understand it, to take down significant structures on the west coast. \nThat was foiled by Customs who apprehended this terrorist. That \nterrorist picked the wrong border to come across, or at least the wrong \nborder point.\n  All terrorists and others who want to bring contraband across our \nborder know that in many locations in this country across the northern \nborder, the only thing that precludes them from moving across the \nborder after 10 o'clock at night, when the border station closes, is an \norange rubber cone sitting in the middle of the road. At 10 o'clock \nthey put out the cone, and the next morning they take it in, and they \nare open for business. The way you get in when there is an orange cone \nis to simply move the cone. That is the problem at many northern border \nports. The ports of entry don't have adequate security, and we must \nhave a northern border initiative to make sure we do something about \nthat.\n  This bill also funds the Internal Revenue Service. We had a rather \ndisturbing report a while ago by the Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration at the Internal Revenue Service. What it said was this: \nThe Inspector General put together four tax questions and sent people \nout across the country to ask those questions in taxpayer assistance \nareas of the IRS. Here is what they found. These are not massively \ndifficult tax questions. The Inspector General sent Federal employees \nout posing as regular folks to ask questions of the IRS. They found \nthat 73 percent of the time they either got the wrong answer, an \nincomplete answer, or no answer. In a number of cases, they were \ntreated very rudely. In other cases, they were left to wait and were \nnot waited on.\n  I read that Inspector General report. It was done last spring. I was \nso furious. I read it at night at home. I was furious when I finished. \nIf you can't have an agency that gives taxpayer assistance to taxpayers \nasking for help and get the right answer from the agency that is \nadministering the program, how can you expect American taxpayers to \ncomply? It is wrong. So I put a million dollars in this appropriations \nbill and I called the IRS Commissioner, someone for whom I have great \nrespect. I think he has the capability to turn this agency around. He \nhas been there now for a bit. He has plans that I think can make a big \ndifference in this agency.\n  I said I am going to have the Inspector General do this 12 times \nbeginning in January next year and issue 12 reports. If they are \nembarrassing--and they are to me, and I hope to you--I want to see an \nimprovement. If we have 12 reports of people going to the IRS offices \nasking for help and we don't see improvement over the year, then there \nis something fundamentally wrong with the folks who are running this \nagency and trying to make this happen.\n  Again, I have great respect for Commissioner Rossotti. He comes from \na business background, and I know he will do a good job. He made the \npoint to me of why this happened and he has taken action to change \nthis. He asked that I defer this monthly investigation to January \nrather than start it in October. I said that is fine. But we are going \nto have 12 reports to the Congress, and I am going to read every one of \nthem. If I see reports that say 73 percent of the time people ask for \nhelp from the Internal Revenue Service they get wrong answers, there is \ngoing to be hell to pay because we are spending a lot of money to make \nsure the American people get the service they deserve.\n  The name of this agency has three words: Internal Revenue Service. If \nwe don't put ``service'' back in the Internal Revenue Service, how long \nwill we expect the American people to voluntarily comply with this tax \nsystem? It is a tiny issue, but it is one about which I feel very \nstrongly. We need to make this work for people. When each of these \nreports is issued, I will come to the floor and share them with my \ncolleagues. I hope they share--as I am sure they do--my concern about \nan agency that gets it wrong 73 percent of the time when they are being \nasked for taxpayer assistance.\n  We add $5 million for a new program for grants for drug testing and \ntreatment and intervention to State and local authorities and Indian \ntribes for criminal justice populations. One of the things we know \nabout these issues of incarceration and recidivism, and so on, is that \npeople who go into our prisons and jails with a drug problem and who \ndon't get treatment are going to come out with a drug problem, and they \nare likely to commit crimes to buy the drugs to continue taking these \ndrugs. The fact is, we have to be smart about this and start making \nsure that people who are drug addicted as they go into jails and \nprisons are required to get drug treatment. It doesn't make any sense \nto throw them in jail and put them back on the street with a drug \naddiction. You are just begging for more crime. And they will comply. \nThat hurts this country, and we can do much better.\n  We add $100 million above the President's request of $130 million for \nthe continued modernization of the Customs Service's new processing \nsystem called the Automated Commercial Environment. That is an \nimportant system. The current system is melting down on us. We have so \nmuch trade back and forth across our borders, the system simply can't \nhandle it. We are trying to fund this system called ACE. We are doing \nit in a way that I believe will be very helpful to facilitating trade \nacross our borders.\n  While I am talking about Customs, let me make another point about \nwhich I feel strongly. The Customs Service doesn't have a Customs \nCommissioner. Think of that. We have this heinous terrorist act \ncommitted against our country, mass murders, unspeakable horrors in our \ncountry. When we deal with these counter terrorism acts and put \ntogether a program of counter terrorism, one critical element is our \nU.S. Customs Service. They are on the border, and we have to secure our \nborders to try to prevent terrorists from coming into the country. We \nhave to have a Customs Service working with all the law enforcement \nagencies to do this.\n  The Customs Service previously ran, and is now contributing to the \nSky Marshal Program. That is up and operating in a skeleton way. The \nCustoms Service is an integral part of counter terrorism. We do not \nhave a Commissioner at the Customs Service. We have a nominee, but \nthere are two holds on the nominee. One has been dropped. In the \nSenate, there is still, as I understand it, a hold on the nominee. We \nhave a person whom I think is perfectly qualified to run the Customs \nService. This is an agency without a head, and we have someone in the \nSenate who is holding the nomination and will not allow us to confirm \nhim. The result is an agency without an agency head at a time when we \nclearly need the direction and leadership that agency head can give at \nthis point.\n  As I understand it, the hold that exists--I will not use the name of \nmy colleague, but it has been in the papers. One of our colleagues has \nput a hold on the President's nominee to head Customs because our \ncolleague objects to his reluctance to commit to the use of a new \nsecurity detection technology. There is a debate about technology. \nThere was another hold that was released, I believe, last week over a \ntextile issue.\n  Look, this is not the time to be holding up the President's nominees. \nIt is not the time to hold up a nominee who is so critical as the head \nof the U.S. Customs Service. Let's get this nomination before the \nSenate and confirm this nominee so this person can be down at the White \nHouse and with the administration bringing the Customs Service fully \ninto this circle of agencies that are going to be critical in combating \nterrorism. We ought to do that today.\n  In fact, I say to my colleagues, if those who have been involved--at \nleast the one that has been concerned about this and has a hold--I wish \nthat hold can be eliminated so that we can bring this nomination before \nthe Senate. I want to confirm this person. I would like to do it today. \nIt is not my decision to bring it before the Senate, but I hope the \ncommittee chair and ranking member will talk to the Senator\n\n[[Page S9474]]\n\nwho is holding up the Customs Service nominee and let's get that done. \nThe President has selected a good person. If we have some disagreements \nwith him, go ahead and disagree with him down the road on some specific \ntechnology issues, but this agency needs a head right now. I hope we \ncan do that, if not today perhaps tomorrow.\n  Let me mention a couple of other items we have included in this \nappropriations bill. We direct the General Services Administration to \ninitiate a pilot project to place automated external defibrillators, \ndevices called AEDs, in Federal buildings and provide training for \ntheir use to more effectively save lives.\n  Most of us know what the automated external defibrillators are now. \nThey are now no bigger than the size of a laptop computer. They save \nmany lives and can be operated by someone with almost no training. If \nwe have these in public buildings, and if someone has a heart attack \nand their heart stops, we can save a large number of lives having these \ndevices available. That has clearly been demonstrated. We are going to \nhave a pilot project with the General Services Administration to do \nthat.\n  We fully fund the request for the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy Youth Antidrug Media Campaign. We add $20 million to the High \nIntensity Drug Trafficking Area Program. That has a total of $226 \nmillion.\n  We add $10 million to the Drug-Free Communities Act, which is a total \nof $50.6 million.\n  We fund the courthouse projects that were requested by the President, \nand we provide funds for an additional six courthouses to continue \naddressing the significant backlog in courthouse funding in this \ncountry.\n  The projects we have funded fully adhere to the priority list that \nwas developed by OMB, GSA, and the Administrative Offices of the Court. \nIn other words, we have not pulled projects out because someone wanted \nthem. We actually followed the priority list, which we should do.\n  We maintain current law requiring the provision of contraceptive \ncoverage in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. We make \npermanent the ongoing project allowing Federal agencies to provide \nchild care services for its lower paid employees, and we provide a 4.6-\npercent pay raise for Federal civilian employees to maintain pay parity \nbetween Federal, civilian, and military employees.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned that in the Treasury Department bill we \nplaced a priority on the Treasury Department's law enforcement needs, \nas well as support for State and local law enforcement needs. We \nprovide $33 million for the third and final year of a Secret Service \nstaff hiring plan to address the overtime and personnel retention \nproblems. They were spending a massive amount of time in overtime \ncompensation because they simply did not have the personnel they \nneeded. We are in the third and final year of the money to restore \nthat.\n  We increase the administration's request for the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco and Firearms to enforce existing gun laws. There are no cuts or \ndeviations in this area from the President's budget request. We simply \nhave complied with the President's budget request.\n  We emphasize in the bill the need for the ATF's Gang Resistance \nEducation and Training Program, called GREAT, by including $3 million \nin addition. The GREAT Program, is a wonderful program. I went to a \nschool in Anacostia one day with some ATF folks. They showed me, at the \nend of the program, what the kids had been through. They had a \ngraduation ceremony for these kids. It is a great program. We have to \nget to these kids with information, and we can make a big difference.\n  We increase by $5 million the integrated violence reduction strategy \nto allow ATF to investigate more comprehensively the National Instant \nCheck System so we make sure felons do not purchase guns. There are a \nlot of gun debates in this country, but no one in this country wants a \ngun dealer to sell a gun to a convicted felon. So our effort is to keep \nguns out of the hands of people who should not have them.\n  Title II of this legislation is the Postal Service title. We provide \n$143.7 million for the U.S. Postal Service, as requested by the \nadministration. We, once again, include language saying to them: Don't \nyou dare talk about going to 5-day mail delivery service. Through rain, \nsnow, sleet, and so on, we deliver the mail 6 days, including Saturday. \nSpeaking as someone who comes from a rural State, I want that to \ncontinue, and we insist it continue. We told the Postal Service in this \nlegislation that they must continue 6-day mail delivery.\n  The Executive Office of the President is in this legislation in an \naccount called Funds Appropriated to the President. It funds, \nobviously, the operation of the White House, salaries, and so on. But \nit also funds the Office of the National Security Council, Office of \nManagement and Budget, Office of National Drug Control Policy, as I \nmentioned earlier, and certain other programs. We have simply met the \nrequest of the President for funding these areas.\n  We have independent agencies, such as the Federal Election \nCommission, the General Services Administration, the National Archives, \nFederal Labor Relations Authority, the Merit Systems Protection Board, \nOffice of Government Ethics, the Office of Special Counsel, Office of \nPersonnel Management--all of these are in this legislation. This \ndescribes in broad terms what we are trying to do.\n  As I close--and my colleague from Colorado, Senator Campbell, is \nhere--let me say how much I have enjoyed working with him. I know \npeople view Congress sometimes as an area where there is a great deal \nof debate, and that is certainly true. I do not think debate is bad for \nthe country. I think it is good. When you get the best of what everyone \nhas to offer, the American people are best served. There are more \ninstances than not where we come together and work with somebody for \nwhom we have great respect, and that is certainly the case with Senator \nCampbell and myself.\n  He chaired this subcommittee, and I was happy to work with him and \nfelt the experience was a great experience. I am now chairing the \nsubcommittee and feel exactly the same way. It is a great experience to \nbe working with my colleague from Colorado, Senator Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell.\n  I will make two final points. One, to go back to this issue of \nterrorism, this country predictably is very concerned at this moment \nabout terrorism. We have been through a frightening ordeal, and we are \nnot yet through it. We must, as the President has indicated, work \ntogether; we must achieve national unity. Part of that national unity \nis to resolve that we will track down and punish those who committed \nthese acts of mass murder against so many American citizens.\n  We must do that thoughtfully, not recklessly. It is very important \nthe way we go about this. Part of it is also to try to make certain we \nprevent future terrorist acts.\n  Yesterday, the Attorney General indicated there might be some \nevidence there were other airplanes that were targeted. He indicated \nthere might be some terrorists who are still not apprehended, and they \nare searching for them. Even as we, in the middle of this nightmare we \nhave gone through, try to make certain the American people understand \neverything humanly possible is being done to prevent another terrorist \nattack, even as we do that, as the President said, we must go back to \nwork. So part of that work is to pass an appropriations bill today.\n  This bill is also central to the question of counter terrorism and \ncombating terrorism because it includes the counter terrorism account \nin Treasury, U.S. Customs, the Secret Service, and the Financial Crimes \nEnforcement Network which is involved with the FBI in tracking all of \nthe money back and forth. So we have so many things in this legislation \nthat directly relate to this need we have as a nation to move \naggressively.\n  For that reason, my fervent hope is we will not spend a great deal of \ntime with a lot of amendments on this bill, and I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in trying to reach an agreement to pass this legislation today.\n  Let me describe what I was hoping to do. I have great heartburn about \nwhat has been happening with respect to Cuba. The Treasury Department \nand the Office of Foreign Assets Control--OFAC--have been levying fines \nagainst people who travel to Cuba because it was against the law. I \nwill give an example: A retired lady to whom I talked\n\n[[Page S9475]]\n\nby phone is a bicyclist, and she answered an ad in a cycling magazine \nwith a Canadian company, a travel company, doing a cycling tour. So she \njoined something like 10 or 12 cyclists through this Canadian travel \ncompany, and they went to Cuba, and they bicycled. This is a retired \nAmerican woman. They bicycled in Cuba. Then 18 months later she got a \nletter from OFAC and the Treasury Department levying a $7,650 fine \nagainst her for riding a bike with a Canadian travel group in Cuba.\n  Another fellow I talked to received a $19,020 fine for a weekend \nvisit to Cuba. When he was in the Cayman Islands with some friends, the \nfriends invited him to go to Cuba for the weekend, and he did.\n  OFAC has begun a new enforcement action against Americans who travel \nin Cuba. I fully intended to offer an amendment to this bill to stop \nthat. OFAC ought to be about tracking terrorists, not tracking down \nretired ladies who ride bicycles in Cuba.\n  However, I am not going to offer that amendment because I do not want \nslow passage of this bill. And the fact is the House has already \nincluded an amendment on this issue in its version of the bill that we \nwill consider in conference. I am going to try my darndest to make \nsure--and I hope my colleague from Colorado will join me--that we \naccept the House provision which would suspend the enforcement of the \nban on travel to Cuba so that we do not have $7,000 to $19,000 fines \nbeing levied against American citizens who have traveled there, some of \nwhom have told me personally that they had no idea this was against the \nlaw.\n  My point is this: I was fully intending to come to the floor to offer \nthat amendment. I know it would be controversial. I know four or five \nof my colleagues who would want to stand up and oppose that amendment. \nI think it is not wise to hold this bill up and offer that amendment in \nthe Senate. Therefore, I will not offer the amendment.\n\n  I have two other amendments that have similar circumstances that are \ncontroversial. I fully intended to offer them, and I have that right, \nobviously, as do all Senators. I have the right of recognition because \nI am managing this bill, but I am not going to offer those amendments \nbecause at this moment it is not productive for us to divert our \nattention and to wander off into other extraneous debates.\n  This bill contains much needed funds for our agencies to prosecute \nthe aggressive search for terrorists, to protect the American people. \nIt is very important we pass this legislation as quickly as we can do \nso.\n  I ask my colleagues if they would do as I have done. If they have an \namendment to this bill, if they can, if they will, work with us and let \nus see if we can find a way to accept it if it is not too \ncontroversial. If it is a very controversial amendment, please hold it \nand let us pass this legislation and come back to their issue on \nanother bill at some point. There will be other opportunities, but I \nthink now is the wrong time for us to spend 3 or 4 or 5 days on \nlegislation such as this where we have such critical resources in this \nbill that need to be devoted to the search for terrorists and to the \naggressive campaign we must wage to combat terrorism.\n  I am going to visit with my colleague from Colorado following our \nstatements and visit with the leaders and see if we can send a message \nto the country that the President says we should go back to work, all \nAmerica should go back to work. The Senate is going back to work, and \nthe best message we can send to the President and the country is to say \nwe went back to work today on an appropriations bill and there was a \nnew sense of unity, a new purpose, and a new understanding that the \ncenter of what this appropriations bill is about is investing in the \nability to provide security for the American people.\n  If we can do that, what a wonderful message it will send to the \nAmerican people and give them some confidence about what we are doing \nand what we can do, not just in this bill, but it will also portend \ngood news for what we can do on the economy and a whole range of other \nissues.\n  The American people need some confidence. What better way to give \nthem some confidence than to bring this bill to the floor and say it is \na new time and we have a new attitude in the Senate? And I take the \nfirst step by saying the amendments I was going to offer, that are very \nimportant to me, I will not offer because I do not think we ought to do \nthat at this point.\n  Let us pass this legislation, if we can, and work together to get \nthis completed today.\n  As I indicated, my colleague from Colorado has been working on this \nlegislation this morning and previously, and let me again say how much \nI appreciate working with him. Following his statement, I ask--\nactually, while he is speaking--that those who wish to offer amendments \nor work with us on amendments to which we could perhaps agree, if they \nwould understand the urgency.\n  We have the Defense authorization bill that will probably come to the \nfloor following this. It may even come late this afternoon. That is a \npretty important bill. The Defense authorization bill is also critical \nto this Nation's security in this difficult time. If our colleagues \nwill cooperate with us and allow us to get this bill through the Senate \ntoday, it will be a terrific signal to the American people that times \nhave changed and things have changed in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Chairman Dorgan, in \nplacing before the Senate our committee's recommendations for the \nfiscal year 2002 funding for the Treasury Department, the Postal \nService, the Executive Office of the President, and various independent \nagencies.\n  I want to associate my comments with the chairman's comments as they \ndeal with terrorism. Certainly we have had huge changes worldwide in \nthe last week. We are going to be in for the long haul, a very \ndifficult, expensive, and deadly kind of a war that we have never faced \nbefore. I know we all want to do our very best in Congress, but I \nremind my colleagues, as the chairman already has, of the focus of \nthese appropriations bills. As the other Senators are in their offices \ncontemplating amendments they might offer to this bill, I remind them \nthere is an emergency supplemental moving through now and probably that \nis the better vehicle if they want to do some changes or some \namendments.\n  There are probably better vehicles dealing specifically with the \nterrorist activities than the TPO bill. In our bill, these \nrecommendations include funding for Federal agencies that are now \nworking on the tactical and security needs of our Nation, and have been \nfor years and years. It is clear those needs and others addressed by \nthe funding legislation merit swift consideration.\n  This bill was crafted by the Subcommittee on Treasury and General \nGovernment. It contains a total of $32.4 billion of new budget \nauthority. Of that, $15.7 billion is for mandatory accounts. The \ncommittee recommendation is within the 302(b) allocations and strikes a \ndelicate balance between congressional priorities, administration \ninitiatives, and agency requirements. I congratulate Chairman Dorgan \nand his staff for the professional manner in which they prepared this \nbill in such a short period of time.\n  This bill allows these Federal agencies to simply maintain current \nlevels. There are very few new initiatives in this bill. Title I \nprovides a total of $14.9 billion for the Department of the Treasury. \nOf this, $277 million is more than the administration requested. The \ncommittee has again placed a priority on Treasury's law enforcement \nneeds as well as support for efforts by State and local law enforcement \nagencies.\n  Let me repeat a couple of highlights the chairman mentioned. We have \n$230 million to the Customs Service for continued development of the \nbadly needed Automated Commercial Environment computer system called \nACE.\n  It has money to continue emphasis on the need for the Gang Resistance \nEducation and Training program, called the GREAT Program, which has \nbeen very successful, by including $3 million more than the \nadministration requested for grants to State and local law enforcement.\n  It has additional funding for the integrated violence reduction \nstrategy to allow ATF to comprehensively investigate denials in order \nto make sure the felons do not possess guns.\n\n[[Page S9476]]\n\n  It has $348 million to the IRS for continuing efforts to modernize \ntheir computer system.\n  Title II provides $76.6 million to the U.S. Postal Service and \ncontinues to require free mailing for oversees voters and the blind, as \nwell as 6-day delivery, to which Chairman Dorgan has spoken, and \nprohibits the closing or consolidation of small and rural post offices.\n  Title III recommends a total of $755.5 million for the Executive \nOffice of the President, which is $23.7 million more than the \nadministration requested. This part of the bill includes the Office of \nManagement and Budget, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the \nFederal drug control programs, and funding for the national antidrug \nmedia campaign.\n  A special note: The committee also provided $42 million to the \nCounterdrug Technology Assessment Center, a program that transfers \ntechnology to State and local law enforcement. I believe since we \nstarted the program--it is going into its fourth year--it has been \nhugely successful. Over 2,500 local police jurisdictions have received \ngrants of equipment they could not afford and for which they do not \nhave the money to do the research and development.\n  It increases funding to the High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas \nprogram, the HIDTA program, by $20 million, which supports programs at \ntheir current level. It coordinates Federal, State, and local efforts \nto combat drug use.\n  It recommends a total of $185 million to the national antidrug media \ncampaign and requires $5 million be spent on the new drug of choice of \ntoo many young teenagers called Ecstasy.\n  Title IV provides funding for the independent agencies, such as the \nFederal Election Commission, the General Services Administration, and \nthe National Archives, as well as agencies involved in the Federal \nemployment arena, such as the Federal Labor Relations Authority, the \nMerit Systems Protection Board, the Office of Government Ethics, the \nOffice of Special Counsel, and the Office of Personnel Management. Also \nincluded in the title are the mandatory accounts to provide for Federal \nannuities, retiree health benefits, and life insurance. The committee \nrecommends a total of $16.6 billion for this title.\n  The administration requested funding for 12 courthouse construction \nprojects. As Senator Dorgan mentioned, we have been able to increase \nthat number of projects to 20. We have provided funding for 12 \nadditional projects such as border stations.\n  In addition, we have continued an aggressive effort to make sure the \nFederal Government real estate is maintained properly, by providing \n$844.8 million for the GSA repairs and alterations account for Federal \nbuildings that are in deterioration.\n  The funding contained in the bill allows agencies to continue their \nwork. It will not be able to accommodate all Members' requests, and I \nremind my colleagues that any funding amendments must be offset. If we \nhave those being contemplated that deal with terrorism, there might be \na better vehicle through the supplemental.\n\n  I thank Chairman Dorgan and his staff, Chip Walgren, Nicole Rutberg, \nMatt King, and Nancy Olkewicz, for their courtesies during the \npreparation of this bill. They have been terrific to work with.\n  We are focused on these recent attacks, but clearly we have to move \nforward, as the chairman mentioned, with our work and our various \nbudget proposals as we have prepared them. My support for this \ncommittee's recommendations comes with my understanding that funding \nneeds for some agencies may demand an increase. I feel certain most of \nthose can be handled through the supplemental appropriation and hope \nthey will.\n  Additionally, I am particularly pleased that Chairman Dorgan agreed \nto my request to provide additional funding to the U.S. anti-doping \ninitiative, called the USADA. This funding will be necessary to ensure \nthat our Olympic athletes, our Pan American, and Paraolympic athletes \nare free from drugs and are taught about the ethics of fair \ncompetition. I thank the chairman for including additional help in the \nEcstasy program, as I mentioned.\n  Speaking of the antidrug media campaign, we have provided over $748 \nmillion for that campaign since 1998. This year, we have $185 million \nfor the fiscal year 2002. But preliminary findings released by the \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy last year showed that the \ncampaign is having a positive effect.\n  Unfortunately, more recent information seems to indicate that while \nthis report card may be good, it may have been somewhat premature. \nWhile I agree we must take steps to protect youth from the lure of \nillegal drugs, we have to make sure that money is wisely spent in the \nmedia campaign and that it is reducing the use of drugs because our \nresources clearly will be strapped in this new war on terrorism.\n  I take this opportunity to highlight a new international crime \ninitiative in southern Europe and how it relates to law enforcement \nagencies and funding by the pending Treasury appropriations bill. It \ncomes as no surprise that international terrorism often relies on \ninternational crime, particularly through drugs, to finance its \ncampaigns of terrorism. The Southern European Cooperative Initiative, \ncalled SECI, is based in Bucharest, Romania, and represents a \nconsortium of 11 countries with a combined population of 135 million \npeople. The members of SECI have pooled their expertise and limited \nresources in a collaborative effort to combat transnational crime in \nsoutheastern Europe. Members include Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, \nBulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Macedonia, Moldova, Romania, \nSlovenia, and Turkey. Most Senators have visited one or more of those \nplaces in the past.\n  Most in the Senate have two or more jobs. One of my jobs as the \nchairman of the Helsinki Commission is fighting crime and corruption. \nIt has been a top priority of mine and the Commission in these member \ncountries, as well as throughout all of Europe. As part of this effort, \nI was pleased when the Foreign Operations Subcommittee included \nlanguage I requested in the fiscal year 2001 committee report urging \nthe State Department to continue providing advice and support in \ncooperation with the FBI to SECI. That is in their bill in recognition \nof the direct and indirect impact of transnational crime on Americans \nand American businesses at home and abroad. The subcommittee is \nrequesting in the fiscal year 2002 committee report that the State \nDepartment designate up to $1 million in technical assistance for SECI. \nThis investment directly helps a number of U.S. law enforcement \nagencies in their fight against a wide range of transnational crimes.\n\n  At least three Justice Department agencies currently are working with \nSECI: The FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service. In addition, at least two Treasury \nDepartment law enforcement agencies, the U.S. Customs and the U.S. \nSecret Service, are utilizing resources of SECI to support their \nefforts.\n  For example, the Secret Service currently sponsors task forces \nthroughout the United States and across the globe recognizing \ncooperation among countries, law enforcement agencies, academia, and \nthe private sector, representing the best hope for defeating the \ncybercriminal and preventing counterfeiting, computer-based fraud, and \nother electronic crimes that resulted in hundreds of millions of \ndollars of losses to American consumers and industry.\n  Because of their expertise and experience with the task force \napproach, the Secret Service has been asked to be the architects and \nleaders of SECI's highly innovative financial crimes task force in \nsouthern Europe. This task force, the first of its kind in the region, \nwill be based in Bucharest and will be operational by the end of the \nyear. The Secret Service expects to open an office in Bucharest and \nhave two special agents dedicated to this cooperative effort.\n  Tomorrow, on September 20, the General Accounting Office is expected \nto release a report on international crime which I requested last year. \nThis report confirms that the threat from international crime is \ngrowing and more high-level cooperation among Federal enforcement \nagencies is necessary.\n  The good work of the Treasury law enforcement agencies in addressing \nnew criminal threats from overseas is warranted and welcome. Passage of \nthe Treasury appropriations bill will continue to provide essential \nsupport for\n\n[[Page S9477]]\n\nthese agencies in their fight against criminal elements at home and \nabroad.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1570\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send a substitute amendment to the desk \non behalf of myself and Mr. Campbell, which is the text of the Senate \ncommittee-reported bill. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \nagreed to, that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, that \nthe amendment be considered as original text for the purpose of further \namendment, and that no points of order be considered waived by virtue \nof this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1570) was agreed to.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/19/senate-section/article/S9477-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9477-S9479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AVIATION SECURITY\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the \nissue of aviation security. The Senate Commerce Committee, on which I \nserve, had hearings this week on this issue. I want to take a few \nminutes this morning to discuss the history of this issue, the history \nof the debate in Congress about aviation security. I do that with one \noverriding concern. I do not want to be back on the floor of the Senate \nin 6 months or a year taking my turn once again in the procession of \nsomber floor speeches about how sorry and upset and how sad the Senate \nis that another air tragedy has occurred. I think it is important for \nthe Senate to step back and take a look at this issue now so we are not \ndealing with it again in another 6 months or a year.\n  Beginning my discussion this morning, I want to talk about the \npattern of the past with respect to aviation security. Let's make no \nmistake about it. There is a very clear pattern. Again and again, there \nhas been an air tragedy. Again and again, there is outrage in the \nCongress and in the country. Again and again, task forces are \nestablished and commissions are assigned to make reports and \nrecommendations. Again and again, there has been incremental and \nultimately ineffective implementation of changes that simply don't get \nthe job done when it comes to aviation security.\n  It would be an enormous disservice to those lives that have been lost \nand to the many who love them if the only response of this Congress is \nagain to issue more reports, let more commissions go forward, and once \nagain fail to act with respect to putting in place the actual \nprovisions that are going to protect our citizens with respect to \nterrorism.\n  The American people deserve quick, decisive, and sweeping aviation \nsecurity reforms. It is time now to get the job done right.\n\n  For a variety of reasons, for more than 20 years, plans to improve \naviation security have not been put into practice. What I intend to do \nthis morning is to outline specifically some of those specific \nproposals, to describe what happened to them, and why they didn't seem \nto be acted on.\n  After the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing over Lockerbie in 1988, and again \nafter the TWA Flight 800 crashed near Long Island in 1996, there was \nenormous support for tightening aviation security. In each case, the \nPresidential commission was established and reforms were initiated. In \neach case, studies by the GAO or the Department of Transportation \ninspector general made clear that there were vulnerabilities. And in \neach case, by the time the reports came out, the momentum was lost. \nAction was slow. It was incomplete and incremental at best.\n  I am not interested this morning in talking about whose fault that \nwas. Clearly, part of the problem stems from what Presidential \nadministrations of both political parties did in allowing the process \nto bog down in redtape and regulations. Part of the responsibility lies \nwith airlines that, indeed, did fight tougher security measures by \nclaiming costs would cripple their operations. But we should be very \nclear. Part of the responsibility lies right in this Chamber, right \nwhere the Congress did not insist on action, and did not insist on \nsafety for our constituents.\n  For example, in 1998, the GAO warned that vigilant congressional \noversight was essential. They made clear that momentum for reform would \nstall otherwise. But while there were spasms of interest on Capitol \nHill, Congress didn't do the job with respect to oversight.\n  I am going to make clear as a member of the Senate Subcommittee on \nAviation that this time is going to be different. This time the \nargument between those in the various agencies and the airline \nexecutives over cost, inconvenience, and control of the system aren't \ngoing to be allowed to be used as an argument for delay. We are not \ngoing to sit by again and reap the grim harvest of congressional \ninaction.\n  This is just a bit of the history on this issue. In 1987, the GAO \nrecommended that the FAA establish a certification program setting \nperformance standards for screening companies that operate the airport \nsecurity x rays. After the 1996 TWA Flight 800 crash, a White House \ncommission said the same thing, and Congress passed legislation calling \non the Federal Aviation Administration to get it done. But the Federal \nAviation Administration's rulemaking process dragged on for years with \nmultiple rounds of public comment. In June of 2000, the GAO reported \nthat the Federal Aviation Administration was then 2 years behind \nschedule. As of this morning, the certification process for screening \nthese companies still has not gone into effect.\n  In 1988, the GAO reviewed FAA's progress in implementing a variety of \nkey improvements, including passenger profiling, bag-matching action, \nand a variety of other initiatives.\n  Their conclusion was:\n\n       Based on FAA's current schedule and milestones, this whole \n     process for enhancing the Nation's aviation security system \n     will take years to fully implement.\n\n  To ensure followthrough on it, the same White House commission \nrecommended an annual report from the Secretary of Transportation on \nthe implementation of new security measures. That report happened \nexactly once: on the first anniversary of the TWA crash. Once again, \nthe response was nothing.\n\n  Under legislation passed in 1990 and 1996, anyone with access to a \nsecured area in an airport is subject to a background check. The White \nHouse commission established after the 1996 TWA crash went further, \nrecommending a full criminal background check and the FBI fingerprint \ncheck. However, the inspector general of the Department of \nTransportation recorded in 2000 that existing background check \nprocedures were, in his view, ineffective.\n  First, Federal Aviation Administration regulations required a \ncriminal background check for some employees but not for others. \nSecond, and more incredibly, some serious crimes, such as assault with \na deadly weapon, were not on the list of offenses that would disqualify \nan employee.\n  Many airports were not complying with the FAA's rules anyway. For 35 \npercent of the employee files reviewed by the inspector general, there \nwas no evidence that a complete background check was ever performed.\n  Let's reflect on that. In 35 percent of the instances, the inspector \ngeneral found no evidence that a complete background check was ever \nperformed.\n  Last year, one screening company pled guilty and paid a $1.2 million \nfine\n\n[[Page S9478]]\n\nfor doing inadequate background checks and for hiring at least 14 \nairport workers who had criminal convictions.\n  Congress passed legislation in 2000 directing the FAA to implement \ncriminal fingerprint checks and expanding the list of disqualifying \noffenses. New requirements, however, apply only to large airports. And \nthere still is no requirement to repeat fingerprint checks \nperiodically.\n  In 1993, the Department of Transportation inspector general reported \nweaknesses in airport measures to keep unauthorized persons out of \nrestricted areas. A followup review in 1996 found no significant \nimprovement.\n  In 1999, the inspector general reported that in a test of eight major \nairports, undercover agents were able to penetrate secure areas in 117 \nof 173 attempts--a 68-percent success rate. In many of those cases, the \ntest intruder, an individual who was testing the system, was able to \nactually board an aircraft. Now, the list goes on.\n  I want to mention just several more in terms of laying out this \nchronology.\n  Following the 1988 Pan Am Flight 103 bombing, there was a major \neffort to develop baggage-screening equipment in order to detect \nexplosives. Technology was developed, but it was still not widely \ndeployed at the time of the 1996 TWA crash.\n  The White House commission created in response to that tragedy \nrecommended the widespread deployment of such equipment. Congress \nprovided funding, and machines were deployed in a variety of locations.\n  But last year--just last year--the Department of Transportation \ninspector general found that these machines were significantly \nunderutilized. The inspector general found that more than 50 percent of \nthe machines were being used to screen fewer than 225 bags per day, \neven though their capacity is 225 bags per hour.\n  According to a 1999 report by the National Research Council, at some \nlocations ``the throughput rate has been so low that operators could \neven lose their skills for operating the equipment.''\n  The reason I am going through this 15-year chronology is that on \nSeptember 11, 2001, known vulnerabilities in America's aviation system \nremained unaddressed.\n\n  Last week's hijackers knew there were holes. The General Accounting \nOffice, that serves the U.S. Congress, had documented these significant \ngaps in our system. The terrorists took advantage of those gaps, and \nthe price paid by our country has been far too great.\n  Now it is time to correct these vulnerabilities. The legislation \nshould include action on at least four fronts:\n  First, swift implementation of the specific to-do list that I have \noutlined this morning should be a top priority. This is a to-do list \nnot made up from some sort of cavalier review by an interest group. \nThis is a to-do list taken from recommendations from the inspector \ngeneral of the United States and from the General Accounting Office. \nThese recommendations have accumulated for years. It is time to focus \non getting those tasks done rather than just perpetually creating more \nreports and more lists.\n  Second, Tuesday's unprecedented attack points to the need for a \nnumber of additional safeguards. As we all know, a number of our \ncolleagues have advocated armed sky marshals onboard many flights. \nCertainly this is a sensible recommendation, a credible deterrent; and \nI support that.\n  I also think there needs to be significantly improved intelligence \nsharing of information. Background checks for students applying for \nflight training obviously need to be more thorough and more meticulous. \nIf a passenger is on a terrorist watch list, the country is saying: How \nin the world can aviation security officials not be aware of that?\n  The technology exists to coordinate efforts between law enforcement \nand the airline industry, so no more turf fights, no more lack of \ncommunication. Focusing on information sharing of the best and most \ncurrent intelligence is absolutely key so that the names and faces of \nthose who are apparently unknown to the airline industry but aware to \nsome in the intelligence gathering can be out and available so as to \nserve as an important tier of protection for the public.\n  Third, and perhaps most important, Congress must fundamentally \nrethink who should be responsible for carrying out day-to-day \nfunctions, such as the screening of baggage and access to restricted \nareas. A number of forward-thinking Members of the Senate have been \nafter this issue for years, particularly the chairman of the Senate \nCommerce Committee, Senator Hollings. He has been suggesting this since \n1996 and before.\n  Obviously, between airlines and airports there have been conflicts in \nthe past, with some wanting security, some wanting to maximize the \nnumber of flights and passengers and convenience. Certainly, security \nand speed and convenience do not always fit perfectly together. But \naviation security functions need to be placed in the hands of those \nwithout any conflict of law, those whose sole and paramount focus will \nbe the security of the American people.\n  Finally, it is obvious there will be costs associated with this. If, \nin fact, the question of airline security becomes a function of the \nGovernment--which is something I support, and I believe has bipartisan \nsupport in this body--there are opportunities to use existing funds, \nsuch as the airport trust fund. I, for one, would be willing to look at \nadditional ways to secure that revenue. And there has been a debate of \nan aviation security trust fund. We are all aware that our constituents \nare saying, in great numbers, that they would be willing to pay a bit \nmore for aviation security.\n  Let's look at using existing funds more efficiently, but if that does \nnot do the job, clearly, responding to our constituents, and getting \nthe job done, even if it requires some additional charges, will be \nnecessary.\n  Finally, I think we ought to be especially concerned about smaller, \nmore rural airports. It is clear they are not going to be able to \nafford some security measures. Let's be clear to the public that we are \nnot going to allow rural airports to be security-sacrifice zones, in \neffect, written off by the Congress.\n  In considering the cost of the massive airline security overhaul, we \nare all going to remember the numbers of last week. It is going to \nrequire additional funds to rebuild the Pentagon, to rebuild New York \nCity. To me, to say the cost of improving airline security is too great \nis not an argument that is acceptable. The country expects us to do \nwhat it takes and to work together to get the job done.\n  Let me conclude this morning with one last point. I came to the \nChamber this morning to go through the 15-year chronology of inaction \nwith respect to aviation security so as to set out on the record how \nagain and again the inspector general and the General Accounting Office \nhave laid bare the vulnerabilities of our aviation system.\n  I want to make clear, again, I am not interested in assessing blame. \nWhen we look at the various executive branch leaders, when we look at \nthe Congress, when we look at those in the various interest groups, \nincluding the airline industry, all of them would now say that if they \ncould do it again, it would be very different. We would not have this \npattern, from 1987 until September 11, at the very least, that \nconstantly resulted in this cycle of tragedy, outrage, recommendations, \nand then essentially slow motion implementation.\n  I do not want to be back here in 6 months or a year. I don't want to \nbe back in just a few months waiting with the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota and the President of the Senate, waiting in a line to \ngive speeches about yet another tragedy. The American people know their \nelected officials share their grief right now. What they want to see is \nthat we can get the job done, that this time it is going to be \ndifferent. This time the Congress is going to take the to-do list that \nhas been spelled out by the General Accounting Office and the inspector \ngeneral for years now and, without any more delay, that to-do list is \ngoing to be put in place and the American people will have every \npossible measure of security as they fly in our skies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, last Tuesday's terrorist attack is \nhaving an immeasurable effect on our country. We are a nation of heavy \nand broken hearts devastated by the tremendous loss of life, property, \nand sense of security. My heart goes out to the victims and their \nfamilies. We continue to take solace in the heroic deeds of the rescue \nworkers and the patriotic response of Americans across the country.\n  September 11 was a dark day in our history. But we have had dark days \nbefore.\n  In the midst of World War II, Thornton Wilder wrote:\n\n       Every good and worthwhile thing stands moment by moment on \n     the razor edge of danger and must be fought for whether it is \n     a home, or a field, or a country.\n\n  We will lead the fight for freedom today. And, as in times past, we \nwill be victorious.\n  Last week Congress acted with unity and speed to respond to the \nattack on our people. We are authorized the use of force. We provided \n$40 billion for the relief effort.\n  We must deal promptly and decisively on another front. The ongoing \nstability of the aviation industry must be an immediate priority.\n  First of all, we need to act quickly to heighten security in our \nairports and on commercial aircraft. We must make Americans feel safe \nso that they will continue to fly.\n  Unfortunately, improving security will not be enough. Our Nation's \nairlines are clearly suffering as a result of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration's decision to ground commercial aircraft last week. \nWhile most airlines began operating again last Thursday, it is unclear \nwhen carriers will be able to resume their full schedules. Moreover, it \nappears that ticket sales are declining, which will further weaken this \nalready distressed industry.\n  We must respond to this crisis to ensure that last week's attackers \ndo not succeed in bringing down our Nation's airlines. This Congress \nmust provide a meaningful economic recovery package to help stabilize \nthe airline industry.\n  A number of proposals are currently being considered. They include \nextending credit or guaranteed loans to the airlines and providing \ndirect compensation for losses sustained as a result of last week's \nevents. I am extremely supportive of these measures.\n  I also believe that any relief package for the airlines must include \nan additional component to provide assistance to displaced workers. \nThis Congress must demonstrate that while we stand ready to bolster the \nairline industry, we are also committed to supporting the men and women \nwho represent its heart and soul.\n\n  I fear that even if a stabilization package for the airlines is \nexpeditiously approved, a certain number of layoffs are inevitable.\n  Midway Airlines has already been forced to suspend all of its flight \noperations and will lay off its remaining 1,700 employees. Continental \nAirlines announced that it was furloughing 12,000 of its employees. \nAirline executives estimate that as many as 100,000 workers could lose \ntheir jobs in the next few weeks.\n  The problems afflicting the airline industry will have a devastating \nimpact on thousands of hard-working men and women. I believe we must \nenact a meaningful relief package designed to both reinforce the \nairline industry and provide support for displaced workers.\n  I am currently crafting a proposal to provide support for displaced \nworkers. We do not know how long these employees will be out of work or \nindeed if they will ever be able to be employed by the airline industry \nagain. They are going to need financial assistance. They are going to \nneed retraining. And they are going to need health coverage. As with \nother aspects of the disaster relief effort, the Federal Government \nneeds to take the lead.\n  Our airline industry needs help. So do its many employees. I am \ncommitted to ensuring that assistance for displaced workers is part of \nthe larger airline relief package that we will take up in the days \nahead.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me take the floor to clarify a \nrumor that is circulating among some of the media that has been drawn \nto the attention of our office--that somehow the Senator from Alaska is \nin the process of offering an amendment to the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill proposing the opening of ANWR. That is certainly not \nthe case. It would be inappropriate and in poor taste.\n  I resent the fact that these rumors are being circulated by some \ngroups that have not even taken the time to contact our office, let \nalone contact me personally. Our press department has had several \ninquiries from members of the media asking if that is our intent. Where \nthese rumors are generated from I don't know. But if I get the \nopportunity to find out, it is my intention to enter them into the \nRecord.\n  Obviously, the activities of the last several days and the tragedy in \nNew York on the 11th of September brought about the reality that, \nindeed, as we look at terrorism, we have to look at the sources that \nfund terrorism in the Middle East. We need to make a determination, as \nwe attempt to hold those responsible, to also address the funding \nmechanism. It is also appropriate that we address our increased \ndependence on imported sources of energy relative to the vulnerability \nof the national security of our Nation.\n  That somehow we would attempt to propose an ANWR amendment to the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill is something we have not even \ncontemplated, and I resent certain implications of those who reported \nthat it is the intention of the office of the junior Senator from \nAlaska.\n  I hope my statement clarifies the Record factually. If there are any \ninquiries, we will be happy to respond to them directly.\n  My own contention is that there is a place for the consideration of \nthe matter of domestic energy development, including ANWR. That belongs \nin the energy bill where it should be debated and evaluated fairly by \nall individual Members based on its merits and in the interest of \nnational security and the national interest of our Nation.\n  It is my hope that we can work with the committee chairman, Senator \nBingaman, to bring forward an energy\n\n[[Page S9480]]\n\nbill that will address the priorities needed relative to energy, which \nis the lifeblood of our national economy, and we can do it in a manner \nthat is within the expedited crisis we have before us relative to \nenergy, national security, and other matters.\n  I thank the Chair for this opportunity, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, all of us who come to the floor of the \nSenate are like most Americans today. In anything we do or approach, we \napproach it with a heavy heart, recognizing the devastation that has \ngone on around us that has been inflicted upon some of our friends or \nsome associates we know of as it relates to the devastation the \nterrorists brought down upon New York City and here in Washington, DC, \nwith our Nation's military center, the Pentagon.\n  As we all know, the President asked for support and authority. This \nCongress responded last week very appropriately. I was not able to be \nhere at that moment. I was en route to my son's wedding in Washington \nState.\n  The difficulty of all of that was that I was not here, but I was also \ntraveling at a very difficult time. Thirty some hours later, both my \nwife and I were able to observe a fine wedding, and we were pleased to \nbe with our family and have our family around us, as I think most \nAmericans would wish they could at a moment of crisis.\n  I am now, as most public people, wrestling with a variety of \ndecisions that will ultimately be critical to our country and will \nspell out, in part, our future and the success of this great Nation.\n  I am confident that the administration is doing everything within its \npower at this moment to either directly or indirectly deal with the \nissue and to respond as all Americans and as most freedom-loving people \nin the world would wish we would.\n  I submit for the Record the story of two Idahoans, one now announced \ndead, the other still missing as a result of the plane crash into the \nPentagon. Their names are Ron Vauk and Brady Howell.\n  I recommended Ron years ago to his appointment at the Naval Academy. \nHe was an accomplished Naval Reserve officer, a submariner and Academy \ngraduate who was on watch at the Naval Command Center last Tuesday. His \nfamily lives in Boise, ID. I talked with his mother this morning.\n  Brady, on the other hand, was a 26-year-old newlywed from Sugar City, \nID. He was a civilian employee at the Pentagon, excited about his job, \nand starting a family. Our hearts go out to all of them. I visited with \nhis wife last evening.\n  Many of us are experiencing that kind of a circumstance or situation \nas this crisis reaches down and out across America to touch many, if \nnot all, of our citizens in a fairly direct way.\n  I am always caught in the great resilience of America. While we were \nbent for a moment, we now arise from that stronger than ever and more \ngreatly committed to the phenomenal values we, as of last Monday, took \nfor granted: The freedom of movement, the marvelous sense of human \nindividualness we had in this country, as protected by a Constitution \nthat had provided an ultimate shield of individual freedom in our \ncountry. To have that shaken to its very core on Tuesday, to find out \nthat we were just a little less free and a great deal more concerned \nabout the very freedoms we have. Our challenge now is to be able to \ndeal with it in a comprehensive and responsible way, to secure and \nmaintain our civil liberties and, at the same time, to be able to draw \nbright lines that establish a much clearer line and sense of security \nfor our people and in a way to detect and control the kind of \nenvironment in which terrorists can live and ultimately prosper. That \nis going to be the role and responsibility of this Congress.\n  I, as most Americans, still stand resolved and optimistic that that \ncan be done. It can be done well. We in the Senate have a role to play \nin all of that.\n  Over the weekend, I was struck by the comments made by the foreign \nminister of the Taliban Government in response to our comments, that \nOsama bin Laden be turned over to U.S. authorities. The head of that \ngovernment stated that it is not consistent with our custom for a host \nto ask a guest to leave. The guest must leave on his own accord: the \nPresident of the Taliban said.\n  This statement confirms what all of us have assumed: that bin Laden \nis in Afghanistan and they are harboring him even at the risk of their \nown ruin.\n  It is equally unfortunate that individuals in the media are already \nposturing the American people for a no-collateral damage goal in our \nmilitary objectives against these terrorists. Such posturing is \ndangerous, as it clearly undermines the support of our President to act \nboth in the short term as well as in the long term to do one very \nsimple but overpowering thing--that is, to secure our Nation's security \nand our citizens' security and our freedom.\n  I am confident this President will not bow down to the suggestion \nthat there might or there should be no collateral damage. If his \nmission becomes clear, he already understands his goal.\n  There is no doubt that many new legislative proposals will be debated \nhere in the Senate in the coming months to address issues of American \nsecurity and the fight against international terrorism. One of the \nissues I hope we will discuss is that of U.S. energy dependence. \nClearly, as we watch Americans line up in front of Red Cross centers to \ngive blood to help the wounded, let us remember the very lifeblood of \nthis country's economy is the energy that drives it.\n  I am not talking about the energy of the human mind. I am talking \nabout the physical presence of energy--gas, oil, coal, the kinds of \nthings that have fueled the economy that were turned into the \nphenomenal piece of explosive power we all watched last Tuesday.\n  Now more than ever before Americans recognize that once again the \nMiddle East is the crucible that could spell our success or failure or \nmight dictate to us the character of our economy in years to come, for \none simple reason: not the politics of the region--that is daunting \nenough as we know it--but it is what they provide for the economy of \nthe world. They are the oil barrel of the world. From that we ask at \nleast 55 to 60 percent of our use on a daily basis.\n  We now consume in excess of 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Iraq \nalone. Is it possible that some of our own oil money is being turned \nagainst us in the form of the resources that the terrorists used \nultimately to bring down the Trade Center and to punch a hole in the \nside of our Pentagon last Tuesday? Yes, it is possible. It is possible \nin part because for so many years we have ignored the fact of a growing \ndependency on foreign oil while we have turned ourselves away from \nincreased domestic oil production and increased efficiency that \nultimately produce the ability for our nation to stand alone, stand \ntall, and stand secure in its energy supply.\n  At least for the last 2 years, Congress has been doing the right \nthing. We have been struggling mightily with the shaping of a national \nenergy policy. President Bush has established that as one of his top \nlegislative priorities: to create greater energy independence on the \npart of this country so that now we know more than ever before that we \ncan act with relative independence as we shape new foreign policy, and \nnow, of course, as we shape an antiterrorist strategy for our Nation, \nfor the world, and for freedom-loving people all around the world. It \nis a piece of the whole--that is, a national energy policy. Unlike \nalmost any other policy except defense, and except intelligence, energy \nis the ultimate tool of a capitalist society. It is the strength of our \neconomy.\n  As I mentioned, struggling to get across the country to get into the\n\n[[Page S9481]]\n\nState of Washington to my son's wedding on Friday and back on Sunday, I \ndidn't ride on the wings of wind. I didn't walk. I rode on the force of \nenergy, as do all Americans when they fly or when they drive or when \nthey are transported around the world.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I certainly conclude that that ought to be \na priority--a national energy policy--and that we ought to be able to \nshape one in reasonable fashion in a couple of weeks. The House has \nalready moved legislation. They have passed a national energy policy.\n  Well over a month and a half ago, we began to mark up an energy \npolicy bill for the Senate. I hope our leaders, Senator Daschle and \nSenator Lott, will ask the Energy Committee to come together and stay \ntogether for the next couple of weeks to produce a bill to be debated \non the Senate floor. Our President deserves a national energy policy as \npart of our overall national security strategy at this moment on his \ndesk, acceptable and ready to sign.\n  I also believe we need to take a hard look at our intelligence \ncommunity to make sure the shortcomings in predicting the events of the \nfirst Trade Center bombing, and the embassy bombing, and attack on the \nU.S.S. Cole and, of course, last week's attack do not recur.\n  We must do better. We cannot accept past performance. I agree with \nthe assessments of my colleagues that a major reinvestment in our human \nintelligence capabilities is needed and it must take place through a \nreorganizational effort. We have the world's best when it comes to \ntechnological advancement. We can look down on any part of the world \nwith such detail that from miles high we can read the watch on the arm \nof someone on the ground. But we cannot read what is in that person's \nmind. That is impossible with the technology of today. That comes from \nthe human side of the capability I talk about, which we have been \nunder-investing in, or divesting of, for the last several decades.\n  Clearly, we must get back into the minds of the citizens of the \nworld--those who would do us damage and view our country as an enemy or \nan evil. It is only then that we can use the look-down from 3 miles \nhigh to determine where that person is going and when he or she may be \nthere. But we must access the mind as well as observe the movement.\n  If we can accomplish all of those things--and I believe we can, and I \nbelieve our President will ask us to invest in those--then we will all \nstand in a bipartisan way to support it, because what is at stake here \nis the very strength of our country and the very freedom of our \ncitizens. I have never once questioned the fact that we will not only \nstand for the test, but in the end, without question, we will win.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is Constitution Week. Of course, I am \ntalking about the U.S. Constitution. A point that all Governors and \nSenators might well remember: No State constitution in this country is \nlike the Federal Constitution. No State's constitution so clearly and \nso strictly delineates the separation of powers as precisely as does \nthe U.S. Constitution. So it is here in the Senate that the \nConstitution is defended--the U.S. Constitution--and it is here that we \nsupport the separation of powers, the checks and balances; and the one \nConstitution that we are bound by in this institution is the U.S. \nConstitution, a copy of which I hold in my hand. I want to take a \nlittle while today to talk about this Federal Constitution.\n  On Monday of this week we marked the 114th anniversary of the U.S. \nConstitution. Of course, the Senate was not in on Monday, and \nconsequently I have been forced to wait until today to speak about the \nConstitution. Again, this is Constitution Week. In tragic and sad \ntimes, we instinctively reach for what matters most in our lives: Our \nfaith, our families, and our fundamental rights as Americans.\n  As we struggle with the horrific events of September 11, we should \ntake a measure of strength from the events of another September day, an \n18th century September day.\n  On September 17, 1787, an extraordinary convention of American \nstatesmen, meeting at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, adopted the \nConstitution of the United States of America. My memory may prove me \nwrong, but I believe that, too, was a Monday--as was September 17, in \n2001, this year of our Lord. So today I wish to commemorate that \nsingular event by discussing several of the constitutional provisions \nthat shape the structure and guide the operations of the U.S. Senate. I \nthink there will never be a better time, or a more propitious time, or \na time when we more need to think and to speak of the Constitution of \nthe United States, than this time, and amidst the circumstances that \nhave attracted the attention and galvanized the attention of Americans, \nwherever they may live--in this country or elsewhere--as well as the \npeople of other countries. So it is timely to think about the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Imagine a U.S. Senate in which the State of West Virginia was \nassigned three Members while California was entitled to 30.\n  Or, consider a Senate in which Members served for life--or for just a \nsingle year.\n  How about a system in which the House of Representatives elected the \nSenate?\n  Or a Senate in which Members voted as a State block rather than as \nindividuals?\n  To our modern ear, these options sound preposterous, perhaps, but to \nthe Framers of the Constitution, these proposals deserved serious \nconsideration.\n  There was nothing inevitable about the Constitution as we now know \nit. Every word required delicate construction, balancing, and \nrefinement. In cases where the Framers could not fully agree on a \nparticular point, they chose ambiguity--or even silence.\n  Among that charter's 55 draftsmen--only 39 actually signed the \ndocument--there existed a vast fund, a vast reservoir of knowledge \nabout the operation of legislative bodies. That knowledge served the \nFramers well as they struggled to fashion the institutional structure \nof the United States Senate.\n  Let us examine some of the Senate-related options that the \nConvention's delegates confronted from the Convention's convening on \nMay 25 until its adjournment on September 17.\n  First the issue of representation. Delegates representing large \nStates at the Constitutional Convention advocated a strong national \ngovernment. In Edmund Randolph's Virginia Plan, the number of Senators \nin each State would be determined by that State's population of free \ncitizens and slaves. Large States, then, stood to gain the most seats \nin the Senate. As justification for this advantage, these delegates \nnoted that their States contributed more of the Nation's financial and \ndefense resources than did small States, and therefore, deserved a \ngreater say in Government.\n  Small-State delegates countered with a plan designed to protect \nStates' rights within a confederated system of government. Fearing the \neffects of majority rule, they, the small States, demanded equal \nrepresentation in Congress. This was the system, they noted, that was \nthen in effect under the Articles of Confederation. When the Convention \nagreed to divide the national legislature into two chambers, various \nFramers argued that every State should enjoy equal representation in \nboth Chambers. In fact, some delegates threatened to withdraw from the \nConvention if it adopted any population-based representation plan.\n  Other delegates sought a compromise between large State and small \nState interests. As early as 1776, Connecticut's Roger Sherman--he is \none of the\n\n[[Page S9482]]\n\nsigners of the Constitution of the United States--Roger Sherman, as \nearly as 1776 had suggested that the Continental Congress, in which \neach State had one vote, should be organized to represent people as \nwell as States, and during the 1787 Convention, Sherman proposed the \nso-called ``Connecticut Compromise'' which provided population-based \nrepresentation in the House of Representatives and equal State \nrepresentation in the Senate.\n  Benjamin Franklin agreed that each State should have an equal vote in \nthe Senate except in matters concerning money. The Convention's grant \ncommittee reported Franklin's motion with some modifications to the \ndelegates early in July. Madison led the debates against that measure \nbelieving it to be an injustice to the majority of Americans. Some \nsmall State delegates were reluctant even to support proportional \nrepresentation in the House.\n  On July 16, delegates narrowly adopted the mixed representation plan, \nthe Great Compromise, giving States equal votes in the Senate. That is \nwhy we are here. The Presiding Officer would not be sitting where he is \nsitting today if there had not been a July 16 Great Compromise. The \nOfficial Reporter would not be here listening to me and taking down \nwhat I am saying. I would not be here. These young people who are our \npages and who help us in so many ways to do our work for our \nconstituencies would not be here. That was the Great Compromise, giving \nStates equal votes in the Senate.\n  The compromise resolved the Convention's most divisive issue and \ncreated a Federal system of Government.\n  Senators already know what I am saying. Many people on the outside \nwho are watching through that electronic eye up there know it. These \nthings were taught long ago in the early years of a child's schooling, \nbut this is Constitution Week. We need to be reminded, and now in the \ncircumstances that confront this country and have confronted it \nespecially since Tuesday, September 11, we must be reminded that we are \nto be guided by a constitution, the United States Constitution.\n  We must zealously guard the powers of the legislative branch in times \nlike these when there is a war, when there is a military conflict. \nPowers have a way of gravitating toward the Chief Executive, and it is \nin times like those, in times like these, that we must be very zealous \nand jealous of the constitutional prerogatives and powers that are \nvested in this body, the legislative branch.\n  We must be on our guard more than ever because the Constitution lives \nand it will live when these circumstances are behind us, if and when \nthey indeed are ever put behind us, and I assume that they will be put \nbehind us at some point in time.\n  It might be a good thing to point out here, just to remind Senators \nthat the Continental Congress met behind closed doors. The Congress, \nunder the Articles of Confederation, met behind closed doors. The \nConstitutional Convention, where the Framers gave us this Constitution, \nmet behind closed doors, with sentries at the doors and the windows \ndrawn. So, there we have food for another speech, another day.\n  Be conscious of the Constitution and this institution (the Senate) \nand its prerogatives and its precedents, its rules. We need \nparticularly now to be reminded of these things.\n  A second major issue related to the number of Senators allotted to \neach State. Once the convention's delegates established the principle \nof equal State representation in the Senate, they needed to determine \nhow many Senators a State would be allotted. Few, if any, delegates \nconsidered that one Senator per State would be sufficient \nrepresentation. Lone Senators might leave their State unrepresented in \ntimes of illness or other absences, and they would have no colleague to \nconsult with on State-related issues. Additional Senators would make \nthe Senate a more knowledgeable body and, perhaps, better able to \ncounter the influence of the House of Representatives. But, some \nbelieved a very large Senate would soon lose its distinctive character, \nwould lack the agility needed to effectively counterbalance the House, \nand would make it easier for Senators to escape personal responsibility \nfor their actions.\n  Given these considerations, delegates had only a narrow choice \nregarding the number of Senators. During the Convention, they briefly \ndiscussed the advantages of two seats versus three. Gouverneur Morris \nof Pennsylvania, the man with the peg leg, stated that three Senators \nper State were necessary to form an acceptable quorum, while other \ndelegates thought a third Senator would be too costly. On July 23, one \nweek after the Great Compromise, only Pennsylvania voted in favor of \nthree Senators. When the question turned to two Senators, Maryland \nalone voted against the measure, not because of the number, but because \nLuther Martin disagreed with the concept of per capita voting, which \ngave each Senator, rather than each State, one vote.\n  Both the Congress under the Articles of Confederation and the \nConstitutional Convention used a voting method that gave each State one \nvote. This system of block voting was meant to reinforce State \nsolidarity, but it often frustrated those State delegations divided by \ncontroversial issues. The alternative, of course, was for Members to \nvote as individuals. Those Framers who had served in State legislatures \nhad ample experience with the per capita system. At the Convention, \nthey spent little time debating the two proposed voting methods. On \nJuly 14, Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts stated that per capita voting \nin the Senate would ``prevent the delays and inconvenience that had \nbeen experienced in [the Continental] Congress and would give a \nnational aspect and spirit to the management of business.'' One week \nlater, Gouverneur Morris and Rufus King of Massachusetts added a per \ncapita voting clause to their motion designating the number of Senators \nfor each State. As I have already noted, Maryland's Luther Martin \nobjected to the motion. A States' rights advocate, he regarded per \ncapita voting as a departure ``from the idea of the States being \nrepresented in the second branch.'' Consequently, Martin convinced his \nfellow Maryland delegates to vote against the two-Senator, per capita \nmeasure. Supported by every State except Maryland, both the measure's \nclauses passed on July 23, allowing each State's two Senators to vote \nas individuals, though still subject to the influence of States, \nconstituents, and party policies.\n  Because they did not have parties in those days, but I am speaking \nwithin the context of the current moment, the Constitution's Framers \nunderstood that no matter which method they chose for electing \nSenators, it would have a significant impact on the Senate's future \nrelationships with the House, the people, and the States.\n  From the beginning, most delegates dismissed any notion of \nimplementing the British House of Lords' peerage system based on \nheredity and title. This system contradicted the egalitarian notions \noutlined in the Declaration of Independence. The system set forth in \nthe Virginia Plan received little support, as well. Had this measure \npassed, the House would have selected Members of the Senate from \nnominations offered by the State legislators. The Senate could not be \nexpected to serve as an effective check on the very institution \nresponsible for its Members' election.\n  Senators will recall that the Virginia plan was introduced by Gov. \nEdmund Randolph, a delegate from the State of Virginia, on May 29, \n1787. It is easy for me to remember the date of May 29 because it was \non that date, 64 years ago, that I married my wife Erma; 64 years ago \non May 29.\n  The convention then considered a revised version of the Virginia \nPlan, which contained the clause, ``the Members of the Second Branch of \nthe national Legislature ought to be chosen by the individual \nLegislatures.'' Most delegates easily accepted this election method, \nregarding it as the most ``congenial'' plan available. Only \nPennsylvania's James Wilson criticized the idea. He believed that the \nState legislative method would ``introduce and cherish local interests \nand local prejudices.'' The alternative method, elections through \npopular vote, never gained the adherents it needed to become a viable \noption.\n  In Federalist 63, Madison defended the plan of election by State \nlegislatures against those who feared indirect elections would \ntransform the Senate into a ``tyrannical aristocracy.'' For\n\n[[Page S9483]]\n\nsuch an unlikely event to happen, the Senate, the State legislatures, \nthe House of Representatives, and the people would all have to fall \nprey to corruption. Madison cited Maryland's successful experiment with \nindirect election. Elected by a unique electoral college system, the \nSenate in Maryland showed no symptoms of tyranny, and in fact, had \nbuilt a reputation unrivaled by any other state in the Union.\n  Despite Madison's assurances, the system of indirect elections \nultimately proved vulnerable to corruption. Following the Civil War, \nnewspaper reporters accused State legislatures of accepting bribes or \nremaining willfully ``deadlocked,'' and therefore, unable to elect a \nSenator into office. Reformers reacted to these allegations by \nadvocating a constitutional amendment that would provide for the \nelection of Senators by popular vote. This one substantive correction \nto the Framers' handiwork for the Senate went into effect in 1913 as \nthe Constitution's 17th amendment.\n  And, next, to the issue of term length. The 6-year Senate term \nrepresented a compromise between those Framers who wanted a strong, \nindependent Senate and those who feared the possible tyranny of a \nSenate insulated from popular opinion. While few delegates to the 1787 \nConvention wanted to emulate the House of Lords' lifelong terms, or the \nCongress under the Articles Confederation's single-year terms, the \nFramers' reaction against these extremes helped shape their arguments \nfor and against long terms in the Senate.\n  Delegates examined the experience of the various State legislatures. \nAlthough the majority of States set 1-year terms for both legislative \nbodies, five State constitutions established longer terms for upper \nhouse members. South Carolina's senators received 2-year terms. In \nDelaware, the senate had 3-year terms with one-third of the senate's \nnine members up for reelection each year. New York and Virginia \nimplemented a similar class system but with 4-year terms instead of 3. \nOnly Maryland's Senate featured 5-year terms, making that legislative \nbody the focus of the convention's Senate term debates.\n  The delegates either praised Maryland's long terms for checking the \nexcesses of lower-house democracy or feared them for the same reason. \nSome members of the Convention believed that even 5-year terms were too \nshort to counteract the dangerous notions likely to emerge from the \nHouse of Representatives. In June, Madison, Edmund Randolph, and other \nconvention delegates cited Maryland's experiences when they argued for \nlong Senate terms. According to Madison, the senate of Maryland had \nnever ``created just suspicions of danger.'' Far from being the more \npowerful branch, the senate had actually yielded too much, at times, to \nMaryland's House of Delegates. Unless the U.S. Senate obtained \nsufficient stability, Madison expected a similar situation under the \nnew Constitution. He suggested terms of 7 years, or more, to counter \nthe influence of the popularly chosen House of Representatives. Edmond \nRandolph believed that the primary object of an upper house was to \ncontrol the larger lower house. He noted that Maryland's senate had \nfollowed this principle but had been ``scarcely able to stem the \npopular torrent.'' Seven-year terms, then, had a greater chance of \nchecking the House than terms of 5 years or fewer.\n  On June 13, the convention took up a provision for 7-year Senate \nterms. This encountered heated criticism from several Framers. For \nAlexander Hamilton, only lifelong terms could check the ``amazing \nviolence and turbulence of the democratic spirit.'' Other delegates \npreferred 4-year terms. Madison devised a 9-year-term proposal with \none-third of the seats subject to election every 3 years. He received \nlittle support for this plan, but he argued in its favor until the \nfinal votes on June 26. On that date, and following the failure of his \nown measure, Madison joined the majority of his colleagues in voting \nfor a 6-year term. In the Federalist papers, Madison argued that \nMaryland's experiment with 5-year terms proved that slightly longer \nterms posed no danger to bicameral legislatures. In fact, he expected \nthe agreed-upon 6-year terms to have a stabilizing effect on the new \nnational government. Long terms would control turnover in the \nlegislature. Long terms would allow Senators to take responsibility for \nmeasures over time. Long terms would make Senators largely independent \nof public opinion.\n  The Articles of Confederation set no qualifications for delegates to \nthe Continental Congress. It left these decisions up to the individual \nStates. By contrast, convention delegates supported establishing \nmembership limitations for House and Senate Members. Influenced by \nBritish and State precedents, they established age, citizenship, and \nresidence qualifications for Senators, but voted against proposed \nreligion and property requirements. There was a lot of sentiment \nespecially on property requirements as to age. I might pay particular \nattention to that aspect.\n  The Framers debated the minimum age for Members of the House of \nRepresentatives before they considered the same qualification for \nSenators. Although James Wilson of Pennsylvania State stated that \n``there was no more reason for incapacitating youth than age, where the \nrequisite qualifications were found,'' other delegates were in favor of \nage restrictions. I'm glad they did not have their way. They were \nfamiliar with England's law requiring members of Parliament to be 21 or \nolder. Some lived in States that barred individuals from serving in \ntheir upper chambers who had not attained the age of 21 or 25.\n  On June 25, 3 days after designating 25 as the minimum age for \nRepresentatives, delegates unanimously set a 30-year-minimum for \nSenators. In Federalist 62, Madison justified the higher age \nrequirement for Senators. By its deliberative nature, the ``senatorial \ntrust,'' called for a ``greater extent of information and stability of \ncharacter,'' than would be needed in the more democratic House of \nRepresentatives. The Framers, not all of them by any means, trusted \ndemocracy.\n  As to citizenship, under English law, no person ``born out[side] of \nthe kingdoms of England, Scotland, or Ireland'' could be a member of \neither house of Parliament. While some delegates may have admired the \n``strictness'' of this policy, no Framers advocated a blanket ban on \nforeign-born legislators. Instead, they debated the length of time \nMembers of Congress should be citizens before taking office. The \nStates' residency qualifications offered moderate guidelines in this \nregard. New Hampshire's State senators needed to be residents for at \nleast 7 years prior to election. In other States, upper house members \nfulfilled a 5-, 3-, or 1-year requirement.\n  The Virginia Plan introduced by Edmund Randolph, on May 29, made no \nmention of citizenship when it was introduced to the Convention. Two \nmonths later, the Committee of Detail reported a draft of the \nConstitution that included a 4-year citizenship requirement for all \nSenators. On August 9, Gouverneur Morris moved to substitute a 14-year \nminimum. Later that day, delegates voted against Senate citizenship \nrequirements of 14, 13, and 10 years before settling on 9 years as a \nresidency requirement. The issue of foreign birth was particularly \nimportant in the Senate, whose responsibilities would extend to the \nreview of international treaties. While the Framers were concerned that \nthe Senate, especially, might be subject to foreign influence, they did \nnot wish to offend foreign allies or close the institution to \nmeritorious naturalized citizens. The 9-year provision made the Senate \nrequirement 2 years longer than that for the House of Representatives. \nOn August 13, the Convention confirmed the 9-year requirement by a vote \nof 8 States to 3.\n\n  Inhabitancy: Although the Parliament of Great Britain repealed its \nresidency law in 1774, no Convention delegates spoke against a \nresidency requirement for Members of Congress. The qualification first \ncame under consideration on August 6 when the Committee of Detail \nreported its draft of the Constitution. Article V, section 3 stated, \n``Every member of the Senate shall be * * * at the time of his \nelection, a resident of the state from which he shall be chosen.''\n  Two days later, Roger Sherman moved to strike the word ``resident'' \nfrom the portion of the clause that related to the House, and insert in \nits\n\n[[Page S9484]]\n\nplace ``inhabitant,'' a term he considered to be ``less liable to \nmisconstruction.'' Madison seconded the motion, noting that \n``resident'' might exclude people occasionally absent on public or \nprivate business. Delegates agreed to the term, ``inhabitant,'' and \nvoted against adding a time period to the requirement. The following \nday, they amended the Senate qualification to include the word, \n``inhabitant'' and passed the clause by unanimous agreement.\n  We now turn to the issue of who gets to make executive and judicial \nnominations. Argued over the course of several weeks, the \nConstitution's nomination clause split the delegates into two factions. \nThe first faction wanted the executive to have the sole power of \nappointment. The second wanted the Senate to have that responsibility. \nThe second faction followed precedents that the Articles of \nConfederation and most of the State constitutions had established \nfavoring legislative appointment. The Massachusetts constitution \noffered yet another approach. This third way particularly interested \nthe convention delegates. For over 100 years, Massachusetts had divided \nthe appointment responsibilities between its Governor, who made the \nnominations, and its legislative council, which confirmed the \nappointments.\n  Rather than adopt the Massachusetts model immediately, the delegates \ninitially agreed to language that split the responsibility in a \ndifferent way. The President would appoint executive branch officers, \nwho would serve during his term, and the Senate would appoint members \nof the judiciary because they would hold their positions for life--a \nperiod most likely to exceed the tenure and authority of one President. \nHowever, the Framers in favor of a strong executive argued that Senate \nappointments would lead to government by a ``cabal'' swayed by the \ninterests of constituents. Other delegates, fearful of monarchies, \nwanted to remove the President entirely from the appointment process. \nOn September 4, the Committee of Eleven reported an amended appointment \nclause. Unanimously adopted on September 7, the clause, based on the \nMassachusetts model, provided that the President ``shall nominate, and \nby and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint'' the \nofficers of the United States--certain officers.\n  As they debated the controversial treaty-making clause, the \nConstitutional Convention's delegates considered, but did not follow in \nwhole, those precedents with which they were most familiar. In Great \nBritain, treaties were made by the king and, in certain cases, had to \nbe approved by a majority vote in Parliament. The Continental Congress, \nwhich had no executive branch, dispatched agents to negotiate treaties. \nThe treaties only went into effect after two-thirds, 9 out of 13, of \nthe States approved the documents. This inefficient process was further \ncomplicated by the States' ability to enter into their own treaties. \nWhile the delegates agreed that the States could not continue to make \ntreaties with foreign powers, they disagreed over the manner in which \nthe United States should negotiate, draft, and ratify international \nagreements.\n  On August 6, the Committee of Detail reported a preliminary \nConstitution to the full Convention. Article IX, section 1 stated, \n``The Senate of the United States shall have power to make treaties, \nand to appoint Ambassadors, and Judges of the Supreme Court.'' \nThroughout August and into the month of September, the delegates \ndebated treaty-making as a separate issue from the rest of the clause. \nSeveral delegates opposed granting the Senate the sole control over \ntreaty-making. It is a good thing that they did. While some wanted the \nexecutive to have that responsibility, others advocated involving both \nhouses of Congress in the process. Small-State delegates, however, were \ninclined to keep the Committee of Detail's treaty clause because it \ngave each State an equal say in the adoption or rejection of treaties.\n  On September 4, the Committee of Eleven reported a treaty clause that \nappeased many of the delegates. This is what it said: ``The President \nby and with the advice and Consent of the Senate, shall have power to \nmake Treaties.'' After further debate, the delegates unanimously \napproved the clause on September 7. However, the clause was taken up \nagain, this time to add to it the words, ``But no treaty shall be made \nwithout the consent of two-thirds of the members present.'' Shortly \nthereafter, the Convention passed James Madison's addition, ``except in \ntreaties of peace,'' which would be ratified by a simple majority vote. \nThe next day, the delegates struck out the peace treaty exception and \nconsidered dropping the Senate supermajority requirement as well. \nHowever, after two delegates cited the Continental Congress' ``two-\nthirds of the States'' example, they voted to keep the two-thirds of \nthe Senate provision.\n  Although adopted by the Convention, the treaty clause continued to \nstir debate in the period before the Constitution's ratification. As \none of the clause's strongest proponents, Alexander Hamilton defended \nthe provision in The Federalist 75. Remarkably, given the delegates' \nextreme dissension over treaty-making, he wrote, the clause ``is one of \nthe best digested and unexceptionable parts of the plan.''\n  Let me pause here to say that we can witness the Convention as it \nworked. And we know that time after time after time the Convention \nwould vote one way one day, and a few days later vote on the same \nmatter again and vote a different way, and then perhaps vote again \nbefore the close of the Convention and arrive at an entirely different \nconclusion.\n  If the Convention had been open to the public, the Framers would have \nbeen severely restricted and constrained, and would have paused and \nthought once, twice, and three times, and more, before they would have \nchanged their votes. They might, on a later date, have come to believe \nthat in the earlier vote they had voted the wrong way.\n  By having the closed Convention, by meeting secretly, they were able \nto have full discussions of a matter, have a tentative vote, vote one \nway, perhaps a few days later vote a different way, and in the final \nanalysis, in order to do the right thing, after considerable reflection \nand after hearing the arguments of others, vote again finally and, \nperhaps, differently.\n  That would have been very difficult to do had there been galleries, \nhad there been the media, newspapers, had there been television--which, \nof course, there could not have been. It would have been difficult.\n  I say that to say that in some situations voting in executive \nsession, in secret session, may, in the last analysis, be in the best \ninterests of the country.\n  Early in the Convention, most delegates agreed that the inclusion of \nan impeachment provision would help to hold national officers \naccountable for their actions. Throughout the summer of 1787, committee \nmembers reported impeachment plans to the full Convention. The Virginia \nPlan proposed a supreme tribunal to hear and determine cases including, \namong other concerns, the ``impeachments of any National officers.'' On \nJune 13, the Committee of the Whole amended the plan to provide that \nthe President could be ``removable on impeachment of malpractices or \nneglect of duty.'' The revised measure did not specify the procedures \nfor trying the President. In June and July, the Framers debated whether \nCongress should have a role in the impeachment process. Roger Sherman--\nthere that Connecticut delegate is again--Roger Sherman asserted that \nthe ``National Legislature should have the power to remove the \nExecutive at pleasure.'' Virginia's George Mason objected to Sherman's \nplan, claiming that the President would become merely a ``creature of \nthe Legislature.'' John Dickinson of Delaware countered with an \nunsuccessful motion to make the executive ``removable by National \nLegislature at request of majority of State Legislatures.''\n  You see, they were all over the place.\n  On August 6, the Committee of Detail reported that the House of \nRepresentatives ``shall have the sole power of impeachment'' and the \nexecutive ``shall be removed from his office by ``conviction in the \nSupreme Court, of treason, bribery, or corruption.'' Two weeks later, \nthe committee added that ``the judges of the supreme court be triable \nby the senate, on impeachment by the house of representatives.''\n  Can you imagine what it would be like in this day and time to have a \nConstitutional Convention with all the doors open, the windows open, \nthe galleries open, the media there? After\n\n[[Page S9485]]\n\nevery vote, Members would rush out the door to get before a camera and \nexplain their votes. Members would not later be able to easily change \ntheir minds and their votes upon more careful thought, upon more \nconsidered reflection.\n  So there are those today who would hem and haw and holler: Oh, we \nmust not do this. We cannot do this. The people are entitled to hear \neverything we say.\n  Well, those Framers were very wise men. It was they who wrote this \nConstitution which I hold in my hand. Of course, there have been some \namendments added later, but those men were wise men. And, remember, \nthey were placing their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor \non the barrelhead.\n  Of course, we had fought a war, but many of them were among those who \nvoted on the Declaration of Independence in 1776.\n  The constitutional plan then went for review to a committee \nconsisting of one member from every State represented at the \nConvention. The committee removed the full Supreme Court from the \nprocess. The report, influenced by the Massachusetts Constitution of \n1780, stated, ``The Senate of the U.S. shall have power to try all \nimpeachments [by the House of Representatives]''--naturally--``but no \nperson shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the \nmembers present.'' Ah, there you have it now. Alexander Hamilton later \nexplained this decision noting that no other institution would be \nsufficiently dignified--no other institution would be sufficiently \ndignified--or independent to handle the proceedings. The Framers \ndebated the clause on September 8 and despite Madison's objection that \nthe executive would become dependent on the legislature, the \nConvention, thank God, passed the final measure by a vote of eight \nStates to two.\n  Mr. President, there are, of course, other provisions in the \nConstitution that guide the operations of the Senate. But, those that I \nhave just discussed serve to stoke our appreciation for this \nextraordinary charter of government that we are talking about. In \nclosing, let us consider the words of James Wilson, one of \nPennsylvania's eight delegates to the Convention. Here is what James \nWilson told a meeting of Philadelphia citizens several weeks after \nSeptember 17, 1787:\n\n       Perhaps there never was a charge made with less reason, \n     than that which predicts the institution of a baneful \n     aristocracy in the federal Senate. This body branches into \n     two characters, the one legislative, and the other \n     executive. In its legislative character, it can effect no \n     purpose without the co-operation of the house of \n     representatives: and in its executive character, it can \n     accomplish no object, without the concurrence of the \n     president. Thus fettered, I do not know any act which the \n     Senate can of itself perform: and such dependence \n     necessarily precludes every idea of influence and \n     superiority. But I will confess, that in the organization \n     of this body, a comprise between contending interests is \n     discernible: and when we reflect how various are the laws, \n     commerce, habits, population, and extent of the \n     confederated States, this evidence of mutual concession \n     and accommodation ought rather to command a generous \n     applause, than to excite jealousy and reproach. For my \n     part, my admiration can only be equaled by my \n     astonishment, in beholding so perfect a system formed from \n     such heterogeneous materials.\n  What a Constitution!\n  I have often thought that the Creator of heaven and earth also had \nhis hand in the creation of the Constitution of the United States. \nWhenever, wherever did such another illustrious gathering of men ever \noccur? And why at this particular time? Had it been 5 years earlier, \nthe Framers may have lacked the experience that they ultimately had \ngained under the Articles of Confederation which enabled them to add \nprovisions that would avoid some of the problems with which they had \nbeen confronted under the Articles.\n  The country, such as it was at that time, the citizenry might not \nhave yet had enough time--I say this particularly with reference to the \nleaders of the Convention and the other members--to so convincingly \nmove them to the idea that mere amendments to the Articles of \nConfederation would not really be enough. There had to be a new start, \na new beginning. They went outside the parameters of their authority to \ninitiate that new beginning.\n  Had it been 5 years later, it might have been impossible, because by \nthen we were seeing the excesses of the French Revolution, with men and \nwomen being hauled to the guillotine. And so perhaps that is where God \nhad His hand. It happened at the right time. It brought together the \nright men, learned men, wise men, experienced men.\n  I thank Providence for this Constitution and for the men who had the \nforesight and the vision, the courage, the ability to listen to others \nand to change their minds. We can be thankful. But we should also be \nfully aware of our responsibilities to preserve that great document and \nto amend it only with great care and after great deliberation.\n  At this perplexing time in this year of our Lord 2001, we must be \never more on guard that we, as the elected Representatives of a great \npeople, as we go forth, hold in our hands, as it were, the Constitution \nof the United States; that we resist any temptation because of the \ndemands of the moment, the exigencies of the day, we resist the \ntemptation to put that Constitution aside in order to avoid debate and \nexpedite the business before the Senate. Let's not hesitate to ask \nquestions. Let's look before we leap.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/19/senate-section/article/S9485-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9485-S9486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska).

There is not.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1573\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Burns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for himself and \n     Mr. Burns, proposes an amendment numbered 1573.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to issue War Bonds \n in support of recovery and response efforts relating to the September \n 11, 2001, hijackings and attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade \n                                Center)\n\n       At the end of title VI, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) From funds made available by this or any other \n     Act, the Secretary of the Treasury may provide for the \n     administrative costs for the issuance of bonds, to be known \n     as `War Bonds', under section 3102 of title 31, United States \n     Code, in response to the acts of terrorism perpetrated \n     against the United States on September 11, 2001.\n       (b) If bonds described in subsection (a) are issued, such \n     bonds shall be in such form and denominations, and shall be \n     subject to such terms and conditions of issue, conversion, \n     redemption, maturation, payment, and rate of interest as the \n     Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment \nwhich would authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to use such funds \nas he deems appropriate to establish and make available war bonds for \npurchase.\n  I am proud that along with a bill that Senator Burns and I have \noffered which is pending as this amendment, there are at least four \nother measures which have been offered that would create a new \ninvestment vehicle for Americans who are anxious to contribute to the \nwar on terrorism. Clearly, the Congress and the American people are \nanxious to establish such a program.\n  Each of the bills which have been introduced are similar. In fact, \ntwo of them adapt the language Senator Burns and I originally \nintroduced almost verbatim. It is safe to assume that the goal of each \nof the sponsors is identical. That goal is to develop a way for \npatriotic Americans to contribute directly to the effort to rebuild the \nbroken and retaliate against the enemy of international terrorism.\n  How many times have we heard over the last few days from our \nconstituents: What can I do to help? The war bond is a way to help.\n  There has been a great deal of wonderful and soaring rhetoric on \ndisplay since the terrible attacks of September 11, 2001. These words \nhave helped our Nation steel its resolve and recognize\n\n[[Page S9486]]\n\nthe imperative of rooting out terrorism wherever it may lurk. As a \nresult, the public is unified in its desire to take decisive action. \nThe legislation that Senator Burns and I are offering today would allow \nthe Secretary of Treasury to channel and sustain American compassion \nand unity.\n  Specifically, we propose allowing the Secretary to establish a new \nform of U.S. savings bond that would be designated war bonds. The war \nbonds would be in such form and denominations and be subject to such \nterms and conditions that the Secretary deemed most appropriate.\n  Some have pointed out that current economic conditions may argue \nagainst the need for war bonds to be used as a tool for funding the war \non terrorism. I argue that view misses the most important point. There \nis no question that America is the most powerful nation economically \nand militarily on earth. However, what is less certain is the very \nnature of this effort, and a war bond campaign could be an invaluable \ntool for the government to explain the complex nature of the threats we \nface and rally all Americans to help provide necessary responses.\n  If the Government chooses to engage in this effort, I envision a war \nbond drive similar to those that were so successful during World War \nII. Influential Americans could be engaged to lead the education effort \nacross the country, and all Americans would have the ability to \nparticipate in what is going to be a lengthy and complicated challenge. \nSuccess would be measured less by how much revenue is raised than by \nthe Government's ability to maintain overwhelming approval of the \nactions it must undertake as we seek to eradicate the threat of \nterrorism.\n  Additionally some may argue that our use of the term ``war bonds'' is \nincendiary or inappropriate. Again, I would differ with this view. \nThere is no question that the attacks of last Tuesday were acts of war. \nAnd, there is equally little doubt that America now finds itself in a \nstate of war against the perpetrators of those vile and evil acts. \nAdditionally, the phrase ``war bonds'' evokes the successful efforts \nwhich were undertaken during World War II. And if there is any doubt \nabout how war bonds resonate with the American people, one need only \nlook at the overwhelming response my office has received since \nintroducing this legislation last week. In fact, I have even been \ncontacted by one patriotic American who has reserved the domain name \nwww.warbonds.gov as well as a toll free number for a war bonds drive.\n  In closing, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this \namendment which would allow the Secretary to establish war bonds and \ncontinue a long and proud tradition of American citizen involvement in \nour Nation's most important causes.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today, I proudly join my dear friend and \ncolleague, Senator Mitch McConnell, in offering an amendment to the \nTreasury, General Government Bill introducing the War Bond Amendment of \n2001.\n  This legislation is in response to the many constituents in my state \nand indeed, Americans from all over this country, looking for a \ntangible opportunity to do something positive in reaction to the \ndespicable acts of cowardice perpetrated upon this nation and its \ncitizens by gutless and faceless cowards.\n  The act will create an opportunity for ordinary citizens to \nparticipate in this country's recovery and response to those acts and \nto support the President and our nation in the rebuilding efforts as \nwell as bringing to justice those responsible for the horrific death \nand destruction of Tuesday, September 11th, 2001.\n  Throughout this nations history, bonds have been used as a vehicle \nfor our citizens to come to the aid of this nation and now, as much as \never in our nations history, the combined support of our people is \nneeded. By investing in these bonds, Americans are given a way to feel \na part of the solution rather than feeling helpless in the face of \nthese terrible events of last week.\n  Americans are not only demanding action, they are looking for an \nopportunity to be of service themselves, to demonstrate their \ncommitment to this country and to do it in a meaningful, tangible way. \nThis bill is one answer to that demand and that opportunity.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the midst of the disaster we saw in \nNew York, we had a number of images all of us will remember. One that \nwill stick in my mind was as one of those great buildings was \ncollapsing and the smoke and the dust and debris were barreling down \nthe streets and people were running away, one of those people who was \nrunning was a fireman. As he got to a certain point, he slowed down, \ntook off his hat and threw it as hard as he possibly could.\n  That courageous professional at that moment knew hundreds, perhaps \nthousands, were dying in that building and he could not save them, that \nmany of his friends and brother firemen had been there at the scene \ncloser than he, inside the building, and that they would not make it \nout.\n  It was a very poignant scene for me, and having been involved in some \nof these issues on the Judiciary Committee and as a Member of the \nSenate, I think it is important for each one of us to remember that in \nany terrorist attack, any really serious national disaster we have in \nthis country, it will not be the Federal Government that is first on \nthe scene. It will be our police officers and firemen, hundreds of whom \nwe lost in New York City, doing what they were paid to do--respond to \nthe scene, to give aid to those in distress, at the risk of their \nlives. Certainly the Biblical reference that ``Greater love hath no man \nthan this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,'' applies to \nthose people.\n  We as a nation know we have problems with terrorism. We as a nation \nhave heard people talk for days on television that we could be facing a \nchemical or biological attack or even a nuclear attack.\n  We need to ask ourselves, and we have been asking ourselves in this \nSenate for some time, and I have been actively involved in this, how \nare we training those first responders who are there to react to that \nevent. Each event is different. This event is different from a \nbiological attack, a chemical poison gas attack would be different from \na biological attack, and a nuclear attack would be different. And who \nknows what else could be conjured up in the minds of these diabolical \npeople.\n  It is important for this Nation to fulfill our obligation to those \npeople we will be sending out to respond to these events, that they \nhave the very best in equipment and the very best knowledge and \ntraining on how to handle each and every one of these events, each \nbeing different from the other.\n  We have begun to make progress on that. I congratulate Senator Byrd, \nSenator Judd Gregg who chairs the relevant subcommittee, Senator \nRichard Shelby of Alabama, a member of the Appropriations Committee, \nand others who have over the past few years taken steps to establish \nprograms to train those first responders, those firemen, those \npolicemen, those emergency medical technicians.\n  I am particularly interested in the Center for Domestic Preparedness \nat Anniston, AL, a center developed around 1997, 1998, where they are \ntraining 5,000 first responders from all over the country. That center \nis in the old Fort McClellan, the military base that was a chemical \ntraining school for the U.S. Army that had a cadre of people with \nexpertise in chemical and biological issues, and it had live agent \ntraining forces for them. They had the barracks from the closed \nmilitary base, places to stay, exercise rooms, and classrooms \navailable. It was the perfect location to establish this center. It has \ndone well.\n  Just a few weeks before this tragedy occurred, I was very pleased to \nsee we\n\n[[Page S9487]]\n\nhad a major increase in funding for that center, taking us now to $30 \nmillion for the year. Of the total of the perhaps $20 billion we spend \non terrorism, maybe more in this country, it is very small. But that \nwill allow us, if it becomes final law this year--and I hope it will, \nparticularly after this tragic event--to train, instead of 5,000 first \nresponders a year, 10,000 first responders a year. They will be able to \ndeploy them around this country. In fact, many have already been \ntrained. We have received great references from the people who have \ncompleted the training. The chiefs of police and firemen who sent their \nmembers to the school have bragged about the training they received. \nIndeed, New York has sent a lot of people there; 146 of New York police \nand firefighters have been trained as first responders and 226 in the \nWashington, DC, metro area have been so trained. We are making \nprogress. I believe it is the right thing to do.\n  At a time like this, we don't need to overreact. We don't need to do \nthings that are not appropriate. But we need to coalesce all the \ninformation we have been gathering for a number of years that relates \nto the kind of attacks this Nation may face, take that information and \nmake decisions about how to be better prepared. One of the most \ncritical things we can say is every first responder, every firemen, \nevery policemen, every emergency medical technician in the country \nneeds to have been given by his or her Federal Government the best \ninformation we can give them when they are asked to put their lives on \nthe line and respond to an attack.\n\n  We have equipment and we need to make sure we can use the equipment \nto determine if it is a biological agent or chemical agent that may be \ndistressing people in a certain area of town. We need to know that \nbefore we go in there. This is a matter about which I feel strongly.\n  It is appropriate, as so many have, to pay the highest tribute to \nthose people, particularly in New York City, who are at great risk of \ntheir lives, and many of whom lost their lives, responded to the care \nand protection of American citizens. We give great tribute to them. We \nalso must give them the tools, the information, the training and \nequipment so they can be even better at protecting our citizens' lives \nand even better at protecting their own lives.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill to unite our \ncitizens in this time of great crisis. As Americans, we feel many \nemotions, from anger to sadness, because of the tragedy of the \nterrorist attacks this past week.\n  The American people have responded with incredible acts of heroism, \nkindness, and generosity. The outpouring of volunteers, blood donors, \nand contributions of food and money demonstrates that America will \nunite to provide relief to the victims of these cowardly terrorist \nacts. This response is the true American spirit our country has always \nknown.\n  So many of my constituents in South Dakota have called my office this \nweek to ask what they can possibly do to help their fellow Americans \nwho are suffering today. Many have given blood, others have donated to \naid organizations, and most have offered prayers for the victims and \ntheir families. One woman asked whether she could buy the equivalent of \nthe old war bonds that allowed our citizens to contribute to the war \neffort back in World War II.\n  Based on my constituent's idea, today I am introducing legislation \nthat directs the United States Treasury to issue Unity Bonds. Americans \nwho purchase these savings bonds will be contributing to disaster \nrelief to the victims of Tuesday's attack and to our Nation's war \nagainst terrorism.\n  We will recover from this week's attacks. We will rebuild our \nNation's infrastructure, and we will rebuild our Nation's spirit. But \nit will take a sustained, long-term effort to stamp out terrorism \nagainst the United States and all other liberty-loving nations.\n  Unity Bonds will allow Americans who want to show their support for \nthis great country to participate in a meaningful way. I urge you to \njoin me in helping to unite our citizens.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think both of my colleagues, Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Johnson, have offered constructive ideas. They \ncome at it in a slightly different way, but their amendments are very \nsimilar. It is my hope that perhaps they can get together and bring \ntheir amendments together, and together offer it today as well.\n  I don't know whether we will finish this bill today. My hope is that \nwe can find a way to actually finish this legislation today. I don't \nknow that we have any requirement for a recorded vote on our side. I \ndon't know whether they have a requirement on the Republican side.\n  But my hope is that perhaps if we can finish this bill today, we can \nhave a vote and perhaps seek a rollcall vote on the conference when the \nconference report comes back. But that is up to the members of both \ncaucuses. We will not make that request at this moment.\n  I hope that perhaps other people will consider that. We have a number \nof amendments that have been discussed. We are now in the process of \ntrying to determine what the list of amendments will be, and we hope to \nhave that at some point. I would like to believe that we can, if we \nwork hard, deal with the amendments we know of on our side and the \nother side, and try to complete this bill pretty much this evening.\n\n  Mr. President, I will wait for a bit. I have a managers' amendment, a \nmanagers' package that I will send to the desk in a few minutes. It has \nbeen\n\n[[Page S9488]]\n\ncleared by my colleague from Colorado. I know he is working on some \nother business relating to this bill off the Senate Chamber.\n  Let me, for a moment, while I am waiting for my colleague to come, \nand before I offer the managers' package, speak as in morning business, \nif I might, for 5 minutes. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords).

Mr. President, let me talk, just for a moment, about the \nagenda in the Senate. Part of that agenda is, of course, what we are \ndoing in this Senate Chamber today; that is, as President Bush is \nindicating to the American people, we are getting back to work. It is \nwhat we want to have happen in this country.\n  What happened last week was an unspeakable horror visited upon us by \nterrorists. It took so many thousands of lives of innocent Americans. \nWe grieve for them. But the President said: We must go back to work. \nAnd so we must, in the Senate as well.\n  Our work largely remains the appropriations bills that we must \ncomplete. We are required to complete them by October 1. It is almost \ncertain we will not be able to do that with all the appropriations \nbills, but we need to work hard to make that happen.\n  Today we bring one appropriations bill to the floor of the Senate; \nand that is the Treasury, Post Office, general government bill. It is a \nvery important piece of legislation because, as I indicated, it \ncontains money for counterterrorism, it contains money for about one-\nhalf of the Federal law enforcement system, including the Customs \nService, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Secret Service, and \nso many other vital functions.\n  I think if we could pass this legislation today, or no later than \nFriday morning--but perhaps this afternoon--it would send a wonderful \nsignal to the American people that when the President said, let's all \nget back to work, the Senate took that seriously, and we have gotten \nback to work, and we have moved a piece of legislation today that \nrepresents one very important subcommittee on the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  I know my colleague, the chairman of the full committee, Senator \nByrd, and the ranking member, Senator Stevens, have worked very hard. I \nam so proud to serve with them on the Appropriations Committee. They \nwork very hard to try to get these appropriations bills moving and get \nthem through the Senate. If we can get this piece of legislation done \ntoday, I think it will be a great signal to send to the American \npeople.\n  Part of the agenda, and the immediate part for us, is to pass \nappropriations bills. But there are, it seems to me, three significant \nissues that the Senate and the Congress and the American people must \ngrapple with in a very serious way, with perhaps more determination \nthan we have had for a long while as a nation.\n  One is the issue of terrorism. We now know that terror visits this \nland in a fashion that we have never before thought possible. The \nresult is that we must not only recover from the acts of terrorism that \noccurred last week, we must work very hard to prevent those kinds of \nacts of terrorism from being committed in the future.\n\n  We know there are cells of terrorists that operate in this country. \nWe know there are training camps for terrorists in other countries. We \nknow there are people who very much would like to strike right at the \nheart of this country. So we must wage a war against terrorism, as \nPresident Bush has indicated. We must do so thoughtfully, not \nrecklessly. We must do so in a vigilant way, every day, in every way, \nto try to be sure, as an American people, that we retain our freedoms \nbut, at the same time, we try to reduce the risk of terrorist acts.\n  It is going to cost some money to do so. If we are, for example, \ngoing to put sky marshals on commercial airplanes flying in the \ncountry, that takes manpower, it takes money, it takes resources, yet \nwe do not have much of a choice. If we are going to beef up security at \nairports so that people who are flying on commercial airplanes in this \ncountry have a feeling of safety and that we have substantially \ntightened security, that is going to require some money, but we do not \nhave much choice.\n  If we are going to give the opportunity to our intelligence \ncommunity, and the FBI, the CIA, and the law enforcement community--if \nwe are going to give them the tools they need to try to take down these \nterrorist cells, and to try to track down the terrorists who committed \nthese acts, and to track down terrorists who might commit future acts \nand prevent those acts from occurring, it is going to require some \nmoney and some resources.\n  I think all of us in Congress have to be willing to do that. I know \nthere are some recommendations that will be controversial with respect \nto this war that we wage on terrorism.\n  The Attorney General made a recommendation the other day that I know \nwill be controversial, and yet I do not think we have much choice in \nthis matter. He talked about the circumstance that now exists when you \nget a wiretap order from the Federal court that allows you to wiretap \nonly with respect to one telephone instrument the conversations of a \nsuspected terrorist.\n  It seems to me, as the Attorney General has suggested, that if you \nhave someone who is a suspected terrorist, and you have been able to \nmake that case to a Federal court and are able to get a Federal court \norder, it ought not just apply to one telephone, it ought to apply to \nthe phone calls made by that suspected terrorist from whatever \ntelephone that suspected terrorist uses.\n  That is an example of the kind of policy changes we are going to have \nto consider, some of which will be controversial, but we do not have \nmuch choice if we are going to protect this country.\n  I do not want America to have to give up a lot of civil liberties in \norder to meet these protections that we now need, but we also need to \nunderstand that we need, as Americans, to be vigilant--all of us. It is \nnot just about law enforcement, it is about all of us being vigilant \nand understanding that if we see something that is unusual, if we see \nsomething that we think should offer us concern, that it be reported.\n  So this war on terrorism is a very serious--a deadly serious--war \nthat will be waged by all of us to try to prevent future terrorist acts \nin this country.\n\n  Even as we focus on that issue--terrorism, counterterrorism, rooting \nout the terrorists, finding out who did what was done last week with \nsuch madness in our country, and punishing them, and trying to prevent \nfuture acts--even as we do that, we have a couple of other things that \nare of paramount importance; and that is, we need to provide some \nadditional vibrancy and restore life to this country's economy.\n  Even before the deadly acts last week, our economy was softening, and \nthat softening of the American economy was causing significant \nproblems. What happened last week has caused significant shock to the \nAmerican economy. As a result of that shock, many of us worry a great \ndeal that the confidence in this country's economy will suffer, the \nAmerican people will lose confidence, and that we will see a further \nspiraling of economic difficulties.\n  So it is very important for all of us--the President and the \nCongress, Republicans and Democrats--to work to see if we can begin to \npump some life into this economy. That means that almost certainly we \nwill have to consider some kind of economic stimulus program, some kind \nof fiscal policy that matches what the Federal Reserve will do in \nmonetary policy that provides some life and some buoyancy to an economy \nthat has been in trouble.\n  The most important thing we can do is offer hope to the American \npeople that in the long term the American economy is one to invest in; \nthis is an economy of hope, optimism, and economic growth in the long \nterm. We go through periods of upturns and downturns. There are \ninevitable contractions and expansions in the American economy. That \nwill never change.\n  But we were going through a contraction at about the same time we \nwere hit with these disasters last week, and that spells real trouble. \nAll of us need to catch this economy very quickly and try to provide \nsome new life and vibrancy to it. I think the President\n\n[[Page S9489]]\n\nwill find willing hands in Congress, wanting to help him lift the kinds \nof policies necessary to boost this economy.\n  Some are talking, I know, about, for example, tax cuts, a capital \ngains tax cut. Frankly, I do not think we ought to be talking about a \ntax cut that will persuade people to sell stock at the moment. If you \nsubstantially create more demand for selling stock at a time that the \nstock market is moving downward, you are creating exactly the wrong \ninfluences. So a capital gains reduction is not, in my judgment, the \nright medicine; at least it is the wrong medicine for this illness.\n  I think, for example, investment tax credits might be something that \ncould provide some stimulus. There are a whole series of things you \ncould put in a menu that you could conceive would provide stimulus to \nthis economy. But I think we have to have that discussion. And we have \nto work with President Bush and the Congress to put something together \nthat says to the American people: We understand this economy has some \ndifficulty. We are going to move quickly and decisively to respond to \nit, to give you hope that this country's economy will have a bright \nfuture and this country's economy will continue to grow.\n  In addition to all of that, what happened in this country ought to \nremind all of us that there is, in fact, an urgency to write an energy \npolicy for America.\n  Without energy, this country doesn't work. Without energy, we don't \nhave an economy. Without energy, America's lights are off. America's \nmachines are shut down. The American economic engine doesn't run. We \nare a country that consumes an enormous amount of energy with a set of \nenergy policies that are very vulnerable to terrorists. We are far too \ndependent on foreign sources of energy, and we have a system of energy \nfor our country that is far too vulnerable to potential terrorist \nattacks.\n  We need a new domestic energy policy, one that says, yes, we are \ngoing to produce more, more oil and more natural gas, not necessarily \nfrom the most fragile lands in the world. We don't need to do that. \nYes, we are going to produce more. We are going to produce more coal, \nand we will do that using clean coal technology. We don't have to \nsacrifice our environment even as we use more coal.\n  Importantly, we are also going to begin to conserve. Conservation is \na very important ingredient in an energy policy that works. We also \nneed to begin to focus more of our resources and more of our \ndetermination to find renewable and limitless sources of energy. It \nmakes good sense for us to take the energy from the wind. The new \ntechnology wind turbines are remarkable. Why not use that energy from \nthe wind that is limitless and renewable?\n  It makes good sense to take a drop of alcohol from a kernel of corn. \nYou extend America's energy supply with that alcohol, and you still \nhave the protein feedstock left from the corn.\n  It makes good sense to do things in a different way. Yes, we need to \nproduce more, more oil, more natural gas, and more coal. Yes, we need \nto do that while we pay attention to this country's environment. We can \nand must do that. But also we need conservation. We need more \nefficiency of appliances, and we need renewable and limitless sources \nof energy developed in a very significant way.\n  I say that because when we talk about these three elements of public \npolicy that require an urgency on the part of Congress, dealing with \ncounterterrorism, trying to provide lift to an economy that is in \ntrouble, and writing an energy bill that makes us less vulnerable to \nterrorist attacks and the shutoff of the supply of oil from the Middle \nEast, all of these represent an urgency that Congress must tackle.\n  We must do this in a way that makes sense. This can't be business as \nusual. It can't be, ``The President believes this and we believe that. \nLet's have a fight for 5 or 6 months.'' It must be taking from the \nPresident and from Members of Congress the best of what all have to \noffer and from that developing a public policy that will strengthen our \ncountry, strengthen our country in the area of fighting terrorism, in \ntrying to give our economy the lift it needs at this point and in \nmaking us less dependent on a source of energy that is vulnerable.\n  All of these represent an agenda that is critical to our country.\n  Could I talk about other things? Yes, there are plenty of other \nthings yet to do. We know we need the kinds of things we were debating \nbefore the terrorist act last week. We were debating campaign finance \nreform, a Patients' Bill of Rights, the cost of prescription drugs. All \nof those things are important. None of them have lost their importance \nin the scheme of trying to do the people's business in the Congress. \nBut there is an urgency to several of the elements of public policy \nthat we must pay attention to first: terrorism, the economy, and \nenergy.\n  I, for one, pledge to this President and my fellow Members of the \nSenate that we must come together in a way that we have never before \ndone--at least in recent years--to grab these policy issues and try to \nfind the best that everyone in the Chamber has to offer and work with \nthe President to make the changes necessary to strengthen America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to urge the Senate to act very \nswiftly to confirm the nomination of Robert Bonner to be Commissioner \nof Customs.\n  I remind my colleagues that Customs is one of the first lines of \ndefense we have in our country. They inspect baggage and the goods of \npeople coming into the United States. They help to assure that we are \nsafe by inspecting any item that might threaten our national security \nand public welfare. They do a good job.\n  Last week's attacks demonstrate how important it is that Customs and \nall of our agencies have our full support. We must make sure that the \nagency is as robust as we possibly can.\n  What is the problem? The problem is that the Finance Committee has \nreported out Mr. Bonner to be Customs Commissioner, and someone on the \nSenate floor is holding him up. We cannot put him in place because \nthere are a few Senators who for some reason don't want him to be \nCustoms Commissioner.\n  I strongly urge this body to quickly and immediately confirm Robert \nBonner to be Commissioner of Customs. He is more than eminently \nqualified. I cannot think of a more qualified person. He has been a \nFederal district judge. He has been the head of the DEA. He has an \nextensive background and experience for the job.\n  I have personally met with him. I have spoken with him. I have asked \nmany questions of him. He is one of those people who--as soon as you \nsit down and talk with him--you immediately know has it. He is \nqualified. He is going to do a great job. I guarantee you that he will \nbe terrific.\n  This is the very time that we need him to get on the job. The Acting \nCommissioner, Mr. Winwood, is doing a great job. I met with him for a \ngood couple of hours last week getting a security briefing on what \nCustoms is doing. He is terrific, too. But he needs help. He very much \nurged me to do all I could to help the Senate confirm the nomination of \nMr. Bonner.\n  I call upon my colleagues. Come on. We are Americans. Let's work \ntogether. Let's get the job done. Mr. Bonner is a great man. Let's \nconfirm him so we can get him on the job and so Customs can begin to do \nthe things it wants to do and continue to do in helping protect our \ncountry.\n  I also say that part of that is strengthening our Customs Service \nalong the northern border. I am quite concerned. In my State of Montana \nthere are reports of a lot more goods coming across the border--\nsometimes, of all places, Glacier National Park because it is \nunprotected and particularly in the summertime. But there is a lot \ncoming across. It is particularly drugs and illegal substances of all \nkinds. It is becoming a problem. We need stronger Customs enforcement \nalong the northern border.\n  But to sum up, I plead with my colleagues. Come on. Let's confirm \nhim. He is a good man.\n  I see my good friend from North Dakota on the floor. I think he has \nsome of the same concerns.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if my colleague from Montana will yield \nfor a question, I heard the statement by my colleague from Montana, and \nI couldn't agree more. It is critically important at this point in time \nto have this Congress confirm the President's nominee for the head of \nCustoms. The Customs Commissioner job has been open for some long \nwhile.\n  The President, in my judgment, submitted the name of someone who is a \nwell-qualified person who will do a good job. It is hung up. There is a \nhold on it over some other issue. It doesn't make any sense.\n  The Customs Service at this point is right at the center with a range \nof other agencies having to deal with this terrorist threat. A \nsignificant amount of our law enforcement is embedded in the Customs \nService. We need good leadership.\n  The Senator from Montana says the Acting Commissioner is a good guy. \nI agree with that. I have great confidence in him. But there is nothing \nquite like having someone there who has been confirmed by the Congress \nto say: Here is the direction we are going to take with this agency.\n  It is important this week that we implore our colleagues who are \nholding nominees up--especially in critical areas--for the sake of this \ncountry, to get out of the way and to get the President's appointees, \nespecially for an agency such as this, in place.\n  Mr. Bonner is a well-qualified man who will do a great job.\n  I just wanted to say how much I appreciate the statement by the \nSenator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if I might, I very much thank my colleague \nfor his statements as well. This Senate, when it is business as usual, \nprobably is not quite as efficient and productive as it could be. I am \na firm believer in the basic underpinnings of democracy. We don't want \nto be too efficient, because as representatives of our people from \ndifferent parts of the country, there are different aspirations, \ndifferent hopes, and different points of view. We want a melting pot \nkind of basis to work together and pass legislation. But this is not \nthe time for business as usual. We have a national crisis. We are \nvirtually at war. There is a lot of talk of unity and of working \ntogether. There has been tremendous cooperation in both Houses, by both \nparties, and at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. But on something as \nvital as this, I just very much hope that whoever the one, or two, or \nthree Senators are who for extraneous, independent, and separate \nreasons--whatever they may be--are holding up Mr. Bonner, that they \nwill reconsider for the sake of our country, and particularly with an \nagency as important as this at this time.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that I be permitted to send an amendment to \nthe desk and have it considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself and \n     Mr. Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 1576.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To authorize State, regional, or local transportation \n authorities that receive Federal Transit Administration assistance or \n   grants, to purchase heavy-duty transit buses through the General \n                        Services Administration)\n\n       After section 642, insert the following:\n       Sec. 643. (a) State, regional, or local transportation \n     authorities that are recipients of Federal Transit \n     Administration assistance or grants may purchase heavy-duty \n     transit buses through the General Service Administration.\n       (b) The Administrator of General Services shall notify the \n     appropriate congressional committees if the administrative \n     costs incurred by the General Service Administration in \n     implementing this section are in excess of fees provided to \n     the General Service Administration under provisions of \n     existing contracts for the purchase of heavy-duty transit \n     buses.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment I am offering on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Domenici. It authorizes State and local \ntransit authorities that receive Federal transit assistance to purchase \ntransit buses through the GSA list. That is the General Services \nAdministration list.\n  Currently only the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has \nthe option to purchase buses through the General Services \nAdministration. The amendment would open up that option to other public \ntransit agencies around the country that also receive Federal transit \nassistance, as the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority does.\n  The General Services Administration currently offers three heavy-duty \ntransit buses on its schedule. GSA selected the three as a result of \ncompetitive solicitations, and the companies had to bid attractive \nterms and prices in order to win those 5-year contracts and get on that \nlist for the General Services Administration.\n  Allowing other public transit agencies the option to purchase these \nbuses from GSA would result in substantial cost and time savings for \nthese agencies. This would, of course, be especially valuable to some \nof our smaller communities around the country.\n  The new authority is limited only to transit buses and options \noffered by the General Services Administration. So the resulting demand \nwill be limited only to transit agencies that want the specific bus \nthat GSA offers. This does not require anyone to buy anything. This \ndoes provide an option that they can use for purchasing if they desire \nto do so.\n  However, in the next 12 to 18 months, GSA plans to broaden the \nprogram to a multiple award schedule with a larger variety of vehicles \nand optional equipment choices, which of course will benefit everyone.\n  We understand GSA is concerned that it may not be able today to \nadequately implement this new option. Consequently, the amendment \ndirects GSA to notify the committee of jurisdiction if it finds that \nthe program is resulting in unanticipated costs or impacts. We try in \nthe language to give GSA the opportunity to do that if they determine \nthat that is required.\n  This is a meritorious amendment.

Mr. President, during the course of the past week, we \nhave witnessed extraordinary acts of bravery: aboard the aircraft that \nwere hijacked, at the World Trade Center Towers, and at the Pentagon.\n  In addition, we have witnessed extraordinary acts of kindness by \npeople from all walks of life in this Nation who have reached into \ntheir own pockets and hearts and sought to comfort those who have lost \nloved ones, who sought to donate something of their own, including \ntheir blood and money, to assist those who have suffered egregious \nlosses.\n  Earlier this afternoon, I visited the Dover Air Force Base in the \nState of Delaware and spent time at the mortuary where the bodies of \nscores of victims of the crash and tragedy at the Pentagon are being \ntaken. There I had the opportunity to thank men and women--active duty \nreservists, members of the National Guard, and civilians--who have come \nfrom all across the country in order to try to identify the remains of \nthose who lost their lives in the crash at the Pentagon, in order to \ntry to be able to provide to families who lost loved ones a sense of \nclosure, to be able to take the remains of their husband, wife, son, or \ndaughter and to be able to give them a proper funeral, to lay them to \nrest at their final resting place with dignity.\n  The job is as difficult and challenging as perhaps any job that has \nbeen undertaken in the wake of these tragedies. I want to express on \nbehalf of not just the people of Delaware and those of us in my State \nwho are affected, but people throughout the country who are touched and \nhave lost a relative, a loved one, who will have that sense of closure \nbecause of the efforts going on today, yesterday, last week, and the \ndays to follow at the Dover Air Force Base.\n  We are fortunate in this country to have so many heroes and heroines. \nAs I speak some of them are working in the central part of the second \nsmallest State in America.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Campbell and myself, \nI send two amendments to the desk and ask they be agreed to en bloc. \nThey are a Campbell amendment for Senators Feingold, Grassley, and \nHarkin regarding shipments of day-old poultry, and a Dorgan for Kohl \namendment regarding information on foreign animal disease.

AMENDMENT TO TITLE 39.\n\n       Section 5402(d) of title 39, United States Code, is amended \n     by--\n       (1) inserting ``(1)'' after ``(d)''; and\n       (2) inserting at the end the following:\n       ``(2)(A) In the exercise of its authority under paragraph \n     (1), the Postal Service may require any air carrier to accept \n     as mail shipments of day-old poultry and such other live \n     animals as postal regulations allow to be transmitted as mail \n     matter.

None of the funds appropriated or made available \n     by this Act may be used for the production of Customs \n     Declarations that do not inquire whether the passenger had \n     been in the proximity of livestock.''\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1578\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Dorgan and Senator \nCampbell, chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Treasury and General Government, for their fine work in \ncrafting the bill now before the Senate. I also thank them for \naccepting an amendment I have offered to help strengthen this country's \nsafeguards against the possible introduction of foreign animal disease.\n  I serve as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nAgriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies, and we have given \nsubstantial attention to the ongoing problems of exotic pests and \ndisease that have been introduced into this country over the years. \nAttention and concern for this problem has been heightened this past \nyear with reports from the United Kingdom where outbreaks of foot and \nmouth disease have severely harmed the British economy and, in \nparticular, rural areas in the British Isles. The U.S. livestock sector \nquickly realized the danger that the spread of foot and mouth disease, \nand similar infectious diseases, could reach our shores with equally \ndevastating effect.\n  When Secretary Veneman testified before our subcommittee this spring, \nshe told us that strong measures were in place to reduce the \npossibility that foreign animal disease would come to America. The fact \nthat to date no such outbreaks have occurred here speaks to the \nstrength of those measures. However, such safeguards are only as strong \nas their weakest part.\n  Currently, all passengers coming to the United States on aircraft or \nby other means are required to complete Customs Declaration form 6059B \nwhich poses a set of questions about that individual's activities \nabroad. Included is a question which asks if the passenger is \n``bringing fruits, plants, meats, food, soil, birds, snails, other live \nanimals, wildlife products, or have been on a farm or ranch outside the \nU.S.'' If the passenger answers this question in the affirmative, he or \nshe is likely to be referred to USDA's Animal and Plant Health \nInspection Service, APHIS, for further inquiry. Clearly, this question \nis designed to help provide the Customs Service with adequate \ninformation to know if a referral to APHIS is warranted or not.\n  I have every confidence that APHIS personnel who serve on the front \nline of this country's inspection force have the expertise and \ncommitment to ask the right questions and take the right actions to \nsafeguard against foreign pests and disease, such as Foot and Mouth \nDisease. However, current practice does not ensure that all overseas \ntravelers who have been in the vicinity of diseased livestock will have \nreceived proper referral to the appropriate agencies. If a traveler did \nnot visit a farm or ranch, for example, the Customs Service would not \nhave the information necessary to make a proper referral to USDA. Still \ntravelers in rural areas of certain countries, such as the UK may come \nin close contact with livestock either at county fairs, rural bed and \nbreakfasts, on back country trails, or other settings that may not \nstrike one as a ``farm or ranch,'' but may in fact pose the same level \nof risk.\n  My amendment simply requires that any new Customs declaration forms \nused for entry into the United States ask a question in a manner to \nalert the traveler to the fact that simply being in the proximity of \nlivestock needs to be brought to the attention of Customs or USDA \npersonnel due to the high risk of foreign borne disease. My amendment \ndoes not require the destruction of forms now in use. However, I \nunderstand that these forms are now in the process of being redrafted \nwhich, I believe, makes my amendment doubly timely. It is my further \nexpectation that until such time that this change is actually put in \nplace, Customs Service personnel will be provided guidance to sensitize \nthem to making further verbal inquiry of travelers who have traveled in \ncountries known to have infectious animal disease outbreaks to \ndetermine if they may have been in areas where a likelihood of \ninfection was possible.\n  Again, my amendment is not lengthy, nor does it require much. \nHowever, I believe it will help strengthen our Nation's defense against \ninvasion by foreign animal disease. If the asking of one question \nprevents an outbreak of a devastating disease in America, it will \ncertainly be a question worth asking.\n\n\n    FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL CUSTOMS INSPECTORS ON THE NORTHERN BORDER\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to comment the managers of the \nTreasury, Postal appropriation bill, Chairman Dorgan and Ranking Member \nCampbell, for including in their bill funds to increase the number of \nCustoms officers stationed on our northern border. I particularly \ncommend their foresight, which was confirmed by the tragic events of \nlast week, and the suggestion that some of the terrorists may have \nentered the United States through ports of entry in my home State of \nMaine.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator from Maine for her kind words. The \nbill before us does indeed include $25 million to fund a northern \nborder hiring initiative. These funds would be used to hire \napproximately 285 additional Customs officers for our northern border.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Due to dramatic increases in land border traffic and \ntrade with Canada coupled with only token increase in staffing in \nrecent years, our ports of entry are woefully understaffed.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The situation in Maine is of particular concern to me. \nNinety-eight Customs inspectors are currently stationed in my home \nState. Yet, according to a Customs Service resource allocation analysis \nbased on threat and workload assessments, Maine should have 253 \ninspectors, or two-and-one-half times more than are currently there. \nMaine has 23 land border ports of entry, some of which are manned by a \nsingle inspector at any given point in time. Our Customs and \nImmigration and Naturalization Service inspectors work long and hard to \nprotect the integrity of our border. But they need reinforcements.\n  I understand that the lack of Customs officials in Maine would not be \nameliorated completely by this bill. But it, in conjunction with the \n$25 million for additional Immigration and Naturalization Service \ninspectors included in the Senate-passed Commerce, Justice, State \nappropriations bill, would take a strong step in the right direction. \nAnd I ask the distinguished chairman and ranking member to help ensure \nthat Maine receives its fair share of additional inspectors.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I assure the Senator from Maine that the Customs Service \nwill be instructed to pay particular attention to the needs of Maine \nwhen assessing where to deploy these officers.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. We appreciate the Senator bringing Maine's needs to our \nattention and fully intend to see those needs met, to the extent \npossible, through the funds appropriated by this bill.\n\n[[Page S9493]]\n\n                    Amendment No. 1574, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on behalf of Mr. Johnson, I ask unanimous \nconsent to modify his amendment, which I offered earlier today on his \nbehalf.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Smith of Oregon be added as an \noriginal cosponsor of the Johnson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1574), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VI, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) From funds made available by this or any other \n     Act, the Secretary of the Treasury may provide for the \n     administrative costs for the issuance of bonds, to be known \n     as `Unity Bonds', under section 3102 of title 31, United \n     States Code, in response to the acts of terrorism perpetrated \n     against the United States on September 11, 2001.\n       (b) If bonds described in subsection (a) are issued, such \n     bonds shall be in such form and denominations, and shall be \n     subject to such terms and conditions of issue, conversion, \n     redemption, maturation, payment, and rate of interest as the \n     Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nauthorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue Unity Bonds in \nsupport of recovery and response efforts relating to the September 11, \n2001, hijackings and attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade \nCenter. This amendment is similar to legislation that I introduced last \nweek, S. 1430. I was pleased that several of my Republican colleagues \nintroduced similar bills because this is an initiative that should and \nmust be bipartisan.\n  Unity Bonds will allow Americans who want to show their support for \nthis great country to participate in a meaningful way. This amendment \ndeserves full bipartisan support, and I look forward to working in a \nconsensus fashion to make Unity Bonds available to all Americans.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHutchinson of Arkansas be added as a cosponsor to the McConnell \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the ranking member, Senator Campbell, and \nI have discussed the issue of the McConnell and Johnson amendments, \nboth of which were offered this afternoon. We suggest the Senate \napprove both the Johnson and McConnell amendments. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Johnson amendment and the McConnell amendment be \nagreed to at this time. Let me be clear, I am asking consent that the \nMcConnell amendment be agreed to as offered earlier today and that the \nJohnson amendment be agreed to as modified by the modification I sent \nto the desk a few moments ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, we have no objection. We support the \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1573 and 1574, as modified) were agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1579\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on behalf of our colleague, Senator \nHollings, I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Dorgan) for Mr. Hollings \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1579.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n\nDESIGNATION OF G. ROSS ANDERSON, JR. FEDERAL BUILDING AND UNITED STATES \n                               COURTHOUSE\n\n       (a) The Federal building and courthouse located at 315 S. \n     McDuffie Street, Anderson, South Carolina, shall be known and \n     designated as the ``G.

Ross Anderson, Jr. Federal \n     Building and United States Courthouse.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have cleared the amendment. I believe \nmy colleague from Colorado has cleared the amendment as well.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. That is correct, Mr. President. We concur.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1579.\n  The amendment (No. 1579) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list I \nwill send to the desk be the only first-degree amendments remaining in \norder to H.R. 2590, the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill; that these \namendments be subject to relevant second-degree amendments; that upon \ndisposition of all amendments, the bill be read a third time, and the \nSenate vote on passage of the bill; that upon passage the Senate insist \non its amendment, request a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the Houses, and that the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees on the part of the Senate, with the above occurring \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The list is as follows:\n       Bingaman: 1 GSA.\n       Byrd: 2 Relevant.\n       Byrd: Relevant to the list.\n       Clinton: September 11 Heroes Stamp Act.\n       Daschle: 2 Relevant.\n       Daschle: Relevant to the list.\n       Dorgan: Managers' amendments.\n       Dorgan: Relevant.\n       Dorgan: Relevant to list.\n       Feinstein: 1 Breast Cancer Stamp.\n       Feinstein: 2 Relevant.\n       Johnson: 1 Unity Bonds.\n       Kerry: OMB study of the funding of SBA programs.\n       Kohl: Customs declarations and livestock.\n       Reid: Relevant.\n       Reid: Relevant to the list.\n       Schumer: 3 Relevant.\n       Hollings: SC facility.\n       Specter: 2 Relevant.\n       McConnell: War bonds.\n       Shelby: 1 Relevant.\n       Hatch: Drugs/Utah.\n       Hatch: 2 Relevant.\n       Lott: 2 Relevant.\n       Lott: 2 Relevant to list.\n       Campbell: Relevant.\n       Nickles: 2 Relevant to list.\n       Domenici: 2 Relevant to list.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have a finite list of amendments that \nwould be offered to this bill, H.R. 2590, the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations. As I look through the list, I see a fair number of \namendments that will not, in fact, be offered. There are a number we \nwill be accepting. I say, if there are Senators who have amendments on \nthis list, come to the floor to offer them. It would be our hope to \nmove to third reading this evening. My expectation is we do not have a \nfinal vote on the bill today. We would likely do that Friday morning--\nof course at the discretion of the leader.\n  In order to finish the amendments and get to third reading, we need \nthose who wish to offer their amendments to come to the floor and do \nso. We have been on the floor since 10 this morning. We know there are \nMembers who have indicated to the respective Cloakrooms\n\n[[Page S9494]]\n\nthey have amendments, and they are properly on the list we have asked \nconsent for, but in order to have amendments considered, Senators have \nto come to the floor and actually offer them.\n  I ask Senators and their staffs who might be monitoring these \nproceedings to call the Cloakroom if they can regarding their \namendments because we would like to go to third reading.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Campbell and I have been talking \nabout the list we have presented that makes certain amendments in order \nand available to be offered. It is a very small list. In fact, with the \nexception of being able to approve a number of items on this list, I \nbelieve there are only two Senators remaining who have yet to come to \nthe floor and offer amendments on which they are protected on the list. \nWe ask them to do that. It is now 10 minutes before 7 in the evening. \nThose Senators would have had notice all day that we have been working \non this bill. And, frankly, the Senate has been in a quorum call much \nof the day.\n  Senator Campbell and I encourage those Senators who still have \namendments they may wish to offer to either come and offer them or \nperhaps call us and notify us that they will not be offering those \namendments, at which point we could go to third reading.\n  My understanding from leadership is that we will not be going to a \nfinal vote tonight. Perhaps this will require a rollcall vote. It is \nnot certain at this moment. But, in any event, to get to third reading, \nwe need to clear these amendments. I believe there are only two \nSenators for whom we are waiting. If they intend to offer the \namendments, we hope they are on their way to the floor or that their \nstaffs will find them and get them to the floor of the Senate so they \ncan do that. If they are deciding not to offer those amendments, please \nnotify us. We want to go to third reading.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, to our knowledge, we have only two \nSenators on our side who said they have an amendment they want to \noffer. We are on the phone now to try to get them down here. But I \nthink if we can get them down here quickly, we will be able to finish \nthis bill by Friday.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if, in fact, there is a way to get to \nthird reading, and then do a voice vote on final passage, of course we \nwould prefer to do that as well. My expectation is we will have a \nrecorded vote on the conference report when it comes back from the \nconference, but I do not know that that has yet been cleared. My \nunderstanding was that a voice vote had not been cleared some while \nago.\n  In any event, if we can finish the amendments and get to third \nreading, it will have represented, in my judgment, significant \nprogress. This is a fairly sizeable appropriations bill. The ability to \ndo this bill today on the floor of the Senate would, I think, signal to \nthe American people that this is a new seriousness of purpose in the \nSenate. We want to obviously do our business, and do it the right way, \nbut we want to express to the American people that we are willing to \nwork together and get things done.\n  This country suffers from a pretty serious crisis as a result of the \nterrorist acts. We want to demonstrate to the American people that we \ncan go back to work and we can get this work done in an expeditious \nway.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I now ask for its second reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I object. And the reasons for the \nobjection are as follows: That in consultation with the Republican \nleader, in consultation with the majority whip, and in consultation \nwith the chairman, the chairman is seeking to have this piece of \nlegislation be considered under rule XIV.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Heroes Stamp Act of \n     2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REQUIREMENT THAT A SPECIAL COMMEMORATIVE POSTAGE \n                   STAMP BE DESIGNED AND ISSUED.\n\n       (a) In General.--In order to afford the public a direct and \n     tangible way to provide assistance to the families of \n     emergency relief personnel killed or permanently disabled in \n     the line of duty in connection with the terrorist attacks \n     against the United States on September 11, 2001, the United \n     States Postal Service shall issue a semipostal in accordance \n     with sub-section (b).\n       (b) Requirements.--The provisions of section 416 of title \n     39, United States Code, shall apply as practicable with \n     respect to the semipostal described in subsection (a), \n     subject to the following:\n       (c) Rate of Postage.--Section 414(b) of title 39, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``of not to exceed 25 \n     percent'' and inserting ``of not less than 15 percent''; and\n       (2) by adding after the sentence following paragraph (3) \n     the following: ``The special rate of postage of an individual \n     stamp under this section shall be an amount that is evenly \n     divisible by 5.''.\n       (2) Disposition of amounts becoming available.--All amounts \n     becoming available from the sale of the semipostal (as \n     determined under such section) shall be transferred to the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency under such arrangements \n     as the Postal Service shall be mutual agreement with such \n     agency establish in order to carry out the purposes of this \n     Act.\n       (3) Commencement and termination dates.--Stamps under this \n     section shall be issued--\n       (A) beginning on the earliest date practicable; and\n       (B) for such period of time as the Postal Service considers \n     necessary and appropriate, but in no event less than 2 years.\n       ``(g) For purposes of section 416 (including any regulation \n     prescribed under subsection (e)(1)(C) of that section), the \n     special postage stamp issued under this section shall not \n     apply to any limitation relating to whether more than 1 \n     semipostal may be offered for sale at the same time.''\n       (c) Design.--It is the sense of the Congress that the \n     semipostal issued under this section should depict, by such \n     design as the Postal Service considers to be most \n     appropriate, the efforts of emergency relief personnel at the \n     site of the World Trade Center in New York City and the \n     Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Hearing no objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1583) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is we are waiting for \nSenator Hatch who will be offering an amendment. That amendment is on \nthe way to the floor. We have discussed that amendment. We will be \naccepting it. I expect it will take just a few moments. And when that \namendment is accepted, I think at this point we are ready to go to \nthird reading of the bill. We will see at that point whether we need a \nrecorded vote on the bill. It would be nice to be able to finish this \nappropriations bill this evening.\n  As soon as we receive the amendment, it is our intention to accept \nthe amendment and move to third reading.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I concur with the chairman. If we can \nfinish this last amendment, I don't know if there are any other \noutstanding issues.

The clerk will state the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for Mr. Hatch, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1584.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

We have no objection on our side.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There being no objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the amendment, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1584) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The absence of a quorum has been \nsuggested.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe the amendment we just considered \nby Senator Hatch is the last amendment to be offered to this bill. I \nbelieve on our side there are no further amendments. I believe that is \nthe case on the Republican side.\n\n\n                     issuance of semipostal stamps\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with \nthe chairman of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations \nSubcommittee. First, I would like to commend the Chairman for his good \nwork on this bill. I appreciate his leadership and commitment.\n  I would like to confirm with the chairman my understanding of an \namendment offered by the chairman and Senators Clinton and Schumer. The \namendment proposes that a special commemorative semipostal stamp be \nissued to recognize the efforts of the brave emergency relief personnel \nwho were killed in connection with last week's terrorist attacks.\n  Existing Postal Service regulations state that the Postal Service \nwill offer only one semipostal stamp for sale at any given time. It is \nmy understanding that it would be consistent with these regulations for \nthe Postal Service to designate the commemorative stamp created by the \namendment as the one semipostal stamp to be offered, pursuant to the \nsaid regulations, for the period specified in the amendment, with the \nexception of the Breast Cancer Research Stamp previously exempted by \nlaw.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. The Postal Service \ncould choose to designate the emergency relief semipostal as the one \nsemipostal stamp to be offered for the period specified in the \namendment, pursuant to Postal Service regulations.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of contraceptive \ncoverage for almost 9 million Federal employees and their dependents \nwho receive their health care coverage through the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program. At a negligible cost, this coverage has been \nincluded in the past three Treasury-Postal appropriations bills and is \nin the House passed bill and as well as the legislation before us \ntoday.\n  This provision enjoys broad bipartisan support among members of the \nSenate as demonstrated by a letter\n\n[[Page S9496]]\n\nsent by over half of the Members of the Senate to the chairman and the \nranking member of the Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and \nGeneral Government.\n  This contraceptive coverage provision was adapted from legislation I \noriginally authored back in 1997, the bipartisan Equity in Prescription \nContraceptive Coverage Act, or EPICC, which currently has 42 \ncosponsors, and which was the subject of a hearing in the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on September 10. \nThroughout this effort, I have had the good fortune of being joined by \nSenator Reid who has been a partner with me in this effort, and I thank \nhim for his ongoing leadership on this issue. We both agree this is \ncommonsense public policy whose time has long since come.\n  The facts are not in dispute, contraceptives are an essential part of \nnot only a woman's health, but that of her children and her future \nchildren. The lack of equitable coverage of prescription contraceptives \nhas a very real impact on the lives of America's women and, therefore, \nour society as a whole. We took a strong first step towards ending this \ninequity when, in 1998, we guaranteed access to prescription \ncontraceptive coverage for federal employees.\n  The inclusion of this coverage in FEHBP has saved female enrollees \nover $1,000 over the past three years, according to the Alan Guttmacher \nInstitute. Not only has the inclusion of this coverage saved our female \nemployees about $350 a year, it has not cost the Federal government \nanything either. A January 2001 OPM statement on the cost of this \ncoverage for federal employees under the FEHBP found no effect on \npremiums whatsoever since implementation in 1998. Since it's not often \nthat we can say that, let me repeat it, it has had no effect on costs \nof health care.\n  In fact, some, like the Alan Guttmacher Institute, argue that \nimproved access to and use of contraception nationwide saves insurers \nand society money by preventing unintended pregnancies, as insurers \ngenerally pay pregnancy-related medical costs, which can range anywhere \nfrom $5,000 to almost $9,000. Improved access to contraception would \neliminate these costs and would reduce the costs to both employers and \ninsurers.\n  Whenever we talk about contraceptive coverage, the issue of a \n``conscience clause'' has continually been raised. I would remind my \ncolleagues that this is a concern we effectively addressed in 1998 and \nthat standard has remained unchanged ever since. I agree that this is a \nlegitimate concern, which is why we found a compromise in order to \nassuage the concerns of our colleagues who felt that there needed to be \na ``conscience clause'' to allow religious plans to opt out of this \ncoverage if their beliefs and tenets are not consistent with this \ncoverage. Originally, we specifically named five health plans that were \nexcluded from having to provide this coverage and allowed ``any other \nexisting or future religious based plans whose religious tenets are in \nconflict with the requirements'' of this coverage. Three years later, \nthere are only two plans remaining in the FEHB program which do not \nprovide this coverage. That's two out of over 245 participating health \nplans.\n\n  While many of my colleagues and I would prefer to have this coverage \nexpanded for all women nationwide, it is essential that we do not \nrescind this critical health care benefit for women in the FEHB \nprogram. And the proponents of the larger legislation, EPICC, are not \nalone.\n  As recently as June, the U.S. District Court for the Western District \nof Washington ruled in Erickson v. Bartell Drug Company that an \nemployer's failure to cover prescription contraceptives in its \notherwise comprehensive prescription drug plan constitutes gender \ndiscrimination, in violation of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964. This case was the first of its kind, setting a legal precedent as \nwell as bolstering the case for our broader legislation.\n  In turn, the foundation for the district court decision was a ruling \nby the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, or EEOC, last \nDecember that an employer's decision to exclude coverage of \ncontraceptives in a health plan that covered other prescription drugs, \ndevices and preventive health care services violated title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act regarding gender discrimination.\n  Together, these two decisions form a ``one-two'' punch in favor of \nthe approach we advocate today, an approach that's already been \nendorsed by a total of 16 States, including my home State of Maine--\nthat have passed similar laws since 1998. Today, another twenty States \nhave contraceptive coverage legislation pending. That's a start, but \nit's not enough. Not only are these laws limited to state regulated \nplans, but this piecemeal approach to fairness leaves many American \nwomen at the mercy of geography when it comes to the coverage they \ndeserve. Unfortunately, until we can get EPICC passed on its own, you \neither have to be a member of Congress, a Senator, a Federal employee, \nor living in one of these states to receive this guaranteed benefit.\n  We believe that contraceptive coverage not only makes sense in terms \nof the cost of contraceptives for women, but also as a means bridging, \nat least in some small way, the pro-choice pro-life chasm by helping \nprevent unintended pregnancies and thereby also prevent abortions. The \nfact of the matter is, we know that there are three million unintended \npregnancies every year in the United States. We also know that almost \nhalf of those pregnancies result from just three million women who do \nnot use contraceptives, while 39 million contraceptive users account \nfor the other 53 percent of unintended pregnancies, most of which \nresulted from inconsistent or incorrect use. In other words, when used \nproperly, contraceptives work. We know that they prevent unintended \npregnancies and when we have fewer unintended pregnancies, we will have \na reduced need for abortions, and that is a goal each of us can \nsupport.\n  I ask my colleagues to continue to support the inclusion of this \nprovision in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program as contained \nin the Fiscal Year 2002 Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. It is an \nimportant benefit and it is in the best interests of women's overall \nhealth, their children and their future children's health.\n  Mr. Conrad. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the Record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring for S. 1398, the Treasury, Postal Service, \nand General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  The Senate bill provides $17.118 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority, which will result in new outlays in 2002 of $12.528 billion. \nWhen outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary outlays for the Senate bill total $16.183 billion in \n2002. The Senate bill is within its Section 302(b) allocation for \nbudget authority and outlays. Once again, the committee has met its \ntarget without the use of any emergency designations.\n  I again commend Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens, as well as \nSenators Dorgan and Campbell, for their bipartisan effort in moving \nthis and other appropriations bills quickly to make up for the late \nstart in this year's appropriations process. The tragic events of \nSeptember 11 demand that this bipartisanship continue and that the \nCongress expeditiously complete work on the 13 regular appropriation \nbills for 2002.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nbudget committee scoring of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nS. 1398, TREASURY, POSTAL SERVICE, AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATION,\n                                  2002\n  [Spending comparisons--Senate-reported bill (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          General\n                                          purpose   Mandatory    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget Authority.....................    17,118      15,478    32,596\n  Outlays..............................    16,183      15,475    31,658\nSenate 302(b) allocation \\1\\:\n  Budget Authority.....................    17,118      15,478    32,596\n  Outlays..............................    16,183      15,475    31,658\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority.....................    17,022      15,478    32,500\n  Outlays..............................    16,261      15,475    31,736\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority.....................    16,614      15,478    32,092\n  Outlays..............................    15,974      15,475    31,449\n \n   SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation \\1\\:\n  Budget Authority.....................  .........  .........  .........\n  Outlays..............................  .........  .........  .........\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority.....................        96   .........        96\n  Outlays..............................

Mr. President, I hope that the Senate will soon begin \nconsideration of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2002. This bill would authorize $343.5 billion for national defense \nprograms, the full amount requested by the administration, including \nthe $18.4 billion requested by the President in his amended budget \nrequest.\n  The bill would also address a number of important priorities \nidentified by the Armed Services Committee, adding significant funding \nfor military compensation and quality of life, the readiness and \ntransformation of the military services, and the capability of our \narmed forces to meet nontraditional threats, including terrorism. In \nlight of recent events, we will obviously do more, as we already have, \nwith the enactment of the $40 billion emergency supplemental \nappropriation bill last week. However, these are no ordinary times, and \nthe debate on this bill will be no ordinary debate. Debate on a bill \nlike this is an inherent part of our democracy, and while our \ndemocratic institutions are stronger than any terrorist attack, in one \nregard we operate differently in times of national emergency. We strive \nto set aside our differences, and ask decent people everywhere to join \nforces with us to seek out and to defeat the common enemy of the \ncivilized world.\n  For this reason, I am today introducing two new bills. The first bill \nis identical to S. 1416, as reported by the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee in every respect but one--the removal of legislative language \ndealing with missile defense. The second bill, which would be deferred \nfor debate at a later and more appropriate time, would include the \nmissile defense language.\n  I strongly believe that the missile defense provisions took an \nappropriate step on an issue of national importance, and I was \ndisappointed that this single area of disagreement led the Republican \nMembers of our committee to vote against this bill that is so important \nto our national security.\n  In my view, however, this is the wrong time for divisive debate on \nissues of national defense. We cannot let issues like this pull us \napart and undermine our common sense of national purpose in fighting \nterrorism. Rather, we should leave this debate to a later time and link \narms against our attackers.\n  When we take up the defense authorization act, I hope that my \ncolleagues will join me in putting controversial issues aside and help \nus move forward together to pass this bill promptly and indicate our \nstrong and unified support for the national defense with a minimum of \ndivisive debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/19/senate-section/article/S9497-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9497-S9498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE HAPPY HOOLIGANS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to comment for a moment about some \nfighter pilots who are flying air missions over our nation's capital.\n  On Tuesday of last week, following the attack on the World Trade \nCenter and shortly before the Pentagon was hit, a detachment of \nfighters who were on alert at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia were \nordered airborne to protect the nation's capital. It happens that the \ndetachment of fighters is from North Dakota.\n  The 119th Tactical Fighter Wing of the North Dakota Air National \nGuard flies F-16s. They are called the Happy Hooligans. The Happy \nHooligans are folks who farm; they run drug stores; they teach school. \nThey do a lot of things in their community, but they also are members \nof the National Guard who maintain and fly F-16s. More than that, the \nHappy Hooligans, the National Air Guard detachment in Fargo, ND, are \nsome of the best fighter pilots in the world. In fact, the Happy \nHooligans have won the William Tell Award on several occasions.\n  The William Tell Award is an award that is given to the fighter units \nthat are the most proficient combat fighter pilots in the world.\n  So this National Guard unit from Fargo, ND, has taken their airplanes \nto the William Tell contest, and they have flown against the world's \ntop combat pilots, and they have brought the William Tell Award home to \nFargo, ND, as proof that they are the best fighter pilots in the world.\n\n[[Page S9498]]\n\n  For some time, the Happy Hooligans have kept a permanent detachment \nwith four F-16s, pilots, and crews on alert at Langley Air Force Base \nto provide air defense of the United States.\n  Last Tuesday morning, the attack on the World Trade Center in New \nYork precipitated an order for those fighters who were on alert to take \nto the skies. And those F-16s took to the air, but regrettably they \nwere not yet over Washington's airspace when the airplane hit the \nPentagon. They were still some minutes away.\n  But they then flew, as I understand it, 7 hours that day over the \nskies of Washington, DC, performing combat air patrol and protecting \nour nation's capital. And these are, as I said, men and women who \nbelong to the National Guard but who have been awarded the distinction \nof being the best fighter pilots in the world.\n  I was enormously proud of them. I called their commander at Langley. \nI told them how proud I was to have the Happy Hooligans--a wonderful \ncontingent of civilian soldiers; men and women who belong to the \nNational Guard--flying those F-16s, providing air cover during a time \nof national emergency.\n  So, for the record, I want to say that all Americans, of course, are \nproud of our men and women in uniform. We grieve with them for the \ntragedy visited upon them when the airplane was flown into the \nPentagon, just as we do for the thousands of people who have lost their \nlives at the World Trade Center.\n  And as there are brave men and women across the country who have \nstepped forward to say, let it be me--the firemen and the firefighters \nand police men and women who were climbing the stairs of the World \nTrade Center to try to rescue people, risking their lives to help \nothers, just as there are so many heroes around this country during a \ntime of need--so, too, were the Happy Hooligans in their cockpit of the \nF-16s, flying combat air patrols over our Nation's Capital.\n  Let me say to the Happy Hooligans: I salute you. I am proud of your \nwork. And this country owes you a great debt of gratitude.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend and colleague from North \nDakota, in relation to his eloquent remarks about the Happy Hooligans, \nwe are glad the Happy Hooligans are on our side. I knew that this \ntraining was going on. These Air Guardsmen--and possibly women as \nwell--were very important in scrambling to protect our Nation's \nCapital. I know of one of those pilots actually who is from Virginia.\n  I am not going to get into the details because it is important for \nnational security not to reveal what they were doing, but they were \nvery much in harm's way. I will not get into any more detail other than \nto say, these pilots--the Happy Hooligans, and any others who were \ninvolved in that scrambled mission to protect our Nation's Capital, and \nthe region here in the DC area--really were willing to give their lives \nin a generally undefended position.\n  So I am glad the Senator saluted the Happy Hooligans. I salute the \nHappy Hooligans and all those Air Guard pilots who scrambled to our \nNation's defense, with complete risk to their lives, possibly having to \ngive their lives to protect others.\n  They will be called upon again, undoubtedly, in service to our \ninterests, our freedom, and our allies. We do salute them and their \nfamilies and their employers, whether they may be in North Dakota, \nVirginia, Minnesota, Wisconsin, or anywhere else in this country \nbecause they are patriots. We have all seen the patriotism that defines \nour country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/19/senate-section/article/S9498-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO THE PAGES\n\n  Mr. DAYTON.

Mr. President, last month, the U.S. Congress lost one \nof the finest public servants I have had the honor to know. As my \ncolleagues may know, Congressman Floyd Spence, who represented South \nCarolina's 2nd District, passed away on August 16, 2001. Floyd Spence \nmay no longer walk the halls of Congress, but the countless \ncontributions he made over the last three decades will continue to \ninfluence South Carolina and this great Nation.\n  Floyd was a humble public servant who was proud of his modest \nbackground, often introducing himself as ``Floyd Spence, dirt farmer.'' \nHe was a principled man who could disarm anyone with his friendly \ndisposition and his distinct chuckle. It was difficult, if not \nimpossible, for anyone to dislike Floyd.\n  Too often we take life for granted, but not Floyd Spence. As a \nbeneficiary of two organ transplants, he knew too well he had been \ngiven not just a second, but a third change at life. As a result, Floyd \nlived life to the fullest, dedicating it to the service of others and \nhis Nation.\n  Floyd's generosity was demonstrated by his willingness to lend an ear \nto those who faced the frightening prospect of a transplant, or the \neven scarier possibility of not receiving an organ in time. Having \nfaced these fears himself, he welcomed the opportunity to comfort \nindividuals from across the United States who called to ask him about \nhis own experience.\n  My friend, ever the Southern gentleman, leaves behind a legacy of \ndedicated public service. For almost fifty years he loyally served the \npeople of South Carolina. Floyd was also an outspoken advocate for our \nArmed Services and had served as Chairman for the House Armed Services \nCommittee. As a retired Naval Reserve Officer, he recognized the \nimportance of a strong military and worked tirelessly to ensure that \nthe needs of our Armed Services were addressed.\n  He was a true patriot, a dedicated public servant, and he will be \ngreatly missed by all who knew him. Floyd is an inspiration to all, and \nmy heartfelt sympathy goes out to his devoted wife Debbie, and his fine \nsons, David, Zach, Ben, and Caldwell, and to his dedicated staff.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/19/senate-section/article/S9498-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9498-S9500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONFIRMATION OF BRUCE COLE AS CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR \n                             THE HUMANITIES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to express my \nstrong support for the nomination of Bruce Cole to be Chairman of the \nNational Endowment for the Humanities.\n\n[[Page S9499]]\n\nDr. Cole is a noted art historian and a Distinguished Professor at \nIndiana University. He served as Visiting Professor at Hebrew \nUniversity in Jerusalem and previously held the Hohenberg Chair of \nExcellence at the University of Memphis. Dr. Cole is a former member of \nthe National Council on the Humanities, and he will bring impressive \nstature and experience to the Humanities Endowment.\n  We have been fortunate over the past three decades to have many \ndistinguished academics and humanists lead this agency. I believe that \nDr. Cole will serve in that tradition and be an impressive leader for \nthis important agency.\n  In conjunction with the consideration of his nomination by the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, I submitted a \nnumber of questions to Dr. Cole, and I wanted to share his answers with \nmy colleagues. I ask unanimous consent that they may be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Questions by Senator Kennedy for Dr. Bruce Cole\n\n\n                                GENERAL\n\n       1. Do you support the mission of the National Endowment for \n     the Humanities and believe that there is a federal role in \n     support of the humanities?\n       Answer: Yes. I believe firmly that the NEH plays a crucial, \n     and necessary role in our democracy. Although the NEH is a \n     small agency, its impact is great. As the only federal \n     program dedicated exclusively to the national dissemination \n     of the humanities, it affirms our government's support for \n     the humanities. This support is proper because the humanities \n     make us aware of our shared human condition and enlarge our \n     worldview. The humanities are the principal means of \n     transmitting our shared democratic values to future \n     generations. As a pivotal civilizing force in human life, the \n     humanities are essential to the well-being of any democracy \n     and all its citizenry.\n       The importance of the humanities is recognized in the \n     National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act \n     establishing the NEH. This act states: ``That a high \n     civilization must not limit its efforts to science and \n     technology alone but must give full value and support to the \n     other great branches of scholarly and cultural activity in \n     order to achieve a better understanding of the past, a better \n     analysis of the present, and a better view of the future.'' \n     The legislation also states that ``democracy demands wisdom \n     and vision in its citizens'' and that ``the study of the \n     humanities requires constant dedication and devotion.'' These \n     words remain as true and meaningful today as when they were \n     written more than three and a half decades ago. If confirmed \n     I hope to serve the nation by furthering the NEH's mission to \n     make the humanities part of the lives of all Americans.\n       2. Are there any circumstances under which you would \n     support the elimination of the agency?\n       Answer: No.\n       3. Due to budget cuts and the impact of inflation, the \n     NEH's spending power is about 30% of what it was in 1980. \n     This decline in funding has reduced the agency's reach and \n     impact. How do you view current funding of the agency? Will \n     you advocate for higher spending levels for NEH?\n       Answer: I cannot answer this question presently because I \n     do not have detailed knowledge of the NEH's current budget \n     and how it is allocated. The proper size of the budget and \n     the distribution of funds among the various programs and \n     offices are important issues that shall command my immediate \n     attention if I am confirmed. As NEH Chairman I shall \n     devote my energies to ensuring that the NEH always has \n     funds sufficient to enable it to disseminate the \n     humanities to all sectors.\n\n\n                        RESEARCH AND FELLOWSHIPS\n\n       4. You bring distinguished academic credentials and \n     considerable experience to the NEH, what is your view of the \n     importance of scholarship in the humanities. How do you feel \n     these programs should balance other agency activities?\n       Answer: As a researcher, author, and teacher I believe \n     strongly that support for humanities scholarship is one of \n     the Endowment's most important activities. Serious \n     scholarship adds directly to our knowledge and understanding \n     of the humanities and forms the basis for public humanities \n     programming such as NEH-supported television documentaries \n     and museum exhibitions. Humanities scholarship also informs \n     and enriches classroom teaching.\n       The NEH's broad mandate to support the humanities requires \n     that it maintain a balance of different grant programs and \n     activities--including education, preservation, public \n     programming, research and scholarship, as well as challenge \n     grants and the Federal/State program areas. I am committed to \n     supporting the best grant proposals in all of the agency's \n     programs.\n       5. Over the past 20 years, the proportion of NEH \n     appropriations for scholarly activity has declined as a \n     percentage of the budget. Do you feel that this is \n     appropriate? Do you have any thoughts at this time about \n     programmatic priorities for the agency?\n       Answer: If I have the privilege of serving as the Chairman \n     of the NEH, I will carefully examine the agency's budget and \n     history to determine if scholarly activity is receiving an \n     appropriate level of support. As a professor and department \n     chairman who has worked in the humanities for over thirty \n     years, and as a recipient of an NEH fellowship which was \n     critical for my development as a scholar, I know that NEH is \n     often the sole source of funding for humanities scholarship. \n     NEH funding for individual fellowships and for large-scale \n     collaborative research projects remains a fundamental factor \n     in the growth and development of talented scholars and \n     teachers in the humanities.\n       6. NEH has been a key national resource for the collection \n     and editing of the papers of American presidents and other \n     important historical and literary figures. What priority \n     would you assign this type of project?\n       Answer: In my view NEH support for these projects \n     epitomizes the vital role the agency plays in creating \n     humanities resources for scholars, students, and citizens \n     alike. NEH's involvement in projects that are producing \n     scholarly editions is one of the agency's crowning glories. \n     These projects stand among the most important and long-\n     lasting contributions the NEH can make to the advancement of \n     the humanities and to the understanding of our past and \n     present. Providing adequate resources to these and other \n     excellent humanities projects will be one of my priorities \n     if the Senate honors me with confirmation as NEH Chairman.\n\n\n                           education programs\n\n       7. How do you feel that the agency can best support \n     humanities in the higher education community?\n       Answer: Higher education projects supported by the \n     Endowment--notably, the annual roster of summer seminars and \n     institutes for college and university teachers--have long-\n     term impact because they concentrate on helping humanities \n     instructors become better teachers. The beneficiaries of \n     these projects are the students who are reached by these \n     intellectually engaged teachers. I think that the agency can \n     best serve higher education by continuing to support model \n     projects like these that others can emulate. I understand \n     that the Endowment has also been quite active in recent years \n     in encouraging projects that make use of the Internet and \n     other electronic technologies to teach history, literature, \n     languages, and other humanities subjects. While I expect to \n     continue to encourage humanities projects that employ digital \n     technology, I plan also to consult with NEH staff and with \n     humanities educators to explore other ways the Endowment \n     might strengthen its work in higher education.\n       8. Do you think that NEH should strengthen teacher training \n     in the humanities in elementary schools?\n       Answer: Yes. The NEH already does this most effectively \n     through its Seminars and Institutes for School Teachers \n     program. These programs make school teachers students again \n     for a few weeks as they study a great range of significant \n     humanities topics, such as Milton's Paradise Lost, the \n     fiction of Willa Cather, the history and culture of the \n     American West or the Civil Rights Movement, the theater of \n     Antonio Buero Vallejo, Dante's Divine Comedy, American Indian \n     narratives, Mozart and his Vienna, cultural responses to the \n     Holocaust in America, and so on. These programs help teachers \n     renew and revitalize their understanding of specific areas of \n     the humanities and better communicate them to their students. \n     I think that it is critically important that American \n     elementary and secondary school children be taught by \n     instructors who are well-versed in the subjects they teach. \n     As someone who has helped design humanities programs for \n     schools, I understand that promoting the humanities in the \n     elementary grades, as well as in other grades, is of \n     paramount importance and worthy of an appropriate level of \n     NEH support.\n\n\n                       Federal/state partnerships\n\n       9. The state humanities councils receive an earmark of \n     about 30% of the agency's programmatic appropriations. This \n     partnership between the federal and state entities is an \n     effective tool to expand the reach of humanities programs and \n     relatively scarce financial resources. Do you feel that the \n     present distribution of programming funds is appropriate?\n       Answer: I enthusiastically support the state humanities \n     councils. They extend the reach of the NEH to a vast audience \n     through programs tailored to meet local needs, and they \n     strengthen the cultural and educational infrastructure \n     throughout America. These councils enrich the lives and \n     understanding not only of those who inhabit America's great \n     cities but also of those who live in the nation's many small \n     towns. I have followed the activities of the Indiana \n     Humanities Council for years and am impressed by its \n     creativity, reach, and impact. The Endowment and the state \n     councils are both very good at what they do; their efforts \n     complement one another. I would like to strengthen and expand \n     this historic partnership, which has fostered progress and \n     excellence in the humanities for the American people. The \n     state councils have my strong backing.\n       Because I do not know exactly what the funding needs of the \n     state councils are, I cannot give an informed answer to this \n     question until I have an opportunity to study in\n\n[[Page S9500]]\n\n     detail all the budget issues related to the agency's \n     programs.\n       10. Do you agree that state humanities councils should also \n     be eligible to compete for other programming funds?\n       Answer: The state humanities councils serve their audiences \n     well and I understand from NEH staff that in recent years \n     state councils have been eligible to compete for funding in \n     other programming areas of the NEH. This has, I am told, \n     resulted in support for a number of excellent projects. As \n     with the previous question on the state council's overall \n     budget, I cannot give an informed answer to this question \n     until I have had an opportunity to study this policy in \n     detail.\n       11. Do you see additional roles for the state humanities \n     councils in expanding the scope and reach of the Endowment's \n     programs?\n       Answer: If confirmed I look forward to conferring with \n     state council chairs and directors and the Endowment's staff \n     to see if the councils could be even more effective than they \n     are now in helping the NEH fulfill its mission. As I said \n     above, I am a strong supporter of the state humanities \n     councils and the excellent work they do.\n\n\n                      regional humanities centers\n\n       12. What priority will you place on the development of \n     Regional Humanities Centers?\n       Answer: I was an early supporter of the regional centers \n     idea when the project was in its embryonic stage. However, I \n     do not now know enough about how this initiative has \n     progressed to offer an informed opinion. If confirmed, I will \n     make a considered judgment about its priority.\n\n\n                               enterprise\n\n       13. Due to budget cuts and an interest in expanding the \n     reach of the agency's programs, NEH has placed increased \n     emphasis on raising private funds to support its own \n     activities and to supplement grants to other organizations. \n     Do you feel that the agency should actively pursue private \n     funds?\n       Answer: If given the honor and opportunity to serve as \n     Chairman of NEH my central task will be to make sure that the \n     funds Congress appropriates to the NEH are spent wisely and \n     in the service of our citizenry. I do not expect that the NEH \n     would engage often in activities that would require it to \n     raise monies in addition to its federal appropriation. Should \n     that occur I would make sure that such fund-raising is done \n     in a way that would not compete with NEH grantees and other \n     important cultural institutions that may also be looking to \n     the private sector support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/19/senate-section/article/S9500-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL T. MICHAEL MOSELEY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today to \nrecognize one of the finest officers in the United States Air Force, \nMajor General T. Michael ``Buzz'' Moseley. On August 3rd, General \nMoseley was promoted from his job as Director of the Air Force Office \nof Legislative Liaison to become the Commander, Ninth Air Force, Air \nCombat Command and Commander, United States Central Command Air Forces, \nUnited States Central Command. During his time in Washington, and \nespecially with regard to his work on Capitol Hill, General Moseley \npersonified the Air Force core values of integrity, selfless service \nand excellence in all things. Many Members and staff enjoyed the \nopportunity to meet with him on a variety of Air Force issues and came \nto appreciate his many talents. Today it is my privilege to recognize \nsome of Buzz's many accomplishments since he entered the military 29 \nyears ago, and to commend the superb service he provided the Air Force, \nthe Congress and our Nation.\n  Buzz Moseley entered the Air Force through the Reserve Officer \nTraining Corps program at Texas A While and ``Aggie'', he completed \nboth his bachelor's and master's degrees in political science. He \nearned his pilot wings in 1973 at Webb Air Force Base, Texas, and was \nthen assigned to stay on as a T-37 instructor pilot. From 1979 to 1983, \nhe flew the F-15 as an instructor pilot, flight lead and mission \ncommander, first at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, and then while \nserving overseas at Kadena Air Base, Japan. Over his career, General \nMoseley demonstrated his skill as an aviator in the T-37, T-38, AT-38 \nand F-15 aircraft, and logged over 2,800 hours of flying time.\n  From early in his career, General Moseley's exceptional leadership \nskills were always evident to both superiors and subordinates as he \nrepeatedly proved himself in numerous select command positions. He was \nthe Commander of the F-15 Division of the United States Air Force \nFighter Weapons School at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada and the \nCommander of the 33rd Operations Group at Eglin Air Force Base, \nFlorida. When stationed at Nellis Air Force Base a second time, he \ncommanded the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing. With 26 squadrons, consisting \nof A-10, B-1, B-52, F-15C/D, F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16C/D, HH-60G and \nthe RQ-1A Predator, it is the Air Force's largest, most diverse flying \nwing. The 57th also included the Air Force Weapons School, Red Flag, \nAir Force Aggressors, the Air Force Demonstration Squadron ``The \nThunderbirds'', the Air-Ground Operations School, Air Warrior, 66th \nRescue Squadron and the Predator unmanned aerial vehicle operations.\n  Buzz Moseley also excelled in a variety of key staff assignments. \nThese include serving as Deputy Director for Politico-Military Affairs \nfor Asia and Middle East on the Joint Staff; Chief of the Air Force \nGeneral Officer Matters Office; Chief of Staff of the Air Force Chair \nand Professor of Joint and Combined Warfare at the National War \nCollege; and Chief of the Tactical Fighter Branch, Tactical Forces \nDivision, Directorate of Plans. General Moseley also serves on the \nCouncil on Foreign Relations and has been named an Officer of the Ordre \nNational du Merite by the President of France.\n  During his service to the 106th and 107th Congress, General Moseley \nwas the Air Force liaison for critical readiness and modernization \nissues. He was a crucial voice for the Air Force in representing its \nmany programs on the Hill, providing clear, concise and timely \ninformation. General Moseley's leadership, professionalism, and \nexpertise enabled him to foster exceptional rapport between the Air \nForce and the Senate, impressing me with his ability to work with the \nCongress to address Air Force priorities.\n  We were all pleased to see that the President recently nominated \nGeneral Moseley for his third star. It is exceptionally well deserved. \nI offer my congratulations to him, his wife, Jennie, son, Greg and \ndaughter, Tricia. The Congress and the country applaud the selfless \ncommitment his entire family has made to the Nation in supporting his \nmilitary career.\n  I know I speak for all of my colleagues in expressing my heartfelt \nappreciation to General Moseley. He is a credit to both the Air Force \nand the United States. We wish our friend the best of luck in his new \ncommand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/19/senate-section/article/S9500-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9500-S9501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CHANGES TO THE 2002 APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLOCATION AND BUDGETARY \n                               AGGREGATES\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred January 4, \n1996 in Houston, TX. Fred Mangione, a 46-year-old gay man, was \nallegedly stabbed to death outside a gay bar. Two men, Daniel \nChristopher Bean, 19, and his half-brother Ronald Henry Cauthier, 21, \nmembers of a new-nazi organization, were charged with a first-degree \nfelony. Gauthier, 23, was sentenced to 10 years' probation for his part \nin the murder.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/19/senate-section/article/S9501-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9501-S9502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PETER MARUDAS\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, my longtime Chief of Staff, Peter \nMarudas, retired recently from public service. It has been both an \nhonor and privilege to work with Peter these many years. He has been \nnot only a superb member of my staff, but also among my closest and \ndearest friends. I consider myself, and the citizens of Maryland, \nfortunate to have benefited from his service, counsel, and commitment \nto the highest standards of conduct and ethics.\n  In addition to his many years of service in the United States Senate, \nPeter's illustrious career includes service for several other public \nofficials, including three former Baltimore City Mayors: Theodore \nMcKeldin, Thomas A. D'Alesandro III, and Kurt Schmoke. While working at \nthe highest levels, Peter has remained a down-to-earth, committed \npublic servant, known for his exuberant good humor and generosity.\n  The attached Baltimore Sun article of August 18, 2001, accurately \nreflects not only Peter's individual and unique personality, but also \nthe admiration and esteem in which he is held by all who are privileged \nto know him. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From The Baltimore Sun, Sept. 18, 2001]\n\n                           Hail and Farewell\n\n                          (By Carl Schoettler)\n\n       National television cameras catch Peter Marudas, Sen. Paul \n     S. Sarbanes' chief of staff, and Allan Greenspan, chairman of \n     the Federal Reserve, head to head in deep confab at a Senate \n     banking committee hearing about a year ago.\n       Marudas immediately starts getting calls: What did he tell \n     you? A hiccup from Greenspan can jump-start the stock market, \n     up or down.\n       Marudas laughs. He likes telling this story.\n       He and Greenspan were talking about jazz.\n       As a young man, Greenspan played clarinet, flute and a \n     little sax in New York jazz bands, including one led by \n     Leonard Garment, who became President Nixon's White House \n     counsel. Marudas is a lifelong and knowledgeable jazz fan.\n       A couple of months earlier, Marudas had asked him, ``Who do \n     you think is the best saxophone player?''\n       Greenspan replies, Ben Webster, a mainstay of the Duke \n     Ellington band.\n       ``That's really an aficionado,'' Marudas exclaims. ``You \n     got to know jazz to say that.''\n       So the next time Greenspan comes before the banking \n     committee, Marudas gives him a Ben Webster tape. And the two \n     are recorded for TV posterity talking about jazz, not G-8 \n     economics.\n       Bringing Greenspan the Webster tape exemplifies Pete \n     Marudas' style: kind, thoughtful, generous and politically \n     astute. For nearly 35 years, Marudas has brought his \n     particular, perhaps unique, political acumen to Baltimore, \n     Maryland and national politics. Now, he's bowing out.\n       The farewells began Wednesday as he celebrated his name day \n     at the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Annunciation. It was \n     the Feast of the Dormition, the Assumption in most Western \n     churches. Marudas' name in the church is Panagia, which is \n     roughly Greek for ``Our Lady,'' the Virgin Mary. He's a \n     devout Orthodox Christian and of course active in church \n     politics.\n       Thursday he celebrated his 64th birthday, basically working \n     in his Washington office, although well-wishers flooded the \n     Sarbanes switchboard with birthday wishes and goodbyes.\n       Friday was his last day at work and the end of his own \n     remarkable chapter in Maryland politics.\n       ``It's an existential decision,'' he says of his \n     retirement. ``We got the senator re-elected in the fall and \n     he's now a chairman, which is what we were working for all \n     the years. The Banking Committee, you can really do a lot \n     there, the predatory lending business, you know, and just the \n     integrity of the capital markets.''\n       He still had a portrait of Franklin Delano Roosevelt on his \n     office wall yesterday as he got ready to leave. ``I got \n     Truman, Roosevelt and Jefferson. And I have a labor union \n     organization picture from the C.I.O., `March with CIO to \n     Victory.' Well, we [See Marudas, 8d] owned this bar where all \n     these U.A.W. workers came in, when I grew up in Detroit,'' \n     he says.\n       As a kid, he spent his summers in Baltimore where his uncle \n     ran a dry-cleaning shop on Light Street in what is now \n     Federal Hill, and he had relatives who lived in Brooklyn. \n     Another uncle ran a restaurant in Curtis Bay.\n       ``The first political event I ever attended was in the 1952 \n     campaign,'' Marudas says. ``The Democratic candidates always \n     kicked off their campaign in Detroit on Labor Day.''\n       Adlai Stevenson was the presidential candidate.\n       ``My cousin and I got up real early, 5:30. Our mothers \n     packed our lunches. We took the bus down. We were right down \n     in front. Walter Reuther [the leader of the United Auto \n     Workers union] introduced Adlai Stevenson,'' Marudas recalls.\n       ``I was 15, my cousin was 12 or 13. It really made an \n     impression for me. Stevenson was a man of such dignity.''\n       As a college student at the University of Michigan, Ann \n     Arbor, Marudas attended a lecture by Reuther, who spoke on \n     labor economics.\n       ``He was a real force. He put the U.A.W. on the progressive \n     side of the political spectrum,'' Marudas is remembering. \n     ``You had people who came up from the South, white and black, \n     where down there they had nothing to do with each other. They \n     worked together as shop stewards. We saw all that going on. \n     It really was something.\n       ``You look at society: Wherever you have free trade unions, \n     they're one of the essentials of a free society.''\n\n\n                           new deal democrat\n\n       He says it twice during a couple of long conversations. He \n     remains an unreconstructed Roosevelt New Deal Democrat, with \n     perhaps overtones of Adlai Stevenson.\n       ``He's very strong democrat with a small `d','' Senator \n     Sarbanes says. ``He's a good Democrat with a big `D'. But \n     more importantly he's a democrat with a small `d'.\n       ``He doesn't have an ounce of meanness in him, at all,'' \n     Sarbanes says, with obvious fondness in his voice. They've \n     been personal friends longer than they've been political \n     colleagues. ``He's really very generous and respectful with \n     people. He really accords people their dignity.''\n       The two met when Marudas was covering City Hall for The \n     Evening Sun. Marudas had studied journalism and earned a \n     master's degree at Ann Arbor. He came to Baltimore to work on \n     The Evening Sun in 1963.\n       Sarbanes, who had been working for Walter Heller, the \n     chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under Presidents \n     Kennedy and Johnson, came back to Baltimore to become \n     executive director of a commission to revise the city's \n     charter.\n       Although Marudas grew up in Detroit and Sarbanes in Easton, \n     Marudas says their roots were in the same province in Greece, \n     Laconia, in Sparta.\n       ``Our villages are 15 or 20 miles apart,'' he says. ``We \n     got to know each other, became personal friends and then our \n     careers came together in `71.''\n       Sarbanes had been a congressman about nine months when \n     Marudas joined him in Washington.\n\n\n                          first political job\n\n       Somewhat paradoxically, Marudas' first political job was \n     for a Republican, Theodore Roosevelt McKeldin, who had been \n     governor of Maryland and was in his second term as mayor of \n     Baltimore. McKeldin was a liberal Rockefeller Republican of a \n     type virtually extinct in today's GOP.\n       One of McKeldin's aides was leaving and he called Marudas: \n     `` `The Governor'--we called McKeldin the Governor then--\n     would like you to take my place.\n       `` `Me!' I said. Then I thought he's got less than a year \n     to go. I went home and talked it over with my wife and my \n     mother-in-law.''\n       His wife, Irene, has been perhaps his closest advisor. \n     They've been married for 39 years.\n       ``I thought, Baltimore is the sixth largest city,'' he \n     continues. ``It will be a chance to get a look at the inside \n     of government and maybe come out again and pursue a career in \n     newspapering.''\n\n[[Page S9502]]\n\n       He worked for McKeldin for 10 or 11 months.\n       ``He was a quick learner,'' says Gene Raynor, the former \n     head of the state election board and an astute political \n     observer in his own right. ``He became a master of precinct \n     politics in the Byzantine world of politics in Baltimore City \n     in the mid-'60s. There were not many people around who \n     understood it as well as Pete Marudas. If I were a candidate \n     anywhere in this state I would seek out Pete for advice.\n       ``Paul is a kind of brainy guy, very, very smart, very, \n     very brainy,'' Raynor says. ``But he was in the clouds. \n     Marudas was right down to earth. They complemented each \n     other.''\n       Thirty years ago, a somewhat wistful McKeldin told an \n     interviewer. ``He [Marudas] was the best in history. If only \n     I had had him earlier in my career.''\n       The same reporter who quoted McKeldin said a half-hour \n     interview of Marudas stretched into a 90-minute discourse on \n     Baltimore, the nation, Greece and the Orioles.\n       Marudas has not changed much over the years. He's an \n     animated talker whose conversation moves by digression. His \n     conversation veers happily from local to national to \n     international politics like a bumper car in an amusement \n     park.\n       Today, you'd certainly have to add the Mideast and the \n     Balkans--and jazz.\n\n\n                            some tough years\n\n       Marudas stayed on with Thomas A. D'Alesandro III after \n     McKeldin left the mayor's office. They were tough years for \n     Baltimore and the nation.\n       ``I was thinking what I have been through and seen,'' \n     Marudas says. ``In the summer of '67, Newark and Detroit \n     exploded. We felt we got through that summer. In '68, we had \n     the assassinations. We had the urban disturbances. We had the \n     Catonsville Nine trial. We had the [George] Wallace campaign.\n       ``Then the war came in. Kent State, Johns Hopkins, they \n     lost control over there. We had to helicopter [Charles McC] \n     Mathias, then an anti-war member of the House of \n     Representatives, to speak to the students. We had all those \n     demonstrations. We didn't have what I'd call a normal year \n     until '71.''\n       That's when D'Alesandro decided not to run for a second \n     term and Marudas went to Washington to work for Sarbanes.\n       ``He brought one outstanding faculty as far as service to \n     me as mayor and I think maybe to Sarbanes as senator,'' \n     D'Alesandro says. ``He could sense sincerity or baloney.\n       ``He was almost like my alter ego. I sort of found in him \n     somebody who thought like I thought. And he sort of read me, \n     in the sense he knew the things I was interested in. He \n     encouraged me in some things and cautioned me in other \n     things.\n       ``And never had a hidden agenda. You knew you were getting \n     a real honest critique . . . And if we made a decision \n     against him he went along. He sang the song.\n       ``I don't ever remember his trying to take credit for \n     anything. Everything was for me as mayor and Sarbanes as \n     senator . . . I loved the guy.''\n       And Sarbanes tells roughly the same story.\n       ``When you draw advice and counsel from Peter,'' he says, \n     ``the bottom line is always do the right thing.''\n       He laughs.\n       ``If he thinks you're going in the wrong direction he'll \n     tell you in no uncertain terms. And he'll keep telling you if \n     you keep moving in that direction.''\n\n\n                           prized discretion\n\n       Marudas' discretion is also legendary, highly prized by his \n     bosses, but sometimes irritating to council members at City \n     Hall. He's the reigning master of obfuscation.\n       Former Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke remembers council members \n     complaining that they often did not understand what Marudas \n     had just said.\n       ``That was Peter being creatively enigmatic,'' Schmoke \n     says. ``That was his trademark.''\n       Marudas picks up his own narrative thread: ``I go over to \n     Washington, saying maybe we have all this stuff behind us and \n     in a couple of years we're into an impeachment. And Sarbanes \n     is on the Judiciary Committee and he offers the first article \n     of impeachment as a junior member.''\n       Perhaps inevitably he thinks the Nixon impeachment was \n     justified and Clinton's was not.\n       ``You don't impeach a president for a lack of personal \n     judgment,'' says Marudas, who read every single constituent \n     letter on the Clinton impeachment received in Sarbanes' \n     office. ``He has to have violated his constitutional oath. \n     Then you have to have really very strong constitutional \n     grounds, not some flimsy excuse.''\n       He returned to Baltimore again in 1987 for a stint as a \n     seasoned senior member of the administration of Schmoke.\n       ``I always wanted to work for someone younger than me,'' \n     Marudas says. ``My grandfather always said when you're young \n     learn from the old. When you're old learn from the young.\n       Schmoke actually had been an intern in Sarbanes' office in \n     the House of Representatives. He's as effusive in his praise \n     of Marudas as the other politicians.\n       ``If I were designing a course at a public policy school, \n     and including a description of the effective staff person,'' \n     says Schmoke, ``I'd model that person on Peter Marudas.''\n       Everybody asks if Marudas can actually leave politics \n     behind. Sarbanes expects to be able to call on his advice \n     when he needs it.\n       But right now Marudas plans to go to a wedding in Detroit \n     with his wife, Irene.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to honor and recognize an outstanding young lady, Brittany \nSanders, of Gladstone, MO, founder of Kristin's Kids Club. Ms. Sanders \nis truly extraordinary for having the commitment and vision to \nestablish a children's club in memory of her friend, Kristin Bean, who \ndied of cancer in 1996. This club's devotion to helping children is an \ninspiration to us all.\n  The Kristin's Kids Club was founded in 1999 in order to help children \nin need and to keep Kristin's spirit alive. Although the club was \nstarted by one extraordinary young girl, it now has more than 60 \nmembers. The club holds various fundraisers in order to raise money to \ngive to charities and other organizations.\n  Not only do the members of this club raise money to help children, \nbut they also help adults who are in need. They recently organized a \nvariety show to benefit the Gladstone VFW Post 10906 to be used for the \nClay County War Memorial fund. They also raised more than $2,000 to \nassist the victims of the September 11th terrorist attack.\n  I commend Brittany Sanders and the other members of Kristin's Kids \nClub for all of their efforts on behalf of Missouri's children. I thank \nthem for making me proud to be a Missourian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/19/senate-section/article/S9502-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/19/senate-section/article/S9502-4", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/19/senate-section/article/S9502-5", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9502-S9503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO IRAN--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 41\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following messages \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), section 204(c) of the International Emergency Economic \nPowers\n\n[[Page S9503]]\n\nAct, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), and section 505(c) of the International \nSecurity and Development Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-\n9(c), I transmit herewith a 6-month periodic report on the national \nemergency with respect to Iran that was declared in Executive Order \n12957 of March 15, 1995.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax relief for victims of the terrorist attacks against the United \nStates on September 11, 2001; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a bill I \nintroduced this morning. The first cosponsor of this measure is my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator John Warner of Virginia. The bill is the \nVictims of Terrorism Relief Act of 2001, which would modify current tax \npolicy to provide needed relief and compassion to the victims of the \nterrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.\n  As you well know--and all Americans know--on September 11, 2001, the \nworld was stunned by what may prove to be the most vile, most \nhorrifying act of hate and terror against a nation's people.\n  While many questions will remain unanswered in the weeks and months \nto come, what is immediately clear is that the conduct of war, as \npreviously waged by the enemies of the United States, has been suddenly \naltered. That conduct of war is so different than what we ever imagined \nas a civilized Nation. This new war does not differentiate between a \nmilitary and a civilian target. The enemies of liberty and democracy do \nnot distinguish between a trained soldier and an unarmed child. The \nFederal Government, and the Congress, have previously recognized, and \nrightfully so, the special circumstances of some of our citizens who \nvoluntarily serve their country in potentially dangerous regions \noutside of the United States.\n  Current law provides a reduction in the death tax liability of the \nestates of members of the Armed Forces who are killed while serving in \na combat zone or die as a result of injuries suffered while serving in \na combat zone.\n  In addition, current law provides an exemption from the Federal \nincome tax, on the income earned in the year of death, by Federal \nmilitary and civilian employees who die during, or as a result of, \ninjuries suffered in a military or terrorist attack outside of the \nUnited States.\n  These brave and honorable individuals put their lives on the line for \nour country. It is only right that we recognize their extraordinary \ndedication and their sacrifice.\n  Unfortunately, the advent of a new type of warfare means many \nprovisions in our Tax Code, which were designed to provide tax relief \nto Federal military and civilian employees killed in service to their \ncountry, are now inadequate in the face of new threats. These benefits \ndo not extend such relief to civilians who may be likewise killed in \nenemy attacks now indiscriminately aimed at civilian targets, as well \nas military installations.\n  As we recognize that our world and the rules of war, as the \nterrorists use them, have changed, we, too, must change the tax \nbenefits of those citizens and their families who are adversely \naffected.\n  To address these inadequacies in the current Tax Code, I introduced \nthe Victims of Terrorism Tax Relief Act of 2001 which would extend and \nexpand current law benefits to any individual who died as a result of \nthe terrorist attacks occurring on September 11, 2001.\n  Specifically, my legislation eliminates all Federal death taxes on \nthe estates of any individual killed during, or as a result of injuries \nderived from, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.\n  It exempts from Federal income tax, in the year of death, any income \nearned by any individual killed during, or who died as a result of \ninjuries resulting from, the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n  It ensures that all our citizens--law enforcement, firefighters, \nrescue and relief workers, nurses, doctors, anyone--are recognized for \ntheir heroism and their sacrifice.\n  On September 13, 2001, the House of Representatives unanimously \npassed H.R. 2884, demonstrating overwhelming bipartisan support for \nextending current law tax benefits to civilian victims of the September \n11, 2001, terrorist attacks. While I do not believe the legislation \nwent far enough, in that it does not provide for full relief from \nFederal death taxes, it takes a very strong stand, sending a message of \nunity from Washington.\n  This is a recognition that all of those who lost their lives, in a \nviolent act of war on the United States, on September 11, 2001, whether \nthey are military personnel, civilian personnel, rescue workers, \nfirefighters, police, nurses, citizens trying to help, citizens in \ntheir offices, children taking a plane trip, passengers on a plane, \npilots of planes, all of these individuals have left us a legacy. \nIndeed, it is an enduring legacy of purpose, a legacy of compassion, a \nlove of liberty, and a quest for justice.\n\n  We must honor all of those who lost their lives in this vile act of \nwar on the United States and never forget; for their memory has truly \nunified a very diverse nation and has made it an even stronger and more \nrespectful nation. We will honor and always remember them.\n  The U.S. Senate must rise to the occasion and stand in solidarity \nwith the House of Representatives. The Senate must promptly pass this \nimportant legislation. It matters to those victims and their families.\n  I have personally talked to many, too many, of those family members--\nbrothers, children, and wives--who have lost loved ones because of this \ndastardly terrorist attack. They are in a time of great grief. That \ngrief will continue until the day they pass from this earth and reunite \nwith their loved ones in heaven.\n  In this new war against the United States, the enemy is making all \nAmericans, whether they are military or civilian, young or old, \nparents, children or spouses, targets for their attacks.\n  In this effort, the Federal Government must adapt its death benefits \nto take into consideration this sad truth: that the traditional line \nbetween combatants and noncombatants is not always respected. I have \ntold those folks that their husband or their brother or their father is \na hero and that they were killed because they were here in America. \nThese grieving families need our assistance as much as do the families \nof our brave military personnel.\n  What they do not need in this time of mourning is the added worry of \nfilling out tax forms. It is going to be hard enough for them to get by \nemotionally, much less financially.\n  For the Senate to act promptly on this legislation, would be to send \na positive, reassuring message to these families: you are not going to \nhave to worry about any of these tax forms, or how to afford new taxes \nin a time of grief--you are not alone in this. We must let them know we \nappreciate them as the heroes they are. We will always remember them, \ntheir acts of martyrdom and heroism unifying this Nation like I have \nnever seen it unified in all of our history.\n  I hope my Senate colleagues, as they all start coming back after the \nholy days, will rise in applause, and help to ensure that our tax \nbenefit laws reflect the realities of the new war against civilians, \nallowing them the same sort of benefits that we provide for our brave \nmilitary personnel.\n\n[[Page S9507]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my legislation introduced \nearlier in the day be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1433\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the President to award posthumously the \nCongressional Gold Medal to the passengers and crew of Untied Airlines \nflight 93 in the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the United States \non September 11, 2001; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, today I have sought recognition to \nintroduce a bill to authorize the President to award posthumously the \nCongressional Gold Medal to the passengers and crew of United Airlines \nFlight 93 in the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the United States \non September 11, 2001. The bill which I am introducing would authorize \nthe posthumous award of a Congressional Gold Medal to each of the crew \nand passengers of United Airlines Flight 93, which took off from \nNewark, New Jersey, changed course over Ohio, and crashed in \nShanksville, PA, which is located in Somerset County.\n  On Friday, after the Senate had passed H.R. 2888, a resolution \nauthorizing the use of force and $40 billion for additional disaster \nassistance, both of which have been requested by the President, Senator \nSantorum and I flew by helicopter to Shanksville, PA, Somerset County, \nwhich is in southwestern Pennsylvania. There, we took a look at the \ncrash scene, participated in a prayer service, and talked to the \nrepresentatives of the FBI and the National Transportation Safety \nBoard, as well as our constituents and friends in the area.\n  At that time, we found absolute rubble. The plane had traveled at a \nspeed of approximately 450 miles an hour at a very low level as it \npassed by the Johnstown, PA airport, which is slightly to the north of \nthe ultimate crash scene. The plane hit the ground with an enormous \nimpact, leaving just traces, the debris of people, regrettably, and the \nplane itself.\n  In our conversations with the officials of the National \nTransportation Safety Board, Senator Santorum and I inquired into a \nrumor which had been circulating that the plane might have been shot \ndown. However, we were assured by the officials from the National \nTransportation Safety Board that such an event, in fact, had not \nhappened.\n  Notwithstanding the debris, the officials were able to piece together \nthe four corners of the plane. Had the plane been shot down, there \nwould have been some sign of it prior to the impact and prior to the \ncrash.\n  While we were at the scene, Senator Santorum and I announced our \nintention to seek the Congressional Gold Medal for the passengers and \ncrew of United Airlines Flight 93. I am introducing this legislation \ntoday and, since yesterday, a large number of cosponsors have already \nsigned on to the bill. Therefore, it is being introduced on behalf of \nSenator Harkin, Senator Boxer, Senator Bond, Senator Bunning, Senator \nBurns, Senator Cantwell, Senator Clinton, Senator Ensign, Senator \nHelms, Senator Landrieu, Senator Nelson of Florida, and Senator \nSchumer.\n  The medal has special significance for the Senate, the House of \nRepresentatives, and for the Capitol because all indications are that \nthe plane--and this is speculation, because we will never know for \ncertain--but, there are indications that the plane was headed for the \nU.S. Capitol. That statement was made by Vice President Chaney on \nSunday, September 16 on NBC's ``Meet The Press.'' It is speculation. I \nwant to clearly identify it as such because there is no way to be sure. \nBut the speculation is supported by the fact that the plane which hit \nthe Pentagon had been on a direct line to the White House and it veered \noff at the last moment. The fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, \nappeared to have been headed in a line that could have been to the \nWhite House, or even to Camp David, although it is unlikely to have \nbeen headed to Camp David since no one was there at the time. Most \nlikely, Flight 93 was headed to the Capitol, the symbol of our Nation.\n  Wherever the United States is symbolized around the world, it is the \nCapitol dome that represents the nation. The terrorists intended to \nstrike at us in every way possible: physically, psychologically, \nemotionally, and at the very Capitol.\n  So it is with a heavy heart, which is a sentiment shared by Americans \nall across he land and really, by most people across the globe, that I \nintroduce this bill denominated at the ``Honoring the Passengers and \nCrew of United Airlines Flight 93 Act.''\n  On September 11, 2001, United Airlines Flight 93 took off at 8:44 \na.m. from Newark, New Jersey, destined for San Francisco, California;\n\n[[Page S9508]]\n\n  The plane was hijacked by 4 terrorists shortly after it took off;\n  It is widely presumed that the terrorists who took control of United \nAirlines Flight 93 intended to use the aircraft as a weapon and crash \nit into the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.;\n  The passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93 learned from \ncellular phone conversations with their loved ones of the fate of the 3 \nother aircraft that were hijacked earlier that same day and used as \nweapons to murder thousands of innocent people and destroy American \nlandmarks;\n  The passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93, recognizing the \npotential danger that the aircraft they were aboard posed to large \nnumbers of innocent Americans, American institutions, and the symbols \nof American democracy, took heroic and noble action to ensure that the \naircraft they were aboard could not be used as a weapon:\n  The 44 people in all, 37 passengers and 7 crew of United Airlines \nFlight 93, in the ultimate act of selfless courage and supreme \nsacrifice, fought to recapture their flight from the terrorists; and\n  The struggle of the crew and passengers of United Airlines Flight 93 \nagainst the terrorists caused the Boeing 757 to crash down in a \nsparsely populated area near Shanksville, Pennsylvania at 10:10 a.m., \nSeptember 11, 2001, possibly saving countless lives in the Nation's \nCapital.\n  The President is authorized, on behalf of Congress, to award \nposthumously a gold medal of appropriate design to each of the United \nAirlines Flight 93 crew members: Lorraine G. Bay; Sandra W. Bradshaw; \nJason Dahl; Wanda A. Green; LeRoy Homer; CeeCee Lyles; and Deborah A. \nWelsh; and the United Airlines Flight 93 passengers: Christian Adams; \nTodd Beamer; Alan Beaven; Mark Bingham, who made a call to his mother; \nDeora Bodley; Marion Britton; Thomas E. Burnett, Jr.--who was one of \nthe individuals who had cellular phone contact--William Cashman; \nGeorgine Rose Corrigan; Joseph Deluca; Patrick Driscoll; Edward Felt; \nColleen Fraser; Andrew Garcia; Jeremy Glick--another one of the \npassengers who had contact with his wife, according to very detailed \nnewspaper accounts, with the determination by Mr. Glick, according to \nhis wife's report, that something would be done. Obviously, something \nwas done--Kristin Gould; Lauren Grandcolas; Donald F. Greene; Linda \nGronlund; Richard Guadagno; Toshiya Kuge; Hilda Marcin; Waleska \nMartinez; Nicole Miller; Louis J. Nacke; Donald Peterson; Mark \nRothenberg; Christine Snyder; John Talignani; Honor Wainio; and 3 \nadditional heroes whose families have requested that their names be \nwithheld.\n\n  The original thought Senator Santorum and I had was to make the \nrecommendation requesting the award of these medals only to the three \nindividuals who had been identified as having cellular phone contact. \nHowever, it is entirely likely that others were involved in the heroic \neffort to somehow storm the cockpit. What precisely happened during \nthat flight, we do not know. We may know more when the black box or the \nvoice recorder is located and investigated. There was a very heroic \naction to stop that plane from continuing on its flight--wherever it \nwas headed--presumably to the Capitol Building, causing it to crash and \ntake the lives of the 33 passengers, seven crew members, and foiling \nthe efforts of those four terrorists.\n  I send the bill to the desk and ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1434\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor to the Senator's bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 1436. A bill to authorize additional funding for Members of the \nSenate which may be used by a Member for mailings to provide notice of \ntown meetings; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce legislation which specifically authorizes funding for \nSenators to mail town meeting notices to their constituents. My \nlegislation authorizes $3 million each year for the next five years for \nMembers to spend on the mailing of town meeting notices in counties \nwith populations of less than 50,000.\n  Town meetings are the best way for Members to inform constituents \nabout\n\n[[Page S9509]]\n\nour actions in Washington, and town meeting notices are the most \neffective means we have of advising constituents about these events. \nUnfortunately, the budgets under which we operate today are very \nrestrictive and do not allow us to properly advise all of our \nconstituents when we will be holding a town meeting in their area. For \nPennsylvania alone, it would cost $735,000, one third of my entire \noffice budget, to circulate town meeting notices to each household in \nPennsylvania. For this reason, additional funding is necessary to allow \nMembers to send adequate notice to constituents of their visits \nthroughout their States. However, recognizing the fiscal constraints \nunder which we are currently operating, I have limited the scope of my \nlegislation to only counties with smaller populations.\n  Smaller, rural communities are not always effectively reached by the \nmass media, which are generally relied upon to deliver news of our \nlegislative activities. For example, if you take the northern tier of \nPennsylvania, or the southern tier, where residents do not necessarily \nget any of the major newspapers and are outside television range, \nunless you actually go to the county, it is very hard for Senators to \ncommunicate with their constituents about what they are doing in \nWashington. Town meetings are a valuable forum in which Members can \nshare details of our work and in turn hear directly from constituents \nconcerning their thoughts on a variety of topics. My legislation would \nensure that constituents in all parts of a Member's State are afforded \nthe opportunity to participate in this process.\n  I regularly visit all 67 counties in Pennsylvania and find it very \nrefreshing to get outside the beltway, to find out what people are \nthinking about in the more rural, remote parts of Pennsylvania. \nLikewise, my constituents also find it valuable to be able to receive \nnotice that Arlen Specter is coming to town, to listen to a short \nspeech, and spend the majority of meeting time participating in a \nquestion and answer session. That way you have participatory democracy.\n  In July 2001, during Senate floor consideration of the Fiscal Year \n2002 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, Subcommittee Chairman \nDurbin and Ranking Minority Member Bennett accepted my amendment which \nprovides $3 million for the mailing of town meeting notices, subject to \nauthorizing legislation. Today I am introducing this authorizing \nlegislation, and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting its timely \npassage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1437. A bill to clarify the applicable standards of professional \nconduct for attorneys for the Government, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have spoken many times over the past two \nyears of the problems caused by the so-called McDade law, 28 U.S.C. \n530B, which was slipped into the omnibus appropriations bill at the end \nof the 105th Congress. The McDade law has delayed important criminal \ninvestigations, prevented the use of effective and traditionally-\naccepted investigative techniques, and served as the basis of \nlitigation to interfere with legitimate Federal prosecutions. At a time \nwhen we need Federal law enforcement authorities to move quickly to \ncatch those responsible for last week's terrorist attacks, and to \nprevent further attacks on our country, we can no longer tolerate the \ndrag on Federal investigations and prosecutions caused by this ill-\nconsidered legislation.\n  The bill that I am introducing today, along with Senators Hatch and \nWyden, will modify the McDade law by establishing a set of rules that \nclarify the professional standards applicable to government attorneys. \nI introduced similar legislation in the last Congress, but was unable \nto get it before the Judiciary Committee for consideration. Since then, \nI have continued to work closely with the Justice Department and the \nFBI to monitor the problems caused by the McDade law and to refine this \ncorrective legislation. I hope Congress will make it a top priority as \nit considers ways to improve Federal law enforcement and combat \nterrorism.\n  By way of background, controversy surrounding the application of \nState ethics rules to Federal prosecutors began over a decade ago, when \na Federal appellate court held in United States v. Hammad, that a \ndisciplinary rule prohibiting lawyers from communicating with persons \nthey knew to be represented applied in the investigatory stages of a \nFederal criminal prosecution. The court also noted that suppression of \nevidence was an appropriate remedy for a prosecutor's breach of an \nethical rule.\n  The Department of Justice responded to the Hammad opinion with what \nbecame known as the Thornburgh Memorandum. Issued on June 8, 1989, the \nMemorandum asserted that ``contact with a represented individual in the \ncourse of authorized law enforcement activity does not violate'' the \nABA's model ``no contact'' rule. The Memorandum concluded, ``The \nDepartment will resist, on Supremacy Clause grounds, local attempts to \ncurb legitimate Federal law enforcement techniques.''\n  The Federal courts responded negatively to the Department's position. \nIn general, the Department was unable to persuade the courts of the \nefficacy of the Attorney General's policy statement.\n  Amid mounting criticism of the Thornburgh Memorandum, Attorney \nGeneral Reno issued regulations in 1994 governing all Justice \nDepartment litigators in their communications with persons represented \nby counsel. These regulations allowed contacts with represented persons \nin certain circumstances, even if such contacts were at odds with State \nor local Federal court ethics rules. State disciplinary authorities \ncould sanction a government attorney for willful violation of the \nregulations, but only upon a finding by the Attorney General that a \nwillful violation had occurred.\n  The Department's new regulations shared the fundamental defect of the \nThornburgh Memorandum, regulation of Federal prosecutors by the Justice \nDepartment instead of by the courts, without valid statutory authority. \nNot surprisingly, the only court to consider these regulations found \nthem to be invalid.\n  On May 1, 1996, Representative Joseph McDade introduced legislation \nthat sought to resolve the controversy over the Justice Department's \nclaimed authority to write its own ethics rules. In essence, H.R. 3386 \nprovided that Federal prosecutors were governed by the ethics rules \nthat apply to lawyers generally. A hearing on the bill was held on \nSeptember 12, 1996, before the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual \nProperty, but no further action was taken.\n  On March 5, 1998, Representative McDade introduced H.R. 3396, a \nmodified version of H.R. 3386. Although the House Judiciary Committee \ndid not hold hearings or act on the bill, language similar to H.R. 3396 \nwas included in the House-passed Commerce-Justice-State appropriations \nbill for FY1999. Thereafter, without the benefit of any hearings or \ndebate in the Senate, and over the objection of a bipartisan majority \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee, the same language was enacted as \nTitle VIII of the final omnibus bill, with a six-month delayed \neffective date.\n  At a hearing before a Judiciary Subcommittee on March 24, 1999, a \nnumber of law enforcement officials lined up to criticize the new law. \nIn particular, they argued that its vague directive to comply with \nrules in each State where the attorney engages in his or her duties \nleaves prosecutors unsure about what rule applies to particular \nconduct. The one certain result of this confusion: Attorneys would \nrefrain from taking critically important investigative steps or would \nleave law enforcement officers to make their own decisions about whom \nand how to investigate.\n  The McDade law went into effect on April 19, 1999. Since then, all of \nlaw enforcement's concerns about the McDade law have come to pass.\n  In floor statements on May 25 and September 14, 2000, I described \nsome of the devastating effects that the McDade law is having on \nFederal law enforcement efforts across the country. You will recall \nsome of the disturbing facts I described:\n  In Oregon, Federal prosecutors will no longer authorize undercover \noperations, and the FBI was forced to shut down its Innocent Images \ninitiative, which targets child pornography and exploitation.\n\n[[Page S9510]]\n\n  In California, a grand jury investigation into an airline's safety \nand maintenance practices was stalled for many months because of the \nMcDade law's interplay with that State's ethics rules. After about a \nyear of investigation, one of the airline's planes crashed, after \nexperiencing mechanical problems on the first leg of its trip.\n  In another State, the FBI was stymied in a child murder investigation \nbecause of a State Bar ethics rule that went far beyond what is \nrequired by established Supreme Court and Federal appellate case law.\n  There are other recent examples. In one case, the FBI has had to \nclose an investigation into allegations of fraud committed by the \nofficials of a city with regard to FEMA disaster funds after the city's \nattorney invoked the McDade law to prohibit FBI agents from \ninterviewing any city employees. In another case, counsel for an \naviation company has used the McDade law to prevent the FBI from \nworking with company employees who are willing to provide information \nand evidence concerning allegations that the company has been selling \ndefective aircraft engine parts to military and civilian airlines.\n  Of more immediate urgency, the McDade law seriously threatens to \nimpede the terrorism investigation into the events of September 11, \n2001. In this widespread, international investigation, the McDade law \nwill subject Justice Department attorneys to multiple and different \nattorney conduct rules, either because the attorneys working on or \nsupervising the investigation are admitted to practice in more than one \nstate, or because they are seeking assistance through court processes, \nsearch warrants; material witness warrants; criminal complaints; and \ngrand jury subpoenas, in more than one Federal district court, each of \nwhich adopts its own set of attorney conduct rules. How are Justice \nDepartment attorneys meant to resolve conflicts in those rules in a \nmanner that is reliable without unduly delaying this critical \ninvestigation?\n  There can no longer be any serious doubt about the need for \ncorrective legislation. We cannot afford to wait until the McDade law \nimpedes the investigation into last Tuesday's attacks before taking \naction.\n  Supporters of the McDade law have argued that Federal prosecutors are \nno worse off than their State counterparts, who have long been subject \nto State ethics rules. This is simply not the case. State prosecutors \npractice almost entirely before the courts of the State in which they \nare licensed: they do not practice in Federal court. Thus, they are \nsubject to only one set of ethics rules, the rules applied by the \ncourts before which they appear and the rules of the State in which \nthey are licensed are one and the same. This is not true for Federal \nprosecutors, who are licensed by a State but practice in Federal courts \nand must comport with local Federal court ethics rules. Thus, Federal \nprosecutors are generally subject to at least two sets of potentially \nconflicting ethics rules.\n  Additionally, Federal prosecutors frequently work across State lines. \nThis is not true of State prosecutors, whose work is generally confined \nto a single State. Under the McDade law, Federal prosecutors must \ncomport with the State ethics rules of each State where they engage in \ntheir duties, which may be different than the rules of either the \nlicensing State or the local Federal court. This means that Federal \nprosecutors may be subject to three or more sets of ethics rules with \nrespect to the same conduct, including two or more sets of State ethics \nrules that do not take into consideration the special needs and \ninterests of the United States in investigating and prosecuting \nviolations of Federal law.\n  In any event, even assuming that State Bar rules are causing serious \nproblems for State prosecutors as well as Federal prosecutors, that is \na matter for the States, not for Congress. Our responsibility is to \nensure the effective enforcement of the Federal criminal laws, and that \nis what my legislation seeks to accomplish.\n  The Professional Standards for Government Attorneys Act adheres to \nthe basic premise of the McDade law: The Department of Justice does not \nhave the authority it has long claimed to write its own ethics rules. \nThis legislation establishes that the Department may not unilaterally \nexempt Federal trial lawyers from the standards of professional \nresponsibility adopted by the Federal courts. Federal courts are the \nmore appropriate body to establish such standards for Federal \nprosecutors, not only because Federal courts have traditional authority \nto establish such standards for lawyers generally, but because the \nDepartment lacks the requisite objectivity.\n  The first part of this bill embodies the traditional understanding \nthat when lawyers handle cases before a Federal court, they should be \nsubject to the Federal court's standards of professional \nresponsibility, and not to the possibly inconsistent standards of other \njurisdictions. By incorporating this ordinary choice-of-law principle, \nthe bill preserves the Federal courts' traditional authority to oversee \nthe professional conduct of Federal trial lawyers, including Federal \nprosecutors. It thus avoids the uncertainties presented by the McDade \nlaw, which potentially subjects Federal prosecutors to State laws, \nrules of criminal procedure, and judicial decisions which differ from \nexisting Federal law.\n  Another part of the bill specifically addresses the situation in \nOregon, where a state court ruling has seriously impeded the ability of \nFederal agents to engage in undercover operations and other covert \nactivities. Such activities are legitimate and essential crimefighting \ntools. The Professional Standards for Government Attorneys Act ensures \nthat these tools will be available to combat terrorism.\n  Finally, the bill addresses the most pressing contemporary question \nof government attorney ethics, namely, the question of which rule \nshould govern government attorneys' communications with represented \npersons. It asks the Judicial Conference of the United States to submit \nto the Supreme Court a proposed uniform national rule to govern this \narea of professional conduct, and to study the need for additional \nnational rules to govern other areas in which the proliferation of \nlocal rules may interfere with effective Federal law enforcement. The \nRules Enabling Act process is the ideal one for developing such rules, \nboth because the Federal judiciary traditionally is responsible for \noverseeing the conduct of lawyers in Federal court proceedings, and \nbecause this process would best provide the Supreme Court an \nopportunity fully to consider and objectively to weigh all relevant \nconsiderations.\n  The problems posed to Federal law enforcement investigations and \nprosecutions by the McDade law are real and urgent. The Professional \nStandards for Government Attorneys Act provides a reasonable and \nmeasured alternative: It preserves the traditional role of the State \ncourts in regulating the conduct of attorneys licensed to practice \nbefore them, while ensuring that Federal prosecutors and law \nenforcement agents will be able to use traditional Federal \ninvestigative techniques. I urge Congress to move quickly to pass this \ncorrective legislation before more cases are compromised.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1437\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Amendments to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 530B\n\n       The first part of the bill supersedes the McDade law with a \n     new 28 U.S.C. Sec. 530B, consisting of six subsections:\n       Subsection (a) codifies the definition of ``government \n     attorney,'' by reference to the current Department of Justice \n     regulations.\n       Subsection (b) establishes clear choice-of-law rules for \n     government attorneys with respect to standards of \n     professional responsibility, modeled on Rule 8.5(b) of the \n     ABA's Model Rules of Professional Conduct. These choice-of-\n     law rules apply only with respect to government attorney \n     conduct that is related to the attorney's work for the \n     government. Under these rules, an attorney who is handling a \n     case in court would be subject to the professional standards \n     established by the rules and decisions of that court; an \n     attorney who is engaged in conduct reasonably intended to \n     lead to a proceeding in court, such as conduct in connection \n     with a grand jury or civil investigation, would be subject to \n     the professional standards of the court in which the \n     proceeding is intended to be brought; in other circumstances, \n     where no court has clear supervisory authority over \n     particular conduct, an attorney would be subject to the \n     professional standards established by rules and decisions of \n     the United States District Court for the judicial district in \n     which the attorney principally performs his official duties. \n     In the event that the Supreme Court promulgates one or more \n     uniform national rules governing the professional conduct of \n     government attorneys practicing before the Federal courts, \n     the terms of the uniform national rule would apply.\n       Subsection (c) clarifies the law regarding the licensing of \n     government attorneys, an issue that is currently addressed \n     through the appropriations process. Since 1979, \n     appropriations bills for the Department of Justice have \n     incorporated by reference section 3(a) of Pub. L. 96-132, \n     which states: ``None of the sums authorized to be \n     appropriated by this Act may be used to pay the compensation \n     of any person employed after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act as an attorney (except foreign counsel employed in \n     special cases) unless such person shall be duly licensed and \n     authorized to practice as an attorney under the laws of a \n     State, territory, or the District of Columbia.'' Subsection \n     (c) codifies this longstanding requirement, and also makes \n     clear that government attorneys need not be licensed under \n     the laws of any state in particular. The clarification is \n     necessary to ensure that local rules regarding state \n     licensure are not applied to federal prosecutors. Cf. United \n     States v. Straub, No. 5:99 Cr. 10 (N.D. W. Va. June 14, 1999) \n     (granting defense motion to disqualify the Assistant United \n     States Attorney because he was not licensed to practice in \n     West Virginia).\n       Subsection (d) specifically addresses the situation in \n     Oregon, where a state court ruling has seriously impeded the \n     ability of Federal agents to engage in undercover operations \n     and other covert activities. See In re Gatti, 330 Or. 517 \n     (2000). This subsection ensures that these traditional law \n     enforcement tools will be available to federal prosecutors \n     and agents.\n       Subsection (e) makes clear that violations of professional \n     conduct rules by government attorneys shall not be construed \n     to permit the exclusion of otherwise admissible evidence in \n     any Federal criminal proceeding.\n       Subsection (f), like the McDade law, authorizes the \n     Attorney General to make and amend rules to assure compliance \n     with section 530B.\n\n\n           II. Judicial Conference Report and Recommendations\n\n       The second part of the bill directs the Judicial Conference \n     of the United States to prepare two reports regarding the \n     regulation of government attorney conduct. Both reports would \n     contain recommendations with respect to the advisability of \n     uniform national rules.\n       The first report would address the issue of contacts with \n     represented persons, which has generated the most serious \n     controversy regarding the professional conduct of government \n     attorneys. See, e.g., State v. Miller, 600 N.W.2d 457 (Minn. \n     1999); United States v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 132 F.3d \n     1252 (8th Cir. 1998); United States v. Lopez, 4 F.3d 1455 \n     (9th Cir. 1993); United States v. Hammad, 858 F.2d 834 (2d \n     Cir. 1988).\n       Rule 4.2 of the ABA's Model Rules of Professional Conduct \n     and analogous rules adopted by state courts and bar \n     associations place strict limits on when a lawyer may \n     communicate with a person he knows to be represented by \n     another lawyer. These ``no contact'' rules preserve fairness \n     in the adversarial system and the integrity of the attorney-\n     client relationship by protecting parties, potential parties \n     and witnesses from lawyers who would exploit the disparity in \n     legal skill between attorneys and lay people and damage the \n     position of the represented person. Courts have given a wide \n     variety of interpretations to these rules, however, creating \n     uncertainty and confusion as to how they apply in criminal \n     cases and to government attorneys. For example, courts have \n     disagreed about whether these rules apply to Federal \n     prosecutor contacts with represented persons in non-custodial \n     pre-indictment situations, in custodial pre-indictment \n     situations, and in post-indictment situations involving the \n     same or different matters underlying the charges.\n       Lawyers who practice in federal court--and federal \n     prosecutors in particular--have a legitimate interest in \n     being governed by a single set of professional standards \n     relating to\n\n[[Page S9512]]\n\n     frequently recurring questions of professional conduct. \n     Further, any rule governing federal prosecutors' \n     communications with represented persons should be respectful \n     of legitimate law enforcement interest as well as the \n     legitimate interests of the represented individuals. Absent \n     clear authority to engage in communications with represented \n     persons, when necessary and under limited circumstances \n     carefully circumscribed by law, the government is \n     significantly hampered in its ability to detect and prosecute \n     Federal offenses.\n       The proposed legislation charges the Judicial Conference \n     with developing a uniform national rule governing government \n     attorney contacts with represented persons. Given the \n     advanced stage of dialogue among the interested parties, the \n     Department of Justice, the ABA, the Federal and State courts, \n     and others, the Committee is confident that a satisfactory \n     rule can be developed within the one-year time frame \n     established by the bill.\n       While the ``no contact'' rule poses the most serious \n     challenge to effective law enforcement, other rules of \n     professional responsibility may also threaten to interfere \n     with legitimate investigations. The proposed legislation \n     therefore directs the Judicial Conference to prepare a second \n     report addressing broader questions regarding the regulation \n     of government attorney conduct. This report, to be completed \n     within two years, would review any areas of conflict or \n     potential conflict between federal law enforcement techniques \n     and existing standards of professional responsibility, and \n     make recommendations concerning the need for additional \n     national rules.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to bring to the Senate's attention a \nserious legal matter currently impeding Federal criminal investigations \nin many States, especially Oregon, and legislation that I am joining \nthe Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, in introducing \ntoday to correct this problem.\n  Enacted at the end of the 105th Congress as Section 801 of the \nOmnibus Appropriations Bill (Public Law 105-277), the Citizens \nProtection Act, commonly known as the ``McDade law,'' has hampered \nFederal law enforcement efforts aimed at combating child pornography, \ndrug trafficking, and terrorism, particularly in the State of Oregon.\n  In the Gatti case [Gatti, 330 Or. 517 (2000)] in early 2000, the \nOregon Supreme Court held that a private attorney had acted unethically \nby intentionally misrepresenting his identity to the employees of a \nmedical records review company called Comprehensive Medical Review, \nCMR. The attorney, who represented a client who had filed a claim with \nan insurance company, believed that the insurance company was using CMR \nto generate fraudulent medical reports that the insurer then used to \ndeny or limit claims. The attorney called CMR and falsely represented \nhimself to be a chiropractor seeking employment with the company. The \nattorney was hoping to obtain information from CMR that he could use in \na subsequent lawsuit against CMR and the insurance company.\n  The Oregon Supreme Court upheld the State Bar's view that the \nattorney's conduct violated two Oregon State Bar disciplinary rules and \nan Oregon statute, specifically, a disciplinary rule prohibiting \nconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; a \ndisciplinary rule prohibiting knowingly making a false statement of law \nor fact; and a statute prohibiting willful deceit or misconduct in the \nlegal profession. In doing so, the court rejected the attorney's \ndefense that his misrepresentations were justifiable because he was \nengaged in an investigation to seek evidence of fraud and other \nwrongful conduct. The court expressly ruled that there was no \n`prosecutorial exception' to either the State Bar disciplinary rules or \nthe Oregon statute. As a result of this decision, prosecutors in Oregon \nmay not concur or participate in undercover and other covert law \nenforcement techniques, even if the law enforcement technique at issue \nis lawful under Federal law.\n  Soon after this Oregon Supreme Court decision, the Oregon U.S. \nAttorney's Office informed the Oregon FBI Field Office that it would \nnot concur or participate in the use of long-used and highly productive \ntechniques, such as undercover operations and consensual monitoring of \ntelephone calls, that could be disallowed by the State Bar. Several \nimportant investigations were immediately terminated or severely \nimpeded. The Oregon U.S. Attorney even refused to certify the renewal \nof the Portland Innocent Images undercover program, which targets child \npornography and exploitation. Without the U.S. Attorney's \ncertification, the program was shut down and a significant criminal \nproblem has since gone unchecked.\n  The Federal Investigation Enhancement Act that I am introducing today \nwith Senator Leahy will clarify that Federal attorneys may, for the \npurpose of enforcing Federal law, authorize, concur, direct, and \nsupervise covert investigations even though such activities may require \nthe use of deceit or misrepresentation. In doing so, our legislation \nwill make it possible for Federal authorities to continue their efforts \nto investigate and apprehend the most dangerous criminals.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will act quickly on this legislation \nthat will correct the most serious problems caused by the McDade law. \nIt will be of enormous help to Federal law enforcement efforts in \nOregon and across our country who are prosecuting these crimes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 1440. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax relief for victims of the terrorist attacks against the United \nStates on September 11, 2001; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Victims of \nTerrorism Relief Act of 2001, to provide tax relief for the innocent \nvictims of the terrorist attacks against our Nation last Tuesday, \nSeptember 11.\n  Last week's attack was unlike any event in our Nation's history. It \nwas an act of war committed on U.S. soil, and more, with innocent \ncivilians cold-bloodedly selected as the principal targets and even \nstrapped to the weapons. I am confident that, under the leadership of \nour Commander-in-Chief, and with broad and deep support, across our \ncountry and, on a bipartisan basis, here in Congress, we will win this \nwar decisively.\n  A significant part of our response also must be compassion for the \nsurvivors of those victims of the first day of this war. Our tax code \nhas long recognized that compassion demands we extend a helping hand by \nproviding relief to our military heroes killed in combat. Today, sadly, \nwe recognize the need to extend similar comfort and relief to the \nfamilies of civilian victims whose lives have been taken.\n  The other body has already passed emergency legislation along these \nlines. The bill I am introducing is identical to that legislation. The \nmain provisions of this bill would extend the same relief to \nindividuals killed in last week's terrorist attack as is currently \nprovided for members of our armed forces, with regard to the death tax, \nand currently provided for Federal military and civilian employees, \nwith regard to Federal income taxes.\n  I fully realize that my Senate colleagues, including knowledgeable \nmembers of the Senate Finance Committee, will propose additional tax \nrelief provisions to meet additional needs that are still being \nidentified. But I want to add my voice, early and urgently, to \nemphasize the importance of acting swiftly and decisively to provide \nthis relief to our fellow Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord, as well as a brief summary of its provisions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1440\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Victims of Terrorism Relief \n     Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INCOME TAXES OF VICTIMS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 692 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to income taxes of members of Armed Forces \n     on death) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(d) Certain Individuals Dying as a Result of September \n     11, 2001, Terrorist Attacks.--\n       ``(1) In general.--In the case of any individual who dies \n     as a result of wounds or injury incurred as a result of the \n     terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, \n     2001, any tax imposed by this subtitle shall not apply--\n       ``(A) with respect to the taxable year in which falls the \n     date of such individual's death, and\n       ``(B) with respect to any prior taxable year in the period \n     beginning with the last taxable\n\n[[Page S9513]]\n\n     year ending before the taxable year in which the wounds or \n     injury were incurred.\n       ``(2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an \n     individual whom the Secretary determines was a perpetrator of \n     any such terrorist attack.''.\n       (b) Conforming and Clerical Amendments.--\n       (1) The heading of section 692 of such Code is amended to \n     read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 692.

RELIEF FROM ADDITIONAL ESTATE TAX.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 2201 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence by inserting ``(a) In General.--\n     '' before ``The additional estate tax'', and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Victims of Certain Terrorist Attacks.--The additional \n     estate tax shall not apply to the transfer of the taxable \n     estate of any individual who dies as a result of wounds or \n     injury incurred as a result of the terrorist attacks against \n     the United States on September 11, 2001. The preceding \n     sentence shall not apply with respect to any individual whom \n     the Secretary determines was a perpetrator of any such \n     terrorist attack.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendments.--\n       (1) The heading of section 2201 of such Code is amended to \n     read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 2201. COMBAT ZONE-RELATED DEATHS OF MEMBERS OF THE \n                   ARMED FORCES AND DEATHS OF VICTIMS OF CERTAIN \n                   TERRORIST ATTACKS.''.\n\n       (2) The item relating to section 2201 in the table of \n     sections for subchapter C of chapter 11 of such Code is \n     amended to read as follows:\n\n``Sec. 2201.

The provision reduces estate tax \n     liability by more than half.\n       The bill would extend this estate tax treatment to \n     individuals who were killed as a result of the September 11 \n     terrorist attack or who dies as a result of injuries suffered \n     from that attack.\n       Income Tax Relief.--Section 692(c) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code currently exempts Federal military and civilian \n     employees from paying Federal income taxes in the year of \n     their death if they die during (or as a result of injuries \n     suffered in) a military or terrorist act outside of the \n     United States.\n       The bill would extend this Federal income tax relief to \n     individuals who died as a result of the September 11 \n     terrorist attack or who die from injuries suffered as a \n     result of that attack.\n       Relief for Airline Payments to Passengers.--The bill would \n     clarify that the $25,000 per passenger payments made by \n     United Airline will be exempt from Federal income taxes, if \n     such a clarification is needed. Any similar payments made by \n     American Airlines would receive similar treatment.\n       Exempt FEMA Assistance Payments from Tax.--The bill would \n     ensure that FEMA assistance payments are exempt from federal \n     income tax.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/19/senate-section/article/S9513-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9513-S9514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 66--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \n  THAT THE PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER MEDAL OF VALOR SHOULD BE AWARDED TO \n PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY IN THE AFTERMATH OF \n              THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n  Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Carper, and Mr. Lieberman) submitted \nthe following concurrent resolution, which was ordered held at the \ndesk.\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 66\n\n       Whereas the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Act of \n     2001 (Public Law 107-12, 115 Stat. 20)--\n       (A) allows the President to award, and present in the name \n     of Congress, a Medal of Valor to a public safety officer \n     cited by the Attorney General of the United States, upon the \n     recommendation of the Medal of Valor Review Board, for \n     extraordinary valor above and beyond the call of duty; and\n       (B) provides that the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor \n     shall be the highest national award for valor by a public \n     safety officer;\n       Whereas on September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked and \n     destroyed 4 civilian aircraft, crashing 2 of the planes into \n     the towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, and a \n     third into the Pentagon in suburban Washington, DC;\n       Whereas thousands of innocent Americans were killed or \n     injured as a result of these attacks, including rescue \n     workers, police officers, and firefighters at the World Trade \n     Center and at the Pentagon;\n       Whereas these attacks destroyed both towers of the World \n     Trade Center, as well as adjacent buildings, and seriously \n     damaged the Pentagon;\n       Whereas police officers, firefighters, public safety \n     officers, and medical response crews were thrown into \n     extraordinarily dangerous situations, responding to these \n     horrendous events and acting heroically, without concern for \n     their own safety, trying to help and to save as many of the \n     lives of others as possible in the impact zones, in spite of \n     the clear danger to their own lives; and\n       Whereas these attacks were by far the deadliest terrorist \n     attacks ever launched against the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) because of the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the \n     limit on the number of Public Safety Officer Medals of Valor \n     should be waived, and a medal should be awarded under the \n     Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Act of 2001 to any \n     public safety officer, as defined in that Act, who was killed \n     in the line of duty; and\n       (2) the Medal of Valor Review Board should give strong \n     consideration to the acts of bravery by other public safety \n     officers in responding to these events.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, yesterday Senator Inouye and I went to \nNew York City to visit the disaster area. It was an experience I shall \nnever forget. We had the cooperation of the New York National Guard, \nwhich flew us in a helicopter over the area of the World Trade Center, \nand then met Mayor Giuliani on the ground and visited the disaster \nscene.\n  Today, I have come to this Chamber to introduce a Senate concurrent \nresolution. This resolution would express the sense of the Congress \nthat the Public Safety Officers Medal of Valor should be awarded to \npublic safety officers killed in the line of duty in the aftermath of \nthe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n  It is with a sad heart that I introduce this resolution, for once \nagain America has seen some of our finest go into harm's way to help \nthose they are sworn to protect and serve. Many of these firefighters, \npolice officers, and public safety officers gave their lives. They made \nthe ultimate sacrifice for our country in the service of their fellow \nAmericans.\n  Without regard for their own safety, firefighters, police officers, \nport authority officers, rescue personnel, and others rushed into the \nWorld Trade Center and the Pentagon to help in the rescue of workers in \nthose buildings. Senator Inouye and I visited the Pentagon the day \nbefore yesterday to view that site.\n  Many of these people gave their lives in helping those they sought to \nrescue. The truly heroic response of our public servants to these \nhorrible and evil attacks on America and Americans should not go \nunnoticed, and we all know the acts will not go unpunished.\n  The Public Service Medal of Valor was created to recognize public \nsafety officers who act with extraordinary valor above and beyond the \ncall of duty and to recognize the protective service that goes often \nunnoticed in our daily lives.\n  In 1998, in the U.S. Capitol, Senators, Congressmen, tourists, and \nstaff were reminded of the tremendous sacrifices that officers make \nevery day when Officers Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson gave their lives \ndefending the peace and defending our lives here in the Nation's \nCapitol.\n  Shortly after that tragic event, I introduced the Senate version of \nthe Medal of Valor Act. The law allows for five medals to be awarded a \nyear, but I believe it is important to recognize all those who lost \ntheir lives on September 11, 2001, in the horrendous attacks in New \nYork City and the Pentagon. They deserve consideration under this law.\n\n[[Page S9514]]\n\n  When President Bush signed the Public Safety Medal of Valor Act into \nlaw on May 30 of this year, 28 of our colleagues were cosponsors of the \nSenate version.\n  It is my hope that they and others in the Senate will join in \nrecognizing the heroic acts of all our public safety officers killed in \nthe line of duty in the aftermath of these terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11 of this year by cosponsoring this resolution and helping \nto get it passed.\n  I ask the concurrent resolution remain at the desk so those who wish \nto cosponsor can do so through tomorrow.\n  Is that request in order, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is advised that doing so may delay \nreferral of the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my desire to have those who wish to be an original \ncosponsor have the opportunity to do so, and I ask the cooperation of \nthe Parliamentarian to see how that can be worked out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/19/senate-section/article/S9514-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 67--PERMITTING THE CHAIRMAN OF THE \n   COMMITTEE ON RULES AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE SENATE TO DESIGNATE \n  ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE TO SERVE ON THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON \n                   PRINTING IN PLACE OF THE CHAIRMAN\n\n  Mr. DODD submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Hydroelectric Licensing \n     Process Improvement Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 4722. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) hydroelectric power is an irreplaceable source of \n     clean, economic, renewable energy with the unique capability \n     of supporting reliable electric service while maintaining \n     environmental quality;\n       (2) hydroelectric power is the leading renewable energy \n     resource of the United States;\n       (3) hydroelectric power projects provide multiple benefits \n     to the United States, including recreation, irrigation, flood \n     control, water supply, and fish and wildlife benefits;\n       (4) in the next 15 years, the bulk of all non-Federal \n     hydroelectric power capacity in the United States is due to \n     be relicensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission;\n       (5) the process of licensing hydroelectric projects by the \n     Commission--\n       (A) does not produce optimal decisions, because the \n     agencies that participate in the process are not required to \n     consider the full effects of their mandatory and recommended \n     conditions on a license;\n       (B) is inefficient, in part because agencies do not always \n     submit their mandatory and recommended conditions by a time \n     certain;\n       (C) is burdened by uncoordinated environmental reviews and \n     duplicative permitting authority; and\n       (D) is burdensome for all participants and too often \n     results in litigation; and\n       (6) while the alternative licensing procedures available to \n     applicants for hydroelectric project licenses provide \n     important opportunities for the collaborative resolution of \n     many of the issues in hydroelectric project licensing, those \n     procedures are not appropriate in every case and cannot \n     substitute for statutory reforms of the hydroelectric \n     licensing process.\n\n     SEC. 4723. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this subtitle is to achieve the objective of \n     relicensing hydroelectric power projects to maintain high \n     environmental standards while preserving low cost power by--\n       (1) requiring agencies to consider the full effects of \n     their mandatory and recommended conditions on a hydroelectric \n     power license and to document the consideration of a broad \n     range of factors;\n       (2) requiring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to \n     impose deadlines by which Federal agencies must submit \n     proposed mandatory and recommended conditions to a license; \n     and\n       (3) making other improvements in the licensing process.\n\n     SEC. 4724.
