Under the previous order, the clerk \nwill report the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4869, as modified.\n\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n[[Page S10234]]\n\n (Purpose: To provide a termination date for the authorization of the \nuse of the Armed Forces of the United States, together with procedures \n    for the extension of such date unless Congress disapproves the \n                               extension)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 5.

And the time is running; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 20 minutes overall--15 \nminutes to the sponsor of the amendment and 5 minutes in opposition. If \nnobody yields time, time will be deducted proportionately.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, does the distinguished Senator from Arizona \nwish to use any time at this point?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time does the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts wish?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Four and a half minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for the past few days we have debated the \ndetails of a resolution but not the implication of war with Iraq. We \nwere into the debate on the resolutions for 2 days, and then a cloture \nmotion was filed. I am reminded of the excellent statements made by my \nfriend from West Virginia that this subject about war and peace \ndeserves a longer period of time for discussion.\n  Earlier in the session, we debated for 21 days the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act; 23 days on the energy bill; 19 days on trade \npromotion; 18 days on the farm bill--all extremely important, but this \nissue is far more so.\n  In facing the global challenges of these times, we defend American \nvalues and interests best when war is our last resort, not our first \nimpulse. I commend President Bush for deciding in the end to take \nAmerica's case to the United Nations. Make no mistake about it, this \nresolution lets the President go it alone. Iraq should have no doubt of \nthe unity of the American purpose and the seriousness of our intent. \nHaving suffered the tragedy of September 11, we will leave no stone \nunturned in the defense of innocent Americans.\n  The question is not whether we will disarm Saddam Hussein of his \nweapons of mass destruction but how. And it is wrong for Congress to \ndeclare war against Iraq now before we have exhausted the alternatives. \nIt is wrong for the President to demand a declaration of war from \nCongress when he says he has not decided whether to go to war. It is \nwrong to avert our attention now from the greater and far more \nimmediate threat of Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida terrorism.\n  Pick up the paper and see the different headlines: ``Attacks Put \nTroops on Alert''; ``They fear contact with al-Qaida''; ``Tape, \nAssaults Stir Worry About Resurgent Al Qaeda''; and the list goes on \nabout the al-Qaida activities all over the world.\n\n  We cannot go it alone on Iraq and expect our allies to support us.\n  We cannot go it alone and expect the world to stand with us in the \nurgent and ongoing war against terrorism and al-Qaida.\n  We cannot go it alone in attacking Iraq and expect Saddam to keep his \nweapons of mass destruction at bay against us or our ally Israel.\n  We cannot go it alone while urging unprincipled regimes to resist \ninvasions of their adversaries.\n  The better course for our Nation and for our goal of disarming Saddam \nHussein is a two-step policy. We should approve a strong resolution \ntoday calling on the United Nations to require Iraq to submit to \nunfettered U.N. weapons inspections or face U.N.-backed international \nforce. If such option fails, and Saddam refuses to cooperate, the \nPresident could then come to the Congress and request Congress to \nprovide him with authorization to wage war against Iraq.\n  By pursuing this course, we maximize the chance that the world can \ndisarm Saddam without our going to war or, if war was necessary, we \nwould be joined by allied troops in the cause. In the end, having tried \nthese options and failed, our allies are far more likely to support our \nintervention should we elect to attack alone.\n  The world looks to America not just because of our superior might or \neconomic weight; they admire us and emulate us because we are a friend \nand ally that defends freedom and promotes our values around the globe. \nThose same traits that are the envy of the world should guide us today \nas we conclude this important debate.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia, and I yield back to him the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. How much time do I \nhave?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand we have 5 minutes. I yield \nthat 5 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut however he chooses to \nuse it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank my colleague \nfrom Arizona.\n  The amendment of the Senator from West Virginia which is before us \nwould terminate, 12 months after the date of enactment of the \nunderlying joint resolution, the authorization given in that \nresolution. In other words, it would put a time limit of a year subject \nto extension, but, nonetheless, a time limit for a year on the \nauthorization provided in the underlying resolution.\n  I say to my colleagues respectfully, this amendment is unprecedented \nand unwise. It is unprecedented in the sense that in brief research \novernight, I have not been able to find an occasion in which Congress \nhas exercised authority with regard to military action under article I \nof the Constitution when Congress has attached a time limit to it.\n  There was one occasion when time limits were discussed with regard to \nthe deployment of American forces in Bosnia, the Balkans, during the \nnineties, but I think we saw there why congressional imposition of time \nlimits on authorization of military action is unwise.\n  Why is it unwise? It is unwise because it gives notice to our enemies \nthat there is a limit to the authority we are giving the President as \nCommander in Chief of our military forces.\n\n[[Page S10235]]\n\nIt allows them to calculate their actions based on that limited \nduration.\n  In Bosnia, when that deadline was articulated by the administration, \nit created expectations which were quite naturally frustrated and \ntherein created a credibility gap.\n  There is a deadline in the underlying resolution, and the deadline is \nwhat it ought to be and always has been for military actions in which \nthe Armed Forces of the United States have been involved. The \nauthorization ends when the mission is accomplished, and in this case \nthe authorization would end when the two missions stated were \naccomplished: When the President as Commander in Chief concluded that \nAmerica was adequately protected, our national security was adequately \nprotected from threats from Iraq, and that the relevant United Nations \nresolutions were adequately being enforced. That is the deadline.\n  If the mood of Congress should change, if the attitude of the public \nshould change, Congress always reserves, as it has shown in the past, \nthe power of the purse and the power to change its opinion. But this \namendment at this time, as we try to gather our strength and unity of \npurpose to convince the international community to join with us, as \nthey surely will, is to finally get Saddam Hussein to keep his promise \nto disarm at the end of the gulf war.\n  We need no limitations on authority. We need to speak with a clear \nvoice. As it says in the Bible, if the sound of the trumpet be \nuncertain, who shall follow? And if we put a 12-month time limit on the \nauthority of the underlying resolution, I fear that fewer will follow \nand the result will be much less than we want it to be.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by the \nSenator from West Virginia, which would sunset the authority Congress \nwould grant to the President in this resolution to defend American \nsecurity against the threat posed by Iraq.\n  As the Senator has pointed out, the 12-month limit on congressional \nauthorization for the use of force his amendment would set could be \nextended by presidential or congressional action. However, these \nrequirements are onerous and infringe upon the authority of the \nCommander in Chief to meet his obligations to protect American \nsecurity.\n  The concept of imposing a deadline after which the President loses \nhis authority to achieve the goals set out in the Iraq resolution \nstrikes me as losing sight of the objective of a congressional \nauthorization of the use of force: ending the threat to the United \nStates and the world posed by Saddam Hussein's regime, so long as it \npossesses weapons of mass destruction and defies its obligations to the \nworld.\n  So long as that threat persists, and with Congress and the President \nhaving agreed that Saddam Hussein's regime endangers America, \ncongressional authority for the President to use force must remain in \nforce until he has met our common objective of disarming Saddam \nHussein.\n  To place a limit on the amount of time the President possesses this \nauthority, once Congress has granted it to him, would only encourage \nSaddam Hussein to stall and temporize on his commitments, knowing that \nthe clock is working in his favor. Such an incentive would make us less \nsecure, not more secure.\n  If the vast majority of Members of Congress and the American people \nagree upon the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's Iraq, and if we accept \nthat the President will confront this danger within the parameters we \nhave laid out in this congressional resolution, what about that threat \nwould change in 12 months, assuming we have not acted against it by \nthat time, that would somehow negate the President's need for the \nauthority to meet it?\n  If anything, the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime will only \ngrow with time. Private and public estimates are that Saddam Hussein \ncould possess nuclear weapons within six months to a year were he to \nacquire weapons-grade plutonium on the international market.\n  That's why the President has requested the authority to act now. \nSaddam Hussein represents a grave and gathering danger. I hope he is no \nlonger in power 1 year from now. But there is certainly a chance he \ncould be.\n  Congress cannot foresee the entire course of this conflict. Acting \nnow to deprive the President 12 months from now of the authority we \nwould grant him in this resolution would be an infringement on the \nauthority of the Commander in Chief and a strange way to respond to the \ngrave threat to American national security posed by Saddam Hussein's \nregime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senator from Connecticut is right that \narticle 1 of the Constitution does not provide for this, but article 1 \nof the Constitution also does not provide for a declaration of war \nbefore the President is asked to go to war. So this is a very different \ncircumstance. The President has not asked us to go to war. He has said \nhe wants the power to be able to go to war. It seems completely \nconsistent with that request that we say: Yes, Mr. President, you have \nthat power to go to war; you can do that within 1 year. If, in fact, \nyou go to war in 1 year, you can extend that 1 year.\n  Let me put it this way. If we are 2 years down the road still fooling \naround with Iraq, then my friends from Connecticut and other places \nhave been so dead wrong about what we are supposed to do that it would \nbe amazing.\n  I point out that this is nothing like Bosnia and nothing like the \nBalkans. In that case, we were in the Balkans. There were forces there, \nand there were people on the floor who were attempting to put a time on \nhow long they could stay after we had gone in, after we had already \nprevailed, after we were in place.\n  The third point I make in the 2 minutes I have is, we learned from \nVietnam the power of the purse is useless. The power of the purse is \nuseless because it presents us with a Hobson's choice. We have our \nfighting men and women in place and we are told, by the way, the \nPresident will not take them home so let's cut off the support for them \nso they have no guns, no bullets, no ability to fight a war. And no one \nis willing to do that. This is a prudent way to do this, totally \nconsistent with what the President is asking. I think it makes absolute \neminent sense. I congratulate the Senator. Even though I disagree with \nhim on his underlying notion, I do think he is right on this point and \nI support him.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 9 minutes 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask to be notified when I have 2 minutes left.\n  Mr. President, 38 years ago I, Robert C. Byrd, voted on the Tonkin \nGulf Resolution--the resolution that authorized the President to use \nmilitary force to ``repel armed attacks'' and ``to prevent further \nCommunist aggression'' in Southeast Asia.\n  It was this resolution that provided the basis for American \ninvolvement in the war in Vietnam.\n  It was the resolution that lead to the longest war in American \nhistory.\n  It led to the deaths of 58,000 Americans, and 150,000 Americans being \nwounded in action.\n  It led to massive protests, a deeply divided country, and the deaths \nof more Americans at Kent State.\n  It was a war that destroyed the Presidency of Lyndon Johnson and \nwrecked the administration of Richard Nixon.\n  After all that carnage, we began to learn that, in voting for the \nTonkin Gulf Resolution, we were basing our votes on bad information. We \nlearned that the claims the administration made on the need for the \nTonkin Gulf Resolution were simply not true, and history is repeating \nitself.\n  We tragically and belatedly learned that we had not taken enough time \nto consider the resolution. We had not asked the right questions, nor \nenough questions. We learned that we should have been demanding more \nhard evidence from the administration rather than accepting the \nadministration at its word.\n  But it was too late.\n  For all those spouting jingoes about going to war with Iraq, about \nthe urgent need for regime change no matter what the cost, about the \nneed to take out the evil dictator--and make no mistakes, I know and \nunderstand that\n\n[[Page S10236]]\n\nSaddam Hussein is an evil dictator--I urge Senators to go down on The \nCapital Mall and look at the Vietnam memorial. Nearly every day you \nwill find someone at that wall weeping for a loved one, a father, a \nson, a brother, a friend, whose name is on that wall.\n  If we are fortunate, a war with Iraq will be a short one with few \nAmerican deaths, as in the Persian Gulf war, and we can go around again \nwaving flags and singing patriotic songs.\n  Or, maybe we will find ourselves building another wall on the mall.\n  I will always remember the words of Senator Wayne Morse, one of the \ntwo Senators who opposed the Tonkin Gulf Resolution. During the debate \non the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, he stated: ``The resolution will pass, \nand Senators who vote for it will live to regret it.''\n  Many Senators did live to regret it.\n  The Tonkin Gulf Resolution contained a sunset provision to end \nmilitary action. S.J. Res. 46 will allow the President to continue war \nfor as long as he wants, against anyone he wants as long he feels it \nwill help eliminate the threat posed by Iraq.\n  With the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, Congress could ``terminate'' \nmilitary action. With S.J. Res. 46 , only the President can terminate \nmilitary action.\n  I should point out that the Tonkin Gulf Resolution and S.J. Res. 46 \ndo have several things in common. Congress is again being asked to vote \non the use of force without hard evidence that the country poses an \nimmediate threat to the national security of the United States. We are \nbeing asked to vote on a resolution authorizing the use of force in a \nhyped up, politically charged atmosphere in an election year. Congress \nis again being rushed into a judgment.\n  This is why I stand here today, before this Chamber, and before this \nNation, urging, pleading for some sanity, for more time to consider \nthis resolution, for more hard evidence on the need for this \nresolution.\n  Before we put this great Nation on the track to war, I want to see \nmore evidence, hard evidence, not more Presidential rhetoric. In \nsupport of this resolution, several people have pointed out that \nPresident Kennedy acted unilaterally in the Cuban missile crisis. That \nis true. I remember that. I was here. I also remember President Kennedy \ngoing on national television and showing proof of the threat we faced. \nI remember him sending our UN ambassador, Adlai Stevenson, to the \nUnited Nations, to provide proof to the world that there was a threat \nto the national security of the United States.\n\n  All we get from this administration is rhetoric. In fact, in an \naddress to our NATO colleagues, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, \naccording to the Chicago Tribune, urged our allies to resist the idea \nfor the need of absolute proof about terrorists intent before they took \naction.\n  Before we unleash what Thomas Jefferson called the ``dogs of war,'' I \nwant to know, have we exhausted every avenue of peace? My favorite book \ndoes not say, blessed are the war makers. It says: ``Blessed are the \npeacemakers.'' Have we truly pursued peace?\n  If the need for taking military action against Iraq is so obvious and \nso needed and so urgent, then why are nearly every one of our allies \nopposed to it? Why is the President on the phone nearly every day \ntrying to convince our allies to join us?\n  So many people, so many nations in the Arab world already hate and \nfear us. Why do we want them to hate and fear us even more?\n  People are correct to point out that September 11 changed everything. \nWe need to be more careful. We need to build up our intelligence \nefforts and our homeland security. But do we go around pounding \neverybody, anybody, who might pose a threat to our security? If we \nclobber Iraq today, do we clobber Iran tomorrow?\n  When do we attack China? When do we attack North Korea? When do we \nattack Syria?\n  Unless I can be shown proof that these distant nations do pose an \nimmediate, serious threat to the national interests and security of the \nUnited States, I think we should finish our war on terrorism. I think \nwe should destroy those who destroyed the Trade Towers and attacked the \nPentagon. I think we should get thug No. 1 before we worry about thug \nNo. 2.\n  Yes, September 11 changed many aspects of our lives, but people still \nbleed. America's mothers will still weep for their sons and their \ndaughters who will not come home.\n  September 11 should have made us more aware of the pain that comes \nfrom being attacked. We, more than ever, are aware of the damage, the \ndeaths, and the suffering that comes from violent attacks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  This is what we are about to do to other countries. We are about to \ninflict this horrible suffering upon other people.\n  Of course, we do not talk about this. We talk about taking out Saddam \nHussein. We are talking about taking out Iraq, about ``regime change.''\n  I do not want history to remember my country as being on the side of \nevil.\n  During the Civil War, a minister expressed his hope to President \nLincoln that the Lord was on the side of the North. The Great \nEmancipator reportedly rebuked the minister stating:\n\n       It is my constant anxiety and prayer that I and this nation \n     are on the Lord's side.\n\n  Before I vote for this resolution for war, a war in which thousands, \nperhaps tens of thousands or hundred of thousands of people may die, I \nwant to make sure that I and this Nation are on God's side.\n  I want more time. I want more evidence. I want to know that I am \nright, that our Nation is right, and not just powerful.\n  And I want the language that is in this amendment so that Congress \ncan oversee this power grab and act to terminate it at some point in \ntime--giving the President the opportunity to extend the time but let's \nkeep Congress in the act.\n  Senators, vote for this amendment. I plead with you.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am opposed to the Byrd amendment, for \nthis is a resolution to deter war.\n  The amendment proposed by Senator Byrd would insert into the joint \nresolution, language which would state that nothing in that joint \nresolution: is intended to alter the constitutional authorities of the \nCongress to declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, or other \nauthorities invested in Congress by Article I, Section 8, of the \nConstitution; or shall be construed as granting any authority to the \nPresident to use the U.S. Armed Forces for any purpose not directly \nrelated to a clear threat of imminent, sudden, and direct attack upon \nthe U.S. or its armed forces unless the Congress otherwise authorizes.\n  The amendment of the Senator from West Virginia attempts to do \nsomething that the Framers of the Constitution did not attempt--to \ndefine, with particularity, the extent of the President's powers as \nCommander in Chief of the Armed Forces. Specifically, it would limit \nthe authority of the President to use Armed Forces to a narrowly \ndefined set of circumstance--``a clear threat of imminent, sudden and \ndirect attack upon the United States or its Armed Forces.'' Even when \nthe United States enjoyed genuine geographic and political isolation \nfrom the Old World, such a limitation could not be maintained. Within a \ndecade of the ratification of the Constitution, the United States \nengaged in an undeclared naval war with France. Shortly thereafter, we \nengaged in undeclared war with the Barbary States of North Africa, who \nhad engaged in piratical depredations against American shipping.\n  In 1861, President Lincoln, faced with an unprecedented situation, \nimposed a blockade--an act of war normally employed against a foreign \nenemy--upon the Southern Confederacy. He did this without congressional \nauthorization. The Supreme Court later upheld this action in the famous \nPrize Cases, stating that the President had a constitutional duty to \nmeet the insurrection as he found it; the determination that a state of \nwar existed was for him to make.\n  This is not a Republican or Democratic issue. Since 1945, Presidents \nof both parties have repeatedly committed American troops abroad \nwithout formal congressional approval. Whether in Korea, Grenada, \nPanama,\n\n[[Page S10237]]\n\nKosovo, or numerous other areas of the world, our Presidents have used \ntheir powers as Commander in Chief to protect the Nation and American \ninterests whenever they, in their considered judgment, thought it best \nto do so. The Clinton administration, which committed American troops \nto military operations abroad on an unprecedented scale in situations \nnot involving imminent danger of attack to the United States, did not \nrequest formal congressional approval for any of those oeprations--\nbelieving that the President possessed the constitutional authority to \ndo so. Indeed, the Secretary of State in 1998 publicly stated that the \n1991 congressional resolution authorizing the use of force against \nIraq, together with existing Security Council resolutions, constituted \nsufficient authority for the use of force against Iraq.\n  On September 11th of last year the American people awoke to the \nrealization that they were in imminent danger, had been for some time, \nand this danger gives no warning. It is a different type of danger, but \nno less real and no less threatening to the Nation than more \ntraditional ones. As the President reminded us in his speech to the \nNation on Monday evening:\n\n       Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological \n     or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual \n     terrorists. Alliance with terrorists could allow the Iraqi \n     regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints . . \n     . confronting the threat posed by Iraq is crucial to winning \n     the war on terror.\n\n  On the Today Show this week, Richard Butler, former head of UNSCOM, \nwas asked how easy it would be for the Iraqis to arm a terrorist group \nor an individual terrorist with weapons of mass destruction. His \nresponse was ``Extremely easy. If they decided to do it, piece of \ncake!''\n  They may already have done it. The danger is clear, present, and \nimminent. We must grant the President the authority to use armed force \nto protect the Nation, and the flexibility to employ that force as \nseems best to him. Our enemies are cunning and flexible; we cannot \ndefeat them with anything less.\n  The Byrd amendment regarding preservation of Congress's \nconstitutional authorities is unnecessary. The portion of the amendment \nthat would limit the authority of the President to wage war is, \narguably unconstitutional. The Congress can declare war, but it cannot \ndictate to the President how to wage war. No law passed by Congress \ncould alter the constitutional separation of powers.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time on our side \nto my friend from Arizona.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nhis thoughtful statement. I want to say in the few remaining seconds \nthat to view the cause of the tragedy of the Vietnam war as being the \nTonkin Gulf resolution is a somewhat, in my view, simplistic view.\n  There were a lot of factors that entered into the beginning and the \ncontinuation of the Vietnam war. The Tonkin Gulf resolution was simply \nwindow dressing. At any time the Congress of the United States could \nhave reversed that resolution and chose not to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time in opposition has expired.\n  The sponsor has 37 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this is a Tonkin Gulf resolution all over \nagain. Let us stop, look, and listen. Let us not give this President, \nor any President, unchecked power. Remember the Constitution. Remember \nthe Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. They have not.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to Byrd amendment No. 4869, as modified.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas (Mrs. Lincoln) \nand the Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski), are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller).

Under the previous order, there will now be 45 \nminutes prior to the cloture vote on amendment No. 4856, as modified. \nUnder the previous order, the first 15 minutes shall be under the \ncontrol of the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, the second 15 \nminutes shall be under the control of the Republican leader, and the \nthird 15 minutes shall be under the control of the majority leader.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes of my 15 minutes to the \ndistinguish Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished President pro tempore and the \nChair.\n  Mr. President, I have sought this time to register my very strong \nobjection to cloture on this resolution authorizing the use of force, \nwhich is the equivalent of a declaration of war. In my 22 years in the \nSenate, the only issue which has been of equal importance was the \nauthorization for the use of force in 1991. The motion to invoke \ncloture, which is to cut off debate, is supposed to be done when there \nis a filibuster. However, there is no filibuster present on this issue.\n  I came to the floor yesterday in an effort to participate in a \ncolloquy with Senator Lieberman, the lead proponent of the bill, and \nfound that all the time was allotted and all the time was taken. When \nno one appeared, we had about 3 minutes to discuss an issue which \nreally required 30 minutes or an hour. I then sought time later in the \nafternoon, and all the time was taken. I then sought time this morning \nand find that the only time which is available is some time after 5 \np.m. this afternoon.\n  It is customary in the Senate to see two lights on for a quorum call, \nbut there have been very few quorum calls on this resolution--really \nnone--except when Senators are on their way to the floor or when there \nare discussions. So there has certainly not been any effort to \nfilibuster. Those who sought time to come over and discuss important \nissues have found that there is no time to do so.\n  We now have a series of amendments lined up with time allocations \nwhich are very brief. To discuss the cloture resolution itself in 45 \nminutes is very limited. To discuss the amendments which are pending is \nvery difficult.\n\n[[Page S10238]]\n\nThere is in the bill a change from the 1991 resolution which has an \nobjective test for the President to use force to carry out U.N. \nresolutions, whereas in the current resolution, it is subjective as the \nPresident sees fit. That is a matter of great moment which has not been \ndebated in the Senate.\n\n  The resolution has numerous whereas clauses so that one can read the \nresolution to justify the use of force if the Iraqi Government \ncontinues to abuse its citizens. I would not want to say the Iraqi \nGovernment has not abused its citizens, but I do not believe anyone is \nseriously contending that is the basis for the President to take the \nUnited States to war. To stop Saddam Hussein from having weapons of \nmass destruction which pose a threat to the United States, is a reason.\n  Then there is the issue of regime change, which is in the whereas \nclause. The resolution contains a provision for U.S. national security \ninterests. I posed questions to the Senator from Connecticut yesterday \nas to whether regime change was comprehended in our national security \ninterest. That has yet to be answered.\n  The point I am making is that this is a matter which requires \ndiscussion and analysis. I do not believe it helps the President of the \nUnited States to have the Senate rush to judgment. It is not quite a \nblank check. It is not quite a knee-jerk reaction, but it is not the \nkind of deliberation that ought to characterize the work of this body. \nIt would be unfortunate if the Senate votes for a resolution \nauthorizing the use of force notwithstanding the questions which I have \nraised, although I said on the floor before that I may well support the \nPresident. However, if we do so in a context of deliberation and \nthoughtfulness when people like Senator Lieberman, Senator McCain, \nSenator Warner, Senator Biden, Senator Jeffords, and other Members, put \nour imprimatur on it, it has some significance in the international \narena, providing it is debated, and providing there is some lucid \ndiscussion on all of the issues we are confronting.\n  I noted in the ``Philadelphia Inquirer'' this week the comment of a \nHouse member: The President has handcuffed us. I am voting yes on this \nresolution because I think ultimately the box the President has put us \nin has forced us to vote in the interests of national security.\n  I do not think we ought to vote for this resolution because we are \nbeing handcuffed. I do not think anyone anywhere ought to vote for a \nresolution for being handcuffed or for being put in a box.\n  These are matters which require a lot of analysis and a lot of \ndebate. The cloture motion will cut off nongermane amendments. That is \na very tight restriction. Other amendments ought to be offered which \nare very important to the discussion on this critical matter. I thank \nthe Senator from West Virginia, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for a very \ncourageous statement.\n  The Polycraticus of John of Salisbury, completed in 1159, says that \nNero, the sixth in line from Julius, having heard the Senate had \ncondemned him to death, begged that someone would give him courage to \ndie by dying with him as an example. When he perceived the horseman \ndrawing near, he upbraided his own cowardice by saying: ``I die \nshamefully.'' So saying, he drove the steel into his own throat and \nthus, says John of Salisbury, came to an end the whole House of the \nCaesars.\n  Mr. President, here in this pernicious resolution on which the Senate \nwill vote soon, we find the dagger that is being held at the throat of \nthe Senate of the United States. I say to my friends, we ought to pause \nand wonder if Captain John Parker and his minutemen fought on the green \nof Lexington for this piece of rag, this so-called resolution. When \nParker lost 8 or 10 of his men with that first shot, is this what they \ndied for, this resolution? Is that what they died for?\n  How about John Paul Jones, when he was fighting the Serapis. He was \nthe captain of the Bon Homme Richard when he said, I have not yet begun \nto fight. What he was fighting for? Was he fighting for this piece of \ncowardice here in this resolution that gives to the President--lock, \nstock and barrel--the authority to use the military forces of this \ncountry however he will, whenever he will, and wherever he will, and \nfor as long as he will?\n  We are handing this over to the President of the United States. When \nwe do that, we can put a sign on the top of this Capitol, and we can \nsay: ``Gone home.'' ``Gone fishing.'' ``Out of business.''\n  I don't believe our forebears died for that kind of a piece of paper. \nHow about Nathan Hale? He, too, was from Connecticut, may I say to the \nchief sponsor of this resolution. Nathan Hale volunteered to go into \nthe British lines when he was called upon to do so by George \nWashington. He volunteered. He went behind the British lines to draw \nthe gun emplacements, the breastwork of the British. And on the night \nof September 21, 1776, he was prepared to return to his own lines. He \nhad on his person the pictures that he had drawn, the notes he had \nmade, and he was discovered as a spy on the night of September 21, \n1776. Nathan Hale.\n  The next morning he was hauled up before a wooden coffin in which he \nknew that his body would soon lie and grow cold. And the captain of the \nBritish, Captain Cunningham, said to Nathan Hale: Do you have anything \nthat you would like to say? He had already been refused a Bible. He was \nasked, did he have anything further.\n  He said: I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my \ncountry.\n  Nathan Hale gave his own life, one life. It was all he had. Can we \ngive one vote for our country today? Each of us took an oath under this \nConstitution. You took it in the chair, Mr. President. Mr. Senator from \nVirginia, you took it. This is the Constitution that James Madison from \nthe State of Virginia helped to write; that George Washington helped to \nwrite. We take an oath to support and defend that Constitution. Are we \ndefending it here today? Are we defending the role of the Senate as set \nforth in this Constitution which says Congress shall declare war?\n  Here we are about to hand off that role, that responsibility, to a \nPresident of the United States without limitation. He can go on and on. \nWe are out of it. Once we pass this resolution and it is signed by the \nPresident, Senators are out of it. You can complain, but it won't help.\n\n  I say that we are denying the American people their right to be \nheard. Here we are being shut off on a cloture vote. I know the rules \nof the Senate. I have used the cloture vote myself. But in a situation \nsuch as this, I have pleaded for time, more time. I have been turned \ndown.\n  The American people out there are going to render a judgment. They \nare going to render a judgment on every Senator in this body before it \nis over. I pray to God that if we go to war with Iraq, we will be \nlucky. I pray to God we will be lucky.\n  Nobody will support this country in war any more strongly than will \nI. But here today we are being tested. I didn't swear to support and \ndefend the President of the United States when I came here. I pledged \non the Bible up there on the desk to support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States, so help me God. That was no light \nprayer. That was no light oath.\n  I think we ought to look inside of ourselves. Look at our children \nand grandchildren. Look in the mirror and see if you can say: Old \nbuddy, I voted for what I thought was right. I voted with the \nConstitution.\n  They say: Well, support our Commander in Chief. He is Commander in \nChief of the Army and Navy and the militia when called into service. He \nis not Commander in Chief of industry. He is not Commander in Chief of \nthe Senate of the United States. So where are the Nathan Hales today \nwho would give their life, their own life for their country? Give one \nvote for this Constitution. After all, if it were not for this \nConstitution, I wouldn't be here. You would not be here. You would not \nbe here. You would not be here. None of us would be here. But because \nof this Constitution, we are here today.\n  The people want us to ask questions. They want us to take a stand. \nThey want us to take a stand against this stampede. Where are Senators \ntoday? Where are the backbones that stand up for the people? How many \nmothers, how many fathers will see their sons and their daughters die \npossibly in a war in a foreign land?\n\n[[Page S10239]]\n\n  I say, my friends, I am sorry to see this day. This is my 50th year \nin Congress. I never would have thought I would find a Senate which \nwould lack the backbone to stand up against the stampede, this rush to \nwar, this rush to give to the President of the United States, whatever \nPresident he is, whatever party, this rush to give a President, to put \nit in his hands alone, to let him determine alone when he will send the \nsons and daughters of the American people into war, let him have \ncontrol of the military forces. He will not only make war, but he will \ndeclare war.\n  That flies in the face of this Constitution. This Constitution does \nnot give to a President of the United States the right to determine \nwhen, where, how, and for how long he will use the military forces of \nthe United States.\n  I plead to Senators in the name of this Constitution: We need people \nwho will stand up for the American people. We need Senators who will \ntake a stand. I hope Senators will take what I am saying in the best of \nspirit. I think we are making one horrible mistake.\n  Remember: I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my \ncountry. Nathan Hale.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next 15 minutes \nwill be controlled by the Republican Party.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe under the agreement, I have 15 \nminutes of this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will use approximately 5 minutes of the time and yield \nthe remainder of my time to Senator Warner.\n  I would like to begin by saying how much I appreciate the work that \nhas been done here in handling this legislation, having a full debate. \nSenator Warner has been here joining in the discussion, Senator Reid, \nSenator McCain. There has been a serious effort to make sure we had an \norderly process where Senators could make their feelings known. There \nhas been thoughtful discussion on both sides of the issue, and there \nmight have been one or two quorum calls the whole time because Senators \nhave known, when you come to the floor, this will be your opportunity \nto speak on this issue.\n  And there will be more time today. As I look at the schedule that was \nlined up through the diligent efforts of Senator Warner, Senator \nMcCain, and Senator Reid, we are going to have votes on amendments--\neven amendments that would not be germaine postcloture. There has been \na real effort to make sure Senator Byrd and Senators Levin, Durbin, \nBoxer, and others have an opportunity to offer amendments and make \ntheir case. We will have five votes between now and approximately 4 \no'clock this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I remember the discussion back in 1991 on the Persian \nGulf resolution. I think we had about 2 days of debate previously, and \n2 \\1/2\\ days when we actually took up the debate--when it passed. It \nwas a very important debate. I thought it was an occasion when the \nSenate proved it is the world's greatest deliberative body. It was very \nserious. Every Senator spoke, we had the vote, and it passed. I thought \nit was one of the high-water marks since I have served in the Senate. \nIt was only 2 \\1/2\\ days and every Senator got a chance to speak.\n  In 1998, at the request of President Clinton, I moved aggressively, \nin a bipartisan way, to pass the Iraqi Liberation Act. As I recall, at \nthat time, Senator Kyl worked with me on that issue, Senator Warner was \ninvolved, as were Senators Kerry and Lieberman, and we passed that \nresolution, which also called for a regime change unanimously, with \nvery short debate--as I recall, maybe even a half day, or a day at the \nmost. But it was important debate and an important vote.\n  So when we have been called on by Presidents of both parties to \naddress this very serious issue in this very serious area of the world, \nwe have handled it in the right way. I think that is the case here. \nSenators were told in my conference, and I know Senator Daschle told \nhis side's conference, you will be able to speak on Friday and, again, \non Monday. We will stay as long as you need. We had all day yesterday. \nA great effort was made to make sure Senators had a chance to speak. \nNow Senators have a chance to offer amendments and speak on them. After \nthe vote between 3 and 4 o'clock, there will be more time because \nSenators do feel strongly about this and want an opportunity to be \nheard. They are going to have that opportunity.\n  I believe this issue has been aired fully. It is not new. We have \nbeen worrying about this, talking about this, and debating the \nseriousness of the threat from Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass \ndestruction for years--really, for 11 years. There is new information \nthat is available. We have had our classified briefings. I have made \nsure Senators on our side--and I know the administration has made sure \nSenators on both sides of the aisle--have had a chance to get briefings \nat multiple opportunities. So Senators know what the issue is. We have \nseen, yesterday, Senators from both parties moving toward giving the \nPresident the authority to do this job.\n  I hope we can get inspectors in there, that they can find the weapons \nof mass destruction, and they are destroyed. But I don't trust Saddam \nHussein. His record is clear. I think, once again, he will resist, he \nwill agree, he will dissemble. In the end, he will try to block this. \nYou can always hope and pray we will find a solution here.\n  The President of the United States has listened to the American \npeople, to the Congress, to the U.N, and our allies. The President came \nto the Congress and said, yes, I want your input. He sent up some \nsuggested language on this resolution, and it was changed once and then \ntwice; significant changes were made at the recommendation of Senators \non both sides of the aisle. So he has worked with us in this effort. He \nencouraged our involvement and our debate. He has gone to the U.N. and \ncalled on them to stand up to their commitment and do their job, and \nquit passing resolutions that are not backed or demanded to be complied \nwith, with force if necessary. He did the job. He and his \nadministration, including the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, have \nworked with allies at the U.N. and with our allies around the world. \nThis President has made it clear he is not going to act precipitously, \nbut he is prepared to act.\n\n  This President has led with commitment and has shown leadership. He \nis prepared to try to find a peaceful solution here. But unless we make \nit clear he is committed, we are committed, and the U.N. is committed, \nthis problem will not go away. It is serious and it is imminent. It \ntakes but one person with a small container to bring very dangerous \nweapons of mass destruction into this country.\n  Some people say, why now? Well, because the threat is not going to \nlessen. It has been 4 years since we passed the Iraqi Liberation Act in \n1998. I suspect matters have gotten much worse. Besides that, the U.N. \nis going to be leaving soon for the year and won't be back until next \nAugust. We want to see action from the U.N. We need to act to show our \ncommitment, and we need to show our determination to get them to act in \na way that has real force.\n  I think we have had a full debate and we will have more debate. To \ntry to delay it another day, another week, is not going to be helpful. \nWe need to stand up now, show we mean what we say, and we are going to \nget the results and, by doing that, perhaps something can be worked out \nwithout the use of force. But this President has asked for this. This \nSenate is committed to this. I believe the vote will be overwhelming.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture. There will be times for \npostcloture debate. We have bent over backward to make sure everybody \nhad an opportunity and will still have an opportunity to speak and even \noffer amendments.\n  With that, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nVirginia, who has done a magnificent job in fairly managing this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the leader. I appreciate very much the calm tone \nwith which he addresses this issue of a rush to judgment. Regrettably, \nour colleague from Pennsylvania used those terms. I was reminded of \nbeing here last Friday afternoon for 5 \\1/2\\ hours. What a memorable \nopportunity it was with my distinguished colleague from West Virginia. \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Dodd joined in. I think we went about a \nvery constructive debate\n\n[[Page S10240]]\n\nand exchanged our views. Senator Byrd and I debated again on Monday, \nTuesday, and Wednesday. Here we are on the fifth day.\n  Mr. President, this is not a rush to judgment. This is the Senate \nworking diligently. Most of us were here close to 11 o'clock last \nnight. In parallel, as the distinguished leader said--I remember it so \nwell--the period of January 10 through 12, when a resolution, again \ndrawn up by my colleague from Connecticut, the principal sponsor this \ntime, at that time I was the principal sponsor. It was carefully \ndebated. The Senate is doing its job and doing it well. We have had a \nvery good debate and we will complete that debate here today, tomorrow, \nor whatever the case may be.\n  I wish to draw the attention of the Senate to the last vote--a very \nstrong vote, not against our colleague from West Virginia. But I \nthought, as he mentioned the Gulf of Tonkin, how appropriate it was \nthat in the leader's chair, Senator McCain, my partner who is working \ndiligently with me on this side, spoke very softly of his experience. I \ndon't know of anyone in this Chamber more qualified than he to speak to \nthat period, and the relevance of that resolution. I was Secretary of \nthe Navy for 5 years, and Under Secretary during that period of time, \nand we remember well that period.\n  I wish to talk about the President of the United States. As I look \nupon this situation and listen to the debate, I think we are of a mind, \nall 100 of us, of the seriousness of these weapons of mass destruction. \nWe may have a difference of conscience as to the level of threat posed \nperhaps today, tomorrow, in the future, but it is there. This is no \nquestion.\n  I stop to think that the United Nations has done nothing for 4 years. \nThey have not sought to enforce the resolutions, 16 in number. It has \nbeen this President, President George Bush, who has taken the \ninitiative to go not only to the American people, but to the whole \nworld, and very carefully and methodically tell the world we should be \non alert; we cannot do nothing. We should join as a community of \nnations to address it. He said that at the United Nations very \nbrilliantly. I think everyone in this body respects him.\n  As we are debating today, another debate is taking place in the U.N. \nTo the extent this resolution remains strong as it is now is the extent \nto which we can expect an equal and perhaps even stronger statement of \nresolve by the United Nations to fulfill its mandate, to fulfill its \ncharter.\n  The League of Nations failed to act at a critical time in the history \nof this Nation, and it went into the dustbin of history. The United \nNations will not go into the dustbin of history. I am confident that \nthis time they will stand up, that they will devise a 17th resolution.\n  I look upon the action by the Senate today in voting a strong \nbipartisan vote for this resolution as not an act of war. It is an act \nto deter war, to put in place the tools for our President and our \nSecretary of State to get the strongest possible resolution in the \nUnited Nations. It is an act seen to force, I repeat, the last option \nas our President has said ever so clearly time and again. It is an act \nto deter war to make the last option the use of force.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes of my time to the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \ngracious yielding of time. I thank him for more than that. I thank him \nfor his leadership in this matter of how the Senate should proceed with \nregard to Iraq, and I thank him specifically for the work that he and \nhis staff did in negotiations with the White House and with Members of \nthe House to get this resolution to where it is where I am confident it \ncan and will enjoy broad bipartisan support.\n  There will be time for debate later in the day about the relevance of \nthis resolution, about the extent to which I am confident it is clearly \nwithin our constitutional authority under article I. I have comparisons \nto other declarations of war and authorizations of military action, \nthat is, if anything, more specific than most.\n  I am inspired by Senator Byrd's reference to Nathan Hale. Nathan Hale \nwas not only a son of Connecticut, but a Yale man. For my entire \nfreshman year, I walked by an inspiring statue of Nathan Hale. I read \nabout him. I studied him. I cannot say I knew him personally, but I \nfeel as if I knew Nathan Hale, who was remembered for saying: ``I \nregret I have only one life to give for my country.''\n  Nathan Hale was a patriot, and he was prepared to give his life for \nthe security and freedom of his country. I am absolutely confident that \nif Nathan Hale were in the Senate of the United States today, he would \nnot only be cosponsoring this resolution, he would be impatient to have \nthe talking stop and the action begin.\n  Is it time? Are we ready? Time is what it is about.\n  It is 12 years since Iraq invaded Kuwait and threatened to invade \nSaudi Arabia and thereby showed that all that Saddam Hussein had been \nsaying about wanting to make Baghdad the capital of the Arab world and \ndominate the Arab world was not just talk; he was prepared to act on \nit.\n  It is 12 years since U.N. Resolution 678 authorizing the use of force \nagainst Iraq.\n  It is 11 years since the congressional authorization for Desert Storm \nand the triumphant brilliant effort of our military in Desert Storm.\n  It is 11 years since Saddam asked for a cease-fire and accepted the \ninspection regime as part of that cease-fire on which he has never \nfollowed through and complied.\n  It is 11 years since the no-fly zones were first adopted and began to \nbe enforced by American military personnel.\n  It is 9 years since the U.N. found Saddam in ``material breach of his \ninternational obligations.''\n  It is 9 years since Iraq under Saddam Hussein attempted to \nassassinate former President Bush.\n  It is 6 years since Saddam crushed Kurdish and Shi'a resistance to \nhis regime.\n  It is 4 years since Saddam ejected inspectors and President Clinton \nordered Operation Desert Fox, an air campaign against Iraq in response \nto this act.\n  It is 4 years since this Senate called for the indictment of Saddam \nas a war criminal.\n  It is 4 years since the Senate found Iraq in breach of international \nobligations and authorized the President to take ``appropriate action \nin accordance with the Constitution and relevant laws of the United \nStates to bring Iraq into compliance with its international \nobligation.''\n  It is 4 years since Congress passed and President Clinton signed the \nIraq Liberation Act.\n\n  It is more than 1 year since we were attacked by terrorists on \nSeptember 11, 2001, showing us the risks of inaction against those who \nwould arm and threaten us.\n  It is 1 month since the President of the United States challenged the \nUnited Nations to act against this international lawbreaker.\n  It is 8 days since we started the debate on this resolution in the \nSenate; excluding the Sabbath, 6 days. The Lord made Heaven and Earth \nin 6 days. It is time now for us to come to a conclusion.\n  Is it time? Are we ready to act? I think the record shows we are \nready to act.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I need additional time, I will take it \nfrom my Senate leader allocation for the day.\n  The Senate is now engaged in one of the most consequential debates \naddressed in this Chamber for many years. We are confronting the grave \nissues of war and peace. We are considering how the United States \nshould respond to a murderous dictator who has shown he will be bound \nneither by conscience nor by the laws or principles of civilized \nnations. And we are contemplating whether and under what conditions the \nCongress should authorize the preemptive use of American military power \nto remove the threat that he poses.\n  These questions go directly to who we are as a nation. How we answer \nthem will have a profound consequence for our Nation, for our allies, \nfor the war on terror, and perhaps most importantly, for the men and \nwomen in our Armed Forces who could be called to\n\n[[Page S10241]]\n\nrisk their lives because of our decisions.\n  There is no question that Saddam Hussein is a dangerous man who has \ndone barbaric things. He has invaded neighbors, supported terrorists, \nrepressed and murdered his own people.\n  Over the last several months, as the world has sought to calm the \nviolence between Israelis and Palestinians, Iraq has tried to inflame \nthe situation by speaking against the very existence of Israel and \nencouraging suicide bombers in Gaza and the West Bank.\n  Saddam Hussein has stockpiled, weaponized and used chemical and \nbiological weapons, and he has made no secret of his desire to acquire \nnuclear weapons. He has ignored international agreements and frustrated \nthe efforts of international inspectors, and his ambitions today are as \nunrelenting as they have ever been.\n  As a condition of the truce that ended the gulf war, Saddam Hussein \nagreed to eliminate Iraq's nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons \nand to abandon all efforts to develop or deliver such weapons. That \nagreement is spelled out in U.N. Security Council Resolution 687. Iraq \nhas never complied with the resolution.\n  For the first 7 years after the gulf war, it tried to deceive U.N. \nweapons inspectors, block their access to key sites, and make it \nimpossible for them to do their jobs.\n  Finally, in October of 1998, the U.N. was left with no choice but to \nwithdraw its inspectors from Iraq. As a result, we do not know exactly \nwhat is now in Iraq's arsenal. We do know Iraq has weaponized thousands \nof gallons of anthrax and other deadly biological agents. We know Iraq \nmaintains stockpiles of some of the world's deadliest chemical weapons, \nincluding VX, sarin, and mustard gas. We know Iraq is developing \ndeadlier ways to deliver these horrible weapons, including unmanned \ndrones and long-range ballistic missiles. And we know Saddam Hussein is \ncommitted to one day possessing nuclear weapons.\n  If that should happen, instead of simply bullying the gulf region, he \ncould dominate it. Instead of threatening only his neighbors, he could \nbecome a grave threat to U.S. security and to global security.\n  The threat posed by Saddam Hussein may not be imminent, but it is \nreal, it is growing, and it cannot be ignored. Despite that, like many \nAmericans, I was concerned by the way the administration first proposed \nto deal with that threat. The President's desire to wage war alone, \nwithout the support of our allies and without authorization from \nCongress, was wrong. Many of us, Democrats and Republicans, made it \nclear that such unilateralism was not in our Nation's best interest. I \nnow commend the administration for changing its approach and \nacknowledging the importance of working with our allies. I also commend \nit for recognizing that under our Constitution, it is Congress that \nauthorizes the use of force, and for requesting a resolution providing \nsuch authority.\n  I applaud my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans in the House and \nin the Senate, for the improvements they have made to the \nadministration's original resolution. Four changes were especially \ncritical.\n  First, instead of giving the President broad and unfocused \nauthorization to take action in the region, as the administration \noriginally sought, this resolution focuses specifically on the threat \nposed by Iraq. It no longer authorizes, nor should it be used to \njustify, the use of force against other nations, organizations, or \nindividuals that the President may believe threaten peace and stability \nin the Persian Gulf region. It is a strong and focused response to a \nspecific threat. It is not a template or model for any other situation.\n  Second, the resolution expresses the deep conviction of this Congress \nand of the American people that President Bush should continue to work \nthrough the United Nations Security Council in order to secure Iraqi \ncompliance with U.N. resolutions. Unfettered inspections may or may not \nlead to Iraqi disarmament, but whether they succeed or fail, the effort \nwe expend in seeking inspections will make it easier for the President \nto assemble a global coalition against Saddam should military action \neventually be needed.\n\n  Third, this resolution makes it clear that before the President can \nuse force in Iraq, he must certify to the Congress that diplomacy has \nfailed, that further diplomatic efforts alone cannot protect America's \nnational security interests, nor can they lead to enforcement of the \nU.N. Security Council resolutions.\n  Fourth, this resolution protects the balance of power by requiring \nthe President to comply with the War Powers Act and to report to \nCongress at least every 60 days on matters relevant to this resolution.\n  This resolution gives the President the authority he needs to \nconfront the threat posed by Iraq. It is fundamentally different and a \nbetter resolution than the one the President sent to us. It is neither \na Democratic resolution nor a Republican resolution. It is now a \nstatement of American resolve and values. It is more respectful of our \nConstitution, more reflective of our understanding that we need to work \nwith our allies in this effort, and more in keeping with our strong \nbelief that force must be a last resort, not a first response.\n  Because this resolution is improved, because I believe Saddam Hussein \nrepresents a real threat, and because I believe it is important for \nAmerica to speak with one voice at this critical moment, I will vote to \ngive the President the authority he needs, but I respect those who \nreach different conclusions. For me, the deciding factor is my belief \nthat a united Congress will help the President unite the world, and by \nuniting the world we can increase the world's chances of succeeding in \nthis effort and reduce both the risks and the costs America may have to \nbear. With this resolution, we are giving the President extraordinary \nauthority. How he exercises that authority will determine how \nsuccessful any action in Iraq might be.\n  In 1991, by the time the President's father sought congressional \nsupport to use force against Iraq, he had secured pledges of military \ncooperation from nearly 40 nations and statements of support from \nscores of others. He had already secured the backing of the United \nNations, and he had already developed a clear plan of action. In \nassembling that coalition, the legitimacy of our cause was affirmed, \nregional stability was maintained, the risks to our soldiers were \nlessened, America's burden was reduced, and perhaps most importantly, \nIraq was isolated.\n  At this point, we have done none of those things. That is why, unlike \nin 1991, our vote on this resolution should be seen as the beginning of \na process, not the end. For our efforts in Iraq to succeed, the \nPresident must continue to consult with Congress and work hard to build \na global coalition. That is not capitulation, it is leadership. And it \nis essential.\n  In my view, there are five other crucial steps the administration \nmust take before any final decision on the use of force in Iraq is \nmade. First and foremost, the President needs to be honest with the \nAmerican people, not only about the benefits of action against Iraq but \nalso about the risks and the costs of such action. We are no longer \ntalking about driving Saddam Hussein back to within his borders, we are \ntalking about driving him from power. That is a much more difficult and \ncomplicated goal.\n  There was a story in this past Sunday's Philadelphia Inquirer that \ntop officials in the administration ``have exaggerated the degree of \nallied support for a war in Iraq.'' The story goes on to say that \nothers in the administration ``are rankled by what they charge is a \ntendency'' by some in the administration ``to gloss over the unpleasant \nrealities'' of a potential war with Iraq.\n  A report in yesterday's Washington Post suggests ``an increasing \nnumber of intelligence officials, including former and current \nintelligence agency employees, are concerned the agency is tailoring \nits public stance to fit the administration's views.''\n  I do not know whether these reports are accurate. We do know from our \nown national experience, however, that public support for military \naction can evaporate quickly if the American people come to believe \nthey have not been given all of the facts. If that should happen, no \nresolution Congress might pass will be able to unify our Nation. The \nAmerican people expect, and success demands, that they be told both the \nbenefits and the risks involved in any action against Iraq.\n\n[[Page S10242]]\n\n  Second, we need to make clear to the world that the reason we would \nuse force in Iraq is to remove Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass \ndestruction. I would have preferred if this goal had been made explicit \nin this resolution. However, it is clear from this debate that Saddam's \nweapons of mass destruction are the principal threat to the United \nStates and the only threat that would justify the use of the United \nStates military force against Iraq. It is the threat that the President \ncited repeatedly in his speech to the American people on Monday night. \nIt may also be the only threat that can rally the world to support our \nefforts. Therefore, we expect, and success demands, that the \nadministration not lose sight of this essential mission.\n  Third, we need to prepare for what might happen in Iraq after Saddam \nHussein. Regime change is an easy expression for a difficult job. One \nthing we have learned from our action in Afghanistan is that it is \neasier to topple illegitimate regimes than it is to build legitimate \ndemocracies. We will need to do much better in post-Saddam Iraq than \nthe administration has done so far in post-Taliban Afghanistan. Iraq is \ndriven by religious and ethnic differences and demoralized by a \nrepressive government and crushing poverty. It has no experience with \ndemocracy. History tells us it is not enough merely to hope that well-\nintentioned leaders will rise to fill the void that the departure of \nSaddam Hussein would leave. We must help create the conditions under \nwhich such a leader can arise and govern. Unless we want to risk seeing \nIraq go from bad to worse, we must help the Iraqi people build their \npolitical and economic institutions after Saddam. That could take many \nyears and many billions of dollars, which is another reason we must \nbuild a global coalition. The American people expect, and success \ndemands, that we plan for stability and for economic and political \nprogress in Iraq after Saddam.\n  Fourth, we need to minimize the chances that any action we may take \nin Iraq will destabilize the region. Throughout the Persian Gulf, there \nare extremists who would like nothing more than to transform a \nconfrontation with Iraq into a wider war between the Arab world and \nIsrael or the Arab world and the West. What happens if, by acting in \nIraq, we undermine the government in Jordan, a critical ally and a \nstrategic buffer between Iraq and Israel? What happens if we \ndestabilize Pakistan and empower Islamic fundamentalists? Unlike Iraq, \nPakistan already has nuclear weapons and the means to deliver. What \nhappens if that arsenal falls into the hands of al-Qaida or other \nextremists?\n  We can tell the Arab world this is not a fight between their nations \nand ours. But a far better way to maintain stability in the gulf is to \ndemonstrate that by building a global coalition to confront Saddam \nHussein. That is why the administration must make every reasonable \neffort to secure a U.N. resolution just as we did in 1991. With U.N. \nsupport, we can count a number of Arab countries as full allies. \nWithout U.N. support, we cannot even count on their airspace. We \nexpect, and success demands, that any action we take in Iraq will make \nthe region more stable, not less.\n\n  Fifth, and finally, we cannot allow a war in Iraq to jeopardize the \nwar on terrorism. We are fighting terrorist organizations with global \nnetworks, and we need partners around the globe. Some, including the \nchairman of the President's own Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, \ndoubt we can count on this continued cooperation in the war on terror \nif we go to war against Iraq. I do not know if that is true. I do know, \nhowever, that the military intelligence and political cooperation we \nreceive from nations throughout the world are critical to the war on \nterrorism.\n  Saddam Hussein may yet target America. Al-Qaida already has. The \nAmerican people expect, and our national security demands, that the \nadministration make plans to ensure that any action we take in Iraq \ndoes not distract or detract from the war on terror. If they fail to do \nso, any victory we win in Iraq will come at a terrible cost.\n  On Monday night in his speech to the Nation, the President said: The \nsituation could hardly get worse for world security and the people of \nIraq.\n  Yes, it can. If the administration attempts to use the authority in \nthis resolution without doing the work that is required before and \nafter military action in Iraq, the situation there and elsewhere can \nindeed get worse. We could see more turmoil in the Persian Gulf, not \nless. We could see more bloodshed in the Middle East, not less. \nAmericans could find themselves more vulnerable to terrorist attacks, \nnot less.\n  So I stress again, this resolution represents a beginning, not an \nend. If we are going to make America and the world safer, much more \nwork needs to be done before the force authorized in this document is \nused.\n  Some people think it is wrong to ask questions or raise concerns when \nthe President says our national security is at risk. They believe it is \nan act of disloyalty. I disagree. In America, asking questions is an \nact of patriotism. For those of us who have been entrusted by our \nfellow citizens to serve in this Senate, asking questions is more than \na privilege, it is a constitutional responsibility.\n  The American people have serious questions about the course of action \non which this resolution could set us. Given the gravity of the issues \ninvolved and the far-reaching consequences of this course, it is \nessential that their questions are answered. I support this resolution. \nAnd for the sake of the American people, especially those who will be \ncalled to defend our Nation, we must continue to ask questions.\n  On one point, however, I have no question. I believe deeply and \nabsolutely in the courage, the skill, and the devotion of our men and \nwomen in uniform. I know that if it becomes necessary for them to stand \nin harm's way to protect America, they will do so with pride and \nwithout hesitation and they will succeed. They are the finest fighting \nforce the world has ever known. For their sake, for the sake of all \nAmericans, for the world's sake, we must confront Saddam Hussein. But \nwe must do so in a way that avoids making a dangerous situation even \nworse.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished majority \nleader for a very powerful and very clear statement. I, too, join you \nin saying that it is our responsibility to ask questions. Questions \nhave been asked throughout this debate. As best we can, we answered \nthem.\n  But I think the distinguished leader has provided very helpful \nguidance in the uncertain days, months, and perhaps years to come. I \ncommend you. As one of the cosponsors, I welcome your strong support.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Virginia for his kind words.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield to me?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I congratulate our leader. I congratulate \nhim not only for his statement today, but I congratulate him on \nrefusing to stand with other leaders of my party on the White House \nlawn. He has shown leadership. He has kept himself apart, kept himself \nin a position to make decisions. He hasn't rushed, pell-mell, to shake \nthis piece of rag. He has done what leaders should do. He has stood \naside and waited, helped to advise us and counsel with us. He is the \none leader on this Hill in my party who didn't rush to judgment on this \nblank check that we are giving the President of the United States. I \nthank him. I congratulate him. I shall always praise him for that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia for his kind words and for his understanding and \nappreciation for the difficulties we face in this body as we make these \nmomentous decisions.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise to support this amendment by the \ngreat senior Senator from West Virginia. It closely parallels an \namendment which I filed and which, unfortunately, now that the Senate \nhas made its determination to limit the amount of time and debate on \nthis historic decision, I will not be bringing to the Senate for a \nvote.\n  A decision to rush to judgment on this matter has now been made by \nthe Senate. I won't belabor the point except to say that in January of \n1998, after Saddam Hussein had bounced U.N. inspectors out of Iraq, the \nSenate took 5 months to consider and finally approve a resolution which \ndid not even authorize President Clinton to use force. In October, \n1998, the Senate passes another resolution which again did not \nauthorize the President of the United States to use force.\n  In 1990, the Senate took 5 months after Saddam Hussein invaded \nKuwait, and that resolution was passed just days before President Bush \ncommitted this Nation to its first military engagement in the Persian \nGulf war.\n  We have had a number of very valuable hearings in the Senate Armed \nServices Committee in the last weeks. I asked one panel of recently \nretired generals, three of whom were directly involved in the Persian \nGulf war, whether the absence of a Congressional resolution or \ndeclaration of war had in any way prevented or impeded that military \nbuildup preparatory to the engagement in January of 1991. They said, \nno, it did not. So I don't understand why, from any consideration--\nmilitary, diplomatic, or constitutional--we should be voting and \nrushing to this judgment this weekend, but we will.\n  We will be voting on what? What is it, S.J. Res. 46, that we are \nactually voting upon? It is a preapproval of whatever the President of \nthe United States decides to do whenever. It is a vote for euphemisms \nsuch as ``to use force'' or ``as he determines to be necessary.'' Why? \nWhy are we rushing to this judgment at this time? So we can adjourn in \nthe next few days and go home until next January, or until we decide \nwhether the outcome of the November election will aid or impair our own \npolitical agendas?\n\n  Some of those concerns might seem justified, particularly as they \nrelate to our own domestic concerns. But for decisions of war or peace, \ndecisions about what is right for our national security, decisions \nabout the life or death of Americans fighting on our behalf, decisions \nabout the survival of the existing world order and even possibly the \nsurvival of our world as we know it, there are no justifications for \npolitical calculation or personal convenience. There should be only one \nconsideration, and that is to do what is right for the country, as God \ngives each of us to see that right.\n  Yet S.J. Res. 46 preapproves any decision by the President of the \nUnited States to commit this Nation to war at some time in the future, \nwith U.N. support or without it--unilaterally, bilaterally, \nmultilaterally, preventatively, preemptively. Even other amendments \nthat I will support, which have the best of intentions, fall into this \ntrap: What do you do when you are preapproving a war? Put a limit on \nthis but not for that; if this; if that. However, it is very hard to \nforecast events of this magnitude.\n  There is no need for us to try to do so. There are no good reasons \nfor us to do so, except the need to preapprove something and then go \nhome.\n  If we don't vote for the final resolution, we will be accused of not \nsupporting the President, of not speaking with one voice to Saddam \nHussein, to the United Nations, and to the world. Those are very \nserious accusations, that you don't support the President of the United \nStates. I do support the President. He is my President. He is our \nPresident. I pray he will make the right decisions and get the credit. \nI pray he won't make the wrong decisions and get the blame.\n  But when I am asked to support this President, or any President, I \nneed to understand what it is exactly that he wants us to do, what he \nintends for us to support. This President, as I understood his speech \nlast Monday, is certainly not asking the Congress to declare war on \nIraq today. He is wisely reserving that judgment. Why wouldn't we \nexercise the same wisdom?\n  The situation, as we have seen in the last weeks, is inherently \nfluid. New facts become known; old facts even change. I support the \nPresident's reserving judgment until after the United Nations decision, \nuntil it attempts to force Saddam Hussein's compliance, until we can \ndetermine the outcome of those efforts. During those critical days or \nweeks ahead, I will be around. I will be available at any time, day or \nnight, whenever, to participate back here on the Senate floor in this \nmomentous decision. All of us in this Chamber and in the House could be \nhere within hours, should be, and would be if we were called upon to do \nso, whenever the President or this Congress believed that a decision to \ncommit this Nation to war must be made.\n  As the President said Monday night, the time before that decision is \nlimited. But the time for that decision is not now.\n  Another reason to follow this protocol, the reason for my amendment,\n\n[[Page S10244]]\n\nthe reason I support Senator Byrd's amendment, is that it is what the \nConstitution of the United States requires Congress to do--either \ndeclare war or not. It says right in that book--I don't carry it with \nme quite as faithfully as the great Senator from West Virginia, but I \ndo happen to have my copy today--Congress shall declare war. That is \nabout as clear and unambiguous a statement as could be made.\n\n  There are important reasons that Congress was given, and only \nCongress was given, that authority and that responsibility. Because it \nwas considered by our Founders to be essential to the system of checks \nand balances upon which this Republic depends.\n  James Madison wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson in 1798, less than a \ndecade after the Constitution's ratification, in which he said:\n\n       The Constitution supposes, what the History of all \n     Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of \n     power most interested in war, & most prone to it. It has, \n     accordingly, with studied care, vested the question of war in \n     the Legislature. But the Doctrines lately advanced strike at \n     the root of all these provisions, and will deposit the peace \n     of the Country in that Department which the Constitution \n     distrusts as most ready without cause to renounce it. For if \n     the opinion of the President, not the facts & proofs \n     themselves, are to sway the judgment of Congress in declaring \n     war, and if the President in the recess of Congress create a \n     foreign mission, appoint the minister, & negociate [sic] a \n     War Treaty, without the possibility of a check even from the \n     Senate, . . . it is evident that the people are cheated out \n     of the best ingredients of their Government, the safeguards \n     of peace which is the greatest of their blessings.\n\n  The subsequent 204 years have demonstrated many times the wisdom and \nforesight of our Constitution. Its principles should give special pause \nto this body when being admonished by the President, by any President, \nnot to ``tie my hands.'' Those words indicate a regrettable lack of \nregard for Congress and for our constitutional standing as a coequal \nbranch of Government. Our Nation's Founders darn well wanted to tie a \nPresident's hands.\n  Thomas Jefferson wrote:\n\n       In questions of power, then, let no more be heard of \n     confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the \n     chains of the Constitution.\n\n  Those words are meant to apply to this President, to any President. \nExcept in matters of war and peace? Especially in matters of war and \npeace. I would say this, the Constitution's wisdom has a very valuable \nperspective on the pressures and perils we face in this body today. Not \nonly the perils in confronting a dangerous dictator, as we must, but \nalso the perils in how we decide to do so.\n  Some might prefer to avoid the momentous decision the Constitution \nassigns us whether or not to declare war. Whether or not to send \nAmericans into battle halfway around the world, where they would likely \nencounter the chemical or biological weapons we rightfully seek to \nspare this country. Some of those Americans will die too young, and \nothers will suffer horrible wounds lasting for lifetimes. Iraqi \nchildren and their families will be destroyed in their own homes, \nschools, and mosques. The rest of the world will judge that decision \nand its consequences, which they could not escape.\n\n  We will read about it in the newspapers. We will watch its \nmanifestations on television. We will probably attempt to share the \ncredit if it turns out well, and avoid the blame if, God forbid, it \ndoesn't. We will talk about that decision. We might even hold hearings \non it, but we won't assemble in this Chamber where previous Senates \nonce voted declarations of war, but not since World War II.\n  Mr. President, these decisions are ones we will live with for our \nlifetimes. They should not be made in these circumstances. We should \nfollow the guidance we have seen evident from the changes in the \nadministration's views over the last weeks. I support and applaud those \nchanging perspectives. I respect a leader who can listen and learn, \nthen adjust his views and decisions accordingly. I believe the wise \ncounsel from Members of this body--Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents--has been an important part of that process. I believe the \nAmerican people, the collective wisdom of our fellow citizens, who \noverwhelmingly support the President, who overwhelmingly believe the \nPresident should consult with this body, who overwhelmingly believe the \nU.S. should act in concert with the U.N. and other nations of the \nworld, and not alone, unilaterally, preemptively. I believe those \npublic judgments, as we all manage to view them, probably daily in \npolling documents, have had enormous influence on the decisions that \nare going to be made.\n  We owe it to our responsibilities to what is best for this country; \nwe owe it to the brave men and women who will have to carry out those \ndecisions, to make them when they must be made, on the basis of the \nbest, most current, and most complete information possible--knowing, \neven then, that we will still not have the certainty, clarity, \nforesight we would wish to have.\n  That is the wisdom of the Constitution. That is the wisdom of Senator \nByrd's amendment. That is, I believe, the wisdom of the amendment I \nwould have brought forth, which says simply the Congress shall go back \nto following the Constitution of the United States. The reasons for \nthat document's decisions are as valid today as they were 213 years \nago, and maybe some day--it will not be this week but soon, this body \nwill review the decision not to follow its dictates and return to it. I \nlook forward to that and, hopefully, Senator Byrd will be on the floor \nthat day, as he deserves to be when that decision is made.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. Mr. President, \nI wish to respond to a couple of the statements made by the junior \nSenator from Minnesota. I don't think they are actually correct in \ncategorizing what happened in 1998. I believe I heard him say then we \nwere very deliberative and the resolution we passed did not authorize \nthe use of force. Well, I will show you what we did in 1998.\n  In 1998, Saddam Hussein had continued his defiance of the U.N. He had \nnot complied with any of the 16 resolutions. So the U.S. passed a \nresolution saying he should comply, Public Law 105-235, on August 14th. \nBut the deliberative portion was introduced before the Senate on July \n31, 1998--placed on the calendar July 27, measure laid before the \nSenate on July 31--and it passed the Senate with an amendment by \nunanimous consent. So it passed in one day. I don't remember the number \nof hours spent in debate, but it wasn't a lot. To say we spent \nmonths deliberating it is not accurate. The fact is we passed it in one \nday. And then to say it had no authorization for force, I don't believe \nis actually correct either. If you look at the resolved section--I put \nthe 1998 resolution in the calendar because I think it is important. It \ngoes through several items of noncompliance by Iraq. Basically, we are \nsaying we should force or compel Iraq to comply. The resolved section \nsays:\n\n       . . . the United States of America and Congress assembled, \n     find the government of Iraq in a material and unacceptable \n     breach of its international obligations, and therefore the \n     President is urged to take appropriate action in accordance \n     with the Constitution and relevant laws of the United States \n     to bring Iraq into compliance with international obligations.\n\n  I believe in the appropriate action Congress was saying with a united \nvoice: Take military action, if necessary, to get Saddam Hussein to \ncomply with the U.N. resolution. That is what this resolution stated. \nWe passed it unanimously. We also passed, in 1998, the Iraqi Liberation \nAct. This act did not authorize any additional military force. That is \ncorrect with this act, but not with Public Law 105-235.\n  When someone says we didn't authorize force in 1998--yes, we did. The \nIraqi Liberation Act didn't have an authorization of force, but it did \ninclude a change of regime. It said Saddam Hussein should go. Again, we \nspoke with a united voice. We passed that by a voice vote. I might \nmention this to my colleagues. In the House, it passed by 360-38. In \nthe Senate, we received it from the House on October 6 and passed it in \nthe Senate on October 7. We passed it by unanimous consent. We passed \nit without objection.\n  This resolution says it should be the policy of the U.S. to have a \nregime change. That became the law of the land. It passed unanimously \nin the Senate with an overwhelming vote in the House. Then, the earlier \nresolution that passed on August 14 said the President is urged to take \nappropriate action to compel compliance with existing U.N. resolutions. \nThat was a\n\n[[Page S10245]]\n\nstrong, united voice. Congress spoke together, overwhelmingly. It was \nnot unanimous in the House, but it was unanimous in the Senate. Both of \nthese resolutions passed in one day.\n  So for people who are saying we haven't been deliberative enough, and \nwhat is the consequence of this--what has changed? This Congress, \nDemocrats and Republicans, this Senate unanimously told President \nClinton to compel compliance. Also, we stated it was the public policy \nof Congress to have a regime change in Iraq. I want to clarify the \nRecord and make sure we are factually accurate.\n  Congress spoke in a united fashion in 1998. It was proud to be part \nof that then, and I am proud to be part of the sponsorship of this \nresolution, which I believe will also pass with a very strong voice--\nafter much more extensive debate than we had in 1998. I thank my friend \nfor yielding me the time.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Not on our time. If the Senator from West Virginia would \nlike to yield the Senator time, I would be more than happy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Minnesota \nthat he has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I will use that 1\\1/2\\ minutes to respond. I was not here \nwhen those events occurred. I rely on the authorities and information \navailable to me. I will note Senator Lott was quoted in several \npublications. On February 12, the then-majority leader said:\n\n       I had hoped that we could get to the point where we can \n     pass a resolution this week on Iraq. But we really developed \n     some physical problems, if nothing else. . . . So we have \n     decided that the most important thing is not to move so \n     quickly, but to make sure that we have had all the right \n     questions asked and answered and that we have available to us \n     the latest information about what is . . . happening with our \n     allies in the world.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The Senate is known for its deliberative actions. And the \n     longer I stay in the Senate, the more I have learned to \n     appreciate it. It does help to give us time to think about \n     the potential problems and the risks and ramifications and \n     to, frankly, press the administration.\n\n  The majority leader made that statement on the Senate floor on \nFebruary 12. The resolution was passed and signed by President Clinton \nAugust 14, 1998, 6 months later.\n  Also, I am not a legal scholar, but in making my comments I cited the \nopinion of counsel at the Library of Congress and its Congressional \nResearch Services. They opined--I realize lawyers and others can \ndisagree----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask for unanimous consent that I have 30 seconds more \nto finish my remarks.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the Senator 2 minutes or whatever he needs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dayton's name be \nadded as a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, the opinion stated its judgment that since the \ndocument in 1998 urged the President to follow the actions which the \nSenator from Oklahoma has accurately described, it did not constitute \nan authorization under the War Powers Act. Furthermore, in the absence \nof any reference to authorization under the War Powers Act, which the \nresolution before us today contains, it did not provide that authority. \nI thank the Chair. I yield back time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 29 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. How many minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-nine.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat my time on this amendment not count against my hour under cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BYRD. This shows the patience of a Senator. This clearly \ndemonstrates that the train is coming down on us like a Mack truck, and \nwe are not even going to consider a few extra minutes for this Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my friend from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in deference----\n  Mr. BYRD. On the Senator's time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. On my time. In deference to the Senator from West \nVirginia, on this one occasion, given all the circumstances, I will not \nobject to it not counting against the Senator's hour.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished President pro \ntempore for yielding me 5 minutes.\n  I do support his amendment which has two provisions. First:\n\n       Nothing . . . is intended to alter the constitutional \n     authorities of the Congress to declare war, grant letters of \n     Marque and Reprisal, or other authorities invested in \n     Congress by Section 8, Article I of the Constitution.\n\n  I think this provision is necessary, although customarily you would \nnot think that you would need a statute to say the Constitution \ngoverns. However, I have expressed on the floor of the Senate my \nconcern of the constitutionality of the delegation of authority to the \nPresident here.\n  Congress has the authority to declare war. The authorization for the \nuse of force is a practical equivalent. What we are doing is saying the \nPresident may decide when to use that force and, in effect, decide when \nthe war will start, or really to make a determination as to when war is \ndeclared. So I think that it is important to have this sort of \nprovision, although its importance is hard to evaluate historically.\n  The second part of the pending amendment of the Senator from West \nVirginia is:\n\n       . . . shall be construed as granting any authority to the \n     President to use the United States Armed Forces for any \n     purpose not directly related to a clear threat of imminent, \n     sudden, and direct attack upon the United States, its \n     possessions, or territories, or the Armed Forces of the \n     United States, unless the Congress of the United States \n     otherwise authorizes.\n\n  The language of ``clear threat of imminent, sudden, and direct \nattack'' has been inserted in place of the language ``the existing \nthreat posed by Iraq.'' This does call for a more precise determination \nof the need for preemptive action, and I think is sound. Ultimately, it \nis not going to detract from the authority of the President because the \nresolution allows the President to ``use all means that he deems to be \nappropriate,'' which is very broad authority.\n  The language of the pending Byrd amendment is consistent with one of \nthe earliest articulations of the concept of self-defense. Secretary of \nState Daniel Webster in 1842, referring to self-defense in an \nanticipatory sense, stated that its use be ``confined to cases in which \nthe necessity of that self-defense is instant, overwhelming, and \nleaving no choice of means and no moment of deliberation.''\n  Hugo Grotius, considered the father of international law, said in his \n1925 treatise that a nation may use self-defense in anticipation of \nattack when there is ``present danger,'' which is a broader definition. \nGrotius further said:\n\n       It is lawful to kill him who is preparing to kill.\n\n  Elihu Root, a distinguished scholar on international law, said in \n1914 that international law did not require a nation to wait to use \nforce in self-defense ``until it is too late to protect itself.''\n\n  I think the language of the pending amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom West Virginia is helpful in providing assurance that preemptive \nforce is really necessary. We know President Bush said he does not \nintend to use this military force unless absolutely necessary and has \nalready made a determination that he thinks there is an imminent threat \nfrom Iraq. Some of the information which has been presented,\n\n[[Page S10246]]\n\npartly in closed session, supports the President's concern along that \nline, but I do think this language is helpful. Therefore, I support it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I wish to say very briefly that I \nunderstand people have a desire to speak. We have a number of Senators \nwho have not spoken on this issue. It is already looking as if we may \nbe here well into this evening. From now on, I will be adhering \nstrictly to the rules according to postcloture. I hope my colleagues \nwill be understanding because we have to resolve this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I believe the distinguished Democratic \nwhip was able to get unanimous consent last night for my amendment No. \n4868 to be modified to remove paragraph 2. It so states in the \nCongressional Record on page S10217; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair believes the Record is in error and \nthat only amendment No. 4869 was modified.\n  Mr. BYRD. On what basis--Madam President, I hope this time is not \nbeing charged. We are trying to clarify something.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. On what basis does the Chair maintain that the Record is in \nerror in that portion of the Record from which I read on page S10217? \nWhat is the basis for the Chair stating that Record portion is in \nerror?\n  I do not question the integrity of the Chair. I am only asking why \ndoes the Chair state--I know the Chair is being advised to that \neffect--why are we to say that this Record, as it is clearly written, \nis in error?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is relying on the Journal of \nproceedings.\n  Mr. BYRD. And what does the Journal say?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Journal indicates that only amendment No. \n4869 was modified.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I ask the distinguished majority whip, is that \nstatement by the Chair in accordance with his understanding?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from West Virginia, I read directly from \nthe paper that the Senator gave me. There were two unanimous consent \nrequests on it. The one was not acceptable. The other was, and I read \nthat into the Record. As I recall, it was changing section 4 to 3, or 3 \nto 4. That is what I submitted.\n  Mr. BYRD. There were two requests, one changing the section numbers, \nand I am sure that one was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. The other one, according to this Record, was also agreed \nto.\n  Mr. REID. No. That is the only one that--in fact, I said on the \nRecord the other was not agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I read the Record. It is very short.\n\n       Mr. REID. Mr. President, this has been cleared with the \n     minority. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Byrd, I ask \n     unanimous consent to modify his amendment No. 4868 to remove \n     paragraph 2, and further I ask consent to modify amendment \n     No. 4869 to change references to section 3(a) to 4(a).\n       The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from West Virginia, I had the paper here \nand the clerk took that paper. Maybe they made a mistake. But there is \nno question in my mind whatsoever--as I told the Senator this morning \nwhen he came in--that the one had been approved, the other had not.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. The whip did tell me that, but when I looked at the \nRecord, I saw, by the Record at least, it said that both requests were \nagreed to. I am not going to argue this point. I am going to take the \ndistinguished whip's word, which is good for me at all times.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from West Virginia, I appreciate that \nvery much. In fact, there are a lot of things going on I may not be \nquite certain on, but I am absolutely, unqualifiedly certain of what I \ndid last night.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I have absolute and complete faith in the \nintegrity of the distinguished Senator from Nevada, and I thank the \nChair, with the greatest of respect. I thank the Assistant \nParliamentarian as well, for whom I have the greatest respect.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-three minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. On this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this amendment, that is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, a point I want to make about this \ndiscussion that ensued after the statement was made by the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota: There were references made to \nPublic Law 105-235, August 14, 1998. Here is the resolving clause which \nhas been quoted by the distinguished Republican whip:\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, . . . .\n       That the government of Iraq is in material and unacceptable \n     breach of its international obligations, and therefore the \n     President is urged to take appropriate action in accordance \n     with the Constitution and relevant laws of the United States, \n     to bring Iraq into compliance with its international \n     obligations. Approved August 14, 1998.\n\n  Well, so what? What does that prove? What does that prove? Somebody \ntell me. Let's read it again. The resolving clause says that the \nGovernment of Iraq is in material and unacceptable breach of its \ninternational obligations. That is okay. But get this: And therefore \nthe President is urged to take appropriate action.\n\n  What does that mean? There is nothing definitive about that. That is \nambiguous. It is not contemporaneous with today's question. It is \nambiguous. It is vague. What would that prove in a court if the Supreme \nCourt of the United States were to take this up? What would those who \nread this piece of junk maintain that this says? It is plain. The \nPresident is urged--well, what does that mean, ``urged''?--to take \nappropriate action. What is that? That is not a declaration of war. \nWhat is that? What does that mean, ``to take appropriate action''? \nWell, you can guess, I can guess, he can guess, he can guess. Anybody \ncan guess.\n  ``Urges the President to take appropriate action in accordance with \nthe Constitution . . . .'' Now, that is fine. It is in accordance with \nthe Constitution. Then that would say that Congress has the power to \ndeclare war.\n  ``In accordance with the Constitution and relevant laws of the United \nStates, to bring Iraq into compliance with its international \nobligations.'' What is he supposed to do? What is the President being \nurged to do to bring Iraq into compliance with its international \nobligations? Anybody's guess. Why, surely this great country of ours is \nnot going to be able to launch a war on the basis of that ambiguous and \nvague language.\n  I wish those who are continuing to refer to this Public Law 105-235 \nand the so-called relevant U.N. resolutions would explain what they \nmean. I hear that over and over again. In connection with the \nresolution that is before this Senate today, it refers to all relevant \nU.N. Security Council resolutions. ``All relevant . . . .'' What does \nthat mean? And they keep referring to 660 and 678 and 687. I would like \nto discuss those resolutions with those who will do so. I hope they \ncome on the floor. Where are they? Where are these men of great \nstrength? Let them come to the floor. I want to debate with them these \nso-called resolutions.\n  In this resolution that is before the Senate, S.J. Res. 46, it refers \nto relevant resolutions. They keep talking about the relevant \nresolutions. What resolutions are they talking about enforcing? Are \nthey talking about 660? Are they talking about 678? No. 678 was adopted \non November 29, 1990. Is that what they are talking about? U.N. \nResolution 687 was the enforcement resolution. That was the resolution \nthat authorized the member states to act to uphold Resolution No. 660. \nBut that conferring of authorization was wiped out. No. 678 was wiped \nout by 687 when Iraq contacted the Security Council and accepted 687. \nIt was wiped out. So I am prepared to argue that. I do not want to do \nit on my flimsy 1 hour, but I am prepared.\n  I have heard the Senator from Connecticut--he is not in the Chamber \nright now, but he will be back. I have heard him and others refer to \nthe so-called relevant resolutions. They have been wiped out. They are \ngone, and no single member state can revive them. They were \nextinguished on April 6,\n\n[[Page S10247]]\n\n1991, when Iraq signified to the Security Council that it accepted the \nterms of 687.\n  Now we can talk about that at a later time. I would love to get into \nit. I would like to get into a discussion on that, but for now, suffice \nit to say, what I am saying is this resolution we are talking about \nwould accept as fact certain things that are not facts--this blank \ncheck we have been talking about that we are going to turn over to this \nPresident of the United States, the power to determine when, where, \nhow, and for how long he will use the military forces of the United \nStates. It is flimsy. That resolution is full of holes. The whereas \nclauses are full of holes. Now they have been wiped out by unanimous \nconsent so they are no longer ``whereas'' but ``since.'' It is flimsy. \nFull of holes. Ambiguities. Statements of facts that are not facts. I \nam ready to debate that at any time.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I hope Members will carefully read this amendment by \nSenator Byrd. This amendment says two things. One of these things \nshould not even be controversial. It asserts the constitutional \nauthority of this Chamber and the U.S. Congress to declare war. The \nSenator and I have stood together on this floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Here it is, my Constitution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thought you might have your Constitution with you.\n  The Senator and I have stood on the floor and argued this point. \nSometimes we did not fare so well. Keep in mind there was a question at \nthe beginning of this debate about Iraq as to whether or not Congress \nwould be engaged. Some argued that the President had the authority of \nhis father's resolutions.\n  The second point made by Senator Byrd in this resolution is one I \nhope you will read carefully because I address part of this in an \namendment I will offer later. He establishes a standard by which we \nwould declare war. A standard is stated clearly: A clear threat of \nimminent, sudden, direct attack upon the United States, its possessions \nor territories, or the Armed Forces.\n  I hope Members of the Senate will read that. If that is not a \nstandard by which we will measure whether this Nation will dedicate its \nArmed Forces and risk the lives of Americans in combat and the lives of \ninnocent victims, I cannot imagine what we are going to debate. To take \nany other standard is to take the power away from Congress to declare \nwar. This is a constitutional resolution. I applaud the Senator from \nWest Virginia for offering it.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope Senators will show an abundance of mercy before the \nday is over and perhaps give me some more time.\n  Mr. President, this week the Senate is considering a very important \nresolution. The language of this resolution has been touted as a \nbipartisan compromise that addresses the concerns of both the White \nHouse and the Democratic leadership in Congress. But the only thing \nthat I see being compromised in this resolution is this Constitution of \nthe United States, which I hold in my hand, and the power that \nConstitution gives to Congress to declare war. This resolution we are \nconsidering is a dangerous step toward a government in which one man at \nthe other end of this avenue holds in his hand the power to use the \nworld's most powerful military force in whatever manner he chooses, \nwhenever he chooses, wherever he chooses, and wherever he perceives a \nthreat against national security.\n  The Bush administration has announced a new security doctrine that \nadvocates acting preemptively to head off threats to U.S. national \nsecurity. Much has been said about the diplomatic problem with this \ndoctrine. But we should also recognize that the administration's new \napproach to war may also pose serious problems for our own \nconstitutional system.\n  In the proposed use-of-force resolution, the White House lawyers \nclaim ``the President has authority under the Constitution to use force \nin order to defend the national security interests of the United \nStates.''\n  It says no such thing. I dare them to go to the Constitution and \npoint out where that Constitution says what they say it said. They \ncannot do it. I know the job of any good lawyer--I have never been a \npracticing lawyer, but I know the job of a good lawyer is to craft \nlegal interpretations that are most beneficial to the client. But for \nthe life of me, I cannot find any basis for such a broad, expansive \ninterpretation in the interpretation of the Constitution of the United \nStates. Find it. Show it to me. You can't do it.\n  Where in the Constitution is it written that the title of Commander \nin Chief carries with it the power to decide unilaterally whether to \ncommit the resources of the United States to war? Show it to me, \nlawyers, lawyers of the White House, or lawyers in this body. Show it.\n  There is a dangerous agenda, believe me, underlying these broad \nclaims by this White House. The President is hoping to secure power \nunder the Constitution that no President has ever claimed before. \nNever. He wants the power--the Bush administration wants that President \nto have power to launch this Nation into war without provocation and \nwithout clear evidence of an imminent attack on the United States. And \nwe are going to be foolish enough to give it to him. I never thought I \nwould see the day in these 44 years I have been in this body, never did \nI think I would see the day when we would cede this kind of power to \nany President. The White House lawyers have redefined the President's \npower under the Constitution to repel sudden acts against the United \nStates. And he has that power, to repel sudden, unforeseen \nattacks against the United States, against its possessions, its \nterritories, and its Armed Forces.\n\n  But they suggest he could also justify military action whenever there \nis a high risk of a surprise attack. That Constitution, how they would \nlove to stretch it to give this President that power which he does not \nhave. Those White House lawyers would have us believe that the \nPresident has independent authority not only to repel attacks but to \nprevent them. How silly. You cannot find it in that Constitution.\n  The White House wants to redefine the President's implied power under \nthe Constitution to repel sudden attacks, suggesting that the realities \nof the modern world justify preemptive military action whenever there \nis a high risk of a surprise attack. What in the world are they \nteaching in law school these days? What are they teaching? I never \nheard of such as that when I was in law school. Of course I had to go \nat night. I had to go 10 years to get my law degree. In the national \nsecurity strategy released last week, a few days ago, the President \nargued--let me tell you what the President argued--we must adapt the \nconcept of imminent threat to the capabilities of today's adversary. \nGet that.\n  Defense Secretary Rumsfeld echoed this sentiment when he told the \nSenate Armed Services Committee: I suggest that any who insist on \nperfect evidence are back in the 20th century and still thinking in \npre-9/11 years.\n  What a profound statement that was. How profound. Perhaps the \nSecretary of Defense ought to go back to law school, too. I don't \nbelieve he was taught that in law school.\n  The President does not want to shackle his new doctrine of 20th \ncentury ideas of war and security, much less any outdated notion from \nthe 18th century about how this Republic should go to war. The Bush \nadministration thinks the Constitution, with its inefficient separation \nof powers and its cumbersome checks and balances--they are cumbersome--\nhas become an anachronism in a world of international terrorism and \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  They say it is too old. This Constitution, which I hold in my hand, \nis an anachronism. It is too old. It was all right back in the 19th \ncentury. It was all right in the 20th century. But we are living in a \nnew time, a new age. There it is, right up there, inscribed, ``Novus \nordo seclorum.'' A new order of the ages. New order of the ages.\n  This modern President does not have time for old-fashioned political \nideas that complicate his job of going after the bad guys single-\nhandedly.\n  And make no mistake, the resolution we are considering will allow the \nPresident to go it alone at every stage of the\n\n[[Page S10248]]\n\nprocess. It will be President Bush, by himself, who defines the \nnational security interests of the United States. It will be President \nBush, by himself, who identifies threats to our national security. It \nwill be President Bush, by himself, who decides when those threats \njustify a bloody and costly war. And it will be President Bush, by \nhimself, who determines what the objectives of such a war should be, \nand when it should begin and when it should end.\n  The most dangerous part of this modernized approach to war is the \nwide latitude the President will have to identify which threats present \na ``high risk'' to national security. The administration's National \nSecurity Strategy briefly outlines a few common attributes shared by \ndangerous ``rogue states,'' but the administration is careful not to \nconfine its doctrine to any fixed set of objective criteria for \ndetermining when the threat posed by any one of these states is \nsufficient to warrant preemptive action.\n  The President's doctrine--and we are about to put our stamp on it, \nthe stamp of this Senate. The President's doctrine, get this, gives \nhim--Him? Who is he? He puts his britches on just the same way I do. He \nis a man. I respect his office. But look what we are turning over to \nthis man, one man.\n  The President's doctrine gives him a free hand to justify almost any \nmilitary action with unsubstantiated allegations and arbitrary risk \nassessments.\n  Even if Senators accept the argument that the United States does not \nhave to wait until it has been attacked before acting to protect its \ncitizens, the President does not have the power to decide when and \nwhere such action is justified, especially when his decision is \nsupported only by fear and speculation. The power to make that decision \nbelongs here in Congress. That is where it belongs. That is where this \nConstitution vests it. The power to make this decision belongs to \nCongress and Congress alone.\n  Ultimately, Congress must decide whether the threat posed by Iraq is \ncompelling enough to mobilize this Nation to war. Deciding questions of \nwar is a heavy burden for every Member of Congress. It is the most \nserious responsibility imposed on us by the Constitution. We should not \nshrink from our duty to provide authority to the President where action \nis needed. But just as importantly, we should not shrink from our \nconstitutional duty to decide for ourselves whether launching this \nNation into war is an appropriate response to the threats facing our \npeople--those people looking, watching this debate through that \nelectronic lens there. They are the ones who will have to suffer. It is \ntheir sons and daughters whose blood will be spilled. Our ultimate duty \nis not to the President. They say: Give the President the benefit of \nthe doubt. Why, how sickening that idea is. Our ultimate duty is not to \nthe President of the United States. I don't give a darn whether he is a \nDemocrat or Republican or an Independent--whatever. It makes no \ndifference. I don't believe that our ultimate duty is to him. Our \nultimate duty is to the people out there who elected us.\n  Our duty is not to rubber-stamp the language of the President's \nresolution, but to honor the text of the Constitution. Our duty is not \nto give the President a blank check to enforce his foreign policy \ndoctrine, but to exercise our legislative power to protect the national \nsecurity interests of this Republic.\n  Our constitutional system was designed to prevent the executive from \nplunging the Nation into war in the name of contrived ideals and \npolitical ambitions. The nature of the threats posed by a sudden attack \non the United States may have changed dramatically since the time when \nConstitution was drafted, but the reasons for limiting the war powers \nof the President have not changed at all. In fact, the concerns of the \nFramers are even more relevant. Talk about this being old fashioned. \nThe concerns of the Framers are even more relevant to the dangerous \nglobal environment in which our military must now operate, because the \nconsequences of unchecked military action may be more severe for our \ncitizens than ever before.\n\n  Congress has the sole power under the Constitution to decide whether \nthe threat posed by Iraq is compelling enough to mobilize this nation \nto war, and no Presidential doctrine can change that. If President Bush \nwants our foreign policy to include any military action, whether for \npreemption, containment, or any other objective, he must first convince \nCongress that such a policy is in the best interest of the American \npeople.\n  The amendment I am offering reaffirms the obligation of the Congress \nto decide whether this country should go to war. It makes clear that \nCongress retains this power, even in the event that we pass this broad \nlanguage, which I believe gives the President a blank check to initiate \nwar whenever he wants, wherever he wants, and against any perceived \nenemy he can link to Iraq. My amendment makes clear that the President \nhas the power to respond to the threat of an imminent, sudden, and \ndirect attack by Iraq against the United States, and that any military \naction that does not serve this purpose must be specifically authorized \nby the Congress.\n  Other Senators have said on the floor that the language of this \nresolution does not give the President a blank check, and they have \nsaid that this resolution is narrowly tailored to Iraq. I do not read \nthe resolution that way, but I hope that the President does. I hope the \nPresident reads this resolution as a narrowly crafted authorization to \ndeal with Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and not as an open-ended \nendorsement of his doctrine of preemptive military action.\n  We should all hope that the President does not fully exercise his \nauthority under this resolution, and that he does not abuse the \nimprecise language Congress may ultimately adopt. But I believe that \nCongress must do more than give the President a blank check and then \nstand aside and hope for the best. Congress must make clear that this \nresolution does not affect its constitutional power to declare war \nunder Article I, section 8 of the Constitution; otherwise, this \nresolution may appear to delegate this important legislative function \nto the executive\n  My amendment also clarifies the intent of this resolution is limited \nto authorizing a military response to the threat of an Iraqi attack \nupon the United States. Congress must ensure that the broad language of \nthis resolution does not allow the President to use this authority to \nact outside the boundaries of his constitutional powers. This amendment \naffirms the constitutional requirement that the President must have \ncongressional authorization before initiating military action for any \npurpose other than defending the United States against an imminent, \nsudden, and direct attack. We must not provide the temptation to this \nPresident, or any president, to unleash the dogs of war for reasons \nbeyond those anticipated by the Congress.\n  The power of Congress to declare war is a political check on the \nPresident's ability to arbitrarily commit the United States to changing \nmilitary doctrines, and the evolving nature of war and security threats \ndoes not change the language of the Constitution. The President cannot \nuse the uncertainty of terrorist threats to confuse the clearly defined \npolitical processes required by the Constitution, and Congress should \nnot rush to endorse a doctrine that will commit untold American \nresources to unknown military objectives.\n  The President admits in his National Security Strategy that \n``America's constitution has served us well.'' But his actions suggest \nthat he feels this service is no longer needed. Congress should ensure \nthat the Constitution continues to serve our national security \ninterests by preventing the United States from plunging headlong into \nan ever-growing war in the Middle East. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment in order to preserve the constitutional system of checks \nand balances that the founders of this republic valued so highly.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I would like to be recognized on a \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, based on the conversation I had earlier \ntoday, with everybody--Senator Byrd--about what is not in the Record, \none of the things we did not do is dispose of the other amendments. \nReciting from the Record, I said we\n\n[[Page S10249]]\n\nwill dispose--they will offer no other amendments tomorrow.\n  That is today, speaking for Senator Durbin, Senator Boxer, and \nSenator Levin. So I ask unanimous consent that their other amendments \nat the desk be withdrawn from the desk.\n  Mr. BYRD. What is the request?\n  Mr. REID. I was reading from the Record that the amendments of \nDurbin, Boxer, and Levin are not going to be offered. They are being \nwithdrawn from the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator asking the amendments be \nrecalled?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Dayton would also ask his be recalled. I ask \nunanimous consent that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is recalled.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, the case that the Senator from West \nVirginia makes is a good case on the merits of whether or not we \nshould, in fact, delegate this authority, but I am confused by the \nargument that constitutionally we are unable to delegate that \nauthority.\n  Historically, the way in which the delegation of the authority under \nthe constitutional separation of powers doctrine functions is there \nhave to be some parameters to the delegation. For example, we could not \ndelegate to the President the authority to pick and confirm any Supreme \nCourt Justice he wanted to confirm.\n  The essence of the constitutional argument which my friend from West \nVirginia makes is, I assume, that there are no parameters to this \ndelegation; therefore, the delegation per se is unconstitutional. I \nassume that is the rationale. But as I read this grant of authority, it \nis not so broad as to make it unconstitutional for us, under the war \nclause of the Constitution, to delegate to the President the power to \nuse force if certain conditions exist. My time is about up, but I would \nargue that in section 4(a), subsections (1) and (2), the conjunctive \n``and'' instead of ``or'' exists, which means that as a practical \nmatter in reading this, the only circumstance the President could find, \nin my view, that the national security was being threatened would be as \nit relates to the resolutions relating to weapons of mass destruction. \nBut I will speak to that later. I appreciate my friend yielding me the \ntime.\n  But, again, constitutionally, this resolution meets the test of our \nability to delegate. It is not an overly broad delegation which would \nmake it per se unconstitutional, in my view.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, according to the letter of the Byrd \namendment, a clear threat of imminent, sudden, and direct attack upon \nthe United States, its possessions or territories, et cetera, clearly \nwould have, would absolutely deprive the President of the United States \nof what he is seeking today. It would deprive the President of the \nUnited States of the authority he has requested to compel Saddam \nHussein to disarm, so let's have no doubt about the impact of this \namendment.\n  The President has spoken clearly of the threat Saddam Hussein's \nregime poses to America and the world today--even though Iraq today \nclearly does not meet the Byrd amendment's standard of threatening \nimminent, sudden, and direct attack upon the United States of our Armed \nForces. To wait for Saddam Hussein to threaten imminent attack against \nAmerica would be to acquiesce to his development of nuclear weapons, to \nignore his record of aggression against his neighbors, and to disregard \nhis continuing threats to destroy Israel.\n  Failure now to make the choice to remove Saddam Hussein from power \nwill leave us with choices later, when Saddam's inevitable acquisition \nof nuclear weapons will make it much more dangerous to defend our \nfriends and interests in the region. It will permit Saddam to control \nmuch of the region, and to wield its resources in ways that can only \nweaken America's position. It will put Israel's very survival at risk, \nwith moral consequences no American can welcome.\n  Failure to end the danger posed by Saddam Hussein's Iraq makes it \nmore likely that the interaction we believe to have occurred between \nmembers of al-Qaida and Saddam's regime may increasingly take the form \nof active cooperation to target the United States.\n  We live in a world in which international terrorists continue to this \nday to plot mass murder in America. Saddam Hussein unquestionably has \nstrong incentives to cooperate with al-Qaida. Whatever they may or may \nnot have in common, their overwhelming hostility to America and \nrejection of any moral code suggest that collaboration against us would \nbe natural. It is all too imaginable. Whether or not it has yet \nhappened, the odds favor it--and they are not odds the United States \ncan accept.\n  Standing by while an odious regime with a history of support for \nterrorism develops weapons whose use by terrorists could literally kill \nmillions of Americans is not a choice. It is an abdication. In this new \nera, preventive action to target rogue regimes is not only imaginable \nbut necessary.\n  Who would not have attacked Osama bib Laden's network before \nSeptember 11th had we realized that his intentions to bring harm to \nAmerica were matched by the capability to do so? Who would not have \nheeded Churchill's call to stand up to Adolf Hitler in the 1930's, \nwhile Europe slept and appeasement fed the greatest threat to Western \ncivilization the world had ever known? Who would not have supported \nIsrael's bombing of Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981 had we then known, \nas Israel knew, that Saddam was on the verge of developing the bomb?\n  In the new era we entered last September, warning of an attack before \nit happens is a luxury we cannot expect. Waiting for imminence of \nattack could be catastrophic. Many fear we will not know of an attack \nuntil it happens--and should our enemies use weapons of mass \ndestruction in such an attack, the deaths of thousands or millions of \nAmericans could occur with no warning--as happened last September. In \nthis age, to wait for our enemies to come to us is suicidal.\n  In 1962, President Kennedy made the point that America cannot wait \nuntil we face the threat of open attack without gravely endangering our \nsecurity. In President Kennedy's words, ``Neither the United States of \nAmerica, nor the world community of nations can tolerate deliberate \ndeception and offensive threats on the part of any nation, large or \nsmall. We no longer live in a world where only the actual firing of \nweapons represents a sufficient challenge to a nation's security to \nconstitute maximum peril.''\n  The Byrd amendment would overturn the doctrine announced by the \nPresident of the United States to guide his administration's conduct of \nAmerican national security policy. The Byrd amendment would negate any \nCongressional resolution authorizing the President to use all means to \nprotect America from the threat posed by Iraq. It would set such a high \nthreshold for the use of military force as to render the Commander in \nChief powerless to respond to the clear and present danger Saddam \nHussein's regime poses to America and the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Byrd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, this is one of the confusing aspects of \nthis debate. I find myself supporting this resolution but worried that \nsupporting this resolution will get us into real trouble.\n  We use Saddam, Hitler, and al-Qaida all in the same verbiage and \nlanguage. Let me make the real distinction, as I see it, regarding \npreemption.\n  If we knew that al-Qaida had particular weapons, knowing, as we did, \nwhat their stated objective was, and with the intelligence we had, we \nwould be fully within our rights--not under\n\n[[Page S10250]]\n\nany doctrine of preemption--because of the existence of a clear, \npresent, and imminent danger to move against al-Qaida.\n  Conversely, with Hitler in the 1930s, the rationale for moving \nagainst Hitler wasn't a doctrine of preemption because we knew he was a \nbad guy. It was because his country signed the Treaty of Versailles. He \nwas violating the Treaty of Versailles. The Treaty of Versailles did \nnot have an end date on it. It didn't say you cannot have forces for \nthe first 2 or 3 years, or you cannot do the following things. We were \nfully within our rights as a world community to go after Hitler in \n1934, 1935, 1936, or 1937. It was not based on the doctrine of \npreemption but a doctrine of enforcement of the Treaty of Versailles, \nand in a very limited time.\n  What we have here, I argue, as the rationale for going after Saddam, \nis that he signed a cease-fire agreement. The condition for his \ncontinuing in power was the elimination of his weapons of mass \ndestruction, and the permission to have inspectors in to make sure he \nhad eliminated them. He expelled those inspectors. So he violated the \ncease-fire; ergo, we have authority--not under a doctrine of \npreemption. This will not be a preemptive strike, if we go with the \nrest of the world. It will be an enforcement strike.\n  I hope we don't walk out of here with my voting for this final \ndocument and somebody 6 months from now or 6 years from now will say we \nhave the right now to establish this new doctrine of preemption and go \nwherever we want anytime.\n  The part on which I do empathize with my friend from West Virginia is \nthis is not a very clearly written piece of work. That is why I think \nSenator Lugar and myself and others had a better way of doing this. But \nit does incorporate with the President's words the notion that we are \noperating relative to weapons of mass destruction and U.S. security \ninterests and enforcement--not preemption.\n  I conclude by saying that the President started his speech explaining \nthe reason why he wanted his resolution on Monday. I guess it was \nMonday. And he said at the very outset that this is based upon \nenforcing what was committed to in dealing with weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  I know my time is up. I will speak to this more later.\n  I am opposed to the Byrd amendment, but I hope we don't establish \nsome totally new doctrine in our opposition to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. I \nappreciate what the Senator from Delaware just said. I think it makes a \nlot of sense.\n  I have many concerns about this amendment, but two stick out to me as \nI read it. My concern is that, under this rationale, if we were told we \nhad good intelligence and we were convinced that within, let us say, 6 \nmonths we were going to be attacked, it would still not fit the \ndefinition of imminent and sudden.\n  As I read it, the threat must be an imminent, sudden, and direct \nattack upon the United States. A sudden attack of 6 months would not \nqualify. It might be imminent, but it certainly wouldn't be sudden. I \ndon't think we can afford that luxury.\n  Second, our allies are totally excluded. Do we want to announce to \nthe world that there must be only an imminent, sudden, direct attack \nupon the United States, its possessions, territories, and our Armed \nForces, leaving our allies in that particular part of the world totally \nundefended by the United States? I don't think that is a message we \nwant to send.\n  I respectfully oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, in summary, this amendment regarding the \npreservation of Congress's constitutional authority is unnecessary. A \nportion of the amendment that would limit the authority of the \nPresident to wage war is arguably unconstitutional. The Congress can \ndeclare war, but it cannot dictate to the President how to wage war.

It is the intention of the Senator from \nVirginia to see that time is given to the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Lieberman.\n  We are now awaiting the opening statement of our distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee. I advise Senators that at the \ncompletion of that time, it is the intention of the Senator from \nVirginia to move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator will withhold for a moment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4862\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to consider amendment No. 4862, the Levin amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in consultation with my colleagues, I \nwithdraw the comment at this time of the desire of the Senator from \nVirginia to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the short title of our amendment is ``The \nMultilateral Use of Force Authorization Act of 2002.'' The very title \nof this alternative to the Lieberman-Warner amendment establishes both \nits similarity and its difference from the Lieberman amendment.\n  It is similar because both of our approaches authorize the use of \nU.S.\n\n[[Page S10251]]\n\nArmed Forces. It is different because our resolution authorizes the use \nof force multilaterally pursuant to a U.N. resolution that the \nPresident has asked the Security Council to adopt for the purpose of \ndestroying Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction and prohibited \nmissile delivery systems.\n  Our resolution also supports the President's call and urges the \nUnited Nations Security Council to promptly adopt a resolution that \ndemands Iraq to provide unconditional access, unconditional destruction \nof all weapons of mass destruction and, in the same resolution, \nauthorize U.N. member states to use military force to enforce that \nresolution.\n  Our resolution also affirms that the United States has at all times \nthe inherent right to use military force in self-defense. There is no \nveto given the United Nations in this resolution of ours. Quite the \nopposite. We explicitly make it clear we maintain, of course, a right \nto use self-defense. And we provide that the Congress will not adjourn \nsine die this year, but will return to session to consider promptly \nproposals relative to Iraq if, in the judgment of the President, the \nUnited Nations fails to adopt or enforce the United Nations resolution \nfor which he and we call.\n  The Lieberman resolution, like ours, authorizes the use of U.S. \nmilitary force to enforce the Security Council resolution that is being \nsought by the President, as well as in the case of the Lieberman \nresolution, as well as earlier U.N. resolutions. But the Lieberman \nresolution also would authorize the use of force on a unilateral basis, \nnot requiring that there be an imminent threat, which is essential to \nusing force in self-defense preemptively under international law, but a \nlower threshold called a continuing threat.\n\n  That would be a departure from the requirement in international law \nthat the use of force in self-defense be for imminent threats. That can \nhave significant negative consequences for the world. If other nations \nadopt that precedent, if India and Pakistan adopt that precedent, two \nnuclear-armed nations, they can find continuing threats against each \nother, not imminent, just continuing threats and, using our precedent, \nif we adopt the Lieberman resolution, say: That is the new standard in \ninternational law; it does not have to be an imminent threat; we can \npreemptively attack a neighbor and anybody else if, in our judgment, it \nis a continuing threat.\n  If China decided that Taiwan, which it labels a renegade province, is \na threat to its security, then under this precedent it can attack \nTaiwan under the approach that ``imminent'' is no longer a requirement.\n  Acting multilaterally--multilaterally--as our alternative resolution \ndoes--in other words, with the backing of the United Nations--has a \nnumber of advantages. It will garner the most support from other \nnations and avoid the negative consequences of being deprived of \nairbases, supply bases, overflight rights, and command-and-control \nfacilities that are needed for military action.\n  Saudi Arabia has already said explicitly: If you do not get a U.N. \nresolution, you cannot use our military bases. And other nations have \nsaid the same. If they are going to be involved with us in using force \nagainst Iraq, they want the authority of a U.N. resolution to do it.\n  Our resolution has a better chance of success in persuading Saddam \nHussein to comply, to capitulate, to cooperate finally with the U.N. \nweapons inspectors and to disarm because it will have the world \ncommunity looking at the other end of the barrel down at him.\n  Our multilateral resolution reduces the chances of losing support \nfrom other nations in the war on terrorism, and we need law \nenforcement, intelligence, and financial cooperation from other \nnations.\n  Our multilateral approach reduces the potential for instability in an \nalready volatile region, and that instability can undermine Jordan, \nPakistan, and possibly even end up with a radical regime in Pakistan, a \nnuclear weapon nation.\n  Our multilateral approach reduces the likelihood of Saddam Hussein or \nhis military commanders using biological or chemical weapons against \nour forces, as he will be looking, again, down the barrel of a gun with \nthe world at the other end rather than only at the United States.\n  Both General Shalikashvili and General Clark testified in front of \nour committee that there is a significant advantage to our troops by \ngoing multilaterally in terms of the likely response of Saddam Hussein \nto a unilateral attack by the United States and the likelier use of \nweapons of mass destruction by him in response to a unilateral attack.\n  Our multilateral approach will increase the number of nations that \nwill be willing to participate in the fighting. It will increase the \nnumber of nations that will be willing to participate in the long and \ncostly effort in a post-Saddam Iraq, and we would be avoiding setting \nthat precedent of using force preemptively without an imminent threat.\n\n  Mr. President, if we are serious about going to the U.N., as the \nPresident has said he is, we must focus our efforts there. We should \nnot send an inconsistent message. We should not take the U.N. off the \nhook. We should not say: We really are interested in the U.N. acting, \nadopting a resolution, requiring an unconditional opening by Saddam, \nrequiring the destruction of his weapons of mass destruction.\n  We are saying we really mean that; that is the kind of resolution we \nwant. We are saying that. We also want that resolution to authorize \nmember states to use military force to enforce it. That is what we are \nsaying on the one hand, but if the Lieberman resolution passes, then we \nwill be sending the exact opposite message: If you do not, we will \nanyway.\n  That takes the U.N. off the hook. That blurs the focus that we should \nbe placing on the importance of multilateral action authorized by the \nUnited Nations.\n  I believe that Saddam Hussein must be forced to disarm. I think it is \ngoing to take force, or the threat of force, to get him to comply.\n  It seems to me there is a huge advantage if that force is \nmultilateral, and going it alone is a very different calculus with very \ndifferent risks.\n  If we fail at the U.N., then under our resolution, the President can \ncome back at any time he determines that the U.N. is not acting to \neither adopt or enforce its resolution. He can then come back here \nunder our resolution, call us back into session, and then urge us to \nauthorize a going-it-alone, unilateral resolution.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield 8 minutes to Senator Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the two resolutions \nthat the Senator from Michigan has talked about in his comments because \nthere are two resolutions before the Senate, both of which authorize \nthe President to use force, if necessary, against Iraq.\n  Before I discuss those, let me just say a few words about the war on \nterrorism which has engaged the attention of this entire Nation during \nthe last 13 months.\n  Before I discuss those, I congratulate the President on the way he \nwas able to bring our country together after the attack of September 11 \nof last year. In cooperation with the President, Congress put aside \nother matters, put aside partisan issues, and acted quickly to \nappropriate necessary funds and to enact important legislation to help \nsafeguard our country and its citizens. I think all of us in Congress \njoined in meeting this challenge, and I am proud we were able to do so.\n  The President has come to us again, and this time he has focused \nattention on another threat--that is, the threat that Saddam Hussein, \nthe leader of Iraq, will use weapons of mass destruction against us or \nour allies or that he will provide such weapons to terrorists for them \nto use.\n  The President has indicated his belief that regime change in Iraq is \nneeded to deal with this threat, but he makes the point that at this \ntime he has not made a decision about whether or when to commence any \nmilitary action.\n  The United Nations, for many years, has agreed with our country's \nview that Saddam Hussein should not be permitted to possess weapons of \nmass destruction. An inspection regime was established by the United \nNations in April of 1991, and inspections by UNSCOM continued until \nAugust of 1998 to ensure that weapons were not being developed or \nmaintained.\n\n[[Page S10252]]\n\nI11In December of 1998, Iraq expelled those weapons inspectors, and \nsince that time it is widely believed the likelihood of such weapons \nbeing developed in Iraq has increased.\n  So in response to this threat, the President has urged Congress to \nadopt a broadly worded resolution that authorizes him at any time in \nthe future:\n\n       To use the Armed Forces of the United States as he \n     determines to be necessary and appropriate, in order to \n     defend the national security of the United States against the \n     continuing threat posed by Iraq; and enforce the United \n     Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.\n\n  Senator Levin, who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee, with \nwhom I have been privileged to serve for the last 20 years, has urged \nus to adopt a different resolution that grants the President the \nauthority to use military power, but Senator Levin's proposed \nresolution differs from the broad grant of authority the President has \nrequested in two very significant ways.\n  First, it authorizes the use of force at this time only pursuant to a \nresolution of the U.N. Security Council. In this way, we would be \nensuring our actions to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction \ncontinue to be taken in coordination with our allies.\n  Second, the Levin resolution authorizes the use of:\n\n       The Armed Forces of the United States to destroy, remove, \n     or render harmless Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, \n     nuclear weapons-usable material, ballistic missiles with a \n     range greater than 150 kilometers, and related facilities, if \n     Iraq fails to comply with the terms of the Security Council \n     resolution.\n\n  There is a specific objective we are saying the President is \nauthorized to use military force to accomplish.\n  The Levin resolution does not authorize unilateral action at this \ntime to accomplish so-called regime change. Rather, it would leave open \nthe option for the President to come back to seek and obtain that \nauthority from Congress if and when he determines that military action \nagainst Iraq is required, even without U.N. sanction.\n  I strongly support giving the President authority to work with our \nallies in the United Nations, to inspect for, locate, and destroy \nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq. It may well prove necessary to use \nmilitary force to accomplish that objective. In my view, the Levin \nresolution grants the President that authority. Unless that effort, \nwhich is already underway, fails, I believe it would be wrong for us to \ngrant authority to the President to use U.S. Armed Forces in what is \nessentially a unilateral action to achieve goals that are, at best, \nvague and broad.\n  The President has made clear that in his view our goal should be \nregime change. The argument is Saddam Hussein has shown such a \nproclivity to lie, cheat, and evade that anything short of regime \nchange will leave us vulnerable to a future attack by Iraq.\n  Depending on the success of our current efforts to reinstitute an \ninspection regime, the American people and our allies may well conclude \nthe President is correct. We may have to conclude that finding and \ndestroying weapons of mass destruction in Iraq cannot be achieved as \nlong as Saddam Hussein is in power, and if that is the necessary \nconclusion we reach, then a major military action will likely be \nrequired, with all the casualties and consequences such an action \nentails.\n  Our allies have not reached that conclusion yet. They believe a new \ninspection regime can be made to work and that the threat can be dealt \nwith short of going to war. At least they believe it is worthwhile for \nus to make that final effort.\n  The President's proposed resolution authorizes him:\n\n       To use the Armed Forces of the United States as he \n     determines to be necessary and appropriate.\n\n  This is, in my view, a virtually open-ended grant of authority. It is \nnot a proper action for Congress to take at this time. I do not believe \nit is wise at this point to be authorizing war without the support of \nthe United Nations and our allies. If war must be waged, other \ncountries should be there with us, sharing the costs, both the \nfinancial and human costs, and helping restore stability in what will \nalmost certainly be the tumultuous aftermath of that military action.\n  I also do not favor an authorization for war unless and until the \nPresident is prepared to advise Congress that war is necessary, and he \nhas explicitly said he is not prepared to advise us of that at this \ntime.\n  For all these reasons, I will support the resolution put forth by \nSenator Levin and not support the much broader grant of authority urged \nby the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a question on \nmy time and a response on his time? In other words, I will ask the \nquestion on the time allocated to me and the Senator can respond on the \ntime allocated to him.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am afraid my time is allocated totally, unless it can be \na brief answer. I would be happy to answer briefly.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then I am going to have to narrow our ability to enter \ninto a colloquy, which you and I have done so many times.\n  I will ask one question: As I read this amendment, I find it could be \ninterpreted as precluding the ability to enforce the existing \nresolutions, namely 688, the no-fly zone. If the Senator wants a few \nminutes to study and reflect on that, I would like to have the Senator \nthink this through. That is one very serious shortcoming. In other \nwords, for 11 years we have been enforcing the no-fly zone, but as I \nread this, it could be construed as stopping that. I make that point.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to answer that. It would be misconstrued \nif it were interpreted that way. This does not preclude the President \nfrom doing anything. This is an authorization. It is not a prohibition. \nIt is an authorization to the President to use force. It does not \npreclude the President. It does not say the President may not use \nforce. It says the President is authorized to use force. So there is no \nprohibition; there is no negative.\n  The President has sought our authority. This resolution would give \nthe President that authority.\n  Mr. WARNER. I draw my colleague's attention to the fact it would \nrequire the United States to wait for the U.N. Security Council to act \non a resolution before the President could take action to protect our \nnational security interests.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Which is the WMD issue. It is only the WMD issue that is \nreferred to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will have to reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and I thank my friend from Virginia \nfor yielding me the time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Parliamentary inquiry: Will the Chair inform us what \nthe time allocations are and how much time is remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Levin began with 50 minutes and has 33 \nminutes remaining. Senator Biden has 15 minutes, Senator McCain has 15 \nminutes, and Senator Warner has used 2 of his 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered \nby my friend, the Senator from Michigan. It seems to me, as I look at \nthis amendment, that the difference we have--those of us who have \nsponsored the underlying resolution, and the Senator from Michigan and \nothers sponsoring the amendment--is over tactics, not \nobjectives. Perhaps we should acknowledge one to the other. We each \nhave the objective, I believe, to compel Saddam Hussein to comply with \nthe various U.N. Security Council resolutions, and in that sense, \nparticularly, to disarm.\n\n  I suggest to my friend from Michigan, noting how he continues to \nrefer to his amendment as the multilateral approach, that those who \nsponsored the underlying resolution consider ours to be a multilateral \ninternational approach as well. We believe our willingness not only to \naccept and urge and encourage the President to go to the United Nations \nand hope the United Nations will authorize use of force if\n\n[[Page S10253]]\n\nSaddam Hussein does not comply with their resolutions but our \nwillingness after that fact to say if that does not happen, the \nPresident has the right to utilize America's Armed Forces for that \npurpose, is probably the better way to achieve an international action \nagainst Iraq under Saddam Hussein. To show our willingness, our \nseriousness to use military force to lead an international coalition \nourselves is the better way to convince the United Nations to take \naction on its own and therefore to have an international act.\n  There is a disagreement about tactics. The disagreement is whether we \nshould do all this in one resolution, as we have, or, as the Senator \nfrom Michigan proposes in the amendment, to have two steps: First, go \nto the United Nations, only allow enforcement, particularly of the \nresolutions concerning Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, to be done \nby the United States with the permission of the United Nations. If that \ndoes not work, the President must come back for a separate resolution.\n  Last night in a colloquy with the Senator from Michigan, I suggested \nthat his resolution does in fact give the Security Council a veto over \nthe President's determination, the President's capacity, to use the \nAmerican military to enforce certainly those resolutions having to do \nwith weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles and related \nfacilities.\n  It seems to me, notwithstanding the fact that the Senator's amendment \naffirms the President's inherent right to use military force in self-\ndefense, section 4(a) also makes clear the President of the United \nStates can only do that if he wants to take action to destroy or remove \nor render harmless Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons, \nfissile material, ballistics, et cetera, pursuant to a resolution of \nthe U.N. Security Council.\n  That means any member of the Security Council--Russia, China, France, \nany temporary member--can veto action by the United States, by the \nCommander in Chief. I don't want that to happen.\n  The question is, Why assume, if the United Nations does not take \naction, the United States will have to go it alone? Having gone to the \nUnited Nations, having made our case, the fact is if military action is \nnecessary, the United States will never have to go alone. We will have \nallies in Europe, allies in the Middle East, who see our seriousness of \npurpose, who share in our desire to protect themselves and the world \nfrom Saddam Hussein, who will come to our side. We will have what we \ncalled in the case of Kosovo a coalition of the willing.\n  The Kosovo case is instructive on several points raised in this \ndebate. There was no United Nations resolution authorizing the United \nStates to deploy forces in the case of Kosovo because everyone, \nincluding the Clinton administration, the President, determined we \nwould possibly be subject to a Russian veto at the Security Council. \nThe President was unwilling to accept that. There was no congressional \nresolution then organizing the deployment of our forces because there \nwas controversy about that. There was clearly no imminent threat of a \nsudden direct attack against the United States, as in other amendments \nthat have been before the Senate, because this was happening in the \nBalkans. But the President of the United States, President Clinton, \nclearly understood what was happening there was wrong. He wanted to \ntake action not only to stop the genocide and prevent a wider war in \nEurope but in the most distant threat, to prevent a potential threat to \nthe security of the United States, so he formed a coalition of willing \nnations.\n  Here the threat from Iraq under Saddam Hussein is much more imminent \nto the United States. So to subject our capacity to defend ourselves \nagainst that threat to a veto by the United Nations Security Council is \ninappropriate and wrong.\n  Again, I state a great phrase from the Bible: If the sound of the \ntrumpet is uncertain, who will follow into battle?\n  If we sound a certain trumpet with this resolution, which this \namendment would make uncertain, then many other nations will follow us \ninto battle.\n  I oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will take a few minutes under my time and give to this \nChamber two quotations that frame the entire debate. The first \nquotation is from 40 years ago. It was the President of the United \nStates, John F. Kennedy, in 1962:\n\n       This Nation is prepared to present its case against the \n     Soviet threat to peace and our own proposals for a peaceful \n     world at any time and in any form, in the Organization of \n     American States, in the United Nations, or in any other \n     meeting that could be useful, without limiting our freedom of \n     action.\n\n  This is precisely what this amendment does. It is a total substitute \nfor the work that has been done by the Senator from Connecticut, \nworking with others, the leadership on both sides of the aisle, and the \nPresident's staff. That would all come down, and in its place would be \nthis resolution which has provisions that could be interpreted as a \nveto, questions the authority of the President, and puts too much \nreliance that the United Nations is going to devise a resolution which \nwould meet the criteria that our President and other nations deem \nessential for a new inspection regime.\n  That was a quote by President Kennedy.\n  Now, 40 years forward, a second quote:\n\n       This resolution gives the President the authority he needs \n     to confront the threat posed by Iraq. It is fundamentally \n     different and a better resolution than the one the President \n     sent to us. It is neither a Democratic resolution nor a \n     Republican resolution. It is now a statement of American \n     resolve and values.\n\n  Continuing:\n\n       For me, the deciding factor is my belief that a united \n     Congress will help the President unite the world, and by \n     uniting the world we can increase the world's chances of \n     succeeding in this effort and reduce both the risks and the \n     cost.\n\n  That quote was made just over 40 minutes ago by the distinguished \nmajority leader of the Senate.\n  The House of Representatives debated language identical in both \nChambers. To achieve that united Congress, we must maintain the \nintegrity of the amendment that is presently pending. That is the \namendment by Senator Lieberman and myself, Senator McCain, and Senator \nBayh.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Carl Levin for his \namendment. I thank the State of Michigan for sending Senator Levin to \nthe Senate. His independence, his courage, his clear thinking, his love \nof country are evident in the work he has put behind this important \namendment. I believe his answer to Iraq's challenge is, indeed, the \nright course for this country.\n  To me, the issue of Iraq should be approached in the following way. \nIraq must be held to its word that it will submit to thorough \ninspections and dismantlement of weapons of mass destruction. Let me \nrepeat that: Iraq must be held to its word that it will submit to \nthorough inspections and dismantlement of weapons of mass destruction.\n  The United Nations should pass an updated resolution ensuring \nunfettered inspections and disarmament, and that should take place or \nthere will be dire consequences for Iraq. The weapons they have are a \nthreat to the world. The world must respond. If we handle this matter \ncorrectly, the way Senator Levin is suggesting, I believe the world \nwill respond. If we handle it wrong--and I think the underlying \nresolution is the wrong approach--if our allies believe we have not \nmade the case, they believe somehow this is a grudge match, or if they \nbelieve they are being manipulated for domestic political reasons, that \nis going to hurt our Nation and that is going to isolate us.\n  Indeed, this rush to pass unilateral authority--I have never seen \nanything quite like what has happened in the Senate. The rush to pass \nunilateral authority, the rush to say to the President, go it alone, \ndon't worry about anybody else, is hurting this debate, and this debate \nlooks political. It looks political.\n  If there are those in the administration who believe this debate \ncould hurt Democrats, they may be surprised. Democrats do not walk in \nlockstep. We are independent thinking. I believe the people want that.\n  Remember, this administration started out thumbing its nose at the\n\n[[Page S10254]]\n\nConstitution and the role of Congress in terms of war and peace. This \nadministration did not want to bring the debate on this war to \nCongress. We have many quotes I have already put in the Record on that \nsubject. They did not want the President to go to the United Nations. \nIndeed, they said he did not have to go there; he did not have to come \nhere; he did not have to do anything. Also, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, they wanted a resolution that gave the authority far beyond \nIraq. They wanted to give the President authority to go anywhere in the \nworld.\n\n  Now that idea is gone from the underlying Lieberman resolution. So \nchecks and balances do work. I think what we ought to do is continue \nthose checks and balances by passing the Levin amendment.\n  The Levin amendment puts America front and center in a way that will \nwin over the civilized world. This is what it does.\n  No. 1, it urges the U.N. Security Council to quickly adopt a \nresolution for inspections of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and \nthe dismantlement of those weapons.\n  No. 2, this new U.N. Security Council resolution urges that we will \nback up the resolution with the use of force, including the United \nStates. And the President gets that authority in Senator Levin's \nresolution.\n  No. 3, it reaffirms that, under international law and the United \nNations Charter, the United States has the inherent right to self-\ndefense. So anybody who says, my God, we are giving everything over to \nthe U.N., has not read the resolution.\n  Last, it states the Congress will not adjourn sine die so that in a \nmoment's notice we can return if the President believes we need to go \nit alone.\n  Some have said that the Levin amendment, again, gives veto power to \nthe U.N. Security Council. That is not true. Again, under the Levin \namendment, if the President cannot secure a new U.N. resolution that \nwill ensure disarmament of Iraq, he can come back, he can lay out the \ncase and answer the questions that have not been answered.\n  I have looked back through history. I never have seen a situation \nwhere the President of the United States asked for the ability to go to \nwar alone and yet has not told the American people what that would \nmean. How many troops would be involved? How many casualties might \nthere be? Would the U.S. have to foot the entire cost of using force \nagainst Iraq? If not, which nations are ready to provide financial \nsupport? Troop support? What will the cost be to rebuild Iraq? How long \nwould our troops have to stay there? What if our troops become a target \nfor terrorists?\n  We have seen in Kuwait, a very secure place for our people; we have \nhad terrorist incidents already against our young people there.\n  Will weapons of mass destruction be launched against our troops? \nAgainst Israel? If you read the CIA declassified report--declassified \nreport--they are telling us that the chance that he will use them is \ngreater if he feels his back is up against the wall. Everybody knows \nthe underlying resolution implies regime change. It implies regime \nchange. What I think is important about the Levin resolution is that it \ngoes to the heart, the core of the matter, which is dismantlement of \nthe weapons of mass destruction.\n  If Saddam knows his back is against the wall, he will use these.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the President.\n  So let's be careful. Why not take the conservative approach, the two-\nstep approach of the Levin resolution, when it comes to the life and \ndeath of our people? There are more questions that have not been \nanswered, and I have put them in the Record. Yet the President wants \nthe authority to go it alone and he has not answered even one of those \nquestions to Members of this Senate, let alone to the American people.\n\n  I cannot vote for a blank check for unilateral action. I cannot vote \nfor a go-it-alone approach before any of these fundamental questions \nhave been answered. Twice in the past 4 years I voted to use force: \nonce against Milosevic, once after September 11. So it is not that this \nSenator will never vote for force, but in this case, when the President \nis proposing to go it alone, I think we have the right on behalf of the \npeople we represent to have the questions answered.\n  In closing, the Levin resolution gives us that two-step approach. It \nsays to this President: If you want to go as part of a world force and \nmake sure that we get the dismantlement of these weapons, we give you \nthe authority and the blessing. If not, come back and ask us and we \nwill debate then and we will vote then. I hope we will vote for the \nLevin resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I understand I have 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, at the outset, let me state that I agree \nwith the distinguished Chairman of the Armed Services Committee: U.S. \npolicy would be stronger if we received the unequivocal support of the \nUnited Nations Security Council. Of that, there is no doubt.\n  But that does not mean that our country must delegate our national \nsecurity decisionmaking to the United Nations. It is neither morally \nnecessary nor wise to give the U.N. Security Council veto power over \nour security.\n  I am a supporter of the United Nations. I have supported efforts to \npay U.S. arrears to the organization. The U.N. does many good deeds \naround the world.\n  However, we should not kid ourselves: the Security Council is not a \nrepository of moral goodness. It is not some supranational authority on \ninternational law, world peace or transnational justice. It is a \ncollection of nation-states, each of whom makes decisions based on \ntheir national interests. Five nations have veto power. Ten more can \nvote up or down, or abstain on a given matter. Individual states may \ncloak their decisions in grand rhetoric of global interest, but they \nare driven by cool calculations of self-interest.\n  As my friend from Michigan knows, the atmosphere before a Security \nCouncil vote often resembles a Middle Eastern bazaar more than it does \na somber courtroom. Deals are cut, resolutions are watered down, and \nstatements are made based on the national interests of the five \npermanent Security Council members. That is as it should be, but we \nshould not fool ourselves that there is some innate moral authority \nonce 15 nations negotiate a deal.\n  Russia is engaged in vicious human rights abuses in Chechnya. Russia \ncontinues to undermine the sovereignty of the Republic of Georgia. \nRussia is owed billions of dollars from its ill-advised arms deals with \nSaddam Hussein's Iraq. Russia has long advocated easing and even \nlifting of sanctions against Iraq. Russia abstained on U.N. Security \nCouncil Resolution 1284 in December 1999, creating the current weapons \ninspections regime in Iraq--apparently because it believed the regime \nwas too tough.\n  China also abstained from supporting U.N. Security Council Resolution \n1284. China has good reason to be concerned about international \nopinion. China has engaged in serious proliferation activities. China \nseverely represses its own people. Gaining the diplomatic acquiescence \nof the People's Republic of China may be desirable but it does not add \nany moral stature to our position.\n  And then there is France. France has armed Saddam Hussein for years. \nFrench President Chirac was Prime Minister when France sold a nuclear \nreactor to Iraq. In the words of the former head of Iraq's nuclear \nprogram, Khidhir Hamza, Saddam ``knew Chirac would eat old tires from \nthe Tigris if it got him our nuclear deal, worth hundreds of millions \nof dollars, along with the prospect of cheap oil.''\n  For years, French businessmen have been regular visitors to Baghdad, \nseeking commercial advantage despite U.N. sanctions. No one in this \nbody should be under any illusions about French motivations.\n  If President Bush and his team can gain French, Chinese and Russian \nsupport for a strong U.N. Security Council resolution, I applaud them. \nRecent signs are promising. Their support will help in the political \nand diplomatic realms. But their support will not make our case more \njust, or more right.\n\n[[Page S10255]]\n\n  In fact, the U.S. position in making progress at the U.N. precisely \nbecause of our determination. If this body were to pass the Levin \namendment, we would set our cause back in New York. We would send a \nsignal of indecision that would embolden those who oppose a tough \nresolution. They would see that the U.S. Senate is deferring judgment \nto them, virtually inviting them to harden their opposition to the U.S. \nposition.\n  Let me address some real concerns I have about the amendment offered \nby my distinguished colleague. It urges the U.N. Security Council to \nadopt a particular resolution--one limited solely to inspectors' access \nto Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs. I don't think we should \ntry to put the U.S. Senate in the role of drafting the parameters of \nU.N. Security Council resolutions. Such a unilateral position by one \nlegislative body in one U.N. member state seems a little bit out of \nkeeping with his oft-stated desire for multilateralism.\n  The U.N. Security Council resolution urged by the Levin amendment is \nsilent on the real issues facing the U.S. government in New York right \nnow. Does the amendment accept or reject the U.N. Secretary General's \n1998 deal with Saddam Hussein to leave huge swaths of Iraqi territory \nunder separate rules? Does the amendment take a position on the need to \ninterview Iraqi scientists outside of Saddam's control--and with their \nfamilies so the regime cannot hold them hostage?\n  The Levin amendment is silent about many issues raised in U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions--issues that the U.N. Security Council may \nsee fit to address in the future as they have in the past: support for \nterrorism; threatening conventional military moves against Kuwait, and \nprotection of the Iraqi people from Saddam's tyranny. Each of these has \nbeen addressed by U.N. Security Council resolutions in the past. Each \nof these has been addressed by the United States in the past. Why are \nthey ignored in the Levin amendment.\n  Even more troubling is the narrow authorization for the use of force \nin the Levin amendment. Right now, American and British pilots are \nrisking their lives enforcing the northern and southern no fly zones in \nIraq. They are being shot at. They are defending themselves by \nattacking Iraqi radar and SAM sites that target them. These zones were \nerected to prevent Saddam from continuing to slaughter the Iraqi \npeople--not to engage in search and destroy mission for weapons of mass \ndestruction. They are authorized by U.N. Security Council Resolution \n688, passed on April 5, 1991. By omitting any reference to the ongoing \nOperation Northern Watch and Operation Southern Watch, one could \nconstrue the Levin amendment to not authorizing no fly zone \nenforcement. I am sure that is not its intent, but it could be its \neffect.\n\n  The same is true of U.N. Security Council Resolution 949, passed on \nOctober 15, 1994, which prohibits Saddam from reinforcing his \nconventional forces in southern Iraq. This resolution was necessitated \nby Saddam's massing of thousands of troops--including at least two \nRepublican Guard divisions--near the Iraq-Kuwait border. By limiting \nthe authorization to only weapons of mass destruction, the Levin \namendment's silence on the conventional threat to Kuwait could send the \nwrong signal to Iraq and undermine existing U.N. Security Council \nresolutions. Again, I am sure that is not its intent but it may be the \neffect.\n  Finally, there is the issue of what to do if the U.N. Security \nCouncil does not act. It may be, at the end of the day, that the \nindividual nations making decisions in the U.N. Security Council do not \nagree with the compelling case that President Bush has laid out. It may \nbe that they will decide that U.N. Security Council resolutions are not \nto be enforced, that the worst violator of U.N. Security Council \nresolutions should not be confronted. It may be that other nations \nchoose to appease, accommodate, or ignore the clear and present danger \nposed by Iraq. Under the Levin amendment, what is the United States to \ndo if the U.N. proves to be as unable to deal with Iraq as it was to \ndeal with genocide in Rwanda and mass murder in Bosnia committed under \nthe nose of U.N. peacekeepers?\n  Under the Levin amendment, Congress would reconvene to ``consider \npromptly proposals relative to Iraq if in the judgment of the \nPresident, the U.N. Security Council fails to adopt or enforce the \nresolution'' called for in the amendment. It is not sufficient to claim \nthe Levin amendment affirms the U.S. right of self-defense and, \ntherefore, there is not U.N. veto. If the U.N. vetoes action on Iraq, \nCongress will come back to ``consider proposals.'' Why? Why should we \nnot decide now about the issue? Why should we wait and see?\n  Does the Senator believe the administration is pursuing the wrong \nresolution in New York? If he does, he should say so. Does the Senator \nbelieve the administration is not seriously committed to pursuing a \nresolution? If he does he should say so. But if he believes the U.S. is \nseriously pursuing a serious resolution in New York, there is no need \nfor this amendment. Unless he wants to grant bargaining power to those \nwho oppose the U.S. position in the U.N. or unless he disagrees with \nthe U.S. position, there is not need for his amendment. The diplomatic \nprocess will continue. We may succeed. We may fail. But I believe we \nhave enough information to act now. I believe we do not need to wait \nfor the U.N. to act. I believe that even if the U.N. does not act, \nAmerica should--as we did in Kosovo in 1999.\n  The case of NATO's preventive attack in Kosovo is instructive. I \nsupported the NATO intervention. It was an intervention designed to \nstop ethnic cleansing and mass murder by a government against its own \npeople. Milosevic had no weapons of mass destruction. The threat he \nposed was to citizens in his country, not his neighbors. In Kosovo, the \nU.N. Security Council could not pass a resolution because of Russian \nopposition. Yet NATO, under U.S. leadership acted. Indeed, in 1998, \nSenator Levin noted with approval the Administration's position ``that \nthe Security Council's authorization was desirable but not required for \nNATO action to intervene in Kosovo.'' Remarks on the Senate floor, July \n8, 1998. This was 8 months before hostilities began. This was before \nany serious effort had been made at the U.N. This was before any veto \nwas cast. It seems to me that if my distinguished colleague from \nMichigan could reach that kind of judgment that far in advance \nconcerning the use of force against a far less threatening adversary, \nhe should be able to do the same today.\n  In summary, the Levin amendment sends the wrong signal at the wrong \ntime. It could give a green light to Saddam to repress his own people \nor use conventional forces to Kuwait while giving a red light to our \ndiplomatic efforts at the U.N. This body should allow the executive \nbranch the leeway to conduct diplomacy at the U.N.--not try to \nmicromange it from the Senate floor. I urge the rejection of the \namendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will yield myself 30 seconds to, first \nof all, assure my good friend from Arizona that my amendment means what \nit says, that we reserve the right of self-defense at all times. There \nis no ceding of our security policy to the United Nations. We are very \nexplicit on that.\n  If I could also point out to my friend from Arizona, back in the gulf \nwar time--and I will yield myself 30 additional seconds--the exact \nauthorization in the gulf war was: The President is authorized, subject \nto such and such section, to use the Armed Forces of the United States \npursuant to United Nations Security Council resolutions.\n  And my friend from Arizona said at that time: I think we should get \napproval from the United Nations to use force, if necessary. And we \nshould then, and if it could be done shortly, get approval from \nCongress to use force, if necessary.\n  I am not suggesting--I am not suggesting--nor did I suggest then that \nthe Senator from Arizona was ceding the policy of the United States to \nthe United Nations just because he wanted to go to the United Nations \nfirst before we voted to get authority from the United Nations. I never \nsuggested that because it was not true. He would never cede authority \nover our security policy to the United Nations, nor would I, nor would \nany Member of this\n\n[[Page S10256]]\n\nbody, nor does the resolution on which we are going to vote.\n  I yield 3 minutes to our friend from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I commend again the able Senator from \nMichigan for this proposal that he has before us. The strength of the \nproposal, and the care with which it has been crafted, is made manifest \nby the tortured argument of the Senators from Connecticut and Arizona \nagainst his resolution. They are in a convoluted posture to try to \nmisinterpret this in order to try to make an argument against it. It is \njust incredible what has happened. We need some intellectual integrity \nhere as we deal with this issue.\n  Let me ask the Senator from Michigan if he would answer a question or \ntwo.\n  The Senator from Connecticut said earlier that you were precluding \nthe use of military force to exercise our inherent right of self-\ndefense because we would have to have a United Nations resolution \nbefore, as I understand--before--we could exercise such force.\n  I read in your resolution a specific affirmation under international \nlaw of our inherent right to use military force; is that right?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct. It specifically ``affirms that . . \n. the United States has at all times the inherent right to use military \nforce in self-defense.'' It explicitly preserves that right.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. On your time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Is there time remaining, I ask the Senator from \nArizona--the Senator from Virginia?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. Madam President, may I inquire as to the remaining \ntime of the Senator from Arizona?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. Three minutes. And for the Senator from Virginia?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 3 \\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Parliamentary inquiry, Madam President: How much time is \nunder my control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I would be happy to yield time for the \nSenator to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from Delaware very much.\n  I want to ask my friend from Michigan or my friend from Maryland to \nexplain how you relate two parts of the Levin amendment. One, yes, does \nsay you affirm the right of the U.S. to self-defense, but then, two \nsections lower, it seems to me, you cut a very big exception, and you \nsay ``pursuant.'' And because you say ``pursuant,'' I assume it means \nonly pursuant to a U.N. Security Council resolution can the President \nauthorize the use of ``the Armed Forces of the United States to \ndestroy, remove, or render harmless Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, \nnuclear weapons-usable material, ballistics missiles . . . and related \nfacilities. . . .''\n  So it is one thing to affirm the general right of self-defense, but \nthen the amendment takes it away with regard to what we all acknowledge \nis the most serious threat that Iraq constitutes to the U.S., which is \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator did this last night, and he is doing it \nagain today. He has inserted into the authorization to use force \npursuant to a U.N. resolution the word ``only.'' The word ``only'' is \nnot there. These are two separate sections. One provides an authority \nunder a U.N. resolution; the other preserves the inherent right of \nmilitary--I want to say to my good friend from Connecticut, it is \npainful to me to see a former able and distinguished attorney general \nof the State of Connecticut twist and turn to try to do this, what he \nis trying to do, to the very well-crafted amendment of the Senator from \nMichigan. It is painful. It is painful to see this.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Well, let me relieve you of your pain.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will you withdraw the use of the word ``only''?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. This comes directly from my experience as an attorney \nand attorney general. If you are saying ``pursuant,'' how else--I ask \nthe Senator from Michigan, do you believe, under your amendment, and if \nthere is no resolution of the United Nations regarding destruction of \nweapons of mass destruction of Iraq, that the President could authorize \nthe use of force?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Of course.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Of course he could. Pursuant to----\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Then why require that the President come back a second \ntime to seek such authorization?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Because we are explicitly saying, pursuant to the right of \nself-defense, he may always, at any time, without authority from \nanybody. But the United Nations----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 3 minutes yielded to the Senator from \nMaryland has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Delaware would yield a couple \nminutes for me to answer.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This is a grant of authority. The word ``only'' is not in \nthere. The Senator from Connecticut sought to add it last night.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. And again here.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. And I am adding it----\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could finish my answer, when the Senator from \nConnecticut, in 1991, introduced and supported a resolution, which \npassed this Congress in a close vote--and the Senator from Connecticut \nwas a leader in that effort; and I commend him for it--the resolution \nrelative to the gulf war said:\n\n       The President is authorized subject to this subsection to \n     use U.S. Armed Forces pursuant to United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 678.\n\n  Did that mean because that grant of authority pursuant to a U.N. \nresolution was present, that the President could not operate in self-\ndefense? Did you, somehow or other, by granting that right intend to \neliminate the right of this Nation to act in self-defense? I know the \nanswer is no. I know the answer is no.\n  Yet in our resolution, when we explicitly preserve that right, \nsomehow or other the Senator from Connecticut is finding it \ninconsistent with the pursuant grant.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Since the Senator from Maryland has questioned my \nlegal capacity, I want to----\n  Mr. SARBANES. I said it just pained me to see it at work here on the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I want to assure the Senator from Maryland----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time at this point?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, how much time is under the control of the \nSenator from Delaware?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will bring this to a close.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I will yield 2 more minutes to the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I want to assure the Senator from Maryland this is not \na tactic. I am genuinely puzzled, for two reasons.\n  You give the grant of authority, and then you say ``pursuant.'' It \nseems to me logical the grant of self-defense, and then you spell out \nthat pursuant to only a U.N. resolution can the President use the Armed \nForces. But then here is the second. Only----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Only?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Where is the word ``only''?\n  If the Senator will yield to me, I think the Senator----\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. No. I think I will just finish because I am taking \nSenator Biden's time.\n  I am reassured but still puzzled about why you then have the second \npart of your amendment, I say to Senator Levin. And it is this: If you \nbelieve you are not saying the ``only'' way the President can use \nAmerica's military forces to disarm Iraq, then why do you require a \nreturn to the Congress for that authorization later?\n  It seems to me your affirmation of self-defense is very broad, and in \nspelling out the pursuant clause, you are limiting it. If you are not, \nthen your language is effectively a nullity.\n\n[[Page S10257]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is a very significant section. What it says is, if the \nPresident does not get the resolution and if he cannot act in self-\ndefense because the threat is not imminent, then he would come back to \nthis Congress to seek unilateral authority. What the President has done \nis laid out a course of action which says even though the threat is not \nimminent, the President wants the authority to use unilateral action.\n  As a matter of fact, the amendment which will be offered later on \ntoday by Senator Durbin will add the word ``imminent.'' I am quite sure \nthe administration and the sponsors of the underlying amendment are \ngoing to fight very hard against adding that word ``imminent'' which \nhas always, under international law, been required in order to attack \nbased on a theory of self-defense.\n  So all our language does is protect the opportunity for the \nPresident, in the absence of a threat which rises to self-defense, an \nimminent threat which would justify self-defense, in the absence of a \nU.N. resolution, it specifically says, we are not going to adjourn sine \ndie. This is too important.\n  If there is no threat that is imminent, if the U.N. does not act \npursuant to this resolution, we would say to the President, we will \ncome back to consider a unilateral authority. You don't need it, if it \nis self-defense. You don't need it, if the U.N. acts. But if it is not \nan imminent threat and the U.N. does not act, then we will be here to \nconsider that request.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend. This exchange has clarified for me \nthe intentions of the amendment. If I may briefly state it, you are \nsaying the President can only take--forgive me for using the word \n``only,'' but I will clarify it--action against, can only use the Armed \nForces of the U.S. to take action against the weapons of mass \ndestruction in Iraq without a U.N. resolution if he determines the \nthreat from those weapons is imminent.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is not imminent.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. If he determines the threat is not imminent, then he \ncannot take action against those weapons without the U.N. resolution, \nunless he returns to the Senate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are not saying what he cannot do here. This is an \nauthority, if I may repeat.\n  I assume this is coming out of the time of the Senator from Delaware; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Then I will not yield any more time. How much time do I \nhave?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. If I may, how much time remains under my control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield another 2 minutes to the Senator to finish his \nanswer, but then I would want to speak briefly to this, if I may.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could complete that thought, this is a grant of \nauthority. It is not a limitation of authority. That is a critical \ndifference which, as lawyers, I think we understand. We are not saying \nwhat the President cannot do. We are saying nothing in here is in any \nway affecting the inherent right of self-defense. We are reiterating \nthe inherent right of self-defense to avoid the kind of argument the \nSenator from Connecticut is now making, to preclude the argument. It \nhas not worked. The Senator from Connecticut is still making the \nargument. But to make it clear that in no way are we affecting the \ninherent right of self-defense, we reiterated that right.\n\n  Secondly, there is a grant of authority to act pursuant to a U.N. \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used an additional minute.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Could I have 30 seconds?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Sure.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If there is neither an imminent threat, which has been the \ntraditional definition of self-defense, if there is neither a threat \nwhich is imminent, which would justify traditionally acting in self-\ndefense, or if there is not a U.N. resolution authorizing member states \nto use force to go with those weapons of mass destruction, then we are \nsaying we will be in session to consider a Presidential request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The additional time has been used.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield me 10 seconds?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I yield myself 3 minutes of the remaining \n9 minutes I have, and I yield 10 seconds of that to my friend from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator from Delaware.\n  I strongly commend the Senator from Michigan for how carefully \nthought-out and reasoned and constructive his amendment is, as was just \nreflected in the exchange which he had with the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Obviously, this amendment, which is before us and which I support, \nhas been very carefully thought through to deal with all these \neventualities. I commend the Senator from Michigan for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I rise to explain why three brilliant \nlawyers can be all right at the same time--because they all started \nfrom a different premise, part of the confusion for the debate that \nlisteners will find on the floor.\n  I join my friend from Arizona and my friend from Virginia in being \nopposed to this amendment, but for reasons different than theirs. Let \nme try to explain as briefly as I can.\n  The point about whether or not there needs to be an imminent threat \nto justify the President taking action is what is at stake. I am of the \nschool that suggests the President need not, if the underlying \namendment passes, have to show there is an imminent threat. He is \nenforcing a peace agreement in effect. He is enforcing, not preempting. \nAnd he is not responding to imminent threat.\n  I do not believe there is an imminent threat in the next day or two \nor week or a month. The reason why I oppose my friend from the State of \nMichigan is because I believe there is an inevitable threat. We are \neither going to have to react, if not tomorrow, we will have to in the \nnext 5 years. If this man is unfettered, with $2 billion per year in \nrevenues, on the course he is on, I guarantee you, we will be \nresponding. I guarantee you, we will.\n  Is it imminent now? No. Is al-Qaida involved now? No. Is all this \ntalk about the likelihood of cooperation with terrorist groups a real \nimmediate threat? No. I don't believe any of that now. But I do know we \nare going to have to address it. So the question is, do we address it \nnow or do we wait a year or two or three.\n  The reason I oppose the amendment of my friend from Michigan is \nbecause the basic premise upon which I began is consistent with where \nmy friend from Connecticut began, and that is the threat need not be \nimminent for us to take action. That is because we would be enforcing \nSecurity Council resolutions. That is authority we are about to \ndelegate to the President.\n  I can understand why my friend from Maryland is upset about the way \nit is characterized by the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The bottom line is I believe if, in fact, we do not get a U.N. \nresolution, we are in a position we were in with regard to Kosovo. My \nfriend from Arizona and I stood shoulder to shoulder on Kosovo trying \nto encourage the previous President of the United States to use force \nagainst the Serbs in Kosovo. I will submit for the Record at the \nappropriate time, after we had gone through an effort to get the U.N. \nto support it. The U.N. would not support it. And then we went.\n  The bottom line was, the Senator from Arizona and I felt strongly we \nhad to go. We had to move. Were the Serbs an imminent threat to the \nUnited States of America? No. Was it a threat to our security \ninterests? Yes. The stabilization of southeastern Europe. And so I \nthink part of the thing that confuses people here--anyone listening to \nthe debate, myself included, as part of the debate--is this notion of \nthe place from which you began.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to briefly comment on Senator \nLevin's alternative proposal relating to Iraq. Some of my colleagues \nfor whom I have tremendous respect have tried to address the fact that \nthe administration's proposal is simply not good enough by emphasizing \nthe desirability of a United Nations resolution, thus transforming this \ndangerous unilateral proposal into an internationally sanctioned \nmultilateral mission. But while I recognize that international support\n\n[[Page S10258]]\n\nis a crucial ingredient in any recipe for addressing the weapons of \nmass destruction threat in Iraq without undercutting the fight against \nterrorism, I will not and cannot support any effort to give the United \nNations Security Council Congress's proxy in deciding whether or not to \nsend American men and women into combat in Iraq. No Security Council \nvote can answer my questions about plans for securing WMD or American \nresponsibilities in the wake of an invasion of Iraq. It is for this \nreason that I must oppose the proposal of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Levin amendment \nto the underlying resolution and am proud to be counted as a cosponsor. \nI believe Senator Levin's legislation represents a rational and \nmeasured approach to military action against Iraq's tyrannical regime.\n  The Levin amendment emphasizes the importance of multilateralism and \nunderstands that the cooperation of the world community is an important \ncomponent of American success in disarming Iraq and in Iraq's eventual \nreconstruction. As I said in my statement last night, if the world \ncommunity is not with us when we take off, it will be hard to ask for \ntheir help when we land.\n  Although the administration at times appears to believe otherwise, \nmultilateralism is not an unnecessary inconvenience, but an important \nprecondition for success not just for actions to disarm Iraq but more \nimportantly is prosecuting our war on terrorism. We rely on other \ncountries for logistics, intelligence, and overflight rights. We have \ncalled on other countries to help cover the costs of previous military \nengagements. And we rely on other countries to provide peacekeepers to \nhelp restore law and order around the globe, including most recently in \nAfghanistan. And we most certainly depend on the 90-odd countries in \nour global coalition to combat terrorism at home in the post 9-11 \ngovernment.\n  However, if we adopt a unilateral approach, we undermine cooperation \nof the world community we have so often enjoyed.\n  Furthermore, the Levin amendment wisely stops short of codifying the \nBush preemption doctrine, a dangerous and reckless new development in \nAmerican foreign policy.\n  Many countries have adversaries who they believe present continuing \nthreats, maybe even imminent threats, to their security. If we \nestablish a precedent of preemption, how in the future can we criticize \nRussia for attacking Georgia, stop India from taking action against \nPakistan, or oppose a Chinese invasion of Taiwan in the court of world \npublic opinion.\n  Nothing in the Levin amendment precludes unilateral action by the \nUnited States in self-defense where imminent and immediate threats \nexist. And nothing in the Levin amendment prevents the Congress from \nauthorizing force at a later date if the U.N. does not take action.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Levin amendment. I believe that \nit presents an excellent balance between the desire to contain and \neliminate potential threats to American interests while demonstrating \nleadership in the post-cold-war world, and the value of devising a \nmultilateral approach.\n  Thank you and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I believe I have 3 minutes remaining. In \nall due respect to the Senator from Michigan, as Paul Harvey would say, \n``Let's hear the rest of the story.'' The reason I said in 1991 that \nthe U.N. Security Council should approve it is because the U.N. \nSecurity Council had already acted and approved. Never, at any time in \nmy entire history, would I believe we are dependent upon the good will \nor the approval or disapproval of the U.N. Security Council. So I \nresent, slightly, the Senator from Michigan taking me out of context \nthere.\n  The fact is, in Kosovo, if we took the same course of action the \nSenator from Michigan is contemplating now, when butchery and genocide \nwas going on there, we would have waited until the Security Council \nacted, or didn't act, and then we would have gone back into session to \ndetermine what we should do about Kosovo.\n  How many thousands of people would have been murdered, butchered, and \nethnically cleansed had we taken the same route that the Senator from \nMichigan is advocating on this issue, as far as Iraq is concerned?\n  All I have to say about this amendment is--well, you can just read \nit:\n\n     . . . will not adjourn sine die and will return to session at \n     any time before the next Congress convenes--\n\n  Et cetera, et cetera. If that isn't a dictate by the action of the \nU.N. Security Council, nothing is.\n  We have come a long way. John F. Kennedy, on October 22, 1962, said \nthis:\n\n       This Nation is prepared to present its case against the \n     Soviet threat to peace and our own proposals for a peaceful \n     world at any time, and in any forum, in the Organization of \n     American States, in the United Nations, or in any other \n     meeting that could be useful, without limiting our freedom of \n     action.\n\n  The Levin amendment limits our freedom of action and contradicts the \nwords of John F. Kennedy at the time of the Cuban missile crisis.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nHawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for a \nresolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq. I do so with two \ncardinal prerequisites: first, that all possible means be exhausted \nshort of war to enforce United Nations resolutions concerning Iraq and, \nsecond, that any attack against Iraq take place as part of an \ninternational coalition. That is why I am pleased to cosponsor the \namendment offered by my colleague from Michigan, Mr. Levin, the \nChairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Before the United States wages war against Iraq, President Bush and \nthe Congress owe it to the young Americans who face death or injury in \nthat conflict to ensure that every effort has been made to obtain our \nends without endangering them. Every ounce of preparation must be taken \nto ensure a swift and efficient outcome should war become necessary. As \nanother President, Herbert Hoover, once said, ``Older men declare war. \nBut it is youth that must fight and die.'' The burden is on our leaders \nto justify why young men and women need to risk their future now.\n  Defense analysts suggest that anywhere from 100,000 to 400,000 troops \nwill be necessary for an attack. There are already approximately 75,000 \nReservists and National Guard troops on active duty, and even more may \nbe needed to deal with the conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan while not \ndegrading military missions elsewhere in the world. An occupation force \nin Iraq might require at least 75,000 troops plus a civilian \ncounterpart to the military presence. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that the war will cost between $6 billion to $9 billion a \nmonth on top of an initial deployment cost of $9 billion to $13 billion \nand that an occupation force would cost $1 billion to $4 billion per \nmonth. Remember in the first Persian Gulf War, it was our allies who \npaid for the war. The cost of the war this time will be borne largely \nby the American treasury, unless we are supported by an international \ncoalition. With a battered economy, it will be difficult to fund two \nwars at once for an indefinite period of time. Already our funds are \nstretched. The head of the U.S. Special Operations Command has \nindicated that he requires an additional $23 billion over the next 5 \nyears to maintain his global responsibilities.\n  The need to justify such a course of action is particularly critical \nin the case of Iraq as President Bush is advocating a preemptive strike \nagainst a potential threat to the American homeland. Traditionally, \nAmerica has never sought war by striking first nor has America eagerly \nsought foreign entanglements. This would be a preemptive war and one in \nwhich we could have few allies. Not since the Spanish-American War \nwould the United States be fighting a war so far from our borders with \nso few friends.\n  As we consider this war, we must also consider the implications of \nwhat we are doing. Saddam Hussein is not the only dictator who \noppresses his people, attacks his neighbors, and is developing weapons \nof mass destruction (WMD). North Korea's Kim Jong Il,\n\n[[Page S10259]]\n\nLibya's Muammar Qadhafi, Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei, Syria's Bashar al-\nAsad, and others, all pose threats or have posed threats to American \ninterests. All are known for their human rights abuses.\n  American troops stand eye to eye with North Korean troops on the DMZ. \nLibyan agents blew up an American commercial aircraft; Iran has \nimprisoned American diplomats; and Syria has supported terrorist groups \nwho have attacked and murdered Americans. All have or are developing \nweapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons and missiles to \ndeliver them. Some of these countries may already have nuclear weapons. \nSome have attacked--directly or indirectly through support for \nterrorist groups--their neighbors. In the case of Iran, recent reports \nindicate that it is sheltering and assisting al-Qaida leaders.\n  In the case of other countries, we are working diligently, through \nbilateral and multilateral diplomacy, to constrain their efforts to \ndevelop weapons of mass destruction. However, in regard to Iraq, the \nPresident argues that Saddam poses a unique threat. His argument is \nconvincing concerning the extent of devastation that Saddam has wreaked \non his own people and his neighbors. He is truly, as the President \nnotes, a ``homicidal dictator,'' but he is not the only dictator \naddicted to developing weapons of mass destruction. Nor is the policy \nsolely a choice between invading Iraq or standing hopelessly by while \nSaddam becomes ever stronger. Since the Persian Gulf War, we and our \nallies have worked to make Saddam weaker and, according to all reports, \nincluding that of our own military, Saddam's military capability is \nmuch less now than it was in 1991.\n  Congressional testimony, reports by the intelligence community and \noutside analysts, state that Iraq's WMD capability is much less now \nthan it was before the Gulf War. A recent CIA public report states that \nIraq's chemical weapons capability ``is probably more limited now than \nit was at the time of the Gulf war . . . '' Although it is probable \nthat Iraq's biological weapons program is more advanced than it was \nbefore the war, its delivery capability, according to the respected \nLondon-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, ``appears \nlimited.''\n  I agree that we must neutralize Iraq's WMD threat. The question is \nhow to do that most effectively while minimizing the loss in American \nlives. The argument that an inspection system cannot guarantee the \nelimination of Iraq's WMD program is certainly true but misses the \npoint. There are few absolutes in this world. Defense Secretary \nRumsfeld insists that we need American troops on the ground, rummaging \nthrough every Iraqi nook and cranny for evidence of WMD. Even with our \ntroops doing so, there would be no guarantee that every item would be \nuncovered or how long it would take. We are still finding traces of \nchemical weapons left over from World War I in the backyards of homes \nin Washington, D.C. Nor have our troops in Afghanistan, despite heroic \nefforts, been able to eradicate every al-Qaida operative.\n  But what aggressive inspections can do is destabilize the Iraqi WMD \nprogram, keep it bottled up, frustrate efforts at gaining new \ntechnologies and additional supplies, and force Iraqi technicians to \nhide and keep moving constantly. It will not be disarmament, but, if \nimplemented effectively, it will be dismemberment of the Iraqi WMD \nprogram, splitting it in parts and preventing it from becoming whole.\n  A new inspection regime has to be very aggressive, receive \nconsiderable support from the United States and its allies, have a \nfixed set of dates for marking compliance, and be backed by the threat \nof war. Iraq's record of evading inspections is well documented. \nBenchmarks for compliance will remove wiggle room for countries who \nargue for a softening of sanctions provisions. Putting in place an \naggressive new inspection regime is not an insubstantial achievement, \nand it does not undermine necessary preparations to develop an \neffective war-fighting strategy and strengthen international backing \nfor a conflict.\n  Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and others in the administration tell us \nthat time is not on our side. But we must make the time to ensure that \nwe minimize American casualties. Time is not on Saddam Hussein's side \neither. Our patience has been exhausted and a new U.N. resolution must \nbe firm in its deadlines. Some in the Administration believe Saddam's \nhold on those responsible for guarding him is so tenuous that in the \nevent of an attack, they will turn on him and overthrow him.\n\n  The current discussion about Iraq has obscured the successes of \nAmerican policy toward Iraq. A recent Congressional Research Service \nreport by its distinguished Middle East expert, Kenneth Katzman, \nobserves, the United States ``has largely succeeded in preventing Iraq \nfrom reemerging as an immediate strategic threat to the region.'' A \nBritish Government intelligence report notes that the ``success of U.N. \nrestrictions means the development of new longer-range missiles is \nlikely to be a slow process.''\n  If war becomes inevitable because Iraq refuses to give inspectors the \nliberty they need to perform their mission, then the United States must \nhave an effective military strategy for fighting a war.\n  Great uncertainty surrounds the President's post-war strategy. \nRemember the day the war ends, Iraq becomes our responsibility, our \nproblem. The United States lacks strategic planning for a post-conflict \nsituation. Retired General George Joulwan recently said that the U.S. \nneeds ``to organize for the peace'' and design now a strategy with \n``clear goals, milestones, objectives.'' General Joulwan argues we did \nnot have such a plan for Bosnia and we are late to develop one in \nAfghanistan. Our objectives in Iraq have not yet been made clear: is it \nour goal to occupy Baghdad and if so, for how long? A rush to battle \nwithout a strategy to win the peace is folly.\n  General Hoar observed that ``there has been scant discussion about \nwhat will take place after a successful military campaign against Iraq. \nThe term ``regime change'' does not adequately describe the concept of \nwhat we expect to achieve as a result of a military campaign in Iraq. \nOne would ask the question, ``Are we willing to spend the time and \ntreasure to rebuild Iraq and its institution after fighting, if we go \nit alone during a military campaign? Who will provide the troops, the \npolicemen, the economists, the politicians, the judicial advisors to \nstart Iraq on the road to democracy? Or are we going to turn the \ncountry over to another thug, who swears fealty to the United States?''\n  As General Shalikashvili stated in testimony before the Armed \nServices Committee, ``we were very fortunate in Afghanistan that in \nfact a government, interim government, emerged that seemed to have a \nmodicum of support from its people. . . . We should not count on being \nlucky twice.'' Nor can we count on Iraq's oil funding reconstruction if \nwellheads are blown up as they were by retreating Iraqi forces in \nKuwait.\n  Experts indicate that American troops will need to remain inside Iraq \nfor many years in order to ensure stability. Iraq will require \nextensive economic assistance. As the current situation in Afghanistan \nindicates, the process of restoring viability to a nation--nation-\nbuilding--after years of repression is a difficult one and made more \ndifficult by the inability of other nations to sustain their support in \nthe effort. Violent attacks are on the increase in Afghanistan. Afghan \nofficials have received only about half of the $1.8 billion in aid \npromised last January. A study by the Army's Center of Military History \nhas concluded that we would need to commit 300,000 peacekeeping troops \nin Afghanistan and 100,000 in Iraq if we are to have an impact \ncomparable to that which we had in reconstructing Japan and Germany \nafter the war.\n  The consequences of a long-term American occupation of Iraq needs to \nbe carefully weighed. Anthony Cordesman, an analyst with the Center for \nStrategic and International Studies, has observed, ``there has been a \n`deafening silence' from the Administration about how Iraq will be run \nafter Hussein.'' Historically, the United States has had a poor record \nin the Middle East. We supported Iraq in its war against Iran.\n  Nor does eliminating Saddam necessarily mean that the Iraqi people \nwill welcome American occupiers or that they will have democratic \nleaders to govern. Secretary Rumsfeld asserts that he trusts the Iraqi \npeople will be\n\n[[Page S10260]]\n\ninspired to form a new government. But can we be assured that it would \nbe a democratic government or a democratic government that is pro-\nAmerican? Can we be assured that the new regime will be committed to \ngetting rid of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, especially as Iraq's \ntraditional adversary, Iran, has an even more advanced program of \nweapons of mass destruction?\n  Even though our military forces may be equipped to fight a war in \nIraq and a war on terrorism in Afghanistan, there is a significant \nprice to be paid. In his testimony before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, General Richard Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, noted \nthat certain unique units, such as intelligence platforms, command and \ncontrol assets, and Special Operations Forces would need to be \nprioritized if the war on terrorism expanded. Richard Solomon, former \nAssistant Secretary of State in the first Bush Administration, refers \nto the ``danger of over-stretch'' in which the United States assets are \ndeployed in multiple nation-building enterprises and are not able to \nrespond if another crisis erupts.\n  All of these concerns point to the importance of international \nsupport as a critical ingredient of both our war-fighting and our \npeace-making strategy. Without the imprimatur of the international \ncommunity, the President's war will be seen as a private vendetta by \nthe United States.\n  The President was right to frame his speech at the United Nations in \nthe context of restoring credibility to the United Nations through \nenforcement of its resolutions. This is the essential context of this \nconflict but it can be validated as such only if the international \ncommunity joins it. Regional support will provide an allied force with \nthe forward basing needed to mount a large-scale attack. Right now no \ncountry in the region contiguous to Iraq is volunteering to host \nAmerican troops in a war. International support will help dampen \nhostility toward the United States by the peoples of the region and \nhelp build support among the Iraqi people. International support for \nthe post-war, peace-making phase of the operation will reduce the \nAmerican military's footprint and decrease the need for American \nfinancial resources. Secretary Rumsfeld has testified that the United \nNations or an international coalition will run Iraq after Saddam. For \nthat to be the case, the United Nations or some ad hoc international \ncoalition will have to be formed before the war.\n  The President also must ensure our troops are properly prepared. \nRecently, the Pentagon's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Chemical and \nBiological Defense stated that American troops are not ``fully equipped \nand prepared'' against a bio-chem attack. Decontamination shelters are \nreported to be in short supply as is the decontaminant foam used to \nclean up following an attack. The General Accounting Office recently \ntestified that 250,000 defective protective suits against a chemical or \nbiological attack cannot be located and may remain in current Pentagon \ninventories.\n  We must take the threat of an Iraqi chemical or biological attack \nvery seriously. According to the British Government's White Paper on \nIraq, Iraq chemical weapons caused over 20,000 casualties in the Iran-\nIraq War. Iraq used sprayers, bombs, artillery rockets, and artillery \nshells to deliver these weapons. Thousands of rockets and artillery \nshells filled with chemical weapons remain hidden in Iraq's arsenal.\n  Haste makes waste, affirms the adage, and in this case, haste means a \nwaste of American lives. We may have an all-volunteer force but they \nare not mercenaries; they are citizen-soldiers and we owe it to each \nand every one of them and their families to proceed carefully when \nendangering their lives. Preparation is not the same as \nprocrastination.\n  Constituent opinion in my home state is running strongly against any \nauthorization of the use of force against Iraq. The President and his \nAdministration need to make a clear and compelling case to the American \npeople and to our allies abroad as to why this confrontation is \nnecessary now.\n  For that reason, Mr. President, I support efforts to frame a \nmultilateral approach to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. I \nsupport action by the United Nations in the form of a resolution \ncalling for unconditional and unfettered inspections in Iraq. Only \nafter we exhaust all of our alternative means should we engage in the \nuse of force, and before then, the President must ensure we have a \nstrategy and plans in place for winning the war and building the peace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, how much time do I control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I yield myself the remainder of my time.\n  The reason to go to the U.N. Security Council does not relate to \nsovereignty, it relates to security, and the security of the United \nStates based upon the notion the President of the United States has \nrecognized when he said he thought it was necessary to go to the U.N. \nSecurity Council.\n  I think the arguments made against the first part of the Levin \namendment are specious. Why did the President of the United States go \nto the Security Council? Was he yielding our sovereignty? No more than \nour friend from Michigan is ``yielding our sovereignty.''\n  The President went to the U.N. because, as one White House official \nsaid to me, he had to do so. Why? For our security interests. If we did \nnot go to the U.N. Security Council and check off the blocks, the \nmoment any force crossed into Iraq, we would find every U.S. embassy \nburned down in every Muslim country in the world. He went for security \nreasons.\n  My only disagreement with my friend from Michigan is I do not think \nwe need a two-step process. We should go to the United Nations, and the \nPresident says we should go to the United Nations. We should seek the \nauthority to enforce the inspectors in disarming weapons of mass \ndestruction. And if he fails, my friend says come back and get \nauthorization to proceed anyway. I am prepared to give him the \nauthorization now. That is the only disagreement we have.\n  I would disagree with those who argue against my friend from Michigan \nsaying that by his making this contingent of going to the United \nNations first, he is in no way yielding to American sovereignty, any \nmore than the President has.\n  In the underlying resolution, it requires the President, in effect, \nto go to the United Nations and exhaust all diplomacy.\n  Nobody has suggested the President of the United States has yielded \nour sovereignty. No one should suggest the Senator from Michigan is, \neither.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. My time is up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator raises a key point on which I was going to \nconclude, and that is, as we are debating, the Secretary of State is \nworking before the U.N. Security Council.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. He has made it clear to the Senator from Delaware, I am \ncertain, as he has made it clear to me, that the two-step process will \nnot achieve the goals a coalition of nations now working--Great Britain \nand the United States--desire to achieve; am I not correct?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes, with one caveat. He has expressed to me his ability \nto achieve a tough resolution would be enhanced by our not making it a \ntwo-step process. But he personally has told me and my committee he \nwould consider and the President would consider a U.N. two-step process \nif they had to. The reason for my saying not two steps now is it \nstrengthens his hand, in my view, to say to all the members of the \nSecurity Council: I just want you to know, if you do not give me \nsomething strong, I am already authorized, if you fail to do that, to \nuse force against this fellow.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is right. Were we to act now, we would substantially \nreduce his leverage and ability.\n  Mr. BIDEN. In response, I cannot honestly say substantially reduce \nit. I think it will reduce it some. This resolution, for example, \nreduces the possibility of getting a strong response compared to what \nLugar-Biden would have done. The truth is it is marginal. Everyone has \nto make their own judgment. I think it would reduce his ability. I \nwould be hard pressed to say it\n\n[[Page S10261]]\n\nwas substantial. He has a stronger hand having the authority granted to \nhim after he exhausts the U.N. outcome to say to them: Look, if you do \nnot give it to me, I now have the authority to move.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I say, Madam President, the distinguished majority leader \nsaid Congress should speak with one voice. We have in our resolution--\nyou recognize the problem of one body. This is a total substitute \namendment. It strips out everything. As the Senator from Delaware \nknows, I say to the distinguished chairman, the Levin resolution just \ntakes part of 687. It does not incorporate the previous resolutions, \nthe 16 which we have time and again on this floor said Saddam Hussein \nhas ignored.\n  I say to my friend, it is very important, as the leader said, that \nCongress speak with one voice, and the only way to do that is to retain \nour Lieberman-Warner-McCain-Bayh amendment and not have a substitute.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 30 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, if the President attempts to take this \nNation to war over Kuwaiti prisoners, I hope to God that is not what \nyou all mean by this underlying provision. If this President attempts \nto take this Nation to war over return of Kuwaiti property, if this \nPresident attempts to take this Nation to war based on this authority \nfor any reason--any reason--other than weapons of mass destruction, I \nwill be on this floor every day taking issue with this President \nattempting to stop the war. I cannot fathom anyone suggesting that \nKuwaiti prisoners warrant us going to war. This is about weapons of \nmass destruction, in this Senator's view.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I totally reject there has been any \ninference on this side of such a nature, but we do incorporate in the \npreamble the other resolutions, and I think it important they be \nincorporated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield myself 15 seconds. There may not \nbe an inference in their rhetoric, but there is more than an inference \nin the resolution they support. It says resolutions of the U.N. It \nidentifies them all, including the one on Kuwaiti prisoners. I am \nafraid while they may want to ignore the language in their own \nresolution, that is more than an inference that is there; that is \nauthorized there.\n  It is amazing to me that language is inserted into my resolution, \nwhich is not there, by the opponents of my resolution, while ignoring \nthe language in their own resolution which is there.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I should point out it also includes the \nreturn of an American prisoner, an accounting of him.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That part I support.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, the vote on the Levin substitute \namendment is one of the most important votes we will cast in this \nprocess. I commend the Senator from Michigan for his fine work on this \nalternative. The Levin amendment urges the United Nations to take \nstrong and immediate action to pass a resolution demanding unrestricted \naccess for U.N. arms inspectors in Iraq. It also urges the United \nNations to press for full enforcement of its prior resolutions on Iraq. \nThe Levin substitute language makes it clear that the United States \nwill stand behind the U.N. Security Council, even authorizing the use \nof U.S. military force to support the Security Council directives if \nnecessary.\n  At the conclusion of World War II, the United States had a vision of \na world body that would be a forum for resolving future disputes with \nmeans other than war. There were many important initiatives that needed \nmultilateral coordination by an international body. For more than half \na century, the United States has poured diplomatic energy and \nconsiderable resources into the United Nations system. During the cold \nwar years, the U.N. languished, weakened by the divisive United States-\nSoviet confrontation. But following the demise of the Soviet Union, the \nUnited Nations has regained considerable authority, and as the world's \nlone superpower, the United States is now finding that it has \nconsiderable use for the United Nations.\n  Our decade-long struggle with Saddam Hussein is one example of how \nworking with the United Nations serves our interests. We partnered with \nthe United Nations very effectively during the Persian Gulf War. \nSanctions have prevented any significant rebuilding of Iraq's \nconventional military capabilities. We maintain U.N. no-fly zones over \nIraq that have restricted military reprisals against the Iraqi Kurds \nand Shiites. United Nations inspectors on the ground in Iraq learned a \ngreat deal about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program immediately \nfollowing the gulf war. But things fell apart in subsequent years.\n  Once again, we need a strong United Nations to step up to Saddam \nHussein. The United Nations must take the lead in enforcing its demands \nthat Iraq give up its biological and chemical weapons stockpiles and \nproduction capabilities. The United Nations also demanded that Iraq \ndismantle its nuclear weapons program. I am pleased that last month, \nPresident Bush decided to take his case against Saddam Hussein to the \nUnited Nations. The U.N. Security Council has responded with vigorous \ndebate, and is considering a strong U.S. proposal for enforcement of a \nstrict U.N. inspections regime. I urge the Security Council to act now, \nand act decisively.\n  The Levin amendment puts us squarely behind this United Nations \neffort. It is the only language that does so. It is critical that we \ngive the U.N. our full support at this time, and give the Security \nCouncil the opportunity to take bold action as proposed by the United \nStates. If we undercut the United Nations here today, we are depriving \nourselves of the best chance to peacefully achieve the most important \ngoal of disarming Saddam Hussein.\n  As the world's lone super power, we need a partner in the United \nNations. Many of the critical tasks before us are actually \ninternational tasks. For instance, degradation of the environment is a \nglobal problem and requires a global solution. The crisis of climate \nchange can hardly be addressed by the United States alone. Improving \nthe quality of our water and air requires internationally coordinated \nefforts. Economic, employment and health problems are increasingly \nbecoming global issues, as people move across national boundaries in \nsearch of jobs and opportunity. We need a strong partner in these \nefforts, and the United Nations system is our best hope.\n  We are becoming increasingly aware of the disparities in the economic \nwealth and use of resources around the globe. Addressing these problems \nwill require a great deal of creative thinking and financial resources. \nWhile we are the world's strongest nation, we cannot solve these \nproblems alone. Nor do we want to. We need a strong partner in this \neffort. A reinvigorated United Nations is the most likely venue for \nprogress.\n  The spread of weapons of mass destruction has clearly become a threat \nto our national security. There is much more that the United States can \ndo to stop this proliferation. But in order to have much success at \nthese efforts, we must work in concert with the international \ncommunity. We need a strong United Nations as a partner in this effort.\n  The effect of the Levin substitute is to give the United Nations a \nchance to prove it is up to the task. If we are to have a strong and \neffective partner in confronting the many problems facing the United \nStates, then we must stand squarely behind the United Nations today. I \nurge my colleagues to support the Levin amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise in support of the Levin \nresolution. I salute my colleague from the State of\n\n[[Page S10262]]\n\nMichigan because I think what he has captured in this resolution is, \nfrankly, what the American people believe.\n  There is no one in this Senate Chamber making apologies for Saddam \nHussein or his weapons of mass destruction. There is no one who wants \nto ignore the peril which that man could pose to the Middle East or to \nthe United States of America. But what Senator Levin is suggesting is, \nfrankly, to follow what the President is suggesting.\n  On September 12, President Bush went to the United Nations and he \nsaid to them, if their organization means anything, then they have to \nstand up to this man. We have to have unconditional inspections. For 5 \nyears we have been standing by the sidelines, and we want to know what \nis happening in Iraq.\n  Senator Levin says that is the first place we should go, and I agree \nwith him. And it is not as if the United Nations has ignored this. \nSecretary of State Colin Powell, a man I respect very much--one of the \nleaders in this administration--has been in New York working with the \nUnited Nations for this resolution. That is the best course of action. \nTo have the United Nations behind us, as President Bush's father had \nthe United Nations behind him in the Persian Gulf war, to have a \ncoalition of allies representing countries from all around the world; \ncountries that have joined us in the war on terrorism would now join us \nin a meaningful inspection regime in Iraq. That is what Senator Levin \nsuggests.\n  What a contrast it is from the President's own resolution. The \nPresident's resolution talks about continued discussion with the United \nNations. But make no mistake, the President's resolution gives him \nunconditional, go-it-alone authority to launch a land invasion in Iraq \nwith or without an ally. There is a world of difference between what \nSenator Levin and I support and what the President has asked for.\n  Doesn't it make more sense for us to work with the United Nations for \nunconditional inspections to make certain we have inspectors on the \nground looking at every square inch of Iraq, and if there is resistance \nfrom Saddam Hussein, if he obstructs us, if he creates obstacles, we \nthen have the force of the United Nations behind us in enforcement? We \ndo not stand alone. We stand with other nations and with the United \nNations. That is what President Bush's father did, and it was the right \nthing to do. That is what we should do because, frankly, bringing this \nforce together is a validation of this organization, the United \nNations, which the United States, as much as any other nation in the \nworld, helped to create.\n  After World War II, we said: Let's come together in collective \nsecurity to work together to solve the problems of the world and to \ndeal with war and peace.\n  Time and again, in over 100 instances, the United Nations has risen \nto that challenge. We should give them that same opportunity and \nresponsibility with the Levin resolution. That is the better course of \naction. As Senator Levin says clearly in his resolution, nothing in the \nresolution ever diminishes in any way whatsoever the power of the \nPresident of the United States to defend this country, its people, its \nterritory, its Armed Forces, against any threat of aggression. That is \npart of what we expect of the Commander in Chief, the President, \nand Senator Levin preserves and protects that.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Levin amendment. The Levin \namendment is the best way for us to approach this challenge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Arizona has 1 minute.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I may be in the debate on the Durbin \namendment. We can discuss the comparison between this situation and \nKosovo. The United Nations Security Council never acted in Kosovo. The \nUnited States of America was not imminently threatened--was not \nthreatened--but genocide was going on in Kosovo where thousands of \npeople were being ethnically cleansed. If we had passed the Levin \namendment at the time of Kosovo, when those of us supported then-\nPresident Clinton, we would have waited to find out whether the \nSecurity Council acted or not and then we would have come back and \nconsidered whether Kosovo was a threat to the United States of America. \nKosovo is not today, was not then, and will not be tomorrow a threat, \nbut the United States of America had an obligation, and because the \nUnited Nations Security Council did not act did not hamstring us.\n  The reading of this amendment says the Congress will come back into \nsession in case of certain Security Council actions. There is no other \nway to read it. This amendment should be resoundingly defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan controls the \nremaining 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, that Saddam Hussein is a threat, must \nagree to inspections and be disarmed is something on which I hope we \nall agree. The only question here is: What is the best way to do that? \nDo we do that by going to the world community, as the President has, \nand saying we want the world community to enforce its resolution \nrelative to weapons of mass destruction? And do we mean it? Do we go \nthere, and are we serious when we say to them: We want you to act \nbecause it makes a difference, when force is used, as to whether or not \nit has the credibility and strength of the United Nations and the world \ncommunity behind it? It makes a difference.\n  It did not make a difference in Kosovo. It makes a difference here. \nThe ramifications of going it alone here are major. In the short term, \nour troops are going to be more in danger if we go it alone without the \nU.N. authorization.\n  We have been told by the Saudis and other countries we are not going \nto have access to their bases, their airspace, their support, unless \nthere is a U.N. resolution. We have been informed of that.\n  We know that the war against terrorism can be weakened unless we act \nas a world community. We cannot act unilaterally and expect that other \nnations are going to join us in a war on terrorism the way they would \nif there were a U.N. resolution supporting it.\n  If we go it alone, there are both short-term risks as well as long-\nterm risks. The long-term risks in going it alone are that without an \nimminent threat--if there is one, we can move in self-defense. No U.N. \nresolution is ever needed to act in self-defense. But to act without an \nimminent threat, to attack another nation, raises some significant \nprecedent problems for other threatening parts of the world. India and \nPakistan can easily say there is a continuing threat and use this kind \nof a precedent to justify attacking each other. That is not the kind of \nprecedent we should set.\n\n  So there are real risks that we should recognize in using force \nunilaterally. We should see the advantage of doing this multilaterally \nwith the support of the world community. We should go to the world \ncommunity, focus all of our efforts there, and tell them we are \nserious.\n  We say we are. Let's mean it, not just say that we want them to be \ncredible but mean it, and to tell them in advance: Oh, by the way, if \nyou do not do it, we will anyway.\n  It takes them right off the hook. Instead of putting a focus on the \nneed for world community action to authorize this action and the \nadvantage of it, our focus becomes blurred. It is an inconsistent \nmessage to the world. Now it is a message of unilateralism. We say: We \nneed you, but whether you do it or not, we are going it alone.\n  This resolution--and here I must say I agree with my friend from \nArizona. He agrees with me that it would be better if we got authority \nfrom the U.N., and I am glad he does. And then when he says we must not \ndelegate our security policy to the U.N., I agree with him. We never \nwill; we never would. This resolution explicitly eliminates any such \nimplication by the reiteration of the right to act in self-defense.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to yield for a question. How much time do \nI have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 50 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. This is a quick question. Some of our colleagues on the \nother side have basically said the Senator is relying totally on the \nUnited\n\n[[Page S10263]]\n\nNations. I have read the Senator's resolution over and over. He is so \nclear on the point that at any time the President can take action in \nself-defense and, in addition, at any time the President can come back \nand make the case for unilateral action. Am I correct on that reading, \nthat at any time he can come back and answer the questions he has yet \nto answer and lay out what it would mean to us to go it alone? Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is very much correct. I thank the Senator for \nthe support and for her kind words earlier this afternoon.\n  Madam President, is there any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield back the entire length of my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, my good friend, the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, has questioned some of the things I have done today. I am \ndisappointed he feels that way.\n  Last night we worked for a long period of time. It was not a matter \nof minutes; it took a long time. The Senator from Virginia, the Senator \nfrom Arizona, the Senator from Connecticut, and others, including the \npeople offering these amendments--I personally spent time on the phone \ncalling Senators who had amendments. The result, after a long period of \ntime, was that Senators who have amendments--Senator Boxer, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Levin, Senator Byrd--we worked out an arrangement where \nthey could offer their amendments. Senator Dayton always was going to \noffer his amendment and he withdrew it and decided not to offer it. His \nwas nongermane.\n  In an effort to get this done, we allowed some amendments to be voted \non today that were nongermane. That is how compromises are made in \nlegislation. As part of the deal, the Senators who had other amendments \nwould withdraw those amendments. There was clearly never any question \nabout that. It is in the Record last night, ``and they will offer no \nother amendments tomorrow.''\n  In the rush of things, they were not withdrawn last night. They \nshould have been. They were not. Just like the problem we had with \nSenator Byrd today, he understood there was a unanimous consent request \nthat had never been made that was in the Record.\n  First, we did not need consent to withdraw this. Every Senator had \nthe right on their own to withdraw this. That is a right. They did not \nneed unanimous consent.\n  My good friend who understands the rules as well as anyone here had \nthe right at any time to file a first-degree amendment. For reasons he \nknows, he decided not to do so. He indicated he had second-degree \namendments that he wanted to pin to some of the amendments, that the \narrangements were made to not be part of the proceedings today.\n  I also say to my friend, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, he \nsaid: Well, I will not agree to any of your unanimous consent requests.\n  I don't make unanimous consent requests for me. Rarely. I bet out of \n100 unanimous consent requests, there is not three-tenths of 1 percent \nthat I make for myself. I will try during this vote and the rest of the \nevening to see if we can work something out for the Senator from \nPennsylvania that will satisfy him. We always try to do that. Both the \nmajority and the minority floor staffs work very hard. We will try to \ndo that. I don't want him upset and disappointed.\n  I want the Record to indicate that what they did last night was for \nthe good of this body. We did our best. It may not have been a perfect \narrangement, but I think it was fair. Senators were allowed to offer an \namendment and in exchange for that they withdrew the others. \nTechnically, they didn't do that last night. I didn't do it on their \nbehalf. We did it this morning. It is done. That was the fair thing to \ndo.\n  I repeat for the second time that I will be happy to work with the \nSenator from Pennsylvania to see if we can arrive at the conclusion he \nwants. We will see what we can do.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Along with the Senator from Virginia, the Senator from \nWest Virginia, and other Senators, negotiations were conducted in good \nfaith, in fairness, with full consultation. Many, many Senators are \nunhappy that they were unable to perhaps propose more amendments or \nperhaps do other things.\n  I attest to the fact that the Senator from Nevada, fulfilling his \nduties of getting this legislation achieved with the consideration due \nevery Senator, in my view, did a fair and unbiased job.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I associate myself with the----\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. The leader is to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is the manager and \nis recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I associate myself with the remarks of my colleague, Mr. \nMcCain. I attest to the accuracy of the statement the Senator made.\n  I further add that the distinguished Republican leader, Mr. Lott, \nfrom time to time visited with the floor managers, so he, likewise, was \nvery much aware of the procedures.\n  Mr. REID. I kept the majority leader advised of everything that we \ndid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to respond to \nthe Senator from Nevada, over the Senator from Virginia, because what \nthe Senator from Virginia has said and what the Senator from Arizona \nhas said does not bear on this issue.\n  I am not upset. I think I have been treated unfairly. I did not offer \na first-degree amendment to the so-called Biden-Lugar amendment because \nI had expected Senator Biden to offer that amendment. He did not do so \nup until 1 p.m. yesterday. Having found that out, I consulted with the \nParliamentarian and found out that I could offer a second-degree \namendment to some seven pending first-degree amendments. I worked it \nout very carefully and elaborately with the Parliamentarian this \nmorning. The word was out that I was offering the Biden-Lugar \namendment.\n  Other Members of the Senate from the other side of the aisle \napproached me, liked the fact I was doing it, and wanted an opportunity \nto vote on it. I got a call from a ranking member of the State \nDepartment saying the White House was concerned that I offered the \namendment. The word was out that I had moved ahead to offer the Biden-\nLugar amendment as a second-degree amendment. I had done that because, \nafter extensive conversations with Senator Biden last week, I had \ndecided to cosponsor it. When it was not offered, I decided to offer \nit. I was under no illusion of its being successful. It seemed to me on \na matter of this importance, going to war, that matter ought to be \nbefore the Senate. So I worked it out. When I walked off the floor, I \nwas told by an aide that the Senator from Nevada had asked unanimous \nconsent to withdraw not only the Levin amendment, the Durbin amendment, \nand the Boxer amendment, but also the Dayton amendment. That was done \nin my absence. I thought that was unfair. I approached the Senator from \nNevada and said so. It seems to me that I ought to have an opportunity \nto offer that amendment.\n  Now, I read the Record from last night that is referred to with \nrespect to three of the Senators, Senator Levin, Senator Boxer, and \nSenator Durbin. Senator Dayton is not mentioned. I know he has the \nright to withdraw the amendment. Senator Dayton does not like the \nresolution. Perhaps he would not have. There is an issue as to whether \nSenator Dayton's amendment was germane. I am advised by the \nParliamentarian that my second-degree amendment being germane cures \nwhatever infirmity there may be on the Dayton first-degree amendment.\n  I have been in this body for 22 years, and I do not think I have \nobjected to any unanimous consent agreement. However, there are plenty \nof Senators who do. I am not talking about the percentage the Senator \nfrom Nevada offers on his own behalf. This is part of my\n\n[[Page S10264]]\n\nobjection to the way this entire debate is being run. There is cloture \nfiled. I understand the rules. Seventh-five Senators voted against it. \nI have already heard comments from some who voted against it who are \nsorry they did so.\n  We are about to go to war and a Senator does not have a right to \noffer an amendment. A unanimous consent agreement is asked in my \nabsence and I do not think that is fair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Utah (Mr. Bennett) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska).

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: It is the \nunderstanding of the Senator from Virginia that the Durbin amendment is \nnext under the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. And will the Chair state the allocation of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois controls 40 minutes; \nthe Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, controls 10 minutes; and Senators \nWarner and McCain share 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are ready to proceed. I would like to \njust address the Senate momentarily, and I say to my distinguished \nfriend and floor leader, that on this side, the following Senators have \nindicated a desire for some time to speak: Senator DeWine, Senator \nCollins, Senator Specter, Senator Sessions, Senator Ensign, Senator \nSmith, Senator McConnell, Senator Gramm, Senator Fitzgerald, and \nSenator Shelby.\n  Now, we have progressed very well through this debate to allocate the \nspeakers going from one side to the other. I would hope we could do \nthat. And in due course we could work together, I say to my good \nfriend, who has been so helpful to move this piece of legislation, to \nget a UC to put speakers in line so as to sequence the times so that \nSenators can go about their duties today on other matters more \nconveniently.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Virginia, we also \nhave a list of people who want to speak. Under the rules, we have 30 \nhours postcloture. We have used some of that time today. We have 100 \nSenators. A number of Senators have already spoken. I have looked at \nour list. I heard the Senator briefly mention his list. I would hope \nthose Senators who have already spoken would allow some who have not \nthe opportunity to speak. But that is a personal choice they have to \nmake.\n  During this next debate, I will be happy to direct our floor staff, \nas you will, to see if we can work out--I think if we do more than four \nat a time, it creates a problem. So we will work on that and see if we \ncan come up with some speakers after we dispose of this next amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the leader. So we shall work together.\n  Senator McCain and I will require additional time on this side, both \nof us, to address various issues. Having managed the bill, there are \nareas of this debate we believe need to be put in the proper context in \nwhich questions arose and were answered.\n  Mr. REID. After the two leaders, you have the right of first \nrecognition, so you would certainly be able to do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I understand, I say to my leader, following \ndisposition of the Durbin amendment, the parliamentary situation is \nthat we are now on the balance of the 30 hours remaining under cloture; \nam I correct?\n  Mr. REID. Since cloture was invoked this morning. I don't remember \nexactly when it was invoked.\n  Mr. WARNER. About 11:10 is my recollection.\n  Mr. REID. The 30 hours started running at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time was 11:38 a.m.\n  Mr. WARNER. Just to inform Senators what the parliamentary situation \nis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois is recognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I am not mistaken, the Senator from \nMississippi was seeking unanimous consent to speak at this time. I \nyield to him before I call up the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, over the last several years the \nSubcommittee on International Security, Proliferation and Federal \nServices has monitored weapons systems development in Iraq and \nelsewhere. We have held numerous public hearings on the threat these \ndevelopments pose to our national security.\n  For the information of all Senators, I am putting in the Record an \nunclassified description of the subcommittee's findings from the \ntestimony presented to us by the intelligence agencies at our hearings. \nI firmly believe we are confronted with a dangerous threat to our \nforces who are now deployed in that area of the world. I am also \nconvinced the President has outlined a strategy for dealing with this \nthreat and with the dangers faced by our homeland which involves the \nUnited Nations and the Congress in the decisionmaking process, and we \nshould support him.\n  This support would be clearly illustrated by approval of the \nLieberman-Warner-McCain amendment. We should let our friends and \nadversaries alike know that, as a nation, we are united in our resolve \nto do whatever is necessary to protect our national security and the \nsafety of our citizens, including the use of military force.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the outline of findings from my \nsubcommittee which I described be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Facts About Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction\n\n       Iraq's program to develop weapons of mass destruction and \n     the means to deliver them has been underway for over three \n     decades. Although it suffered setbacks during and immediately \n     after the Gulf War, the program has since been reconstituted \n     and has achieved significant progress in recent years. The \n     following key facts about Iraq's program to acquire and \n     employ weapons of mass destruction are drawn from \n     publications and testimony of intelligence officials.\n       In an October 2002 report entitled ``Iraq's Weapons of Mass \n     Destruction Programs,'' the Central Intelligence Agency \n     reached these key judgments:\n       Iraq has continued its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) \n     programs in defiance of UN resolutions and restrictions. Iraq \n     has chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles with \n     ranges in excess of UN restrictions; if left unchecked, it \n     probably will have a nuclear weapon during this decade.\n       Iraq hides large portions of its WMD efforts. Revelations \n     after the Gulf War starkly demonstrate the extensive efforts \n     undertaken by Iraq to deny the world information about its \n     programs.\n\n[[Page S10265]]\n\n       Since inspections ended in 1998, Iraq has maintained its \n     chemical weapons efforts, energized its missile program, and \n     invested more heavily in biological weapons; most analysts \n     assess Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program.\n       Iraq's growing ability to sell oil illicitly increases \n     Baghdad's capabilities to finance WMD programs; annual \n     earnings in cash and goods have more than quadrupled.\n       Iraq largely has rebuilt missile and biological weapons \n     facilities damaged during Operation Desert Fox and has \n     expanded its chemical and biological infrastructure under the \n     cover of civilian production.\n       Baghdad has exceeded UN range limits of 150 km with its \n     ballistic missiles and is working with unmanned aerial \n     vehicles (UAVs), which allow for a more lethal means to \n     deliver biological and, less likely, chemical warfare agents.\n       Although Saddam probably does not yet have nuclear weapons \n     or sufficient material to make any, he remains intent on \n     acquiring them.\n       How quickly Iraq will obtain its first nuclear weapon \n     depends on when it acquires sufficient weapons-grade fissile \n     material.\n       If Baghdad acquires sufficient weapons-grade fissile \n     material from abroad, it could make a nuclear weapon within a \n     year.\n       Iraq has begun renewed production of chemical warfare \n     agents, probably including mustard, sarin, cyclosarin, and \n     VX. Its capability was reduced during United Nations \n     inspections and is probably more limited now than it was at \n     the time of the Gulf War, although VX production and agent \n     storage life probably have been improved.\n       Saddam probably has stocked a few hundred metric tons of \n     chemical weapon (CW) agents.\n       The Iraqis have experience in manufacturing CW bombs, \n     artillery rockets, and projectiles, and probably possess \n     chemical agents for ballistic missile warheads, including for \n     a limited number of covertly stored, extended-range Scuds.\n       All key aspects--R, production, and weaponization--of \n     Iraq's offensive biological weapon (BW) program are active \n     and most elements are larger and more advanced than they were \n     before the Gulf War.\n       Iraq has some lethal and incapacitating BW agents and is \n     capable of quickly producing and weaponizing a variety of \n     such agents, including anthrax, for delivery by bombs, Scud \n     missiles, aerial sprayers, and covert operatives, including \n     potentially against the U.S. Homeland.\n       Baghdad has established a large-scale, redundant, and \n     concealed BW agent production capability, which includes \n     mobile facilities; these facilities can evade detection, are \n     highly survivable, and can exceed the production rates Iraq \n     had prior to the Gulf War.\n       Iraq maintains a small missile force and several \n     development programs, including for an Unmanned Aerial \n     Vehicle (UAV) that most analysts believe probably is intended \n     to deliver biological warfare agents.\n       Gaps in Iraqi accounting to UNSCOM suggests that Saddam \n     retains a covert force of up to a few dozen Scud-variant \n     missiles with ranges of 650 to 900 km.\n       Iraq is deploying its new al-Samoud and Ababil-100 short-\n     range ballistic missiles, which are capable of flying beyond \n     the U.N.-authorized 150-km range limit.\n       Iraq's UAVs, especially if used for delivery of chemical \n     and biological warfare (CBW) agents, could threaten its \n     neighbors, U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, and the United \n     States if brought close to, or into, the U.S. Homeland.\n       Iraq is developing medium-range ballistic missile \n     capabilities, largely through foreign assistance in building \n     specialized facilities.\n       Iraq's effort to extend the reach of its ballistic missile \n     force is not limited to medium-range missiles capable of \n     striking its immediate neighbors. Iraq has pursued long-range \n     ballistic missiles in the past and has even tested a \n     rudimentary space launch vehicle (SLV).\n       In testimony before the Subcommittee on International \n     Security, Proliferation and Federal Services, Robert Walpole, \n     the National Intelligence Officer for Strategic and Nuclear \n     Programs stated, ``Iraq's goals of becoming the predominant \n     regional power, and its hostile relations with many of its \n     neighbors, are the key drivers behind Iraq's ballistic \n     missile program.''\n       According to the Department of Defense's report \n     ``Proliferation: Threat and Response,'' Iraq in December 1988 \n     attempted to launch the Al Abid 3-stage space launch vehicle, \n     which used 5 Scud missiles clustered together as a first \n     stage.\n       The Intelligence Community's unclassified summary of the \n     ``National Intelligence Estimate on Foreign Missile \n     Developments and the Ballistic Missile Threat Through 2015'' \n     states:\n       After observing North Korean missile development the past \n     few years, Iraq would be likely to pursue a three-stage Taepo \n     Dong-2 [TD-2] approach to a ICBM, or space-launched vehicle, \n     which would be capable of delivering a nuclear weapon-sized \n     payload to the United States.\n       Iraq could develop and test a Taepo Dong-2-type system \n     within about ten years of a decision to do so.\n       If Iraq could buy a TD-2 from North Korea, it could have a \n     launch capability within a year or two of a purchase.\n       It could develop and test a TD-1-type [Taepo Dong-1] \n     system, within a few years.\n       Iraq could attempt before 2015 to test a rudimentary long-\n     range missile based on its failed Al-Abid SLV . . .\n       If it acquired No Dongs from North Korea, it could test an \n     ICBM within a few years of acquisition by clustering and \n     staging the No Dongs--similar to the clustering of Scuds for \n     the Al-Abid SLV.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4865 To Amendment No. 4586\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pursuant to the unanimous consent \nagreement, I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4865 to amendment No. 4586.\n\n(Purpose: To amend the authorization for the use of the Armed Forces to \n cover an imminent threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction \n            rather than the continuing threat posed by Iraq)\n\n       On page 7, line 20, strike ``the continuing threat posed by \n     Iraq'' and insert ``an imminent threat posed by Iraq's \n     weapons of mass destruction''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I call up this amendment to the underlying \nresolution presented by the President and sponsored by Senator \nLieberman and others on the floor of the Senate.\n  In this Capitol Building, there are many historic rooms. There is one \nthat is of great significance to me. It is only a few steps down the \nhall. It was in room 219 where I gathered with about a dozen of my \ncolleagues among the Senate Democrats for a meeting on the morning of \nSeptember 11, 2001. I can still recall the meeting vividly as we \nwatched the television screen and its report, as we heard of the \nevacuation of the White House, as we jumped from our chairs and looked \ndown The Mall to see the black smoke billowing from the Pentagon. And \nthen we were told immediately to leave this great building and rushed \ndown the steps and far away.\n  That is my image of September 11. Everyone who is following this \ndebate has their own image of September 11. My world changed. America \nchanged. Perhaps things changed all around the world on that day.\n  I came to work on that morning never believing that just a few days \nlater, on September 14, I would stand on this floor and join every one \nof my colleagues in the Senate in a unanimous bipartisan vote of \nsupport for President Bush's request for war on terrorism. I am not a \nperson who comes to that vote easily. I am one who grew up with the \nspecter of war during our war in Vietnam. I am a person who served in \nthe Congress and considered the momentous decision of the Persian Gulf \nwar. I always took those votes extremely seriously. But there was no \ndoubt in my mind on September 14, this was the right one. The war \nagainst terrorism was the right one. We were going to go after those \nparties responsible for what they had done to us on that day of infamy.\n  Now we gather in the Senate, a little over a year later, to face \nanother historic vote. The President has asked Congress for the \nauthority to wage another war, a war against Iraq. It is fair first to \nask what progress we have made on the war against terrorism. Some \nthings have happened for which we can be very proud.\n  The Taliban is out of power in Afghanistan. They no longer will be \ncatering to the kind of extremist we saw with al-Qaida. Osama bin Laden \nis at least on the run, and that is certainly good news. Afghanistan is \nmoving back toward a civilized state. Women are returning to the \nstreets without the burkas. Girls are going to school. Positive things \nare happening. We saw an intelligence network created around the world \nto support the U.S. war on terrorism, an amazing display of unity and \nsupport for what we were doing.\n  But still, as I stand here today and make this assessment of the war \non terrorism, the manhunt continues for Osama bin Laden and his top \nlieutenants. Afghanistan is still in its national infancy. Hamid \nKarzai, leader of Afghanistan, is a good man but barely escaped an \nassassination attempt a few weeks ago, an assassination that, had it \nresulted, would have thrown that nation into chaos. Al-Qaida is still \nknown to be in 60 nations around the world, and this war is far from \nover.\n  Make no mistake, we cannot dedicate the resources, the manpower, the \nskills, and the weapons of war to a new war in Iraq without sacrifices \nin our war on terrorism. This will be a war on two fronts; sacrifices \nwill be made.\n\n[[Page S10266]]\n\n  Let's speak to the President's request for a war against Iraq. If you \nhave followed the comments from the President since August until today, \nyou will note that his approach has changed. In fact, this is the third \nversion of the resolution before us.\n\n  In one respect it is a tribute to the President that he has worked \nwith others to try to improve the resolution. We expect that. In \nanother, it suggests a change in attitude and philosophy and perhaps an \nintent as this resolution develops.\n  The speech the President gave on Monday night I listened to, every \nsingle word of it. I wanted to hear everything he had to say. The \nspeech the President gave to the American people was far different than \nthe language of the resolution before us.\n  What has happened since August when the President first raised the \nspecter of Iraq as a threat to the United States?\n  Initially the White House said: We don't need congressional approval. \nWe can move forward. They went on to say: We can do it unilaterally. We \ndon't need any allies. We can attack Iraq if necessary by ourselves. \nAnd the President said our goal is regime change. We want Saddam \nHussein gone. We have had enough of him. And he went on to say--Vice \nPresident Cheney backed him up--inspections by the U.N. are worthless. \nWe tried that.\n  That was the first cut, the first position of the White House.\n  Last Monday, when the President gave a speech, it was a much \ndifferent message. He is seeking congressional approval. That is why we \nare here today. He said that he is going to help lead a coalition of \nforces against Saddam Hussein, far different than what this resolution \nsays, far different than what he said at the outset.\n  He is now working through the United Nations; something that had been \ndismissed early on in the debate has now become a big part of it. The \nPresident went on to say that he is now focusing on weapons of mass \ndestruction and destroying them. There won't be any argument here. I \nhave yet to meet a single Member of Congress who defends Saddam Hussein \nand his weapons of mass destruction.\n  The President said we need an inspection regime through the United \nNations. That is a big departure from where he was. But that speech \nbasically described a process the President suggested and endorsed, \nwhich many of us endorse as well.\n  In 8 weeks the administration has changed its rhetoric but the \nresolution we have before us has not. This resolution is important for \nmany reasons. First, it is a war resolution. With this expression of \nauthority from Congress, the President will have what he needs under \nour Constitution to move forward, to dispatch troops, mobilize \nreserves, move the men and women in uniform into harm's way, and be \nprepared for battle. That is, of course, the most important part of the \nresolution.\n\n  Another part rivals it in importance. This resolution is historically \nimportant because it marks a dramatic departure in the foreign policy \nof the United States of America. It is not simply a question of our \npolicy toward Iraq or Saddam Hussein; it is a question of our policy \ntoward the world.\n  This resolution still authorizes a unilateral, go-it-alone invasion \nof Iraq. This resolution contains no requirement to build a coalition \nof allies behind us. It has been said over and over again, isn't it \nbetter for the United States to have a coalition behind us than to have \na coalition against us? This resolution does not specify that we are \ntargeting weapons of mass destruction. This resolution represents a \ndramatic departure in foreign policy. That is why I have offered this \namendment.\n  Senator Levin of Michigan was here earlier speaking about the role of \nthe U.N. As much as any nation, the United States has guided and \nnurtured the U.N. We have gone through painful, frustrating moments \nwhen we have disagreed with their actions and could not agree with \nSecurity Council decisions, but by and large we have stood by the U.N. \nsince its creation. In the words of Kofi Annan, ``The U.N. is the \ninternational community at work for the rule of law.''\n  That is as succinct a description of what the U.N. is all about as I \nhave ever read. We have been with the U.N. through NATO, in the cold \nwar, on questions of post-Soviet transatlantic order, and a variety of \nother issues. Now comes the President, on September 12 of this year, \nwho visits the U.N. and issues a significant challenge. He says to the \nU.N. on September 12: If this organization has a backbone, it is going \nto stand up to Saddam Hussein, demand inspections for the weapons of \nmass destruction, and remove or destroy them. And if it does not, the \nPresident basically said that the U.N. is irrelevant; it has become the \nLeague of Nations.\n  Well, since then, progress has been made. A man whom I respect very \nmuch, Secretary of State Colin Powell, has been involved in shuttle \ndiplomacy with the Security Council to put together U.N. support for \njust the very approach the President asked. It is the right approach--\nto really put our inspectors on the ground with no holds barred, \nnothing off limits, with no exemptions for Presidential palaces, so \nthat we can go in and discover, with the help of our intelligence \ncommunity, which will provide information where we think the weapons \ncan be found and, in finding them, be able to establish once and for \nall that Iraq is in violation of U.N. resolutions and destroy the \nweapons.\n  If Saddam Hussein and Iraq should resist or stop us, consider the \nposition we are in. We can then turn to the U.N. and say: We gave you \nyour opportunity. You know this man will not comply with orders. Now \nstand together in enforcing the U.N. inspection. What a strong position \nthat is--for us to have a coalition of nations, through the U.N., \nworking with us, rather than the Bush resolution, which says we will do \nit by ourselves.\n  I think we have seen progress, but this resolution would brush it all \naside. This resolution would say to the U.N. and others around the \nworld: Go ahead and finish your debate and engage yourself as much as \nyou like, but in the final analysis this Nation, the United States of \nAmerica, will do exactly what it wants to do.\n  I don't think that has been our approach historically. We have always \nsaid: If you attack us, expect an answer. That is what happened on \nSeptember 14, when we voted on the resolution on the war on terrorism. \nBut why, if the U.N. is making progress toward this goal, do we want to \nsay we are going to ignore the progress you have made, ignore the fact \nthat you have accepted this challenge, we are going to ignore the \npossibility of meaningful inspections to disarm Iraq, and we will go it \nalone, we will launch a land invasion?\n  I think that is a mistake. This U.N. coalition effort is very \nimportant. In October of last year, President Bush stated, with some \npride, that we had launched our war on terrorism, and he said: ``We are \nsupported by the collective will of the world.'' And we were. The \nPresident has a right to be proud of that. The fact that we mobilized \nnations around the world to come behind us in the war against al-Qaida \nand the terrorists meant something in the war on terrorism.\n  Why, then, does it not mean something today? Why, then, when we are \nconsidering this war resolution, are we not committing to build a \ncoalition of force to make sure we are successful? We know what the \ncoalition means. It means strength in numbers. It means a sharing of \nthe burden. Why should it only be American soldiers walking through the \ndeserts on the way to Baghdad? Should we not have an international \nforce? Because the threat Saddam Hussein poses is certainly to the \nMiddle East and other countries before it threatens the United States. \nWhy should other nations not defray the cost of this war? The fact that \nwe would spend $100 billion or $200 billion when we are currently in \ndeficit--why should that not be shared? Certainly, when we fought in \nthe Persian Gulf, that was what happened. There is nothing in the Bush \nresolution for a coalition of force to join us in this effort in Iraq.\n  Also, the creation of a coalition establishes vital cover for other \nnations to join us. Do you recall the comments made by Saudi Arabia a \nfew days after the President's visit to the U.N.? They had been not \nonly cold but antagonistic to the idea of the United States going it \nalone against Iraq. They announced, after his visit to the U.N., that \nif the U.N. took action, they\n\n[[Page S10267]]\n\nwould cooperate. Why is that significant? It is as significant today as \nit was in the Persian Gulf. President Bush's father realized that when \nyou bring Arab States into the coalition, it is critically important as \nwe consider action against an Arab nation, Iraq.\n  Think of this for a moment, too: If our coalition includes Arab \nStates and countries from around the world, it minimizes the impact \nthis will have on the fundamentalists and extremists who are trying to \nbreed and educate and train the next generation of terrorists. A third \nof the people living in the Arab world today are under the age of 14.\n  If this is a coalition including Arab States, then we are in a much \nstronger position to argue that it is U.N. action, collective action, \nit is not the United States going it alone. This will help to defuse \nany terrorists who might come out and will help to establish stability \nafter the attack.\n  Let me go to the particular reason to raise this amendment to this \nresolution. The House has passed the resolution we are considering. It \ntells you we are drawing that much closer to the possibility of war. It \nis a historic decision, one which now is in this Chamber. If this \nChamber agrees to the same resolution and presents it on the \nPresident's desk, my guess is it will be signed very quickly. It is \nmore than just war against Iraq. Just a few weeks ago, the \nadministration released what they called ``The National Security \nStrategy of the United States of America.'' It is a document which \noutlines what they consider to be the new parameters of foreign policy \nin our Nation. It is well worth the read.\n  You will find in this document, on page 15, a significant and \nhistoric departure from the foreign policy of the United States. The \nargument is made in this publication by the administration, by \nPresident Bush's White House, that the world has changed so \nsignificantly since September 11, 2001, that the principles and values \nand norms of conduct of our foreign policy must be changed dramatically \nin this respect. We have always said to the world: The United States is \nnot an aggressor nation. We are not seeking to invade your country for \nterritory or treasure. But if you threaten us, you can expect that we \nwill return with all the force and power we have. We are not trying to \nconquer you, but if you threaten our territory, our people, our allies, \nour Armed Forces, you can expect the worst. That is the way it should \nbe.\n\n  We have said historically we are a defensive nation. Even at the \nheight of the cold war, we did not endorse a first strike against the \nSoviet Union. No, we are a defensive nation. This new foreign policy \nreflected in the resolution before us is a dramatic departure from \nthat.\n  The argument is made that we have no choice. Because we are now \nfighting terrorism, we can no longer wait for an imminent threat \nagainst the United States. We have to be able to move preemptively for \nwhat might be, as is said in this resolution, a continuing threat.\n  What does it mean? If you list the nations of the world that pose any \nthreat to the United States, unfortunately the list is fairly long. It \nwould not just be Iraq. The President's ``axis of evil'' includes North \nKorea and Iran. One would certainly put Syria, Libya, and maybe many \nother countries on that list.\n  What the President's foreign policy is calling for is the right of \nthe United States to attack these countries without provocation, \nwithout imminent threat. That, I say to my friends in the Senate, is a \ndramatic departure in foreign policy. We are not just talking about how \nto deal with Saddam Hussein, how to deal with weapons of mass \ndestruction in Iraq, what to do through the United Nations. The \nsupporters of this resolution are calling for a dramatic departure in \nAmerican foreign policy.\n  From my point of view, it is a departure which is unwarranted and \nunwise. This is why I believe it: For over 50 years, with nuclear \nArmageddon facing us, with nuclear missiles poised in the Soviet Union \nand in the United States, our position was one of deterrence. We said, \nas I mentioned before, we would not strike first. We held that \nposition, with some rare exceptions. That was our position as a nation, \nand it prevailed. It prevailed to overcome the Soviet Union and, \nfrankly, to bring the Russians closer to our position in the world and \nto bring the world closer to peace.\n  Look what has happened in the last 10 years in our relationship with \nIraq. Since the Persian Gulf war, we have made it clear to Saddam \nHussein and his leaders that if they make one bad move with a weapon of \nmass destruction, either through a terrorist organization or directly \nagainst the United States, its neighbors, or any of our allies, \nfrankly, they will pay a heavy price. There has never been a doubt \nabout that. There is no doubt about that today.\n  The establishment and maintenance of the no-fly zone is our way of \nkeeping an eye on Saddam Hussein from start to finish. There is not a \ntank or truck that moves in Iraq today we do not monitor. There is not \na hole that is dug and filled up we do not monitor. We made that clear \nunder existing foreign policy, but this resolution says it is time for \nus to change that policy. It is time for us to argue we can \npreemptively strike Iraq or any other country before they pose a threat \nto the United States. That is a dramatic change.\n  My amendment goes to this issue and says the President has the \nauthority to use force. Let me read it specifically because I do not \nwant to misstate it for my colleagues:\n\n       The President is authorized to use the Armed Forces of the \n     United States as he determines to be necessary and \n     appropriate in order to defend the national security of \n     the United States against an imminent threat posed by \n     Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  That is what my amendment says. It spells that out in terms of \nforeign policy that we have created, in many respects, and honored \nthroughout our history. To state it as stated in this resolution is to \nendorse this new rewrite of American foreign policy and to say in the \nage of terrorism that preemption is the answer.\n  I asked Dr. Condoleezza Rice a question when she came before us a few \nweeks ago, as follows: If we are going to argue that we have the right \nas a nation to attack any nation we suspect may be a threat to us, how \nthen can the United States play a role in the world supporting \ndiplomacy and peace? How can we argue to countries that are in \nincendiary relationships, such as India and Pakistan over Kashmir, that \nthey should not do preemptive attacks of their own? How do we make that \nargument?\n  Oh, she said, diplomacy is working in Kashmir. It depends on what day \nof the week that question is asked. I hope it works. I hope peace comes \nto that region. We really lose our right to argue and demand more \ndiplomacy and more peacekeeping when we say the United States may \npreempt any perceived threat, but other nations in the world should \nnegotiate. The same can be said of China and Taiwan and many other \nplaces in the world.\n  To my colleagues I say this: This resolution not only addresses Iraq, \nit marks a significant departure in foreign policy. I hope, even though \nwe have not had hearings, even though we have not debated this at \nlength, that this amendment which I offer, with just a handful of \nwords, will call into question whether this is the wisest policy, \nwhether this is a necessary policy.\n  Let me say this as well. I know the United States is in a fearful and \nanxious situation since the attacks of September 11, 2001. Though we \nhave been heartened by the strength of this Nation and its unity, there \nis still a lingering question as to whether we will be struck again.\n  It is because of that anxiety, because of that fear, I think many of \nus are moving now to say, let's do what is necessary, let's make the \nchanges, let's get on with it.\n  I caution and beg my colleagues to think twice about that. America \nhas faced periods of fear in its past, some not from foreign threats \nbut from domestic situations.\n  One of the most noteworthy in our history was the Great Depression \nwhich faced our country when then-President Franklin Roosevelt, in his \nInaugural Address, said:\n\n       This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will \n     revive and will prosper. So, first of all, let me assert my \n     firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear \n     itself. Nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which \n     paralyzes needed efforts to convert, retreat, and advance. In \n     every dark hour of our national life, a leadership of \n     frankness and vigor is met with that understanding\n\n[[Page S10268]]\n\n     and support of the people themselves, which is essential to \n     victory.\n\n  I have listened to speeches on this floor, speeches which have, \nfrankly, touched the anxiety, concerns, and fear of America. I have \nheard people on this floor lionize Saddam's weapons of mass destruction \nas a threat. The President's own resolution said Saddam Hussein may \nlaunch a surprise attack against the United States, language which is \nalmost, frankly, impossible to understand in the world in which we \nlive.\n  I heard those same voices minimize the impact of weapons of mass \ndestruction on the battlefields of Iraq if we launch a land invasion to \ntry to force regime change.\n\n  As we know--it has been declassified this week--our intelligence \ncommunity tells us the most likely scenario of weapons of mass \ndestruction to be used against Americans is if we launch an invasion of \nIraq. Saddam Hussein knows today if those weapons move or are used in \nany way against us and our allies, he will pay a terrible price.\n  Our foreign policy must not be driven by fear. We must be vigilant. \nWe must be careful. But at this moment of national concern over our \nvulnerability of terrorism, we cannot lose sight of the course which \nguided our Nation for generations. As we search every corner of our \nNation and every corner of the world for danger and threats, we can \nnever lose our sight on true north, and that rock-solid reliable point \nis a commitment to a rule of law, a commitment to a foreign policy \nbased on established values and established standards of international \nconduct.\n  We cannot now ignore the challenge of Saddam Hussein. We need to \naddress it. We should push forward with inspections through the United \nNations, and build a coalition of support to make sure he is kept under \ncontrol. The Presidential resolution, which envisions the United States \nstanding alone, is not the best course. The Presidential resolution, \nwhich calls for a dramatic departure in our foreign policy, is not the \nbest course.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Illinois has 15 \nminutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my understanding is the Senator from \nVirginia and the Senator from Arizona have 15 minutes, equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. At this time, the Senator from Arizona wishes to allocate \nhis time to Senator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will speak for about 7 minutes. If any \nother Senator wishes to speak, they may certainly do so.\n  Mr. President, I want to address directly the Senator's amendment. He \ntalked about everything but his amendment. His amendment is remarkable \nbecause instead of allowing the President to deal with the continuing \nthreat posed by Iraq, this amendment would require the President to \nidentify an imminent threat; that is to say, one that is immediate, \npressing, upon us, imminent. I suggest, as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee for almost 8 years, that it is virtually impossible for us to \nknow when a threat is imminent, a threat posed by a regime such as \nSaddam Hussein's, or a group of terrorists.\n  These people do not announce their threats in advance. They conceal \ntheir intentions, as well as their capabilities, and it is very \ndifficult for us to know the precise moment at which the threat is \nimminent.\n  So this amendment is remarkable because it would literally force the \nPresident to wait until the last minute in order to take the action \nthat is permitted by the amendment.\n  There is a saying in the intelligence community that we do not know \nwhat we do not know. We find out later what we did not know.\n  We did not know that Saddam Hussein, for example, had gone to the \nextent he had in the development of biological and chemical weapons \nuntil defectors came out of Iraq and told us what he had done. We did \nnot find out about that through other intelligence. Then we sent \ninspectors, and before Saddam Hussein got it all hidden, they were able \nto find some of it, at which point he said: Oh, gosh I forgot about \nthat--or words to that effect.\n  We did not realize the extent to which he had developed his nuclear \ncapability until after the gulf war was over, when we learned that he \nwas years closer to having a nuclear weapon than we had thought.\n  If Saddam Hussein had waited to attack Kuwait, had not attacked \nKuwait, and gone ahead with his plans, he would have had a nuclear \ncapability before the United States knew about it. By then, it would \nhave been too late.\n  My point is this: We may have pretty good intelligence, but it is not \ngood enough to calibrate as closely as the Senator's amendment would \nrequire, to wait until the moment when the President says now it is \nimminent. And that is the problem. Action has to be taken when the \nthreat is clear, when it is known to be there, but we do not really \nknow exactly when he is going to make his move.\n  As September 11 showed, if it showed us anything, our intelligence is \nnot good enough to do that. We can know there is a threat. We can know \nit is growing, we can know it is continuing, but we cannot know that \nmoment when it becomes imminent.\n  This amendment asks an impossibility of the President: To prove that \nthe threat is imminent or at least to wait until it is clear to him \nthat the threat is imminent. But we may never know until it is too late \nthat Saddam Hussein has a nuclear weapon.\n  The Senator also complained about this new doctrine of preemption, \nbut I would suggest that with respect to Iraq, we are not talking about \npreemption, we are talking about unfinished business called the gulf \nwar.\n  Every day the United States and the United Kingdom fly airplanes, \npursuant to United Nations resolutions, to enforce those resolutions--\nfrankly, to engage in aerial inspection called reconnaissance--and they \nget shot at almost every day. When they get shot at, they either try to \ntake out the radar site or SAM missile site that is firing at them \nafter they have been shot at, or what they try to do is knock it out \nbefore they get shot at. Now, somebody may call that preemption. I call \nit self-defense and common sense.\n\n  This is not some new doctrine we are about to engage in that is going \nto threaten world peace. This is the unfinished business of the gulf \nwar that is authorized by United Nations resolutions that we engage in \nevery day and that requires us to act in our own self-defense.\n  It is also said that for the last 11 years, Saddam Hussein has not \nused his weapons of mass destruction. So why deal with this now? Why \nnot wait until the threat is imminent? Is that it? We are supposed to \nput our trust in Saddam Hussein? I am unwilling to place the security \nof the United States of America in the hands of the likes of Saddam \nHussein. I do not believe we can trust him.\n  Because our intelligence is not good enough to calibrate this threat \nto the action that would be authorized by the amendment, and because we \ncannot trust Saddam Hussein, I support the resolution that is before us \nand oppose the amendment of the Senator from Illinois.\n  Finally, suggesting, as some have, although I did not hear these \nwords from the Senator, that there has to be a smoking gun--that is the \nconcept behind this notion of imminence--before we can take action, is \nextraordinarily misguided. Remember, a gun smokes after it has been \nfired.\n  When I think of a smoking gun, I think of the Pentagon and the World \nTrade Center. I believe that the amendment of the Senator from Illinois \nis dangerous, misguided, and I hope my colleagues will join me in \ndefeating it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Texas?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Warner, unless Senator \nLieberman wishes any time, I yield the remainder of the time to Senator \nGramm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this has been a great debate. I want to \ncongratulate Senator Warner and Senator Lieberman, and I want to thank \nmy\n\n[[Page S10269]]\n\ndear friend John McCain for his leadership on this issue.\n  Even error has been presented on the floor of the Senate in a way \nthat one could be proud of. I think these kinds of debates build the \nstature of the Senate, and when the American people listen to this \ndebate they will realize that on this issue there is a lot of serious \nthinking, a lot of good thought, and I believe in the end we are going \nto make the right decision.\n  I have waited to speak--did the Senator want me to yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. I had to speak to the Republican leader. I had 7 \nminutes. I wish to allocate several of those minutes to our colleague \nfrom Connecticut.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. I regret to say to my good friend from Texas----\n  Mr. GRAMM. How about 4\\1/2\\ minutes?\n  Mr. WARNER. Why doesn't the Senator take an additional 2 minutes so \nwe can complete the debate on this amendment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will wait until this amendment is \ncompleted and then I will speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my friend from Texas for his cooperation. I now \nyield the remaining time, with the exception of 1 minute for the \nSenator from Virginia, to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask that the Chair notify me when a \nminute remains so I may terminate my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose, respectfully, the \namendment introduced by the Senator from Illinois.\n  The underlying resolution, building on 11 years in which the world \ncommunity has tried every way imaginable, except war, to get Saddam \nHussein to keep the promises he made at the end the gulf war to disarm, \nis a strong resolution. This amendment would diminish it, and in that \nsense it would also diminish its effectiveness to convince the United \nNations to act so we do not have to form our own international \ncoalition.\n  In two regards, it also diminishes the authority of the Commander in \nChief, as granted by our resolution, and does so in a way that is far \nmore restrictive than most any authorizing resolution for war or \nmilitary action that I have seen before.\n  First, it introduces the word ``imminent'' in place of the words \n``continuing threat.'' We say in our resolution that the President may \nuse the Armed Forces of the United States in order to defend the \nnational security of our country against the continuing threat posed by \nIraq. The Durbin amendment would change that to the imminent threat \nposed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.\n  In changing it to ``imminent,'' which is a temporal term--it suggests \ntime, that something is about to happen soon--it adds a qualification \nthat I think is unwarranted. In the totality of Saddam Hussein's evil \nadministration, weapons of mass destruction, ballistic missiles, \nunmanned aerial vehicles, there is a threat that is real to us, and I \nam convinced will be used against the American people unless we act, \nhopefully through the United Nations, to disarm him.\n  So while it might not be imminent in the sense that he is about to \nuse it against us, in my opinion it is a ticking time bomb. We do not \nknow exactly how many seconds or minutes or hours are left on that \ntimer. I don't want the President to be limited to an imminent threat \nto use the power we are giving him here.\n\n  Second, it limits that authority for the President to act only in \nregard to an imminent threat of weapons of mass destruction.\n  The resolution we have introduced provides two conditions under which \nthe President may use the Armed Forces to defend the national security \nof the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq and to \nenforce all relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq. \nThis harkens back to a colloquy I had with Senator Specter of \nPennsylvania yesterday.\n  It seems to me these two parts have to be read in totality as \nmodifying each other. The resolutions that are relevant in the U.N. \nSecurity Council are to be enforced particularly in relationship to the \nextent to which they threaten the national security of the United \nStates. In doing this, we are expressing our understanding that the \nPresident is unlikely to go to war to enforce a resolution of the \nUnited Nations that does not significantly affect the national security \nof the United States.\n  We want to do what the Constitution invites us to do. Congress is \ngiven the authority under article I to declare war. The President under \narticle II is the Commander in Chief. There is a healthy tension there. \nIt is up to Congress to authorize and to the President to act as \nCommander in Chief with the latitude that authority gives him but also \nwith the accountability and responsibility that authority gives him.\n  I have spent time looking at authorizing resolutions for war or \nmilitary action from the past. The one that we put together--although \nsome of our colleagues have described it, I think, erroneously as a \nblank check--is quite limited compared to the declaration of war \nauthorizing and directing the President to employ the entire naval and \nmilitary forces of the United States and the resources of the \nGovernment to carry on war--this was in the case of World War I--and to \nbring the conflict to a successful termination, all the resources of \nthe country are hereby pledged by the Congress of the United States.\n  We have only one Commander in Chief; 535 Members of Congress cannot \neffectively conduct a war. We set the parameters, as this resolution \ndoes. We authorize. But it is the President ultimately who carries out \nand serves as our Commander in Chief. That is what our resolution does. \nThat purpose would be significantly altered and, I say respectfully, \nweakened by the language of the Senator from Illinois, which is why I \nrespectfully oppose his amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. My understanding is that the Senator from Delaware has 10 \nminutes. He is not here. I will ask unanimous consent I take 7 of his \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to retain 2 of those minutes for \nmyself and give 4 minutes to our colleague from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank my dear colleague and floor leader. \nI will make a couple of comments.\n  I have listened to these arguments, and I would say they have been \nmade very effectively and with great eloquence. But as I hear them, \nthey boil down to two simple arguments. The first argument is that if \nwe are going to use military power against Saddam Hussein, we ought to \ndo it within the context of the United Nations and it ought to be part \nof a multinational effort. I reject that.\n  I reject it because when we are talking about the security of our \nNation, I am not willing to delegate the responsibility of protecting \nit to the U.N. When it comes to the lives and safety of our people, I \nam not willing to leave that up to the U.N. I am not even willing to \nleave it up to our allies. It is the responsibility of the U.S. \nGovernment. That is why we need this resolution.\n  The plain truth is, if nobody else in the world is willing or able to \ndo this job, we are able and we are willing. That is what this \nresolution says. And by being able and being willing, I believe there \nwill be others who will help us.\n  The second argument can be explained through an analogy. Let's say \nthere is a rattlesnake nesting in your rock garden. Our colleagues are \nsaying, look, if you go in there and try to find that rattlesnake and \ntry to kill him, he is liable to bite you. The probability of being \nbitten is lower if you leave him alone.\n\n[[Page S10270]]\n\n  For a short period of time, they are right. There is no doubt about \nthe fact if you put on your snake boots and you get rat shot and your \npistol and go out there with a stick and start poking around trying to \nfind him, the probability during that period of time that you are going \nto get bitten does go up. But most rational people get their pistol and \nget that stick and go out there because that rattlesnake will be out \nthere for a long time. Your dog might go through there and get bitten. \nYour grandchild might be playing out there. The good thing about going \nin to find a rattlesnake is you know he is there and you are alert to \nthe threat.\n  My view is we do have the rattlesnake in the rock garden. We have the \nability to go in and get him out. And because of the threat that it \nposes to us, I don't think we ought to wait around to do what we know \nwe need to do. In looking at the future, I say the threat is greater if \nwe do not act than if we do.\n  Those are the two arguments I hear. They are in fancier garb and they \nare better put. But it really boils down to, let's turn over our \nsecurity to the U.N. or to our allies. I am not willing to do that. \nLet's avoid the risk of this conflict because it will be dangerous \nwhile the conflict is going on. It will be a lot safer once the \nconflict is over.\n  That is where we are. I think we are doing the right thing. I think \nwe are going to have an overwhelming vote. We have had great bipartisan \nsuccess on this force resolution because Saddam Hussein has no \norganized political support in America. I wish we did not face \norganized political support for opposition to homeland security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to our distinguished colleague from \nTexas, I listened intently to his remarks. Two things occurred to me. \nFirst, how much we value the Senator's contribution these many years we \nhave served together. We shall miss him. Also, the Senator cut right to \nthe heart of the argument, leaving no doubt where he stands.\n  Mr. President, I am happy to yield the floor. I think I have 3 \nminutes left under my control.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding the Senator from Delaware still \nhas time remaining under the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 3 minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from Illinois has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for his courtesy. When we disagree, \nhe is always courteous in his treatment and fair on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  I might say to my friend from Connecticut, it is rare we disagree. I \nam sorry this is one of those cases. But I would pose a question, if he \nwants to answer it--without yielding the floor.\n  Do you believe that the threat of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq \nis an imminent threat to the United States today?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend. I agree it is rare we disagree, so \nI do so with respect.\n  That is my point. I believe the threat is real. The weapons of mass \ndestruction threat is real. Whether it is imminent or not, I do not \nknow.\n  As I said, the analogy that comes to mind is of a bomb on a timer. I \ndon't know whether the timer is set to go off in a day or a year. But \nbecause the danger is so real, I don't want to establish the standard \nof imminence before the United Nations or the President of the United \nStates can act to eliminate the danger.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Connecticut, and I think it is \nan honest answer. But let me tell you, I serve on the Intelligence \nCommittee and I would not disclose anything I learned there because it \nis classified and top secret, but some things I can say because they \nare public knowledge.\n  If you want to talk about threats to the United States, let me \nquickly add to that list North Korea. Currently, North Korea has \nnuclear weapons. North Korea has missiles that can deliver that nuclear \nweapon to many countries that we consider our friends and allies in \ntheir region.\n  Iran may not have a nuclear weapon today but could be further along \nthan Iraq is at this moment. There is scant if little evidence that \nIraq has a nuclear weapon.\n  We do not trust Syria because it is a harbor for some 12 or 15 \ndifferent terrorist organizations in Damascus, and we certainly do not \ntrust Libya because of our fear of weapons of mass destruction.\n  So now of all the countries I have listed, Iraq is one of them for \nsure. But I have given you five or six countries which, under this \nresolution's logic and under this President's new foreign policy, we \nshould be considering invading. Which one and when?\n  Historically, we have said it is not enough to say you have a weapon \nthat can hurt us. Think of 50 years of cold war when the Soviet Union \nhad weapons poised and pointed at us. It is not enough that you just \nhave weapons. We will watch to see if you make any effort toward \nhurting anyone in the United States, any of our citizens or our \nterritory.\n  It was a bright-line difference in our foreign policy which we drew \nand an important difference in our foreign policy. It distinguished us \nfrom aggressor nations. It said that we are a defensive nation. We do \nnot strike out at you simply because you have a weapon if you are not \nmenacing or threatening to us. Has September 11, 2001, changed that so \ndramatically?\n  The words ``imminent threat'' have been used throughout the history \nof the United States. One of the first people to articulate that was a \nman who served on the floor of this Chamber, Daniel Webster, who talked \nabout anticipatory self-defense, recognized way back in time, in the \n19th century. What we are saying today is those rules don't work \nanymore; we are going to change them.\n  I might also add, even though the Senator from Connecticut didn't \naddress it directly, as to whether Iraq is an imminent threat, the \nminority leader, Republican minority leader, Senator Lott, today on the \nfloor came forward and said, and I quote:\n\n       He [meaning the President] is prepared to try to find a \n     peaceful solution here. But unless we make it clear he is \n     committed, we are committed, the U.N. is committed, this \n     problem will not go way. It is serious and it is imminent.\n\n  The words of Senator Lott on the floor today, recognizing the point I \nam trying to make here. If the President believes it is an imminent \nthreat from weapons of mass destruction, he should have the authority \nto go forward.\n  But this is not just a matter of striking a strong position and \nshowing that we have resolve. It is a matter of the people of the \nUnited States, through the Senate and the House, giving authority to \nthe President of the United States to commit the lives of our men and \nwomen in the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  I, for one, have thought long and hard about voting for war. As I \nsaid on September 14, 2001, I did. I would do it again on the war on \nterrorism. I believe every Senator--every Senator--Republican and \nDemocrat alike, takes this responsibility particularly seriously.\n  I had a personal experience in my district as a Congressman in the \nPersian Gulf war. One of my friends had a son who was in the Marines. \nShe called me and said: He has just been sent over there, and I am \nworried to death about him.\n  I said: Let's wait and see how this goes.\n  We engaged in a debate on the floor of the House and Senate, and we \ngave President Bush's father, the President, authority to go forward. \nIf you remember, we built up our troops and forces for 6 months, the \nday came, and the war began, and we were prepared, and we were \ndecisive; in a matter of 48 hours the war ended and I breathed a sigh \nof relief. It was over quickly, and there were just a handful--I think \nabout 200 American--of casualties out of the thousands and thousands of \ntroops who were in harm's way.\n  No sooner had I had this feeling of relief than I got a call. One of \nthe 200 killed in that 48-hour period was Christian Porter, a lance \ncorporal in the U.S. Marine Corps, killed by friendly fire--the son of \nmy close friend. I went to that funeral, faced his mother and his \nfather. There was little I could say. I went to the veterans cemetery, \nthe National Cemetery, afterwards, as I am sure all of the Members of \nthe Senate would do to pay their respects to his family and respect to \nthis man who served his country.\n  The image of that funeral at that service in that day is still in my \nmind\n\n[[Page S10271]]\n\ntoday as I think about the decision we are making, about whether or not \nwe are just striking a position to show our resolve or whether we are \nin fact, as this resolution says, giving to this President the \nauthority to call into combat men and women who will put their lives on \nthe line for the decision we make today.\n  Is it unfair for us to say, on this side of the debate, that we \nshould exhaust every reasonable and realistic option before we engage \nin war? That we should work through the United Nations if we can find \nan inspection regime that is honest, to try to lessen the threat on the \nUnited States at any time in the future? That we should gather a \ncoalition of forces?\n  I couldn't disagree more with my colleague from Texas. Yes, it is a \nthreat to the United States. All of the countries I listed are threats. \nBut why should we bear this burden alone? Should this burden not be \nshared by our allies and those who agree with us that we need a \npeaceful and civilized world? Shouldn't their troops be in the field \nwith American troops fighting side by side for this cause? Only \nAmerican soldiers? Only American tax dollars? Only America is assuming \nthe responsibility for stability when the war on Iraq is over?\n\n  I don't think it is a fair approach. It is far better for us to have \na coalition working on it. But what triggers it, goes to the heart of \nthis amendment, is that moment in time when this President--and he is \nthe one who has the authority as Commander in Chief--says we now face \nan imminent threat from weapons of mass destruction.\n  What could that be? It could be the identification of fissile \nmaterial that is now going into Iraq which could lead to their \ndevelopment of a nuclear weapon. That, in my mind, shows imminent \nthreat. It could be his using weapons of mass destruction and sharing \nthem with terrorist organizations. That is clearly an imminent threat. \nAll of these things would trigger the United States to step forward and \nsay now we have to defend ourselves. But at this point in time, none of \nthat is here.\n  We are being asked, by voting on this resolution, not to wait for the \nUnited Nations, not to wait for a coalition, but to move forward on a \ncontinuing threat. Member after Member comes to the floor and tells us: \nThe threat against the United States of weapons of mass destruction is \nan imminent threat. We have to take it seriously. We have to vote on \nthis before the election. That is what the White House says: We have to \ndo it now, we have to do it before we leave town.\n  Yet when you ask them to put the words ``imminent threat'' in the \nresolution, watch them scatter and run when the vote comes to the desk \nhere. There will be a handful of us voting for that, a handful of us \nwho believe the foreign policy which has guided the United States for \nso many generations, so successfully, which has brought us peace and \nstability, should be honored and respected even on this resolution of \ngreat historic moment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time. I don't know \nif there are others who wish to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are making excellent progress on this \nbill. Did the leader wish to speak?\n  Mr. REID. Not quite yet. We need a few more minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am sorry. I did not hear the leader.\n  Mr. President, we have some matters moving along very well. I thank \nmy colleague from Illinois for his remarks. I shall proceed to use my 3 \nminutes, and the 3 minutes from the Senator from Delaware, which as I \nunderstand it is still there, without objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have listened carefully to our colleague. His amendment \nis very simple on its face. But behind the simplicity lies a great deal \nof history.\n  This Nation of ours has been protected by the two oceans, and by \nwonderful neighbors to the north and to the south. We have had a sense \nof security. But with the advent of high technology, and with the \nadvent of worldwide syndicates of terrorists, America will never be the \nsame again.\n  That is a tough thing for me to tell my children and my grandchildren \nbecause I have labored in my life--as everyone in this Chamber has--to \nprovide not only for my family, friends and neighbors such that they \ncan enjoy the life we have enjoyed these many years. However, high \ntechnology, while it benefits mankind in so many ways, has brought \nabout dramatic change.\n  If you wish to have the standard of imminent threat placed in the \nbill that Senator Lieberman, Senator McCain, Senator Bayh and I have \ncrafted, I say to you most respectfully, with the advent of this \nextraordinary evolution of technology, the time involved in warning \nthat is implicit in imminent threat left us with the end of the 20th \ncentury. The 21st century high technology has erased that. Imminent \ndanger struck us on September 11th. We didn't know it was coming. The \ndoctrine of imminent danger, as I say, has changed in this 21st \ncentury. It no longer gives us the warning that we must have.\n  I urge my colleagues to let this resolution remain unchanged by this \namendment as they have with the other amendments that have been brought \nbefore us.\n  I expect Senator Reid in the Chamber momentarily. I know he has a \nconcluding matter by way of a unanimous consent request.\n  Before I, ask for regular order, I want to make certain that----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Virginia \nthat all time has not expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. What is the Chair saying, may I ask?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Virginia \nthat all time has not expired. Forty-five seconds remain to the Senator \nfrom Virginia, and 6 minutes remain to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for his \ncourtesy. I am not going to use all 6 minutes. The Senator is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has the Senator from Virginia yielded?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The Senator is correct. The tools of war, the incidence of war, the \ntiming of war has changed. But it has changed throughout our history. \nThe principles, the rules of value, the norms and conduct which we \napply today were applied starting in a much different era, and applied \nagain and again as we saw ourselves move into an era of airplanes, into \nan era of intercontinental missiles. The same standards, principles, \nnorms, conduct, and value remain.\n  I do not believe the war on terrorism is easy. But I also believe the \nUnited States has established an international reputation behind the \nrule of law--a reputation which I am afraid is going to be changed \ndramatically by this resolution. No longer will we wait for that \nimminent threat if this amendment is defeated. It is enough for us to \nassert that a country is a threat to the United States and begin a land \ninvasion. And that, to me, is a dramatic change from where the United \nStates has always been throughout its history.\n  I hope we will think twice about that. I have no illusions about the \nresult of this vote. But to think we are going to make this wholesale \nchange in foreign policy without the deliberations and hearings and \nwithout a direct debate, to me, is just wrong.\n  I think the Foreign Affairs Committee and others should have taken \nthe President's new foreign policy suggestions directly and seriously \nand gone forward with them. Instead, through Saddam Hussein and the \ndebate on Iraq, we are about to make a historic change in foreign \npolicy which I hope we do not do.\n  In the interest of moving this to a vote, I not only yield the floor, \nbut I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might conclude, time doesn't permit\n\n[[Page S10272]]\n\nme to get into the doctrine of anticipatory self-defense, but I think \nat another opportunity we will have that debate, perhaps before we \nconclude this matter.\n  I think we are about to proceed as soon as the distinguished majority \nwhip addresses the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I haven't had a chance to speak to my friend \nfrom Virginia, but the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee--if \nwe could just get a unanimous consent request agreed to, which I am \nhopeful and confident we will--the Senator from Delaware wants to be \nrecognized to speak.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, yes. I received this information. But I \nwould be happy to allow our distinguished chairman time.\n  Mr. REID. We know others want to speak, but he is chairman of the \ncommittee, and he has been very quiet, which is unusual.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wouldn't suggest that he has been quiet, but I \ncertainly want to recognize him and give him such time----\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, let the Record \nshow I have spoken about one-tenth the amount of time my friend from \nVirginia has, but not nearly with the persuasiveness he has. I want the \nopportunity to speak before the final vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon \ndisposition of the Durbin amendment, Senator Byrd be recognized to \nspeak for up to 2 hours; that upon the disposition of the Lieberman \namendment, the joint resolution be read a third time; the cloture vote \non the joint resolution be vitiated; the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of the House companion, H.J. Res. 114; the joint \nresolution be read a third time, and the Senate vote on final passage \nof that joint resolution; that the preamble be agreed to and that no \namendments to the title be in order; and that S.J. Res. 45 be \nindefinitely postponed, with the preceding all occurring without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I had not \nintended to, but I just received a request from Senator McCain that he \nbe allowed to follow Senator Byrd's speech for not to exceed 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as chairman \nof this committee, I have yet to make a full speech on this subject. I \nhave withheld for 3 days on the request of everyone else. I understand \nthat.\n  Two things: No. 1, I just want to make sure I get to speak before the \nfinal vote; and, No. 2, that I speak at some point after Senator McCain \nspeaks and very close to Senator Byrd's speech.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator will speak after Senator McCain.\n  I ask unanimous consent that be part of the request.\n  Mr. BIDEN. This is highly unusual. I can't think of another time when \nthe chairman of the Foreign Relations has been denied an opportunity to \nspeak when he wishes to. But I will be happy to yield, because I just \nwant to be a nice fellow. But this is preposterous.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I say to the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware that at the request of the distinguished majority whip, which \nwas agreed to, I will have two hours. This Senator will be glad to \nyield to the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee the first one-\nhalf hour of my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there is no need for that. I just want an \nopportunity to make my speech. It will take about 35 or 40 minutes to \nlay out in the Record why this is an important position which we are \nall about to take.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 4865. The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 30, nays 70, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 236 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--30\n\n     Akaka\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--70\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Carnahan\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 4865) was rejected.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Senator Byrd has indicated to me and a \nnumber of us that he will not use the full 2 hours. In that we are \nwaiting for him, I think it appropriate that the time of the quorum \ncall I will make run against his allotted 2 hours. I ask unanimous \nconsent that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I withdraw my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request is vitiated.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator from Arizona--he is entitled to a half \nhour after Senator Byrd speaks--if he would mind using that time now?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to the Senator from Nevada, not only will I be glad \nto start using the time now, but when Senator Byrd returns to the \nfloor, I will be glad to interrupt my speech for Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I will proceed with my statement. If \nSenator Byrd arrives on the floor, I will interrupt it and yield to \nSenator Byrd.\n  In the history of nations, greatness is forged, or opportunity \nsquandered, not by natural evolution or by the hand of mysterious Fate, \nbut by decisions leaders make in times of potential or imminent peril. \nA common view in America is that these decisions are thrust on us--the \nworld wars, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the attacks of September 11--and \nwe find meaning, and honor, in our response. As Americans, that \nresponse is guided by faith in our founding principles, in our love of \nfreedom, and the blessings of justice.\n  Yet leaders always have choices, and history teaches that hard \nchoices deferred--appeasing Hitler, choosing not to deter Saddam \nHussein in 1990, failing to act sooner against al Qaeda--often bring \nabout the very circumstances we wished to avoid by deferring action, \nrequiring us to react in freedom's defense.\n  America's leaders today have a choice. It will determine whether our \npeople live in fear behind walls that have already been breeched, as \nour enemies plan our defeat in time we have given them to do it. It \nwill answer the fundamental question about America's purpose in the \nworld--whether we perceive our beliefs to be uniquely American \nprinciples or universal values, for if they are so dear to us that we \nbelieve all people have the right to enjoy them, we should be willing \nto stand up for them, wherever they are threatened.\n  It will reveal whether we are brave, and wise or reluctant self-\ndoubting, and in retreat from a world that still, in its cruelest \ncorners, possesses a merciless hostility to our values and interests. \nIt will test us, as did September\n\n[[Page S10273]]\n\n11, except that we can choose to engage the enemy on our terms rather \nthan wait for the battle to be brought to us.\n  Our choice is whether to assume history's burden to make the world \nsafe from a megalomaniacal tyrant whose cruelty and offense to the \nnorms of civilization are infamous, or whether to wait for this man, \narmed with the world's worst weapons and willing and able to use them, \nto make history for us.\n  It is a question of whether preemptive action to defeat an adversary \nwhose designs would imperil our vital interests is not only appropriate \nbut moral--and whether our morality and security give us cause to fire \nthe first shot in this battle. It will help determine whether the \ngreater Middle East will progress toward possession of the values \nAmericans hold to be universal, or whether the Arab and Islamic worlds \nwill be further influenced by a tyrant whose intent is to breed his own \nvirulent anti-Americanism in all who fall under his influence, and use \nthat influence to hurt us gravely.\n  The government of Saddam Hussein is a clear and present danger to the \nUnited States of America. Would that he were just another Arab \ndictator, pumping oil and repressing his people but satisfied with his \npersonal circumstances within the confines of his country's \nborders. That situation alone would offend our sense of justice and \ncompel us to militate for a regime change, but buy means short of \npreemptive military action. But Saddam Hussein has shown he has greater \nambitions.\n\n  His ambitions lie not in Baghdad, or Tikrit, or Basra, but in the \ndeserts of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. They lie in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, \nwhere he sponsors suicide bombings by Palestinians he calls ``martyrs'' \nand the civilized world calls terrorists, using murder by proxy to \nadvance his aspirations to lead the Arab world and fan hatred of \nIsrael, America, and the universal ideal of freedom. These ambitions \nhave led him to attack his sovereign neighbors--Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, \nIsrael, Iran and Bahrain. His will to power has so affected his \njudgment that he has started two major wars and lost them, each time \nimperiling his own grip on power.\n  His moral code is so spare that he has gassed his own people--horror \nthe world thought it had left behind at Auschwitz and Treblinka. We are \ntold that he enjoys watching video of his opponents being tortured, for \nfun. He kills not just his political opponents but their families, \ncruelly.\n  He has developed stocks of germs and toxins in sufficient quantities \nto kill the entire population of the Earth multiple times. He has \nplaced weapons laden with these poisons on alert to fire at his \nneighbors within minutes, not hours, and has devolved authority to fire \nthem to subordinates. He develops nuclear weapons with which he would \nhold his neighbors and us hostage.\n  No, this is not just another self-serving, oil-rich potentate. He is \nthe worst kind of modern-day tryant--a conscienceless murderer who \naspires to omnipotence who has repeatedly committed irrational acts \nsince seizing power. Given this reality, containment and deterrence and \ninternational inspections will work no better than the Maginot Line did \n62 years ago.\n  He has unrepentantly violated sixteen United Nations Security Council \nresolutions, defying the will of the international community so \nconsistently, so compulsively, so completely that no leader who \nprofesses allegiance to the values the United Nations was formed to \nuphold can sanction his audacity. His defiance, if not ended, is a \nthreat to every nation that claims membership in the civilized world by \nvirtue of its respect for law and fundamental human values.\n  Because Saddam Hussein respects neither law nor values, advocating \ninspections of his weapons facilities as an alternative to war posits a \nfalse choice between ending the threat he poses peaceably or by force \nof arms. His character, his ambition, and his record make clear that he \nwill never accept the intrusive inspections that, by depriving him of \nhis arsenal of dangerous weapons, would deprive him of his power. This \npower gives him international stature, feeds his fantasy of being a \nSaladin for our time, and sustains his ability to repress his people \nand thus remain the rule of Iraq.\n  Saddam Hussein is on a crash course to construct a nuclear weapon--as \nhe was in 1981 when Israel preemptively destroyed his reactor at \nOsirak, enabling U.S. forces to go into Iraq a decade later without the \nthreat of nuclear attack, and as he was in 1990, when he thought \ndevelopment of such a weapon, if completed in time, would have deterred \nAmerican military action against him, allowing him to secure his \ncontrol over his neighbors and dominate the region.\n\n  Saddam has masterfully manipulated the international weapons \ninspections regime over the course of a decade, enabling him to remain \nin power with his weapons of mass destruction intact, and growing in \nlethality. He knows how to play for time, and how to exploit divisions \nwithin the international community, greased by the prospect of oil \ncontracts for friendly foreign powers.\n  His calculated ambiguity about his willingness to accept a new \ninspections regime are intended to stave off military attack until such \ntime as he is able to deter it through deployment of an Iraqi nuclear \nweapon. He is using opponents of war in America, including well-\nintentioned individuals who honestly believe inspections represent an \nalternative to war, to advance his own ends, sowing divisions within \nour ranks that encourage reasonable people to believe he may be \nsincere.\n  He is not. He has had ten years to prove otherwise, and he has \ntransparently failed. His regime would be secure if he would only \nacquiesce to the international community's demands to disarm, but he \nhas not. It is Saddam Hussein who puts his own regime at risk by \ndeveloping these weapons. The burden is not on America to justify going \nto war. The burden is Saddam Hussein's, to justify whey his regime \nshould continue to exist as long as its continuing existence threatens \nthe world.\n  Giving peace a chance only gives Saddam Hussein more time to prepare \nfor war--on his terms, at a time of his choosing, in pursuit of \nambitions that will only grow as his power to achieve them grows. \nAmerican credibility, American security, and the future of the United \nNations Security Council rest on the will of the United States to \nenforce the legitimate demands of the international community for \nIraq's disarmament, by means that match the menace posed by his \nambitions.\n  Saddam Hussein's regime cannot be contained, deterred, or \naccommodated. Containment has failed. It failed to halt Saddam's \nattacks on five sovereign nations. The sanctions regime has collapsed. \nAs long as Saddam remains in power, he will be able to deceive, bribe, \nintimidate, and attack his way out of any containment scheme.\n  Some say we can deter Saddam Hussein, even though deterrence has \nfailed utterly in the past. I fail to see how waiting for some \nunspecified period of time, allowing Saddam's nuclear ambitions to grow \nunchecked, will ever result in a stable deterrence regime. Not only \nwould deterrence condemn the Iraqi people to more unspeakable tyranny, \nit would condemn Saddam's neighbors to perpetual instability. And once \nIraq's nuclear ambitions are realized, no serious person could expect \nthe Iraqi threat to diminish.\n  As for accommodation, I am reminded of Winston Churchill's \ncharacterization of appeasement: continually feeding the alligator in \nthe hope that he will eat you last.\n  I do not believe the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime will be \neliminated until he is removed from power. Congress made the same point \nin 1998 when we passed the Iraq Liberation Act, which made regime \nchange in Baghdad a priority of American policy.\n  Our regional allies who oppose using force against Saddam Hussein \nwarn of uncontrollable popular hostility to an American attack on Iraq. \nBut what would really be the effect on Arab populations of seeing other \nArabs liberated from oppression? Most Iraqi soldiers will not willingly \ndie for Saddam Hussein. Far from fighting to the last Iraqi, the people \nof that tortured society will surely dance on the regime's grave.\n  I wish the Bush administration and its predecessor had given more \nserious support to internal and external Iraqi opposition than has been \nthe case. But it's a safe assumption that Iraqis will be grateful to \nwhoever is responsible\n\n[[Page S10274]]\n\nfor securing their freedom. Perhaps that is what truly concerns some of \nour Gulf War allies: that among the consequences of regime change in \nIraq might be a stronger demand for self-determination from their own \npeople.\n  I commend the President for making a strong case for bringing Iraq \ninto compliance with its international obligations to the United \nNations. The Security Council bears the responsibility for enforcing \nthe obligations it has imposed on Iraq in order to uphold international \npeace and security. The President was right to tell our friends and \nallies on the Council that if it does not act, America will.\n  Diplomacy is important, and I welcome the diplomatic campaign the \nadministration is waging to solicit the support of other nations. At \nthe end of the day, we will not wage this war alone. Many nations are \nthreatened by Saddam Hussein's rule, and many nations have a stake in \nthe new order that will be built atop the ruins of Saddam Hussein's \nfascist state. Our friends and allies will help us construct this new \norder, and we should welcome that.\n  Our friends and allies must know that we do not target Saddam's \nregime simply because he is a bad man, although his continuation of his \ntyranny is a rebuke to every decent value of humanity. We contemplate \nmilitary action to end his rule because allowing him to remain in \npower, with the resources at his disposal, would intolerably and \ninevitably risk American interests in a region of the world where \nthreats to those interests affect the whole world.\n  For the United States to accept Saddam's continued rule is to \nacquiesce to the certain prospect of strategic blackmail when, soon, \nSaddam wields a nuclear weapon and threatens the destruction of Israel \nor the invasion of Saudi Arabia, or demands the withdrawal of all \nAmerican forces from the region, and America finds itself forced to \nrespond at much more terrible cost than we would pay today.\n  Failure now to make the choice to remove Saddam Hussein from power \nwill leave us with few choices late, when Saddam's inevitable \nacquisition of nuclear weapons will make it much more dangerous to \ndefend our friends and interests in the region. It will permit Saddam \nto control much of the region, and to wield its resources in ways that \ncan only weaken America's position. It will put Israel's very survival \nat risk, with moral consequences no American can welcome.\n  Failure to end the danger posed by Saddam Hussein's Iraq makes it \nmore likely that the interaction we believe to have occurred between \nmembers of al Qaeda and Saddam's regime may increasingly take the form \nof active cooperation to target the United States.\n  We live in a world in which international terrorists continue to this \nday to plot mass murder in America. Saddam Hussein unquestionably has \nstrong incentives to cooperate with al Qaeda. Whatever they may or may \nnot have in common, their overwhelming hostility to America and \nrejection of any moral code suggest that collaboration against us would \nbe natural. It is all too imaginable. Whether or not it has yet \nhappened, the odds favor it, and they are not odds the United States \ncan accept.\n  To those who argue that America's threat to Saddam's rule makes it \nmore likely that he would collaborate with terrorists to attack our \nhomeland, I would ask: how can we sanction the continuing existence of \na regime whose ruler has the capability to inflict such damage on us \nand would even consider doing so?\n  Standing by while an odious regime with a history of support for \nterrorism develops weapons whose use by terrorists could literally kill \nmillions of Americans is not a choice. It is an abdication. In this new \nera, preventive action to target rogue regimes is not only imaginable \nbut necessary. Who would not have attacked Osama bin Laden's network \nbefore September 11th had we realized that his intentions to bring harm \nto America were matched by the capability to do so? Who would not have \nheeded Churchill's call to stand up to Adolf Hitler in the 1930s, while \nEurope slept and appeasement fed the greatest threat to Western \ncivilization the world had ever known? Who would not have supported \nIsrael's bombing of Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981 had we then known, \nas Israel knew, that Saddam was on the verge of developing the bomb?\n  Opponents of this resolution offer many questions that are designed \nto persuade the President to wait before moving against Saddam Hussein. \nThey have every right to do so. But there is one question I don't want \nto be asked in the months and years ahead: ``Why did you give Saddam \nHussein time to harm us?''\n  Weighing the costs of inaction is an important as chronicling the \ncosts of action in blood and treasure as we prepare to confront Iraq in \n2002. In an age of weapons of mass destruction and global terrorists \nbent on acquiring those weapons, the costs of inaction could well be \ncatastrophic.\n  As we hold this debate today, this future is not preordained. We have \nchoices. I hope we make the right one.\n  Politics has no place in this debate. Voting for a course of action \nthat will send young Americans off to fight and die for their country \nis the most solemn responsibility every member of this Congress will \nundertake. Those of us who have the honor of bearing that \nresponsibility must weigh our words, and consult our consciences \ncarefully. By voting to give the President the authority to wage war, \nwe assume and share his responsibility for the war's outcome. Others \nhave neither that burden nor that privilege.\n  We have a choice. The men and women who wear the uniform of our \ncountry, and who might lose their lives in service to our cause, do \nnot. They will do their duty, as we see fit to define it for them.\n  We have a responsibility to these men and women to judge responsibly \nwhen our security is so threatened that we must call on them to uphold \ntheir oath to defend it. When we call them to serve, they will make us \nproud. We should strive to make them proud by showing deliberation, \njudgment, and statesmanship in the debate that will determine their \nmission.\n  There is no such thing as a Democrat or a Republican war. We vote on \nthis resolution in the same way brave young men and women in uniform \nwill fight and die as a result of our vote-as Americans. The freedom \nand security Americans will continue to enjoy as history's greatest \nnation will be their legacy, and their honor.\n  They will do their duty. Ours lies before us. Its outcome will \ndetermine America's course in this century, in an age when waiting for \nimminence of attack is catastrophic.\n  In this age, liberating oppressed peoples from the tyranny of those \nwho would do us harm serves not only narrow American interests but the \nordered progress of freedom. The global success of liberty is America's \ngreatest strategic interest as well as its most compelling moral \nargument. All our other interests are served in that cause. In it rests \nour faith in the greatness of America, the last, best hope of earth.\n  What ensures our success in this long struggle against terrorism and \nrogue leaders who conspire against us is that our military strength is \nsurpassed only by the strength of our ideals. Our enemies are weaker \nthan we are in men and arms, but weaker still in causes. they fight to \nexpress an irrational hatred for all that is good in humanity, a hatred \nthat has fallen time and again to the armies and ideals of the \nrighteous. We fight for love of freedom and justice, a love that is \ninvincible. We will never surrender. They will. All we must do is stay \ntrue to our faith.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator from West Virginia begins his remarks, I \nwish to say something publicly that I should have said privately. That \nis, I know a little bit about the rules of the Senate, but very little \ncompared to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I am not sure everyone appreciates how far along we are. This is a \nvery important resolution we are debating no matter on what side of the \nresolution you are. The Senator from West Virginia has expressed his \nthoughts now for almost a week off and on. We would not be in the \nposition we are today to finish this sometime tonight but for the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  In my younger days when I would be involved in things physical, there \nis not anyone I would like to have next to\n\n[[Page S10275]]\n\nme than the Senator from West Virginia. He is a fighter. I have never \ncome across many fighters like the President pro tempore of the Senate. \nI express my personal appreciation and that of all the Senators for the \nSenator allowing us to be in the position we are today to finish this \nresolution tonight.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has forgotten more about the Senate \nrules than I will ever know. I am searching for words to express my \nadmiration and respect for the Senator from West Virginia. He is a \nfighter, but he is a fair fighter and is always willing to see the \nother side of the picture, even though we may not agree.\n  Senator Byrd, you have made my life and that of the Senate, while \ninteresting today, a lot easier than it could have been. The Senator \naccomplished this. No one in the world could have expressed themselves \nwith the sincerity of feelings and love of country and Constitution as \nhas the Senator. I say again, thank you for allowing us to be in this \nsituation we are in today.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I add to the comments of the Senator from Nevada. I \nfind from my days trying to enact a line-item veto, the days when the \nSenator from West Virginia was the majority leader, that he has always \ntreated me with the utmost courtesy and consideration. In all of my \nencounters, I have found him to be incredibly enlightening, very \neducational, and occasionally frustrating. I would like to thank \nSenator Byrd for setting the tone and the tenor of this debate at a \nlevel that I think was important to maintain and one that I think all \nMembers of the Senate, no matter which side they are on on this issue, \ncan be proud of as we will look back at this debate and this very \nimportant resolution that is being considered.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I look forward to hearing him \nfor the next couple of hours.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  How much time do I have remaining on my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Eight minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to reserve the remainder of my \ntime for Senator Bayh, who is one of the original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to begin. I read this quote:\n\n       Naturally, the common people don't want war but, after all, \n     it is the leaders of a country who determine the policy and \n     it is always a simple matter to drag the people along. \n     Whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a \n     parliament or a Communist dictatorship, voice or no voice, \n     the people can always be brought to the bidding of the \n     leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they \n     are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for a lack of \n     patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the \n     same in every country.\n\n  Hermann Goering, 1893-1946, field marshal, German Army, founder of \nthe Gestapo, President of the Reichstag, Nazi parliament, and convicted \nwar criminal. Speech, 1934.\n  Mr. President:\n\n     The moving Finger writes; and, having writ,\n     Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit\n     Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,\n     Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.\n\n  So said the Persian poet, Omar Khayyam, in the 11th century.\n  And so I say today. The Senate has made clear its intentions on the \nIraq resolution. There is no doubt, there is no question. The Senate \nhas made its intentions indubitably clear. The outcome is certain. The \nending has been scripted. The Senate will vote, and the Iraq resolution \nwill pass.\n  I continue to believe that the Senate, in following this preordained \ncourse of action, will be doing a grave disservice to the Nation and to \nthe Constitution on which it was founded.\n  In the newly published ``National Security Strategy of the United \nStates,'' the document which I hold in my hand--``The National Security \nStrategy of the United States of America,'' date: September 2002, the \ndocument in which the President of the United States outlines the \nunprecedented policy of preemptive deterrence which the Iraq resolution \nwill implement--the President asserts that: ``The constitution has \nserved us well.''\n  There you have it, 31 pages, and that is the only reference to the \nConstitution of the United States that is made in this document titled \n``The National Security Strategy of the United States of America.'' He \nasserts that: ``The constitution has served us well.'' That's it. That \nis the alpha and the omega of the reference to the Constitution, this \ngreat Constitution of the United States which creates the Presidency of \nthe United States, which creates a bicameral legislative body, which \ncreates the judicial branch of this great Nation--provides for it. That \nis all it says about the Constitution. He asserts that ``the \nConstitution has served us well.''\n  And note, too, that the word ``constitution'' as mentioned in the \nPresident's document is in lower case. It doesn't begin with a capital \nletter, it begins with a lower-case letter, ``the constitution.''\n  I have a constitution. The Senator from New Mexico has a \nconstitution. His constitution, which was given to him by his Roman \nancestral forebears, that is his constitution. He is strong, he is \nweak, he has strong mental processes, he has a good heart, or whatever \nit is--his constitution, lower case. But this Constitution is with a \ncapital C. This administration doesn't believe that it merits a capital \nC even, and only mentions, as I say, one time in passing that ``the \nConstitution has served us well.''\n  That, apparently, is what this administration thinks of the \nConstitution. And it references the Constitution as though it were some \ndusty relic of the past that needs to be eulogized before it is \nretired. And so it says: ``The constitution has served us well.''\n  He is wrong about that. The Constitution is no more dated than the \nprinciples that it established than is this great book that I treasure \nabove all books, this great book right here.\n  The President is wrong. The Constitution is no more dated in the \nprinciples it established than is the Holy Bible.\n  The Constitution continues to serve us well, if only we would take \nthe time to heed it.\n  I am deeply disappointed that this Senate, which I have believed in \nfor all these many years--and which God and the people of West Virginia \nhave blessed me to experience, 44 years come next January 3rd--I am \ndeeply disappointed the Senate is not heeding the imperatives of the \nConstitution and is instead poised to hand off to the President of the \nUnited States the exclusive power of Congress to determine matters of \nwar and peace--to declare war.\n  I do not in my heart believe this is what the American people expect \nof the Senate.\n  I have had many occasions in which to stand and laud the Senate, and \nto renew my expression of deep belief in the Senate of the United \nStates as an institution. I have done that many times. But I am deeply \ndisappointed the Senate is not heeding the imperatives of the \nConstitution, and is instead poised, as I say, to hand over to the \nPresident the exclusive power of Congress to determine matters of war \nand peace.\n  I do not in my heart believe this is what the American people expect \nof the Senate.\n  I have heard from tens of thousands of people--people from all across \nthis country of ours--people from every State in the Union, from New \nMexico to Florida to California to the State of Washington, and to the \nStates of Wisconsin, Minnesota, West Virginia, New York, and all in \nbetween. I have heard from thousands of Americans who have urged me to \nkeep up the fight--almost 50,000 e-mail letters within the last 5 days, \nand more than 18,000 telephone calls to my office in the last 5 days--\nurging me to keep up the fight. So they are listening, and they want to \nhear more.\n  If Senators don't think for a moment that people are listening to \nthis Senate debate, the people are listening. They want to be informed. \nThey have questions they want answered.\n  When I came to this body, we didn't have televised coverage. We \ndidn't have a radio. We didn't even have radio coverage of the debates \nin this Senate. I can remember that when a Senator stood to his feet, \nother Senators gathered closely. They moved up close in their seats to \nlisten to that Senator. We had no public address system in\n\n[[Page S10276]]\n\nthis Chamber. But they were being informed by the Senate debates. The \npeople were being educated and informed as to the great issues of the \nday. The Senate was an institution which did inform the people. We \nspent days upon days on the great issues that came before this Senate--\nmore than 100 days, for example, on the Civil Rights Act of 1964, more \nthan 100 days. This institution did its duty to the American people by \ninforming them of the issues of the day, and by debating those issues--\nRepublicans and Democrats. The aisle was not as wide in those days as \nit is now. Sometimes I think it is a great canyon here, a great chasm \nthat separates the Democratic and the Republican parties in this \nSenate. But not so then. We disagreed from time to time.\n  But I can remember. If I were to take the time now, I could call the \nnames of the faces who in my dreams come back to me--the faces of those \nwho sat in those seats years ago, decades ago. They were men. There was \nonly one woman at that time, Margaret Chase Smith of Maine. But \nSenators, Republicans and Democrats, joined in informing the people \nthrough the process of debate.\n\n  I am only one Senator from a very small State. Yet, as I say, within \nthe past week, I have received nearly 20,000 telephone calls and nearly \n50,000 e-mails supporting the position I have taken on this floor. This \nis not counting the calls and the e-mails that have come in to my State \noffice in Charleston, WVA.\n  I want all of those people across America, out there across the \nplains, the Great Rockies, across the Mississippi, and to the Pacific \ncoast, from the gulf coast to the Canadian border--I want all those \npeople who took the time to contact me to know how their words have \nstrengthened, heartened me and sustained me in my feeble efforts here \nto turn the tide of opinion in the Senate.\n  ``The iron will of one stout heart shall make a thousand quail.''\n  These are my heroes--the people out there who have called, who have \nwritten, and who have told me in person as I have walked across the \nstreet. They are my heroes. And I will never forget the remarkable \ncourage and patriotism that reverberated in the fervor--in the fervor--\nof their messages. I gave them hope because they love this country. And \nthey love this Constitution. Senators all know that. The people out \nthere love this Constitution. They love this Constitution. All of the \npeople out there do.\n  So they are my heroes.\n  As the Apostle Paul, that great apostle, said, ``I have fought a good \nfight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith.''\n  There are Americans all across this country in every State of this \nUnion who have joined in spirit with me and with a small band of like-\nminded Senators in fighting the good fight.\n  We could stay here on this floor and continue to fight. They say, \nwell, we might stay here until 4:30 in the morning. Come on. Come on.\n  I am thinking of the words of Fitzjames in ``The Lady of the Lake,'' \nwhen he stood there before Roderick and said: ``Come one, come all! \nthis rock shall fly From its firm base as soon as I.'' So come on. \nLet's see the clock turn to 4:30 in the morning. Who cares what time it \nis as long as we are speaking for our country?\n  So I say to the distinguished Senator who presides over this Chamber \ntonight, whose forebear and ancestral relative signed his name at the \nConstitutional Convention on September 17, 1787--his name was Dayton, \nJonathan Dayton. This is his relative who presides over the Senate at \nthis moment.\n  So we could continue this fight. Let me tell you, ladies and \ngentlemen, there are several checkpoints--I will call them \ncheckpoints--at which, under the rules, I could cause the Senate to \nhave to go through another cloture and another 72 hours. I could do \nthat. And I would have no hesitancy, not any, in doing it if I did not \nknow the Senate has already spoken.\n  Also, there is a point at which it becomes time to accept reality and \nto regroup. It is clear we have lost this battle in the Senate. The \nnext front is the White House. I urge all those people who are \nfollowing the debate out there, and who have encouraged me in my \nefforts, and have encouraged the other Senators who have stayed with me \nfirmly--without faltering, without fainting, and without wavering--I \nurge the people to keep on in their behalf, who have encouraged us in \nour efforts, I urge them to turn their attention to the President of \nthe United States. Call him, write him, e-mail him, urge him to heed \nthe Constitution and not short circuit this Constitution by exercising \nthe broad grant of authority the Iraq resolution provides.\n  The President has said on many occasions that he has not yet made up \nhis mind to go to war. And here we are, we have been stampeded into \nthis moment, when we will soon approve this resolution.\n  Let me say again, there are several checkpoints at which we could \nplay this record over and over again. For example, the title of the \nresolution could be amended. How about that? And then there is going to \nbe a House resolution coming over to this body, and there is going to \nbe a request, I suppose, after the Senate votes on that resolution, a \nrequest to insert the words of the Senate, which are likewise the same \nwords, so that it will have a House number. And there would have been a \nplace.\n  I will not go through all these places. But we could fight on. No, we \nwould not finish at 4:30 tomorrow morning, we would not finish it at \n4:30 the next morning, if we wanted to. I hope the leadership and the \nSenators will all understand that. I am not bragging. Dizzy Dean said: \nIt's all right to brag if you have done it. We could do that. We could \ndo that. But what good would it do? What good would it do? The course \nof destiny has already been set by this Senate.\n  So the President has said on many occasions he has not made up his \nmind to go to war. When he does make up his mind, if he does, then he \nshould come back to Congress and seek formal authorization.\n  Let those high-powered lawyers of the White House tell him otherwise. \nThey are going to stand by their client, I suppose. But they did not go \nto the same law school I went to. They probably did not have to work as \nhard as I had to work. Their wives may not have worked as hard as my \nwife to put me through law school. Well, so much for that.\n\n  Let him come back to the Congress for authorization.\n  Mr. President, I continue to have faith in our system of Government. \nIt works. I continue to have faith in the basic values that shape this \ncountry, this Nation. Ours was a great country before it became a great \nnation. Those values do not include striking first at other countries, \nat other nations. Those values do not include using our position as the \nstrongest and most formidable Nation in the world to bully and \nintimidate other nations.\n  There are no preemptive strikes in the language of the Constitution, \nI do not care what other Senators say. Those values do not include \nputting other nations on an enemies list so we can justify preemptive \nmilitary strikes.\n  Were I not to believe in the inherent ability of the Constitution to \nwithstand the folly of such actions as the Senate is about to take, I \nwould not stop fighting. Yes, he is 85--85. I will be 85 years old 41 \ndays from now if the good Lord--if the good Lord--lets me live. But \ndon't you think for a moment I can't stand on this floor all the rest \nof this night. I like to fight when I am fighting for the Constitution \nand for this institution. I will fight until I drop, yes, fight until \nthey hack my flesh to the bone. I would fight with every fiber in my \nbody, every ounce of my energy, with every parliamentary tool at my \ndisposal--and there are parliamentary tools at my disposal; don't you \never think there are not--but I do believe the Constitution will \nweather this storm. The Senate will weather the storm as well.\n  I only hope that when the tempest passes, Senators will reflect upon \nthe ramifications of what they have done and understand the damage that \nhas been inflicted on the Constitution of the United States.\n  Now, those people out there believe in the Constitution. And I have \nbeen very disappointed to have stood on my feet--an 85-year-old man, \nstanding on his feet, and pleading with his colleagues to stand up for \nthe Constitution--I have been disappointed that some of them seem not \nto have listened at all. That is a real disappointment. It\n\n[[Page S10277]]\n\nisn't Robert C. Byrd who counts; it is the Constitution of the United \nStates. And but for that Constitution, they would not be here, I would \nnot be here, and you, Mr. President, would not be here. It is that \nConstitution.\n  And we all take an oath, a solemn oath, to support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and \ndomestic.\n  In the greatest oration that was ever delivered in the history of \nmankind, the oration ``On the Crown,'' delivered in the year 331 B.C. \nby Demosthenes in his denunciation of Aeschines, he asked this \nquestion: Who deceives the state?\n  He answered his own question by saying: The man who does not speak \nwhat he thinks. Who deceives the state? The man who does not speak what \nhe thinks.\n  I believe we ought to speak what we think. A political party means \nnothing, absolutely nothing to me, in comparison with this Constitution \nwhich I hold in my hand. It means nothing, political party means \nnothing to me, in comparison with this great old book which our mothers \nread, the Holy Bible.\n  It seems to me that in this debate--thinking about the 50,000 e-mails \nthat have come to this country boy from the hills of West Virginia, \n50,000 e-mails, almost 20,000 telephone calls; my wonderful staff have \nbeen hard-pressed to take all these calls and log them in--the American \npeople seem to have a better understanding of the Constitution than do \nthose who are elected to represent them.\n  Now, that is a shame, isn't it? I feel sorry for some of my \ncolleagues. I love them; bless their hearts. I love them. I forgive \nthem. But you might as well talk to the ocean. I might as well speak to \nthe waves as they come with the tides that rise and fall. I might as \nwell speak to the waves, as did King Canute, as to speak to some of my \ncolleagues. They won't hear me. And it isn't because it is Robert Byrd. \nThey just don't want to hear about that Constitution.\n  That is what these people are writing me about. Perhaps it is that \ntheir understanding, the understanding of the people, the great mass of \npeople out there, it may be that their understanding of the \nConstitution has not yet filtered through the prism of the election \nyear politics. That's it--the election year politics.\n  I believe the American people have a better understanding of what the \nSenate is about to do, a greater respect for the inherent powers of the \nConstitution, and a greater comprehension of the far-reaching \nconsequences of this resolution, a greater comprehension than do most \nof their leaders.\n  I thank my colleagues who have allowed me to express at considerable \nlength my reasons for opposing the resolution. I thank those Senators, \nsuch as the Senator who presides over the Senate at this very moment, I \nthank those Senators who have stood with me in my fight for the \nConstitution and for this institution and for that provision in the \nConstitution that says, Congress shall have power to declare war.\n  I thank those Senators who have engaged in thoughtful debate with me. \nI thank Senator McCain. I thank Senator Warner. I thank these men. They \nstood up for what they believe. They stood up for this administration. \nThe only difference is, I will stand for no administration--none--when \nit comes to this Constitution. If the administration took a position \nopposite that Constitution, forget it. I don't care if it is a \nDemocrat.\n  I do not believe the Senate has given enough time or enough \nconsideration to the question of handing the President unchecked \nauthority to usurp the Constitution and declare war on Iraq. I have no \nbrief for Iraq. But I accept the futility of continuing to fight on \nthis front. So I could keep us here all night tonight. I know there \nwould be other Senators who would stand with me. Other Senators believe \nas I do. I could keep us here tomorrow. I could keep us here through \nSaturday. I would hope we would not be in on Sunday. That is the \nSabbath Day. But come back on next Tuesday, have at it again, until the \nflesh from my bones be hacked.\n  I say to the people of America, to those who have encouraged other \nSenators and me to uphold the principles of the Constitution: Keep up \nthe fight. Keep fighting for what is right. Let your voices be heard.\n  Why do you think George Washington crossed the Delaware? I say to my \ngood friend from Delaware, Joe Biden, my esteemed friend, my esteemed \ncolleague. He crossed the Delaware, I say to my friend Fred Thompson--\nSenator Fred Thompson, we are going to soon miss him. I like him. I \nlike him. He always speaks with great passion and fervor, and he is \nalways respectful of other Senators. He was here during the days of Sam \nErvin, Howard Baker, the days of Watergate, that Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Let me say, I will always listen to you, the people out there, and I \nhope the President will begin to listen to you.\n  If the President really wants to do something for this country, let \nhim help to fight the war at home. This week, we will soon be passing \nanother CR. Time and time again, the President's Attorney General and \nthe Director of Homeland Security have put the Nation on notice that \nthere is an imminent threat of another terrorist attack to our \nhomeland. And from time to time, they have even identified the most \nlikely targets, such as our nuclear powerplants, our transportation \ninfrastructure, our Nation's monuments, our embassies. They have told \nour citizens to be vigilant about this imminent risk.\n  What has the President done to respond to this imminent risk of \nterrorist attack on our Nation's shoulders? The President has proposed \nto create a new bureaucracy. He has proposed to move boxes around on an \norganization of flowcharts. He has proposed to create the second-\nlargest domestic agency in the history of the Republic. Even the \nPresident recognizes that actually creating the new Department of \nHomeland Security will take at least 1 year.\n  I tell you, my friends, if I ever saw a good lawyer, he sits right \nhere on the back row, right now--that Senator from Tennessee, Fred \nThompson. Why do I say that? Because he made the most rousing defense \nof this sorry resolution that is before the Senate and on which we will \nsoon vote, the most rousing defense of it. And yet he is against it. He \nis against it. That is what I call a good lawyer; he makes a rousing \ndefense of this thing which he hates.\n  Even the President recognizes that actually creating the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security will take at least 1 year. The GAO has \nsaid it will take at least 5 to 10 years for a new Department to be \neffected.\n  So while our citizens are facing this imminent risk, under the \nPresident's proposal, the agencies responsible for securing our \nborders, such as the Customs Service, the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, and the Coast Guard, will spend the next year \nor more figuring out for whom they work, with whom they work. Instead \nof focusing on their mission, our border agencies and inspectors will \nbe wondering whether their units will be reorganized or transferred to \nnew locations, and they will be wondering where their phones are, where \ntheir computers are, and whether their jobs are going to be eliminated. \nAnd what would be happening in the meantime? Who will be keeping the \nstore and watching the terrorists?\n  Reorganizing our bureaucracy will not improve our Nation's immediate \ncapacity to deter or respond to the imminent threat of a terrorist \nattack. Since September 11, the Senate Appropriations Committee has \nfocused on providing immediate resources to Federal, State, and local \nagencies and first responders in order to improve our capacity to \nrespond to this evolving threat.\n  On September 14, 2001--just 3 days after the horrific attacks on \nSeptember 11--Congress approved $40 billion. That is $40 for every day \nsince Jesus Christ was born. Congress approved $40 billion, including \n$9.8 billion for homeland defense. Resources were provided to the FBI \nto hire more agents and to improve their computers; to State and local \ngovernments to improve the capacity of our hospitals and clinics to \nrespond to chemical or biological weapons attacks; to State and local \ngovernments to train and equip our law enforcement and fire personnel \nto respond to attacks; for HHS to purchase smallpox vaccine for USDA; \nto the FDA to protect our food safety; to the Postal Service to \npurchase equipment that can protect the mail--where have you been, Mr. \nPresident? That is what\n\n[[Page S10278]]\n\nCongress did--for the FAA to secure cockpits and to improve the \nsecurity of our airports; to the Department of Transportation for port \nsecurity; to the Energy Department to help secure our nuclear \nfacilities; to Customs and INS for additional border security \ninspectors and agencies, and for improved training and equipment.\n  To listen to the President, he is the only person who has been \nthinking anything about homeland security. Here is the great Congress \nof the United States that has been providing moneys for the defense of \nour country.\n  Despite objections from the White House, Congress was able to \nincrease funding for homeland security programs by $3.9 billion. Where \nhave you been, Mr. President? If you want to do something, do something \nhere at home.\n  On November 14, 2001, Senate Democrats supported the inclusion of $15 \nbillion for homeland security in an economic stimulus package, \nincluding $4 billion for bioterrorism and food safety; $4.6 billion for \nlaw enforcement and responsive initiatives; $3.2 billion for \ntransportation security: and $3 billion for other homeland security \nprograms, including mail screening and protection for our nuclear \nplants and labs, water projects, and other facilities.\n  Where has he been, Mr. Commander in Chief? Out on the campaign trail \nraising money for the campaign? This is what Congress has been doing.\n  On November 14, 2001, the White House strongly objected to the \namendment, asserting that existing funding was ``more than adequate to \nmeet foreseeable needs.''\n  Now, who is fighting for homeland security? Under pressure from the \nWhite House, Senate Republicans, objecting to the emergency designation \nfor the homeland security funding, raised the Budget Act point of \norder. Efforts to waive the budget point of order failed. On December \n4, 2001, the Appropriations Committee reported out, by a vote of 29 to \n0, the Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2002.\n  In addition to the $20 billion appropriated on September 14, the bill \nwould have provided $7.5 billion in additional homeland security funds, \nincluding $3.9 billion for bioterrorism and food safety; $1.3 billion \nfor antiterrorism law enforcement; $1.43 billion for security of mail \nand nuclear facilities; $879 million for transportation and border \nsecurity. The bill would also have provided an additional $7.5 billion \nto FEMA's disaster relief account for activities and assistance related \nto 9/11.\n  On December 5, 2001, in a meeting with congressional leaders, \nPresident Bush threatened to veto the Defense appropriations bill \nbecause of funding ``that is not needed at this time.''\n  On December 6, 2001, Senate Republicans objected to the emergency \ndesignation for the homeland security funding in the Defense \nappropriations bill and raised the Budget Act point of order. Efforts \nto waive the budget point of order failed.\n  On December 7, 2001, after negotiations with Senate Republicans, \nhomeland security programs were reduced by over $3.6 billion. The \nSenate then passed the Defense appropriations bill. In April and May of \n2002, the Senate Appropriations Committee held five bipartisan \nhearings, led and conducted by Senator Ted Stevens and me, concerning \nthe defense of our homeland. Senator Stevens and I, and others on that \ncommittee, Republicans and Democrats, heard from Governors and from \nmayors. We heard from firemen, law enforcement, and emergency medical \npersonnel. We heard from specialists in the field of counterterrorism. \nBased on those hearings, the Committee on Appropriations in the Senate \nproduced a bipartisan supplemental appropriations bill to continue our \neffort to provide immediate resources to improve our Nation's capacity \nto deter and respond to terrorist attack.\n  On May 22, 2002, the Senate Appropriations Committee, by a vote of 29 \nto 0, reported out a supplemental appropriations bill that included \n$8.3 billion for homeland defense programs.\n  Once again, on June 4, 2002, the President threatened to veto the \nbill because he believed it contained unnecessary homeland security \nspending.\n  On June 7, 2002, the Senate passed the Supplemental Appropriations \nAct for further recovery from and response to terrorist attacks on the \nUnited States. The bill provided $8.3 billion for homeland security \nprograms, including the following amounts above the President's \nrequest: $265 million for airport security funds; $646 million for \nfirst responder programs; $716 million for port security. However, \nunder pressure from the White House, conferees on that bill were forced \nto reduce homeland security funding from $8.3 billion to $6.7 billion--\nunder pressure from the White House.\n  In negotiations with House Republicans, homeland security funding was \ndropped for cybersecurity, for improved capacity for the Centers for \nDisease Control to investigate potential biological attacks, for \nairport security, for the Coast Guard, and for the Customs Service.\n  On July 24 of this year, the Senate passed the conference report to \nthe Supplemental Appropriations Act for further recovery from and \nresponse to terrorist attacks on the United States. Get this now; we \nare talking about war here, the war on terrorism. Where? Here in this \ncountry. This act reduced the $8.3 billion for homeland security \nappropriated by the Senate to $6.7 billion.\n  Did the White House agree to fund the full $6.7 billion for homeland \ndefense programs? Did it?\n  No. The White House talks a good game on homeland defense, but the \nWhite House support is more about rhetoric than it is about resources. \nIn order for the President to spend $2.5 billion for homeland defense \nspending, it was necessary for him to do what? Just sign his name on a \ndocument designating the funding as an emergency requirement.\n  What did the President choose to do? Did he choose to sign his name \nand start that $2.5 billion to flowing into the States and counties and \nmunicipalities of this country? No. The President chose not to make \nthat designation.\n  In making that decision, he terminated $2.5 billion of funding for \nthe FBI, funding to train and equip our Nation's firefighters, funding \nfor the Corps of Engineers to help ensure our water supply, funding for \nsecurity at nuclear facilities, funding for the Coast Guard.\n  Now tell that, Mr. President, at your next campaign stop, your next \nfundraiser when you are talking about making war on Iraq. Tell the \npeople there what I have been reading. It is fact. These are for the \nrecord.\n  One of the lessons we learned at the World Trade Center on September \n11 was that our fire personnel could not communicate by radio with \npolice personnel; that local officials could not communicate with State \nand regional personnel.\n  When the President decided to block the $2.5 billion, he blocked the \n$100 million that we approved to help State and local governments \nacross the land to solve the problem, and $90 million to provide \nmedical assistance to the first responders at the World Trade Center \nwas lost.\n  What is the President's solution for the imminent threat to our \nNation's homeland security? Rhetoric? Yes. More bureaucracy? Yes. \nResources to respond to the immediate threat? No.\n  Mr. President, with reference to this Commander in Chief business \nthat we hear about--oh, the Commander in Chief, they say. I listen to \nmy friends across the aisle talking about the Commander in Chief. We \nmust do this for the Commander in Chief; we must stand shoulder to \nshoulder with the Commander in Chief. The Commander in Chief. Of what \nis he Commander in Chief? The army, the navy, and the militia of the \nseveral States. But who provides the army and the navy? Who provides \nfor the calling out of the militia of the several States? Congress. So \nmuch for the the term ``Commander in Chief.''\n  Charles I used that term in 1639--Commander in Chief. You know what \nhappened to Charles I of England? The swordsman cut off the head of \nCharles I on January 30, 1649. So much for Commander in Chief.\n  Parliament and the King of England fought a war. Can you imagine \nthat? Can you imagine Congress fighting a war with the President of the \nUnited States? They did that in England. Yes, Parliament and the King \nfought a war. Who lost? The King. Who was it? King Charles I. A high \ncourt convened on January 1, I believe it was, 1649, and in 30 days \nthey cut Charles I's head off--severed it from his body. So much for\n\n[[Page S10279]]\n\nCharles I. That was the Commander in Chief. Yes. Hail to the chief.\n  I respect the President as much as anybody else. But the Barons at \nRunnemede on the banks of the Thames on June 15, 1215, took it upon \nthemselves to let the King know that there was a law, and that Kings \nhad to live by the law, just as did barons and others.\n  I do not know who is talking to this President down here. I do not \nknow who among his crowd down there is trying to pump him up, but my \nfriends, this President of the United States is the President by virtue \nof this Constitution. He is created by this Constitution that I hold in \nmy hand, which says in article II that the President shall be Commander \nin Chief. And yet this refers to the Constitution in this national \nsecurity strategy of the United States of America printed on September \n2002. It refers to the Constitution not even with a capital letter.\n  The Constitution of America--what is the matter with those people? \nHaven't they studied the Constitution down at the other end of the \navenue? They better become aware of it. This is the Constitution, and \nthat Constitution refutes this resolution on which Congress is about to \nvote to give to the President of the United States power to determine \nthe use of the military forces, when he will use them, where he will \nuse them, how long he will use them. It is this Constitution. You \nbetter believe it, may I say to those who advise the President.\n  I think the President is probably a much better individual by \nhimself, but somebody is giving him bad advice.\n  Here is what Hamilton says. Let's read what Hamilton says. He is one \nof the three authors of the ``Federalist Papers.'' Hamilton, who was \nshot to death in Weehawken, NJ, on the 11th of July, 1804. He died on \nthe 12th of July, 1804; shot by the Vice President of the United \nStates; murdered by the Vice President of the United States. Let's hear \nwhat Alexander Hamilton has to say in the Federalist Paper No. 69. Read \nit. These are the ``Federalist Papers.'' There are 85 of them written \nby Jay, Hamilton, and Madison. Let's hear what he says about the \nCommander in Chief. I want the Commander in Chief to hear me. I want \nthe Commander in Chief to hear not what Robert Byrd said--who is he?--\nbut read what Alexander Hamilton said:\n\n       The President is to be the ``commander-in-chief'' of the \n     army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the \n     several States, when called into the actual service of the \n     United States. . . .In most of these particulars, the power \n     of the President will resemble equally that of the king of \n     Great Britain and of the governor of New York. The most \n     material points of difference are these:--First. The \n     President will have only the occasional command of such part \n     of the militia of the nation as by legislative provision may \n     be called into the actual service of the Union. The king of \n     Great Britain and the governor of New York have at all times \n     the entire command of all the militia within their several \n     jurisdictions. In this article, therefore--\n\n  Talking about this article of the Constitution--\n\n       In this article, therefore, the power of the President \n     would be inferior to that of either the monarch or the \n     governor. Second. The President is to be commander-in-chief \n     of the army and navy of the United States. In this respect \n     his authority would be nominally the same with that of the \n     king of Great Britain, but in substance much inferior to it.\n\n  Get that down there at the other end of the avenue. Read it.\n\n       Second. The President is to be commander-in-chief. . . .It \n     would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and \n     direction of the military and naval forces, as first general \n     and admiral of the Confederacy; while that of the British \n     king extends to the declaring of war and to the raising and \n     regulating of fleets and armies--all which, by the \n     Constitution under consideration, would appertain to the \n     legislature.\n\n  That is Hamilton.\n  I am reading from the Federalist Papers. Perhaps I ought to send a \ncopy down to the White House. I will see if I can't do that. I will \nsend them a copy. It will not cost them anything, just a gift from \nRobert C. Byrd. \n  Now, I have a little more to say. Suffice it to say there are other \nof my colleagues, and I, who have stood on this floor and we have \npointed to the Constitution of the United States. We have said time and \ntime again, as we have offered amendments, to try to uphold this \nConstitution of the United States, read those amendments. They went \ndown, I am sorry to say, but I am not discouraged.\n  Let me read some verses from the Book of Luke in the Holy Bible, \nbeginning with chapter 16, verse 19 and continuing through verse 31:\n\n       There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple \n     and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day. And there \n     was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his \n     gate, full of sores, and desiring to be fed with the crumbs \n     which fell from the rich man's table. Moreover the dogs came \n     and licked his sores. And it came to pass that the beggar \n     died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. The \n     rich man also died, and was buried.\n       And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and \n     seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he \n     cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send \n     Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and \n     cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.\n       But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime \n     receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; \n     but now he is comforted and thou art tormented. And beside \n     all of this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed; \n     so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot. \n     Neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.\n       Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou \n     wouldest send him to my father's house; For I have five \n     brethren: that he may testify unto them, lest they also come \n     into this place of torment. And Abraham saith unto him, They \n     have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. And he said, \n     Nay, father Abraham; but if one went unto them from the dead \n     they will repent. And he said unto him, if they hear not \n     Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, \n     though one rose from the dead.\n\n  There you have it. We can speak until we are blue in the face, we can \nspeak until our tongues fall out, and they will not hear us. So if \nthere were those who were brought from the dead, would some listen?\n  Some would; some would not.\n  We have spoken. We have spoken out of our hearts, and we can speak \nuntil our hearts fall from our bodies, but some would not hear. Let \nthose who will not hear understand that this Constitution will endure. \nIt will endure because it was written, as John Marshall said, to endure \nfor the ages.\n  In closing, I want to thank my dear friends in this Senate who have \nstood in this Chamber day after day in the effort to educate our \npeople.\n  The Senate is a great institution, but somehow I think we are \nfailing. We are failing to educate the people. Why? Because we do not \nwant to spend enough time. How much time have we spent on this \nresolution as of yesterday at 4 p.m.? A little over 25 hours on this \nbill--25 hours. Why, many of the larger municipalities in this country \nwould spend a week on an application for a sewer permit. And here we \nspend 2 days?--that is what it amounts to, 25 hours--and we are ready \nto quit.\n  We know we might as well quit because this cloture rule is being used \nagainst us. Why at this critical time, when we are discussing the most \ncritical legislation we have had before the Senate this year, the most \ncritical legislation we may have in a long time? We have been \nstampeded, we have been rushed, and it is unfair to the people of this \ncountry. Yet it has to be that way.\n  I have letters from constitutional scholars in response to my inquiry \nof them as to the war powers of the United States Congress. I received \nseveral letters from constitutional scholars from around the country, \nand I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record: A \nletter by Jane E. Stromseth, professor of law, Georgetown University \nLaw Center; a letter from Tufts University, the Fletcher School of Law \nand Diplomacy, a letter signed by Michael J. Glennon, professor of \ninternational law.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Georgetown University Law Center,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 26, 2002.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: Thank you for your letter of July 22, \n     asking for my opinion regarding whether the Bush \n     Administration currently has sufficient constitutional and/or \n     statutory authority to introduce U.S. Armed Forces into Iraq \n     for the purpose of removing Saddam Hussein from power. This \n     question is of vital importance to our country and our \n     Constitution, and I appreciate the opportunity to address it.\n       The answer to your question requires an interpretation of \n     the Constitution and of several statutes, and it also depends \n     on the factual circumstances surrounding any contemplated \n     military action. As I discuss below, if the United States or \n     its armed\n\n[[Page S10280]]\n\n     forces are subject to attack or imminent attack by Iraq, the \n     President can invoke his constitutional authority as \n     Commander in Chief to repel sudden attacks. Also, if the \n     President establishes a direct link between Iraq and the \n     attacks of September 11, he can invoke S.J. Res. 23 (Pub. L. \n     No. 107-40) as statutory authority to commit U.S. forces to \n     Iraq. However, based on the facts as they have been presented \n     by the Bush Administration as of August 26, 2002, neither an \n     imminent attack by Iraq nor a clear link between Iraq and the \n     September 11 attacks have been established. Moreover, given \n     the likely scale and risks of a U.S. military action to \n     remove Saddam Hussein from power, the commitment of U.S. \n     forces to Iraq to impose a regime change would constitute a \n     war requiring prior congressional authorization, which, \n     absent a connection to the September 11 attacks does not \n     presently exist. While serious arguments can be advanced that \n     the 1991 Gulf War authorization, coupled with subsequent \n     legislative action, provide statutory authority to use U.S. \n     armed forces to remove Saddam Hussein as part of enforcing \n     the Gulf War cease-fire resolution (UN Security Council \n     Resolution 687), those arguments ultimately fall short on \n     close examination. In sum, whether commencing U.S. military \n     action against Saddam Hussein, in circumstances outside a \n     link to Sept. 11 or an attack or imminent attack against the \n     United States, is a wise policy is a question on which \n     reasonable people can disagree; it is also a question that \n     ought, under our Constitution, to be debated by Congress and \n     its authorization secured before any such military action \n     commences. The basis for these conclusions is set forth full \n     below.\n     First Principles\n       As you know well, the Constitution's war powers provisions \n     are part of a structural system of checks and balances \n     designed to protect liberty by guarding against the \n     concentration of power. The Constitution gave Congress the \n     power to declare war because the Founders believed that such \n     a significant decision should be made not by one person, but \n     by the legislature as a whole, to ensure careful deliberation \n     by the people's elected representatives and broad national \n     support before the country embarked on a course so full of \n     risks. As James Madison put it: ``In no part of the \n     constitution is more wisdom to be found, than in the clause \n     which confides the question of war or peace to the \n     legislation, and not to the executive department . . . \n     [T]he trust and the temptation would be too great for any \n     one man. . . .''\\1\\ The Founders, in short, vested the \n     power to decide whether the country should go to war in \n     the Congress to ensure that the decision to expose the \n     country to such sacrifices and costs reflected the \n     judgment and deliberation of the legislative branch as a \n     whole.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ James Madison, in Alexander Hamilton & James Madison, \n     Letters of Pacificus and Helvidius on the Proclamation of \n     Neutrality of 1793, at 89 (Washington, D.C., J. Gideon & G.S. \n     Gideon, 1845).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       At the same time, the framers wanted a strong Executive who \n     could ``repel sudden attacks'' and act with efficiency and \n     dispatch in protecting the interests of the United States in \n     a dangerous world. By making the President Commander in \n     Chief, moreover, they sought to ensure effective, unified \n     command over U.S. forces and civilian accountability. My best \n     reading of the constitutional sources is that the Founders \n     expected the President, as Commander in Chief and Chief \n     Executive, to protect the United States in a dangerous and \n     uncertain world by repelling attacks or imminent attacks \n     against the United States, its vessels, and its armed forces, \n     but not, on his own, to go beyond this authority and commence \n     war without congressional authority. The Founders, in short, \n     made a clear distinction between defending against attacks \n     initiated by others and commencing war.\n       Historical practice since the Constitution's ratification \n     has not fundamentally altered how we should understand the \n     Constitution's allocation of war powers today. On the \n     contrary, practice cannot supplant or override the clear \n     requirements of the Constitution, which gives the power to \n     declare or initiate war to Congress. Furthermore, of the \n     dozen major wars in American history, five were formally \n     declared by Congress and six were authorized by other \n     legislative measures.\\2\\ Whatever conclusions one might reach \n     about small-scale uses of force, which admittedly raise more \n     complicated issues, the fact remains that major wars have \n     been authorized by Congress.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ President Truman committed U.S. forces to Korea without \n     seeking congressional authorization. For a discussion of \n     constitutional war powers and the Korean War, see Jane \n     Stromseth, ``Rethinking War Powers: Congress, The President, \n     and the United Nations,'' 81 Georgetown Law Journal 597, 621-\n     640 (1993). Congress subsequently enacted legislation to \n     provide funds for the Korean War and to extend the draft, id. \n     at 626, 630.\n     \\3\\ In a longer piece, I discuss original intent, historical \n     practice, and current arguments about war powers more fully \n     and systematically, and I draw upon my conclusions in that \n     piece here. See Jane E. Stromseth, ``Understanding \n     Constitutional War Powers Today: Why Methodology Matters,'' \n     106 Yale L.J. 845 (1996).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The War Powers Resolution (Pub. L. No. 93-148) aims to \n     ``insure that the collective judgment of both the Congress \n     and the President'' apply to the introduction of U.S. forces \n     into hostilities and to the continued use of those forces. \n     Moreover, it seeks to enable the Congress to better fulfill \n     its constitutional responsibilities by requiring the \n     President ``in every possible instance'' to ``consult with \n     Congress before introducing'' U.S. armed forces into \n     hostilities or imminent hostilities. Among its other \n     provisions, the War Powers Resolution makes clear, in Section \n     8(a), that authority to introduce U.S. Armed Forces into \n     hostilities or imminent hostilities ``shall not be inferred . \n     . . from any provision of law . . . , including any provision \n     contained in any appropriation Act, unless such provision \n     specifically authorizes the introduction of United States \n     Armed Forces into hostilities or into such situations and \n     states that it is intended to constitute specific statutory \n     authorization within the meaning of this joint resolution.'' \n     This clear-statement rule is designed to serve the \n     constitutional purpose of ensuring a clear and deliberate \n     congressional authorization of force. Thus, when Congress \n     authorized commencement of the Gulf War in 1991, and again \n     when Congress authorized the use of force in response to the \n     September 11 attacks, it expressly affirmed that it was \n     providing specific statutory authorization within the meaning \n     of the War Powers Resolution.\n       Moreover, the War Powers Resolution makes clear that it is \n     not intended ``to alter the constitutional authority of the \n     Congress or of the President,'' nor shall it ``be construed \n     as granting any authority to the President with respect to \n     the introduction of United States Armed Forces into \n     hostilities . . . which authority he would not have had in \n     the absence of this joint resolution.'' (Section 8(d)(1) and \n     8(d)(2)). Thus, contrary to claims sometimes made, the War \n     Powers Resolution does not authorize the President to commit \n     U.S. forces to war for 60 days.\\4\\ On the contrary, because \n     the Constitution requires congressional authorization to \n     commence war, the War Powers Resolution should not be read to \n     confer such authority on the President. Congress thus \n     expressly authorized the 1991 Persian Gulf War and certainly \n     did not view the War Powers Resolution as obviating the need \n     for such authorization. (I have attached my summary of the \n     congressional debate preceding the Gulf War as an appendix to \n     this letter).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\4\\ The War Powers Resolution and its 60/90 day time-clock \n     apply to a wide variety of situations in which U.S. forces \n     are introduced into hostilities as well as into ``situations \n     where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly \n     indicated by the circumstances.'' Whatever effects this \n     statute has, or was intended to have on smaller-scale \n     deployments of force, including deployments that involve \n     simply the prospect of hostilities, the War Powers Resolution \n     cannot be read as authorizing 60 days wars because of the \n     clear language to the contrary in sections 8(d) and 2(c) of \n     the statute.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Military Action Against Iraq for the Purpose of Removing \n         Saddam Hussein from Power\n       If the President were to commit U.S. armed forces to Iraq \n     for the purpose of removing Saddam Hussein from power, the \n     United States would be embarking on what likely would be a \n     major and sustained commitment of military forces in a \n     campaign that would involve enormous risks and substantial \n     potential casualties. In order to commit U.S. forces to \n     such a military action, the President would need authority \n     to act.\n       Constitutionally, the President possesses the power to \n     repel sudden attacks, which, in my view, includes the power \n     to forestall imminent attacks against the United States and \n     its armed forces, and to protect Americans in imminent danger \n     abroad.\\5\\ In an age of terrorism, there may well be direct \n     and imminent threats to the United States that require an \n     immediate defensive response by the President and constitute \n     a legitimate exercise of the international right of self-\n     defense. But, at this point, the President has not offered \n     evidence of an imminent attack by Iraq on the United States \n     or its forces. The purpose behind the President's power as \n     Chief Executive and Commander in Chief to ``repel sudden \n     attacks'' is to give the President the flexibility to act to \n     defend the United States when there is not time to consult \n     with Congress. But the decision to go beyond this and to \n     commence a war is vested in Congress. Moreover, there is time \n     for a thorough legislative debate regarding Iraq; the United \n     States and its forces are not currently being attacked; \n     military forces would be built up over a period of time \n     before military action could be commenced; and ample time \n     exists to consult with Congress and seek its authorization to \n     use force.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\5\\ This interpretation of the President's authority is \n     consistent with the understanding reflected in the original \n     Senate version of the War Powers Resolution. See S. Rep. No. \n     93-220, at 22 (1973). For a discussion of the scope of the \n     President's defensive war powers, see Stromseth, \n     ``Understanding Constitutional War Powers Today: Why \n     Methodology Matters,'' 106 Yale L. J. 845, 888-892 (1996).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Major military action with far-reaching objectives such as \n     regime change is precisely the kind of action that \n     constitutionally should be debated and authorized by Congress \n     in advance. Under present circumstances, which admittedly \n     could change, military action against Iraq to force a change \n     in regime would pose significant risks to U.S. forces, \n     including risks of Iraqi retaliation with weapons of mass \n     destruction, and risks of a larger conflict in an already \n     hemoraging Middle East. Initiating a military confrontation \n     of this nature would be a decision to engage in war that is \n     precisely the kind of decision the Founders vested in \n     Congress by virtue of its power to declare war. Moreover, the \n     purposes behind that power (ensuring deliberation, democratic \n     consensus and national unity before\n\n[[Page S10281]]\n\n     engaging in war) are critical if the American people and \n     American armed forces are being asked to bear those risks. In \n     short, under the factual circumstances that exist as of the \n     date of this letter, the President cannot rely on inherent \n     constitutional authority to commit U.S. forces to Iraq for \n     the purpose of removing Saddam Hussein from power.\n     Congress's Post-September 11 Authorization of Force\n       Whether statutory authority presently exists to introduce \n     U.S. armed forces into Iraq to depose Saddam Hussein depends \n     on whether such action would fall within the provisions of \n     S.J. Res. 23 (Pub. L. No. 107-40), adopted in response to the \n     September 11 attacks.\n       Congress's authorization for the use of force against those \n     responsible for the attacks of September 11 is an express \n     recognition that Congress and the President both have a \n     critical constitutional role to play in the war on terrorism. \n     S.J. Res. 23 authorizes the President: ``to use all necessary \n     and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, \n     or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or \n     aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, \n     2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to \n     prevent any future acts of international terrorism against \n     the United States by such nations, organizations or \n     persons.'' Thus, the force must be directed against those \n     responsible for the September 11th attacks, or those who \n     harbored such organizations or persons; and the purpose of \n     using force is focused and future-oriented: to prevent \n     additional terrorist acts against the United States by the \n     states, organizations, or persons responsible for the \n     September 11th attacks or who harbored those responsible.\n       Congress' post-September 11th resolution was an unambiguous \n     decision to authorize force. Like the Gulf War authorization \n     in 1991, the authorization explicitly affirms that it ``is \n     intended to constitute specific statutory authorization \n     within the meaning of section 5(b) of the War Powers \n     Resolution.'' This removes any actions that fall within the \n     scope of the authorization from the War Powers Resolution's \n     60-day time-clock provision. At the same time, Congress made \n     clear that the requirements of the War Powers Resolution \n     otherwise remain applicable, which would include the \n     requirement of regular reporting and consultation. Moreover, \n     in signing the Joint Resolution, President Bush made clear \n     that he would consult closely with Congress as the United \n     States responds to terrorism.\n       Whether this joint resolution authorizes military action \n     against Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power depends on \n     whether the requisite link to the attacks of September 11 \n     exists or not. That is, did Iraq ``plan [ ], authorize, [ ] \n     commit [ ], or aid [ ] the September 11 attacks,'' or \n     ``harbor'' organizations or persons who did? Under the terms \n     of the resolution, the President determines whether such a \n     link to the September 11th attacks is established, but \n     Congress undoubtedly expected that the President would \n     make his determination and the basis for it known to \n     Congress. In a matter as momentous as commencing \n     hostilities against Iraq, Congress and the American people \n     would certainly expect a clear and convincing indication \n     of evidence linking Iraq to the September 11 attacks. As \n     of August 26, 2002, the Administration, to my knowledge, \n     has not made such a showing nor publicly argued that there \n     is a direct link between Iraq and the September 11 \n     attacks. Nor has the Administration presented its views \n     regarding whether using force to remove Saddam Hussein \n     from power is ``necessary and appropriate force . . . in \n     order to prevent any future acts of international \n     terrorism against the United States'' by the nations, \n     organizations or persons responsible for the September 11 \n     attacks. If the link between Iraq and the September 11 \n     attacks is tenuous, additional congressional authorization \n     clearly addressing Iraq would better serve the important \n     constitutional purposes underlying Congress's power to \n     declare war: congressional deliberation and national \n     consensus before the country embarks on a major military \n     action so full of risks.\n     The 1991 Gulf War Authorization\n       Some argue that the President has current authority to use \n     U.S. forces against Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein based on \n     the 1991 Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution (Pub. \n     L. 102-1). This Resolution, adopted prior to the 1991 Gulf \n     War, authorized the President to use U.S. Armed Forces \n     pursuant to U.N. Security Council Resolution 678 to achieve \n     implementation of previous, enumerated Security Council \n     resolutions.\\6\\ Those Security Council resolutions included \n     Resolution 660 (1990) demanding that Iraq withdraw \n     immediately from Kuwait. UN Security Council Resolution 678, \n     in turn, authorized UN member states cooperating with Kuwait \n     ``to use all necessary means to uphold and implement \n     resolution 660 (1990) and all subsequent relevant resolutions \n     and to restore international peace and security in the \n     area.'' In contrast to this UN resolution, which refers to \n     ``all subsequent relevant resolutions,'' the 1991 \n     congressional authorization of force was crafted to refer \n     only to implementation of specific UN resolutions adopted \n     prior to Resolution 678--resolutions that focus above all on \n     Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and restoration of Kuwait's \n     sovereignty. Congress, in short, tailored its 1991 \n     authorization to the specific goal of liberating Kuwait \n     rather than providing an open-ended authorization of force.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\6\\ H.J. Res. 77, Pub. L. No. 102-1, provides in Section \n     2(a): ``The President is authorized, subject to subsection \n     (b), to use United States armed forces pursuant to United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 678 (1990) in order to \n     achieve implementation of Security Council Resolutions 660, \n     661, 662, 664, 665, 666, 667, 669, 670, 674, and 677.'' \n     Section 2(b), in turn, requires the President, before using \n     force, to make available to Congress his determination that \n     ``the United States has used all appropriate diplomatic and \n     other peaceful means to obtain compliance by Iraq with the \n     United Nations Security Council resolutions cited in \n     subsection (a); and . . . that those efforts have not been \n     and would not be successful in obtaining such compliance.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Those who invoke the 1991 Use of Military Force Against \n     Iraq Resolution as current authority to remove Saddam Hussein \n     begin by noting that Iraq is in material breach of UN \n     Security Council Resolution 687 (the Gulf War cease-fire \n     resolution). That resolution requires Iraq to relinquish all \n     weapons of mass destruction and authorized a UN Special \n     Commission (UNSCOM) to monitor Iraq's compliance. Resolution \n     687, in particular, requires Iraq to ``unconditionally accept \n     the destruction, removal, or rendering harmless, under \n     international supervision'' of all chemical and biological \n     weapons and all ballistic missiles with a range exceeding 150 \n     kilometers and to ``unconditionally undertake not to use, \n     develop, construct or acquire'' such weapons. (Resolution \n     687, paragraphs 8 and 10). Iraq likewise is required not to \n     develop or acquire nuclear weapons or subsystems or \n     components, and to submit to ongoing monitoring and \n     verification of its compliance (paragraphs 12, 13). \n     Undoubtedly, Iraq's persistent refusal to allow full, \n     unimpaired weapons inspections is a clear and unacceptable \n     breach of Resolution 687. The domestic legal question then \n     is: has Congress authorized the use of U.S. armed forces to \n     remove Saddam Hussein from power in order to enforce UN \n     Security Council Resolution 687?\n       The 1991 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against \n     Iraq Resolution does not, on its face, provide authorization \n     to use force to implement Resolution 687. Adopted prior to \n     the Gulf War, the 1991 Joint Resolution authorized the \n     President to use U.S. armed forces pursuant to UN Resolution \n     687 in order to achieve implementation of specific UN \n     resolutions adopted prior to Resolution 687. So purely as a \n     temporal matter, the cease-fire resolution (687), which came \n     at the end of the Gulf War, is not among the UN resolutions \n     enumerated in the 1991 Joint Resolution. Consequently, the \n     1991 authorization does not provide clear authority to use \n     force today to remove Saddam Hussein from power as a means to \n     enforce the Gulf War cease-fire resolution.\n       Since 1991, Congress has indicated in a ``sense of the \n     Congress'' resolution its support for using ``all necessary \n     means'' to achieve the ``goals'' of UN Resolution 687; \n     Congress has also indicated its support for a policy of \n     regime change in Iraq. Yet, upon careful examination, these \n     indications of congressional intent do not provide a \n     clear authorization by Congress of the use of U.S. armed \n     forces to attack Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power. \n     If the United States is to commence war against Iraq, and \n     to expose U.S. forces and citizens to the considerable \n     costs and sacrifices that this would entail, both the \n     Constitution and the War Powers Resolution (section \n     8(a)(1)) expect a clear authorization from Congress that \n     reflects a deliberate decision to initiate hostilities on \n     a major scale. The various congressional actions since \n     1991 concerning Iraq do not provide that authorization.\n       First, Section 1095 of the FY1992 Defense Authorization Act \n     (Pub. L. 102-190, signed December 5, 1991) declared the sense \n     of the Congress that Iraq's noncompliance with UN Resolution \n     687 constitutes ``a continuing threat to the peace, security, \n     and stability of the Persian Gulf region'' and that ``the \n     Congress supports the use of all necessary means to achieve \n     the goals of Security Council Resolution 687 as being \n     consistent with the Authorization for Use of Military Force \n     Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1).'' At the same \n     time, Section 1095 also expressed the sense of the Congress \n     that ``the President should consult closely with the partners \n     of the United States in the Desert Storm coalition and with \n     the members of the United Nations Security Council in order \n     to present a united front of opposition to Iraq's continuing \n     noncompliance with Security Council Resolution 687.''\n       Some may contend that Section 1095 together with the 1991 \n     Authorization for Use of Military Force Resolution gives the \n     President the authority to use force to commence war against \n     Iraq to impose a regime change because the 102nd Congress \n     expressed its view that using ``all necessary means to \n     achieve the goals of Security Council Resolution 687'' is \n     ``consistent with'' the 1991 authorization of force. Iraq is \n     in material breach of Resolution 687, as it was back in 1991, \n     and thus, according to this argument, the President can use \n     force to achieve Iraq's compliance, in accordance with \n     Section 1095 and the 1991 authorization, by removing Saddam \n     Hussein from power.\n       Yet, upon careful review, this argument ultimately falls \n     short. First, regime change goes beyond the provisions or \n     requirements of UN Resolution 687, so Congress has not \n     provided clear authority for commencing hostilities for this \n     purpose as a means to implement 687. It is one thing to use \n     limited force to enforce no-fly-zones, for instance; it is a \n     quite different thing to commence war\n\n[[Page S10282]]\n\n     to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Second, and more \n     importantly, Section 1095 does not provide the clear \n     authorization of war that both the Constitution and the War \n     Powers Resolution expect. Section 1095 does not use the word \n     ``force'' or ``authorize''; rather, it is a ``sense of the \n     Congress'' resolution indicating that Congress ``supports'' \n     the use of ``all necessary means'' to ``achieve the goals'' \n     of Resolution 687 as being consistent with the 1991 \n     Authorization. Section 1095 also fails to fulfil the War \n     Powers Resolution's clear-statement rule that authority to \n     use force cannot be inferred from legislation that does not \n     specifically cite its provisions. Although Section 1095 \n     refers to the 1991 Authorization, it does not itself cite the \n     War Powers Resolution. Constitutionally, reliance on a \n     ``sense of the Congress'' resolution in a massive defense \n     authorization bill enacted over a decade ago as authorization \n     to commence a war against Iraq today to remove Saddam Hussein \n     from power falls short of a clear contemporaneous \n     authorization of major military action that is faithful to \n     the purposes underlying the Constitution's vesting of the \n     power to declare war in Congress.\n       The Constitution vested the power to declare war in \n     Congress to ensure careful deliberation by the Congress as \n     well as the President before the United States commenced war. \n     Much has changed over the last decade, particularly after the \n     attacks of September 11, and initiating war against Iraq \n     today clearly would involve substantial costs and risks for \n     the United States, our forces and citizens, and for our \n     allies. Reasonable people may come to different conclusions \n     on the merits of this issue. But commencing a major military \n     action against Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power would \n     clearly constitute war, and congressional deliberation and \n     clear authorization is required. Reliance on an ambiguous \n     ``sense of the Congress'' resolution adopted over a decade \n     ago falls short of clear authority to commence war against \n     Iraq. The American people, including the brave men and women \n     who fight for our country, would expect a full debate and \n     consideration of the issue from their elected representatives \n     in Congress in light of the circumstances we face today. The \n     Constitution's wisdom on this point is compelling: \n     Authorization, if provided by Congress, ensures that the \n     costs and implications of any such action have been fully \n     considered and that a national consensus to proceed exists. \n     Congressional authorization also ensures American combat \n     forces that the country is behind them, and conveys America's \n     resolve and unity to allies as well as adversaries.\n       To be sure, congressional action since 1991 indicates \n     Congress's continuing concern about Iraq's noncompliance with \n     UN Resolution 687 and Congress's support for maintaining the \n     no-fly-zones. But Congress has not provided clear statutory \n     authority to commence war against Iraq to overthrow Saddam \n     Hussein. In 1998, in response to Saddam Hussein's continuing \n     defiance of UN Resolution 687 and his refusal to allow \n     weapons inspections, the Senate and House passed a \n     resolution, S.J. Res. 54 (Pub. L. 105-235, signed Aug. 14, \n     1998), which declared Iraq in ``material breach'' of \n     its international obligations and ``urged'' the President \n     ``to take appropriate action, in accordance with the \n     Constitution and relevant laws of the United States, to \n     bring Iraq into compliance with its international \n     obligations.'' This did not, however, provide clear \n     authorization to use U.S. armed forces.\n       Later in October 1998, Congress declared in the Iraq \n     Liberation Act of 1998, Pub. L. 105-338 (112 Stat. 3178), \n     that it ``should be the policy of the United States to \n     support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein \n     from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a \n     democratic government to replace that regime.'' (sec. 3). But \n     that Act also declared that ``[n]othing in this Act shall be \n     construed to authorize or otherwise speak to the use of \n     United States Armed Forces . . . in carrying out this Act'' \n     except as provided in section 4(a)(2) of the Act, which \n     authorizes the President to provide assistance to Iraqi \n     democratic opposition organizations through a ``drawdown of \n     defense articles from the stocks of the Department of \n     Defense, defense services of the Department of Defense, and \n     military education and training for such organizations.'' \n     (sec. 4(a)(2)).\n       Some may argue that the 1991 Authorization and Section \n     1095--combined with Pub. L. 105-235 (declaring Iraq in \n     material breach of its international obligations); Publ. L. \n     105-338 (calling for a regime change in Iraq); and \n     congressional acquiescence during ``Operation Desert Fox'' \n     (Dec. 16-19, 1998) when force was used in response to Iraq's \n     refusal to readmit weapons inspectors--amounts to implied \n     authorization by Congress to use U.S. armed forces on a more \n     substantial scale to remove Saddam Hussein from power. See \n     Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654 (1981) (relying on \n     related legislation and congressional acquiescence in holding \n     that the President was implicitly authorized to suspend \n     claims pending in U.S. courts).\n       This argument falls short as well. While Congress's acts \n     and resolutions clearly indicate its concern about Iraq's \n     noncompliance with UN Resolution 687, nowhere in the record \n     is there explicit authorization by Congress to commence a war \n     against Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Sense of \n     the Congress resolutions and congressional acquiescence \n     cannot substitute for a clear authorization to initiate war. \n     They do not meet the clear-statement provisions of Section 8 \n     of the War Powers Resolution. Furthermore, the principles \n     underlying the Constitution's decision to vest the power to \n     declare war in Congress are not served by relying on \n     ambiguous indications of Congressional intent regarding \n     force. Moreover, Congress itself decisively closed the door \n     to ``composite'' interpretations of its intent in 1998, when \n     it made clear that its support for a policy of regime change \n     should not be ``construed to authorize or otherwise speak to \n     the use of United States Armed Forces.''\n     Summing Up\n       To recap the basic points of this letter: If the United \n     States is subject to attack or imminent attack by Iraq, the \n     President clearly possesses constitutional authority to use \n     U.S. armed forces. Likewise, if it can be demonstrated that \n     Iraq ``planned, authorized, committed, or aided'' the \n     September 11 attacks, or ``harbored'' those responsible, the \n     President would have authority to use force under S.J. Res. \n     23. If the link is tenuous and disputed, however, the \n     constitutional purposes underlying the vesting of the power \n     to declare war in Congress would be best served by an \n     additional clear, express authorization of force against Iraq \n     that reflects the deliberation and judgment of the Congress. \n     Finally, Congress's authorization of the Persian Gulf War, \n     together with subsequent legislative action, fall short of a \n     clear authorization of war against Iraq to remove Saddam \n     Hussein from power.\n       Both the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution affirm \n     the critical importance of ensuring that decisions to commit \n     U.S. forces to war reflect the deliberation and support of \n     both the President and the Congress. Prior to the Persian \n     Gulf War, the President obtained clear authority to use force \n     from Congress. Likewise, in response to the September 11 \n     attacks, Congress and the President acted together in \n     enacting S.J. Res. 23. As our country moves ahead in the war \n     against terrorism and as it considers policy options with \n     respect to Iraq, I sincerely hope that the Congress and the \n     President will work together as the Constitution envisions.\n       Please call on me again if I can be of assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Jane E. Stromseth,\n     Professor of Law.\n                                  ____\n\n       Tufts University, The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy,\n\n\n                                 Medford, MA, August 20, 2002.\n\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: Thank you for your letter of July 22, \n     2002 requesting my opinion whether the President currently \n     has authority under U.S. domestic law to introduce the U.S. \n     armed forces into hostilities against Iraq for the purpose of \n     removing Saddam Hussein from power.\n       To summarize, I believe that he does not, although that \n     conclusion is based upon the assumption that Iraq was not \n     involved in the events of September 11, and that use of force \n     for this purpose would risk substantial casualties or large-\n     scale hostilities over a prolonged duration. I reach that \n     conclusion for the following reasons:\n       A. No treaty currently in force gives the President \n     authority to use force.\n       B. None of the three relevant statutes gives the President \n     authority to use force.\n       1. The War Powers Resolution confers no power on the \n     President to introduce the armed forces into hostilities that \n     he would not have had in its absence.\n       2. Congress's Gulf War authorization would confer such \n     power only if Security Council Resolution 678 did so, and \n     Resolution 678 probably does not do so.\n       a. The authority conferred by Resolution 678, which \n     authorized use of force against Iraq following its invasion \n     of Kuwait, was narrowly circumscribed and was directed at \n     reversing the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.\n       b. That authority most likely was extinguished on April 6, \n     1991, the date the Iraqis notified the United Nations of \n     their acceptance of the pertinent provisions of Security \n     Council Resolution 687, which declared a formal cease-fire.\n       c. Once extinguished that authority did not revive when \n     Iraq failed to comply with its obligations under Resolution \n     687.\n       d. A decision to revive Resolution 678 must be made by the \n     Security Council and cannot be made by an individual member \n     state.\n       e. It would be inappropriate to infer Security Council \n     intent to revive Resolution 678 from acquiescence by the \n     Council to subsequent military strikes against Iraq that were \n     not expressly authorized.\n       f. The War Powers Resolution requires that doubts flowing \n     from ambiguous or unclear measures be resolved against \n     finding authority to use force; at a minimum, these \n     considerations raise such doubts.\n       3. S.J. Res. 23 would permit use of force against Iraq only \n     if Iraq participated in the events of September 11.\n       C. Absent authorization from a treaty or statute, authority \n     to use force against Iraq can derive only the Constitution. \n     The Constitution's text, the case law, custom, the intent of \n     the Framers, and structural and functional considerations all \n     suggest that, to the extent that use of force against Iraq \n     would risk substantial casualties or large-scale hostilities \n     over a prolonged duration, prior congressional approval would \n     be required.\n       I now turn to a closer examination of each of the three \n     sources from which authorization to use force could in \n     principle derive: a treaty, a statute, or the Constitution.\n\n[[Page S10283]]\n\n     A. Authorization by treaty\n       No treaty currently in force gives the President authority \n     to use force. Indeed, the United States has never been a \n     party to any treaty that purported to give the President \n     authority to use force. The constitutionality of any such \n     treaty would be doubtful in that it would necessarily divest \n     the House of Representatives of its share of the \n     congressional war power. (For this reason, all of the United \n     States' mutual security treaties have made clear that they do \n     not affect the domestic allocation of power.) Moreover, war-\n     making authority conferred by any such treaty would be cut \n     off unless it met the requirements of section 8(a)(2) of the \n     War Powers Resolution. Section 8(a)(2) requires, in effect, \n     that any treaty authorizing the use of force meet two \n     conditions. The first condition is that any such treaty must \n     ``be implemented by legislation specifically authorizing'' \n     the introduction of the armed forces into hostilities or \n     likely hostilities. This condition is not met because no \n     treaty is so implemented. The second condition is that any \n     such implementing legislation must state that it is \n     ``intended to constitute specific statutory authorization'' \n     within the meaning of the War Powers Resolution. Again, since \n     no implementing legislation is in effect, the second \n     condition is also not met. Thus it must be concluded that, if \n     further authority to use force is required, the President \n     cannot seek that authority from any treaty.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n     B. Authorization by statute\n       The second source to which the President might turn for \n     authority to use force is statutory law. I referred above to \n     the provision of the War Powers Resolution that limits \n     authority to use force that can be inferred from a treaty. A \n     companion provision limits such authority that can be \n     inferred from a statute. That provision is section 8(a)(1). \n     Section 8(a)(1) sets out two similar conditions that must be \n     met before authority to use armed force can be inferred from \n     a given statute. The first condition is that such a statute \n     must ``specifically authorize'' the introduction of the armed \n     forces into hostilities or likely hostilities. The second \n     condition is that such a statute must state ``that it is \n     intended to constitute specific statutory authorization \n     within the meaning of'' the War Powers Resolution. Unless \n     each condition is met, a given statute may not be relied upon \n     as a source of authority to use armed force. Arguments \n     challenging the validity of this provision are essentially \n     frivolous. (Archibald Cox testified that he was ``aghast'' at \n     the contention; I addressed the argument in an appendix to my \n     testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 17, \n     2002.)\n       The War Powers Resolution cannot itself be relied upon as \n     authorization to introduce the armed forces into hostilities \n     because it does not meet these two conditions and because it \n     explicitly provides that it confers no power on the President \n     to introduce the armed forces into hostilities that he would \n     not have had in its absence. Two statutes now in effect, \n     however, may meet these conditions. The first statute is H.J. \n     Res. 77 of January 14, 1991 (P.L. 102-1), the law authorizing \n     use of force against during the Gulf War. The second statute \n     is S.J. Res. 23, the law enacted by Congress and signed by \n     the President on September 18, 2001 (P.L. 107-40).\n       1. The Gulf War authorization\n       Congress's Gulf War resolution authorized the President to \n     use force against Iraq only to the extent that such use of \n     force had been authorized by the United Nations Security \n     Council. Section 2(a) of P.L. 102-1 provides that ``[t]he \n     President is authorized, pursuant to subsection (b), to use \n     the United States Armed Forces pursuant to United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 678 (1990) in order to achieve \n     implementation of Security Council Resolutions 660, 661, 662, \n     664, 665, 666, 667, 669, 670, 674, and 677.'' (Subsection (b) \n     required the President to determine, before using force, that \n     all appropriate diplomatic and other peaceful means had been \n     used.) Thus the Gulf War resolution would continue to \n     authorize use of force against Iraq if such use continues to \n     be authorized under resolution 678 of the Security Council. \n     If Resolution 678 does not continue to authorize the United \n     States to use force against Iraq, on the other hand, the Gulf \n     War resolution would not authorize the President to introduce \n     the armed forces into hostilities against Iraq, and further \n     congressional approval would be required. This would be true, \n     as indicated above, even if the Security Council adopts new \n     approval to use force against Iraq, since the existing \n     congressional authorization, the Gulf War resolution, refers \n     only to specific Security Council measures adopted at the \n     time of the Gulf War.\n       In considering this key issue, it is helpful to recall the \n     chain of events that led to the adoption of the relevant \n     congressional and Security Council resolutions:\n       On August 2, 1990, Iraq invaded and occupied the territory \n     of Kuwait.\n       On August 2, 1990, the Security Council adopted the first \n     of the eleven resolutions later set out in Congress's Gulf \n     War resolution, quoted above. This was Resolution 660, which \n     condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and called for an \n     immediate and unconditional withdrawal. All eleven Security \n     Council resolutions related to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait \n     and represented an effort gradually to tighten the screws \n     before authorizing use of force.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Among other things, those resolutions imposed economic \n     sanctions on Iraq (661), found that the Iraqi annexation of \n     Kuwait was null and void and demanded that Iraq rescind its \n     annexation (662), demanded that Iraq permit the departure of \n     third-country nationals and ensure their safety (664), \n     authorized member states to halt maritime shipping to Iraq so \n     as to inspect cargoes incident to the economic embargo (665), \n     took steps to ensure a supply of foodstuffs to alleviate \n     human suffering in Iraq (666), demanded the release of \n     diplomatic personnel seized by Iraq in Kuwait (667), \n     established a consultative mechanism to deal with special \n     economic problems arising from the economic sanctions (669), \n     extended limitations on aircraft destined to land in Iraq or \n     Kuwait (670), demanded that Iraq cease and desist from taking \n     third-country nationals hostage or otherwise mistreating them \n     or Kuwaiti nationals (674), and condemned the Iraqi \n     destruction of civil records maintained by the government of \n     Kuwait (677).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       On November 29, 1990, the UN Security Council adopted \n     Resolution 678 which, among other things, authorized ``all \n     member States to uphold and implement Resolution 660 (1990) \n     and all subsequent relevant resolutions and to restore \n     international peace and security in the region.'' The \n     Resolution provided that this authority could not be \n     exercised, however, if Iraq ``on or before January 15, 1991, \n     fully implements . . . the above-mentioned resolutions. . .'' \n     (The ``above mentioned resolutions'' were the same eleven \n     measures.)\n       On January 14, 1991, Congress adopted the Gulf War \n     resolution.\n       On January 17, 1991, the United States commenced air \n     attacks against Iraq.\n       On February 24, 1991, the United States commenced the \n     ground attack.\n       On February 27, 1991, Iraq in a letter to the President of \n     the Security Council, promised to comply with the twelve \n     Security Council resolutions.\n       On February 28, a cease-fire was declared.\n       On March 2, 1991, the Security Council adopted Resolution \n     686, noting the cease-fire, noting Iraq's promise to comply \n     with the the Council's twelve resolutions, demanding that \n     Iraq do so, and demanding that Iraq meet additional \n     conditions spelled out in paragraphs (2) and (3). \n     Significantly, Resolution 686 further provided that, ``during \n     the period required for Iraq to comply with paragraphs 2 and \n     3 above, the provisions of paragraph 2 of resolution 678 \n     (1990) remain valid. . . .''\n       On April 3, 1991, the Security Council adopted Resolution \n     687 which demanded that Iraq destroy all weapons of mass \n     destruction and set up a comprehensive on-site inspection \n     regime under the aegis of the UN Special Commission on Iraq \n     (UNSCOM). The Resolution also declared that ``upon official \n     notification by Iraq to the Secretary-General and to the \n     Security Council of its acceptance of the provisions above a \n     formal cease-fire is effective between Iraq and Kuwait and \n     the Member States cooperating with Kuwait in accordance with \n     resolution 678 (1990).''\n       On April 6, 1991 in a letter from its Iraqi Minister of \n     Foreign Affairs, Iraq notified the President of the Security \n     Council and the Secretary-General that it accepted the \n     provisions of the Resolution 687.\n       In light of this background, can Resolution 678 reasonably \n     be construed to continue to authorize use of force by the \n     United States against Iraq? While reasonable arguments can be \n     made on both sides,\\2\\ the more persuasive argument appears \n     to be that it does not, for these reasons:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ Most commentators have rejected the argument that \n     authority to use force continues to flow from Resolution 678. \n     See, e.g., Gray, After the Cease-Fire: Iraq, the Security \n     Council and the Use of Force, 65 British Yearbook of \n     International Law 135 (1994); Krisch, Unilateral Enforcement \n     of the Collective Will: Kosovo, Iraq, and the Security \n     Council, 3 Max Planck United Nations.

But see Wedgewood, The \n     Enforcement of Security Council Resolution 687: The Threat of \n     Force against Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction, 92 American \n     Journal of International Law 724 (1998).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       (a) The authority conferred by Resolution 678 was narrowly \n     circumscribed and was directed at reversing the Iraqi \n     invasion of Kuwait. Resolution 678 conferred authority to use \n     armed force for three different purposes. (i) The first \n     purpose was to uphold and implement resolution 660. \n     Resolution 660, however, simply called upon Iraq to withdraw \n     from Kuwait that goal has been achieved. (ii) The second \n     purpose was to uphold and implement ``all subsequent relevant \n     resolutions'' The phrase could conceivably be construed as \n     referring to any resolution adopted after the date on which \n     Resolution 660 was adopted, August 2, 1990. Read in context, \n     however, it seems more likely that the phrase refers to the \n     nine ``foregoing resolutions'' that were recalled and \n     reaffirmed in the first prefatory clause of Resolution 678. \n     Those resolutions were ``subsequent to'' Resolution 660 but \n     of course all preceded Resolution 678. ``All subsequent \n     resolutions,'' it might further be argued, could hardly be \n     taken as referring to any resolution ever adopted on any \n     future date by the Security Council. Such a construction \n     would have had the effect, internationally, divesting the \n     Security Council of any future role in deciding whether to \n     authorize use of force against Iraq--even though paragraph 5 \n     of Resolution 678 explicitly affirms the intent of the \n     Security Council ``to remain seized of the matter.'' \n     Domestically, given the incorporation by reference of the \n     phrase in Congress's Gulf War resolution, such as \n     interpretation would\n\n[[Page S10284]]\n\n     have effected a massive delegation of the congressional war \n     power to the Security Council--a delegation that would crate \n     profound constitutional problems. These difficulties are \n     avoided by giving the phrase ``all subsequent relevant \n     resolutions'' the meaning that it seems plainly intended to \n     have had, namely, as referring to resolutions subsequently to \n     Resolution 660 but adopted before Resolution 678. (iii) The \n     third purpose for which Resolution 678 authorized use of \n     force was to restore international peace and security in the \n     region. A broad interpretation of that grant of authority \n     would view it as permitting use of force against Iraq by any \n     state at any point in the future when that state concluded \n     that Iraq had disrupted that region's peace and security. The \n     authority to restore peace and security was, however, like \n     other provisions of Resolution 678 authorizing use of force \n     against Iraq, tied to and precipitated by the Iraqi invasion \n     of Kuwait. Each of the twelve Security Council resolutions \n     cited in Congress's Gulf War Resolution relates directly to \n     that invasion. Resolution 687, declaring a ``formal cease-\n     fire,'' appears to have represented a de facto finding by the \n     Security Council that peace and security had been restored. \n     It seems unlikely that the Security Council, in adopting \n     Resolution 678, intended to declare Iraq a free-fire zone \n     into the indefinite future.\n       (b) The authority to use force conferred in Resolution 678 \n     was most likely extinguished April 6, 1991, the date the \n     Iraqis notified the United Nations of their acceptance of the \n     pertinent provisions of Resolution 687. Under that \n     Resolution, ``a formal cease-fire'' took effect upon such \n     notification. The legal obligations that flow from a formal \n     cease-fire are incompatible with the legal rights that flow \n     from authorization to use force. The Security Council did \n     ``reaffirm'' Resolution 678 in Resolution 949, adopted \n     October 15, 1994, and also in Resolution 1137, adopted \n     November 12, 1997. However, this was done only in prefatory \n     clauses; neither Resolution 949 nor Resolution 1137 re-\n     authorizes the use of force against Iraq. No resolution has \n     done so. The Security Council has never declared that either \n     the cease-fire or Resolution 687 is no longer in effect.\n       (c) The authority to use force conferred in Resolution 678, \n     once extinguished did not revive when Iraq failed to comply \n     with its obligations under Resolution 687. Resolution 687 \n     makes clear that the termination of that authority was \n     conditioned upon Iraq's notification of acceptance of the \n     pertinent provisions of Resolutions 687, not upon Iraq's \n     compliance with those provisions. In this regard it is \n     instructive to compare the terms of Resolution 687 with \n     the terms of its predecessor resolution, Resolution 686. \n     Resolution 686 implemented a provisional cease-fire \n     following the suspension of hostilities between Iraq and \n     the coalition forces. As noted above, Resolution 686 \n     provides that compliance, not acceptance, by Iraq was \n     required with respect to two paragraphs of Resolution 686 \n     to bring about the termination of authority to use force. \n     (It is agreed that Iraq has complied with those two \n     paragraphs.) In contrast, Resolution 687 provides that \n     acceptance, not compliance, was all that was required to \n     terminate authority to use force. Had the Security Council \n     intended to cause that authority to revive upon Iraqi non-\n     compliance, the Council presumably would have used the \n     same words, or similar words, that it used in the \n     preceding resolution to bring about that result. But it \n     did not. There is no indication in the terms of Resolution \n     687 or any other Security Council resolution that the \n     Council intended that Iraqi non-compliance would trigger a \n     revival of authority to use force.\n       (d) A decision to revive Resolution 678 must be made by the \n     Security Council and cannot be made by an individual member \n     state. As suggested by the interactive context in which the \n     Gulf War was ended, the transaction that brought hostilities \n     to a close was in the nature of an agreement. Its terms were \n     set forth in Resolution 686 and 687. Those terms were agreed \n     to and approved by Iraq and the U.N. Security Council, not by \n     Iraq and individual member states of the Security Council, \n     and not by Iraq and individual member states of the Gulf War \n     coalition. An earlier, informal, battlefield cease-fire was \n     instituted by coalition forces. But the coalition owed its \n     presence to authority conferred by the Security Council, and \n     the informal cease-fire was superseded by the formal \n     termination of hostilities set out by the Security Council in \n     Resolution 687. The parties to that formal undertaking were \n     Iraq and the U.N. Security Council. With rare exceptions that \n     are not applicable here, under long-settled principles of \n     international law rights flowing from the material breach of \n     an agreement run to the aggrieved party of the agreement; a \n     state has no right to complain of the breach of an agreement \n     to which it is not a party. One of the rights that flows from \n     the power to complain of the material breach of an agreement \n     is the option to terminate or suspend the agreement in whole \n     or in part. In Resolution 687 the Security Council apparently \n     intended to retain that right: paragraph 34 of Resolution 687 \n     provides that the Council, not individual states, ``shall \n     take such further steps as may be required for the \n     implementation of the present resolution and to secure peace \n     and security in the region.'' Thus it would be up to the \n     Council as a body to decide what action to take in response \n     to a breach. Individual states such as the United States have \n     no right to terminate or suspend those provisions of \n     Resolution 687 that caused the authorities granted in \n     Resolution 678 to be extinguished upon the notification of \n     Iraqi acceptance. The option to terminate or suspend those \n     provisions resides exclusively in the author of Resolution \n     678 and party to the agreement with Iraq: the Security \n     Council, not individual member states.\n       (e) It would be inappropriate to infer implicit Security \n     Council intent to revive Resolution 678 from acquiescence by \n     the Council to subsequent military strikes against Iraq that \n     were not expressly authorized. It can be argued that a \n     consistent pattern of acquiescent practice would constitute \n     evidence of the authoritative interpretation of the \n     Resolution. However, the right of veto that inheres in the \n     Council's five permanent members renders this argument \n     unconvincing in these circumstances. All five members have \n     not remained silent during each of the subsequent strikes \n     against Iraq; several have on occasion objected. Following \n     the 1998 air strikes on Iraq, for example, the President of \n     the Russian Federation declared that ``[t]he U.N. Security \n     Council resolutions on Iraq do not provide any grounds for \n     such actions. By the use of force, the U.S. and Great Britain \n     have flagrantly violated the U.N. Charter and universally \n     accepted principles of international law.'' \\3\\ The Chinese \n     also objected.\\4\\ When Resolution 1154 was adopted, warning \n     that continued violations of Iraq's obligations to permit \n     unconditional access to UNSCOM ``would have the severest \n     consequences,'' the French representative to the Security \n     Council stated that the resolution was designed ``to \n     underscore the prerogatives of the Security Council in a way \n     that excludes any question of automaticity. . . . It is the \n     Security Council that must evaluate the behavior of a \n     country, if necessary to determine any possible violations, \n     and to take the appropriate decisions.'' \\5\\ Even if all five \n     permanent members of the Security Council had remained \n     silent, silence under such circumstances does not necessarily \n     signify consent or approval. Silence may simply indicate a \n     belief that objection is futile. Moreover, if formal \n     objection were now legally required, this argument would in \n     effect establish a new procedure under which each of those \n     five members would be required to take the affirmative step \n     of voicing objection to acts not authorized by the Council \n     that they did not wish to be seen as approving. The U.N. \n     Charter itself places no such obligation on the permanent \n     five members of the Council; to prevent the Council from \n     acting, each is required to voice objection only to a formal \n     proposal made by a member of the Council within the Council's \n     proceedings, not to the external conduct of third states. In \n     any event, even if it were appropriate to infer the Council's \n     approval to attack Iraq from its acquiescence to other \n     attacks on Iraq, there would be no reason to assume that the \n     Council, in its acquiescence, intended to revive Resolution \n     678 rather than to create new, implicit authority. New, \n     implicit Security Council authority would not constitute \n     authorization under Congress's Gulf War Resolution to \n     introduce the armed forces into hostilities against Iraq. As \n     noted above the Gulf War Resolution permits such use of force \n     only if it is permitted by Resolution 678. New Security \n     Council authorization, whether given explicitly in the form \n     of a new resolution or implicitly in the form of \n     acquiescence, would not satisfy the terms of the Gulf War \n     Resolution and could not, under U.S. domestic law, authorize \n     the President to introduce the armed forces into hostilities.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\3\\ Statement of the President of the Russian Federation, \n     press release of the Mission of the Russian Federation to the \n     U.N., Dec. 20, 1998.\n     \\4\\ Press release of the Foreign Ministry of China, Dec. 17, \n     1998 (``The unilateral use of force . . . without the \n     authorization of the Security Council runs counter to the \n     U.N.

As discussed \n     above, section 8(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution \n     requires that Congress ``specifically authorize'' the \n     introduction of the armed forces into hostilities if its \n     enactment is to suffice as statutory approval. The War \n     Powers Resolution, in other words, requires that doubts \n     flowing from ambiguous or unclear measures be resolved \n     against finding authority to use force. Because serious \n     doubt exists whether Security Council Resolution 678 \n     confers continuing authority on the United States to use \n     force against Iraq,\\6\\ the Gulf War Resolution, which \n     incorporates Security Council Resolution 678 by reference, \n     cannot be said to constitute specific statutory \n     authorization within the meaning of the War Powers \n     Resolution to introduce the armed forces into hostilities \n     against Iraq.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\6\\ Because your letter requests my views concerning the \n     application of U.S. domestic law, I do not here discuss \n     whether international law would permit use of force against \n     Iraq absent Security Council approval.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       For these reasons, I conclude that the Gulf War \n     authorization is most reasonably construed as conferring no \n     such authority.\n       2. S.J. Res. 23\n       The second statute that meets these conditions is the law \n     enacted by Congress and signed by the President on September \n     18, 2002, P.L. 107-40, also known as Senate Joint Resolution \n     23 or S.J. Res. 23.\n       The statute contains five whereas clauses. Under \n     traditional principles of statutory\n\n[[Page S10285]]\n\n     construction these provisions have no binding legal effect. \n     Only material that comes after the so-called ``resolving \n     clause''--Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled''--can \n     have any operative effect. Material set out in a whereas \n     clause is purely precatory. Such material may be relevant for \n     the purpose of clarifying ambiguities in a statute's legally \n     operative terms, but in and of itself such a provision can \n     confer no legal right or obligation.\n       To determine the breadth of authority conferred upon the \n     President by this statute, therefore, it is necessary to \n     examine the legally operative provisions, which are set forth \n     in section 2(a) thereof. That section provides as follows: \n     ``In General.--That the President is authorized to use all \n     necessary and appropriate force against those nations, \n     organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, \n     committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on \n     September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or \n     persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international \n     terrorism against the United States by such nations, \n     organizations or persons.'' The central conclusion that \n     emerges from these words (which represent the only \n     substantive provision of this statute) is that all authority \n     that the statute confers is tightly linked to the events of \n     September 11. The statute confers no authority unrelated to \n     those events. The statue authorizes the President to act only \n     against entities that planned, authorized committed, or aided \n     the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11. 2002. No \n     authority is provided to act against entities that were not \n     involved in those attacks. The closing reference limits \n     rather than expands the authority granted, by specifying the \n     purpose for which that authority must be exercised--``to \n     prevent any future acts of international terrorism against \n     the United States. . . .'' No authority is conferred to act \n     for any other purpose or to act against ``nations, \n     organizations or persons'' generally. Action is permitted \n     only against ``such'' nations, organizations or persons, to \n     wit, those involved in the September 11 attacks.\n       The statute thus cannot serve as a source of authority to \n     use force in prosecuting the war on terrorism against \n     entities other than those involved in the September 11 \n     attacks. To justify use of force under this statute, some \n     nexus must be established between the entity against which \n     action is taken and the September 11 attacks.\n       The requirement of nexus between the September 11 attacks \n     and the target of any force is reinforced by the statute's \n     legislative history. Unfortunately, because of the truncated \n     procedure by which the statute was enacted, no official \n     legislative history can be compiled that might detail what \n     changes were made in the statute and why. It has been \n     reported unofficially however, that the Administration \n     initially sought the enactment legislation which would have \n     set out broad authority to act against targets not linked to \n     the September 11 attacks. The statute proposed by the \n     Administration reportedly would have provided independent \n     authority for the President to ``deter and preempt any future \n     acts of terrorism or aggression against the United States.'' \n     \\7\\ Members of Congress from both parties, however, \n     reportedly objected to this provision.\\8\\ The provision was \n     therefore dropped from the operative part of the statute and \n     added as a final whereas clause, where it remained upon \n     enactment. You outlined this history in your remarks on the \n     Senate floor on October 1, 2001 (Cong. Rec., daily ed., Oct. \n     1, 2001 at S9949).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\7\\ Helen Dewar & Juliet Eilperin, Emergency Funding Deal \n     Reached; Hill Leaders Agree to Work Out Language on Use of \n     Force, Wash.

Res. 23. Only one \n     possible source remains: the United States Constitution. If \n     use of force by the President is authorized by the \n     Constitution, no authority is needed from any treaty or \n     statute.\n     C. Constitutional authorization\n       A starting point in considering the scope of the \n     President's independent constitutional powers is to note a \n     proposition on which commentators from all points on the \n     spectrum have agreed: that the President was possessed of \n     independent constitutional power to use force in response to \n     the September 11 attacks upon the United States. As was \n     widely observed at the time, the War Powers Resolution itself \n     supports this conclusion. Its statement of congressional \n     opinion concerning the breadth of independent presidential \n     power under the Constitution (section 2(c)(3)) recognizes the \n     President's power to use force without statutory \n     authorization in the event of ``a national emergency created \n     by attack upon the United States, its territories or \n     possessions, or its armed forces.'' Thus, U.S. military \n     operations in Afghanistan could have been carried out \n     under the President's constitutional authority, even if \n     S.J. Res. 23 had never been enacted. This conclusion has \n     important implications for the question you have posed. If \n     it turns out that Iraq is linked to the September 11 \n     attacks, S.J. Res. 23 will continue to suffice, along with \n     the President's constitutional authority, to provide all \n     necessary authorization.\n       A more difficult question arises if Iraq was not connected \n     with the September 11 attacks. In the last 30 years, Congress \n     has on two occasions expressed its opinion concerning the \n     scope of the President's power to use armed force without \n     prior congressional approval the issue. One statement of \n     opinion, as I mentioned, is set forth in section 2(c)(3) of \n     the War Powers Resolution. I've also alluded to the other \n     statement: the final whereas clause in S.J. Res. 23. That \n     whereas clause expresses the opinion of Congress that ``the \n     president has authority under the Constitution to take action \n     to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against \n     the United States.'' Obviously, these two statements are \n     inconsistent. The scope of presidential power to wage war \n     that was recognized by Congress in the War Powers Resolution \n     is much narrower than that recognized in S.J. Res. 23. If the \n     President only has power to act alone in ``a national \n     emergency created by attack upon the United States, its \n     territories or possessions, or its armed forces,'' then he \n     obviously is without power to ``to take action to deter and \n     prevent acts of international terrorism against the United \n     States'' where no attack upon the United States has occurred. \n     Which statement is correct?\n       In my view, neither. The statement in the War Powers \n     Resolution is overly narrow, and the statement in S.J. Res. \n     23 is overly broad. The original, Senate-passed version of \n     the War Powers Resolution contained wording, which was \n     dropped in conference, that came close to capturing \n     accurately the scope of the President's independent \n     constitutional power. It provided--in legally binding, not \n     precatory, terms--that the President may use force ``to repel \n     an armed attack upon the United States, its territories or \n     possessions; to take necessary and appropriate retaliatory \n     actions in the event of such an attack; and to forestall the \n     direct and imminent threat of such an attack.'' This formula, \n     unlike the hastily-crafted words of the S.J. Res. 23 whereas \n     clause, was drafted over a period of years, with numerous \n     hearings and advice from the top constitutional scholars in \n     the country. It was supported by Senators Fulbright, \n     Symington, Mansfield, Church, Cooper, Eagleton, Muskie, \n     Stennis, Aiken, Javits, Case, Percy, Hatfield, Mathias, Scott \n     and yourself--not an inconsequential group. They agreed upon \n     a simple premise: that the war power is shared between \n     Congress and the President.\n       This is the premise that animates all efforts by members of \n     Congress who seek to have the Executive meet authorization \n     and consultation requirements. This is the premise that is, \n     for all practical intents and purposes, rejected by \n     proponents of sole executive power.\n       The premise flows from each source of constitutional power:\n        The constitutional text. Textual grants of war power to \n     the President are paltry in relation to grants of that power \n     to the Congress. The president is denominated ``commander-in-\n     chief.'' In contrast, Congress is given power to ``declare \n     war,'' to lay and collect taxes ``to provide for a common \n     defense,'' to ``raise and support armies,'' to ``provide and \n     maintain a navy,'' to ``provide for calling forth the militia \n     to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and \n     repel invasions,'' to provide for organizing, arming, and \n     disciplining, the militia,'' and to `'make all laws necessary \n     and proper for carrying into execution...all...powers vested \n     by this Constitution in the Government of the United \n     States.''\n       The case law. Support for the Executive derives primarily \n     from unrelated dicta pulled acontextually from inapposite \n     cases, such as United States v. Curtiss-Wright (1936). The \n     actual record is striking: Congress has never lost a war \n     powers dispute with the President before the Supreme Court. \n     While the cases are few, in every instance where the issue of \n     decision-making primacy has arisen--from Little v. Barreme \n     (1804) to the Steel Seizure Case (1952)--the Court has sided \n     with Congress.\n       Custom. It is true that Presidents have used armed force \n     abroad over 200 times throughout U.S. history. It is also \n     true that practice can affect the Constitution's meaning and \n     allocation of power. The President's power to recognize \n     foreign governments, for example, like the Senate's power to \n     condition its consent to treaties, derives largely from \n     unquestioned practice tracing to the earliest days of the \n     republic. But not all practice is of constitutional moment. A \n     practice of constitutional dimension must be regarded by both \n     political branches as a juridical norm, the incidents \n     comprising the practice must be accepted, or at least \n     acquiesced in, by the other branch. In many of the precedents \n     cited, Congress objected. Furthermore, the precedents must be \n     on point. Here, many are not. Nearly all involved fights with \n     pirates, clashes with cattle rustlers, trivial naval \n     engagements and other minor uses of force not directed at \n     significant adversaries, or risking substantial casualties or \n     large-scale hostilities over a prolonged duration. In a \n     number of the ``precedents,'' Congress actually approved of \n     the executive's action by enacting authorizing legislation \n     (as with the Barbary Wars).\n       Structure and function. If any useful principle derives \n     from structural and functional considerations, it is that the \n     Constitution gives the Executive primacy in emergency war \n     powers crises, where Congress has no time to act, and that in \n     non-emergency situations--circumstances where deliberative\n\n[[Page S10286]]\n\n     legislative functions have time to play out--congressional \n     approval is required.\n       Intent of the Framers. Individual quotations can be, and \n     regularly are, drawn out of context and assumed to represent \n     a factitious collective intent. It is difficult to read the \n     primary sources, however, without drawing the same conclusion \n     drawn by Abraham Lincoln. He said: ``The provision of the \n     Constitution giving the war-making power to Congress, was \n     dictated, as I understand it, by the following reasons. Kings \n     had always been involving and impoverishing their people in \n     wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of \n     the people was the object. This our convention understood to \n     be the most oppressive of all kingly oppressions; and they \n     resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should \n     hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us.'' \n     Chief Justice William Rehnquist, quoting Justice Robert \n     Jackson in Dames & Moore v. Regan (1981), shared Lincoln's \n     belief that the Framers' rejected the English model. He \n     said: ``The example of such unlimited executive power that \n     must have most impressed the forefathers was the \n     prerogative exercised by George III, and the description \n     of its evils in the Declaration of Independence leads me \n     to doubt that they were creating their new Executive in \n     his image.''\n       Notwithstanding the plain import of these sources of \n     constitutional power, some argue that the only role for \n     Congress occurs after the fact--in cutting off funds if the \n     president commences a war that Congress does not support. Two \n     problems inhere in this theory. First, it reads the \n     declaration-of-war clause out of the Constitution as a \n     separate and independent check on presidential power. The \n     Framers intended to give Congress control over waging war \n     before the decision to go to war is made. Giving Congress a \n     role only after the fact, however, would make its power to \n     declare war nothing but a mere congressional trumpet to \n     herald a decision made elsewhere.\n       Second, the theory flies in the face of the Framers' \n     manifest intention to make it more difficult to get into war \n     than out of it. This approach would do the opposite. If the \n     only congressional option is to wait for the president to \n     begin a war that Congress does not wish the nation to fight \n     and then cut off funds, war can be instituted routinely with \n     no congressional approval--and seldom if ever ended quickly. \n     The practical method of cutting off funds is to attach a \n     rider to the Department of Defense authorization or \n     appropriation legislation. This means, necessarily, passing \n     the legislation by a two-thirds vote so as to overcome the \n     inevitable presidential veto. The alternative is for Congress \n     to withhold funding altogether--and be blamed by the \n     president for closing down not merely the Pentagon but \n     perhaps the entire federal government. The short of it is, \n     therefore, that to view the congressional appropriations \n     power as the only constitutional check on presidential war \n     power is for all practical purposes to eliminate the \n     declaration-of-war clause as a constitutional restraint on \n     the president.\n       For reasons such as these, the Office of Legal Counsel of \n     the Justice Department concluded in 1980 that the core \n     provision of the War Powers Resolution--the 60-day time \n     limit--is constitutional. It said: ``We believe that Congress \n     may, as a general constitutional matter, place a 60-day limit \n     on the use of our armed forces as required by the provisions \n     of [section 5(b)] of the Resolution. The Resolution gives the \n     President the flexibility to extend that deadline for up to \n     30 days in cases of ``unavoidable military necessity.'' This \n     flexibility is, we believe, sufficient under any scenarios we \n     can hypothesize to preserve his function as Commander-in-\n     Chief. The practical effect of the 60-day limit is to shift \n     the burden to the President to convince the Congress of the \n     continuing need for the use of our armed forces abroad. We \n     cannot say that placing that burden on the President \n     unconstitutionally intrudes upon his executive powers.\n       ``We believe that Congress may, as a general constitutional \n     matter, place a 60-day limit on the use of our armed forces \n     as required by the provisions of [section 5(b)] of the \n     Resolution. The Resolution gives the President the \n     flexibility to extend that deadline for up to 30 days in \n     cases of ``unavoidable military necessity.''

We \n     cannot say that placing that burden on the President \n     unconstitutionally intrudes upon his executive powers.\n       ``Finally, Congress can regulate the President's exercise \n     of his inherent powers by imposing limits by statute.'' \\9\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\9\\ Presidential Power to Use the Armed Forces Abroad without \n     Statutory Authorization, 4A, Op.

The President, \n     executive branch lawyers maintained, was constitutionally \n     empowered to place the United States at war against Iraq \n     without congressional approval. A number of Members of \n     Congress brought an action seeking an injunction to prevent \n     him from initiating an offensive attack against Iraq without \n     first securing a declaration of war or some other explicit \n     congressional authorization. The action was dismissed by a \n     federal district court as not yet ripe for review. In the \n     course of doing so, however, the court made the following \n     pithy but important observation, which seems directly \n     pertinent to events unfolding today: ``If the Executive had \n     the sole power to determine that any particular offensive \n     military operation, no matter how vast, does not constitute \n     war-making but only an offensive military attack, the \n     congressional power to declare war will be at the mercy of a \n     semantic decision by the Executive. Such an \n     ``interpretation'' would evade the plain language of the \n     constitution, and it cannot stand: \\10\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\10\\ Dellums v.

Yes, I would be happy to.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Before the Senator concludes this evening, I wanted to \nthank him, as a new Member to this body, for his incredible commitment \nto our Constitution, our country, and our people. It has been an \ninspirational time for me to watch the Senator from West Virginia on \nthe floor, listen to his arguments, and see his dedication. I have been \nproud to stand with him in opposing this resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a New York Times op-ed written today by \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia be printed in the Record. \nIt is an excellent summary of the concerns that many of us have in \nrushing into this war, and I want to thank the Senator for that. I \nthink it is important this be in the Record of the Senate as a part of \nthis debate today.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 10, 2002]\n\n                  Congress Must Resist the Rush to War\n\n                          (By Robert C. Byrd)\n\n       A sudden appetite for war with Iraq seems to have consumed \n     the Bush administration and Congress. The debate that began \n     in the Senate last week is centered not on the fundamental \n     and monumental questions of whether and why the United States \n     should go to war with Iraq, but rather on the mechanics of \n     how best to wordsmith the president's use-of-force resolution \n     in order to give him virtually unchecked authority to commit \n     the nation's military to an unprovoked attack on a sovereign \n     nation.\n       How have we gotten to this low point in the history of \n     Congress? Are we too feeble to resist the demands of a \n     president who is determined to bend the collective will of \n     Congress to his will--a president who is changing the \n     conventional understanding of the term ``self-defense''? And \n     why are we allowing the executive to rush our decision-making \n     right before an election? Congress, under pressure from the \n     executive branch, should not hand away its Constitutional \n     powers. We should not hamstring future Congresses by casting \n     such a shortsighted vote. We owe our country a due \n     deliberation.\n       I have listened closely to the president. I have questioned \n     the members of his war cabinet. I have searched for that \n     single piece of evidence that would convince me that the \n     president must have in his hands, before the month is out, \n     open-ended Congressional authorization to deliver an \n     unprovoked attack on Iraq. I remain unconvinced. The \n     president's case for an unprovoked attack is circumstantial \n     at best. Saddam Hussein is a threat, but the threat is not so \n     great that we must be stampeded to provide such authority to \n     this president just weeks before an election.\n       Why are we being hounded into action on a resolution that \n     turns over to President Bush the Congress's Constitutional \n     power to declare war? This resolution would authorize the \n     president to use the military forces of this nation wherever, \n     whenever and however he determines, and for as long as he \n     determines, if he can somehow make a connection to Iraq. It \n     is a blank check for the president to take whatever action he \n     feels ``is necessary and appropriate in order to defend the \n     national security of the United States against the continuing \n     threat posed by Iraq.'' This broad resolution underwrites, \n     promotes and endorses the unprecedented Bush doctrine of \n     preventive war and pre-emptive strikes--detailed in a recent \n     publication, ``National Security Strategy of the United \n     States''--against any nation that the president, and the \n     president alone, determines to be a threat.\n       We are at the graves of moments. Members of Congress must \n     not simply walk away from their Constitutional \n     responsibilities. We are the directly elected representatives \n     of the American people, and the American people expect us to \n     carry out our duty, not simply hand it off to this or any \n     other president. To do so would be to fail the people we \n     represent and to fall woefully short of our sworn oath to \n     support and defend the Constitution.\n\n[[Page S10287]]\n\n       We may not always be able to avoid war, particularly if it \n     is thrust upon us, but Congress must not attempt to give away \n     the authority to determine when war is to be declared We \n     must not allow any president to unleash the dogs of war at \n     his own discretion and or an unlimited period of time.\n       Yet that is what we are being asked to do. The judgment of \n     history will not be kind to us if we take this step.\n       Members of Congress should take time out and go home to \n     listen to their constituents. We must not yield to this \n     absurd pressure to act now, 27 days before an election that \n     we will determine the entire membership of the House of \n     Representatives and that of a third of the Senate. Congress \n     should take the time to hear from the American people, to \n     answer their remaining questions, and to put the frenzy of \n     ballot-box politics behind us before we vote. We should hear \n     them well, because while it is Congress that casts the vote, \n     it is the American people who will pay for a war with the \n     lives of their sons and daughters.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let me first thank the Senator from \nMichigan, Debbie Stabenow, for her eloquence, for her steadfast \ndetermination to stand by the Constitution as she has shown so many \ndays, so many times in recent days. I thank her for being the Senator \nshe is, a Senator who is indebted to her people and stands every day \nsomewhere in this Senate complex working for the people she represents. \nI have received great inspiration from watching her. I serve on the \nBudget Committee with her and she is an outstanding voice for the \npeople who believe in the Constitution, who takes a stand and is so \neloquent, so articulate on behalf of that Constitution.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan from the bottom of my heart.\n  I am about to yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Michigan in \nexpressing my deep thanks to the Senator from West Virginia for his \nextraordinarily effective and powerful presentations in the course of \nthis debate. I was also planning to put this article in, as my \ncolleague has already done. It is a very powerful statement that \nappeared in this morning's New York Times entitled ``Congress Must \nResist the Rush to War.'' The Senator from West Virginia, as he always \ndoes, asks some very piercing questions and calls the Congress to its \nresponsibilities.\n\n  Let me quote a paragraph or two from the article:\n\n       This broad resolution underwrites, promotes and endorses \n     the unprecedented Bush doctrine of preventive war and pre-\n     emptive strikes--detailed in a recent publication, ``National \n     Security Strategy of the United States''--against any nation \n     that the president, and the president alone, determines to be \n     a threat.\n\n  Of course, the particular resolution that is before the Senate, as is \npointed out in this article, and I quote the Senator from West \nVirginia:\n\n       This resolution would authorize the president to use the \n     military forces of this nation wherever, whenever, and \n     however he determines, and for as long as he determines if he \n     can somehow make a connection to Iraq.\n\n  And there actually were other proposals to narrow that authority, but \nof course none of them carried.\n  Further quoting:\n\n       It is a blank check for the president to take whatever \n     action he feels ``is necessary and appropriate in order to \n     defend the national security of the United States against the \n     continuing threat posed by Iraq.''\n\n  I say to my colleague from West Virginia, it seems to me clear that \nupon approval of this resolution, as far as the Congress is concerned, \nwar has been declared against Iraq. Would the Senator agree with that \nobservation?\n  Mr. BYRD. I do, I do. And I say further to my dear friend that as \nsoon as this resolution is adopted and signed by the President of the \nUnited States, Congress is out of it. It is on the sidelines. We may \nwish we could say something. We may wish we could do something. But as \nfar as the human eye can see, we are out of it until such time as \nCongress asks to repeal this legislation or to put a limit on it \ninternally.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me ask my colleague this question: Suppose some \nunforeseen, extraordinary development should take place after this \nresolution is passed and sent down and signed by the President which \ntransforms perhaps the weapons of mass destruction situation. The \nPresident, though, could still move ahead and go to war, could he not?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. They would have been given the authority to do that; \nwould that be correct?\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely. We would have handed this over to the \nPresident--lock, stock, and barrel. Here it is.\n  Mr. SARBANES. When would the President have to decide whether he was \ngoing to use this authority? Let's assume with respect to passing it \nlater in the evening--although I will oppose it--assuming it is passed \nand the Congress authorizes the President to go to war, in effect, with \nIraq, is there a limit on the time period in which the President could \nthen use that power to launch war against Iraq?\n  Mr. BYRD. There is no limit.\n  I offered an amendment, and the distinguished Senator from Maryland \nsupported that amendment today, as the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota supported it, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, but we only got 31 votes. That \namendment was defeated.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That underscores what the distinguished Senator says in \nthis op-ed piece that appeared in this morning's New York Times. I \nquote:\n\n       We may not always be able to avoid war, particularly if it \n     is thrust upon us, but Congress must not attempt to give away \n     the authority to determine when war is to be declared. We \n     must not allow any president to unleash the dogs of war at \n     his own discretion and for an unlimited period of time.\n       Yet that is what we are being asked to do [in the \n     resolution before the Senate].\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This, of course, is a decision with far-sweeping \nconsequences, certainly as it deals with Iraq and all of its \nimplication. But the precedent is being established in terms of the \nfuture, it seems to me, and that constitutes a major erosion of the \nrole of the Congress with respect to the Nation going to war.\n  Mr. BYRD. It does. And it is easy enough, I suppose, to pass this \nresolution. But should we try to negate it, should we try to repeal it, \nshould we try to change the law, a President can veto any change that \nCongress might bring along later, any change it might enact, in order \nto overturn this law it is now about to adopt.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am glad the distinguished Senator made that point \nbecause that is the next item I wanted to go to. People could say: If \nthe circumstances changed and the Congress wants to pull it back, why \nnot come in, pass a law, and pull it back? But the fact is that a \nPresident who wanted to keep that authority and may well want to use \nit, as long as he could keep the support of one-third--not of each \nHouse of the Congress but only one-third of one House, either a third \nof the Senators, plus one, or a third of the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives--he could negate congressional action that tried to \npull back this war-making authority, could he not?\n  Mr. BYRD. The distinguished Senator from Maryland is absolutely \ncorrect. It only takes a majority of both Houses to pass this \nresolution, but it would take two-thirds in the future if the President \nshould attempt to veto a substitute piece of legislation by this \nCongress to abort what we are doing here today, to appeal it, to amend \nit. One-third plus one in either body could uphold the President's \nveto, and that legislation would not become law.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think that is a point we have not really touched on \nmuch in this debate, but I think it is an extremely important point.\n  What has happened--you pass this resolution, you make a major grant \nof war-making authority to the President, but then if subsequently you \ndecide it ought to be pulled back or ought not be exercised by the \nPresident, it is extraordinarily difficult to do that, so not only have \nyou given the President this broad power to begin with, but the way the \nsystem is constructed, he can hold on to that power, even if a majority \nof both Houses of the Congress which gave the power want to take it \nback. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator could not be more correct. The Senator is \nabsolutely correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is worth engaging in this discussion just to \nunderscore the sweep of authority that is being provided.\n  Again, I thank my colleague for his leadership on this issue and \nespecially commend him for what I thought was a very thoughtful and \npowerful article. I\n\n[[Page S10288]]\n\nencourage people across the country to read this article. It is a very \nsuccinct, analytical, and perceptive statement of the issues that are \nat stake.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland. He is a great Senator. I am proud of the years I have served \nwith him. We have gone through some interesting times here in the \nSenate. We stood beside one another, shoulder to shoulder, shoulder to \nshoulder in fighting for this Constitution on several occasions--the \nline-item veto, constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and on \nother occasions. I thank the people of Maryland for sending him and for \nkeeping him here.\n\n  I would say that the Republic will long live, as long as the people \nof America send Senators here like Paul Sarbanes.\n  I thank the people of Maryland, and I thank God for him.\n  Mr. President, I am about to yield the floor. I have been asked by \nthe distinguished Senator from New York to yield to her. How much time \ndo I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. JEFFORDS). The Senator has 42 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not intend to hold the floor much \nlonger. How much time will the Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, \nwish me to yield to her?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator, and I \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from New York just yield for a second to \nme?\n  Mr. BYRD. And I yield to the distinguished Senator whatever time he \nneeds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I point out the distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee has not had an opportunity to speak. In all due \nrespect, I would like to give the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee the respect he deserves.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator. I am delighted to wait in line, and I \nwill wait until after the Senator has finished.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-one minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from New York, Mrs. \nClinton, and I yield 20 minutes, leaving myself 1 minute, to the \nSenator from Delaware, Mr. Biden.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona for reminding me the \nSenator from Delaware had been waiting very patiently.\n  I thank all Senators.\n  Mr. BIDEN. No problem.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor his courtesy. By far beyond that, I thank him for his leadership \nand his eloquence and his passion and commitment to this body and to \nour Constitution. I join with the remarks by both the Senators from \nMichigan and Maryland, expressing our appreciation for the way in which \nhe has waged this battle on behalf of his convictions. It is a lesson \nto us all.\n  Today, Mr. President, we are asked whether to give the President of \nthe United States authority to use force in Iraq should diplomatic \nefforts fail to dismantle Saddam Hussein's chemical and biological \nweapons and his nuclear program.\n  I am honored to represent nearly 19 million New Yorkers, a thoughtful \ndemocracy of voices and opinions who make themselves heard on the great \nissues of our day, especially this one. Many have contacted my office \nabout this resolution, both in support of and in opposition to it. I am \ngrateful to all who have expressed an opinion.\n  I also greatly respect the differing opinions within this body. The \ndebate they engender will aid our search for a wise, effective policy. \nTherefore, on no account should dissent be discouraged or disparaged. \nIt is central to our freedom and to our progress, for on more than one \noccasion history has proven our great dissenters to be right.\n  I believe the facts that have brought us to this fateful vote are not \nin doubt. Saddam Hussein is a tyrant who has tortured and killed his \nown people, even his own family members, to maintain his iron grip on \npower. He used chemical weapons on Iraqi Kurds and on Iranians, killing \nover 20,000 people.\n  Unfortunately, during the 1980s, while he engaged in such horrific \nactivity, he enjoyed the support of the American Government because he \nhad oil and was seen as a counterweight to the Ayatollah Khomeini in \nIran.\n  In 1991, Saddam Hussein invaded and occupied Kuwait, losing the \nsupport of the United States. The first President Bush assembled a \nglobal coalition, including many Arab States, and threw Saddam out \nafter 43 days of bombing and hundreds of hours of ground operations. \nThe United States led the coalition, then withdrew, leaving the Kurds \nand the Shiites, who had risen against Saddam Hussein at our urging, to \nSaddam's revenge.\n  As a condition for ending the conflict, the United Nations imposed a \nnumber of requirements on Iraq, among them disarmament of all weapons \nof mass destruction, stocks used to make such weapons, and laboratories \nnecessary to do the work. Saddam Hussein agreed and an inspection \nsystem was set up to ensure compliance. Though he repeatedly lied, \ndelayed, and obstructed the inspectors' work, the inspectors found and \ndestroyed far more weapons of mass destruction capability than were \ndestroyed in the gulf war, including thousands of chemical weapons, \nlarge volumes of chemical and biological stocks, a number of missiles \nand warheads, a major lab equipped to produce anthrax and other \nbioweapons, as well as substantial nuclear facilities.\n  In 1998, Saddam Hussein pressured the United Nations to lift the \nsanctions by threatening to stop all cooperation with the inspectors. \nIn an attempt to resolve the situation, the U.N., unwisely in my view, \nagreed to put limits on inspections of designated sovereign sites, \nincluding the so-called Presidential palaces--which in reality were \nhuge compounds, well suited to hold weapons labs, stocks, and records \nwhich Saddam Hussein was required by U.N. resolution to turn over.\n  When Saddam blocked the inspection process, the inspectors left. As a \nresult, President Clinton, with the British and others, ordered an \nintensive 4-day air assault, Operation Desert Fox, on known and \nsuspected weapons of mass destruction sites and other military targets.\n\n  In 1998, the United States also changed its underlying policy toward \nIraq from containment to regime change and began to examine options to \neffect such a change, including support for Iraqi opposition leaders \nwithin the country and abroad. In the 4 years since the inspectors, \nintelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his \nchemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, \nand his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary \nto terrorists, including al-Qaida members, though there is apparently \nno evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, \n2001.\n  It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will \ncontinue to increase his capability to wage biological and chemical \nwarfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he \nsucceed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security \nlandscape of the Middle East which, as we know all too well, affects \nAmerican security.\n  This much is undisputed. The open questions are: What should we do \nabout it? How, when, and with whom?\n  Some people favor attacking Saddam Hussein now, with any allies we \ncan muster, in the belief that one more round of weapons inspections \nwould not produce the required disarmament and that deposing Saddam \nwould be a positive good for the Iraqi people and would create the \npossibility of a secular, democratic state in the Middle East, one \nwhich could, perhaps, move the entire region toward democratic reform.\n  This view has appeal to some because it would assure disarmament; \nbecause it would right old wrongs after our abandonment of the Shiites \nand Kurds in 1991 and our support for Saddam Hussein in the 1980s when \nhe was using chemical weapons and terrorizing his people; and because \nit could give the Iraqi people a chance to build a future in freedom.\n  However, this course is fraught with danger. We and our NATO allies \ndid not depose Mr. Milosevic, who was responsible for more than a \nquarter of million\n\n[[Page S10289]]\n\npeople being killed in the 1990s. Instead, by stopping his aggression \nin Bosnia and Kosovo, and keeping the tough sanctions, we created the \nconditions in which his own people threw him out and led to his being \nin the dock and being tried for war crimes as we speak.\n\n  If we were to attack Iraq now, alone or with few allies, it would set \na precedent that could come back to haunt us. In recent days, Russia \nhas talked of an invasion of Georgia to attack Chechen rebels. India \nhas mentioned the possibility of a preemptive strike on Pakistan. What \nif China should perceive a threat from Taiwan?\n  So, for all its appeal, a unilateral attack, while it cannot be ruled \nout, is not a good option.\n  Others argue that we should work through the United Nations and \nshould only resort to force if and when the United Nations Security \nCouncil approves it. This too has great appeal for different reasons. \nThe United Nations deserves our support. Whenever possible we should \nwork through it and strengthen it, for it enables the world to share \nthe risks and burdens of global security and when it acts, it confers a \nlegitimacy that increases the likelihood of long-term success. The \nUnited Nations can lead the world into a new era of global cooperation. \nAnd the United States should support that goal.\n  But there are problems with this approach as well. The United Nations \nis an organization that is still growing and maturing. It often lacks \nthe cohesion to enforce its own mandates. And when Security Council \nmembers use the veto on occasion for reasons of narrow national \ninterest, it cannot act. In Kosovo, the Russians did not approve the \nNATO military action because of political, ethnic, and religious ties \nto the Serbs.\n  The United States, therefore, could not obtain a Security Council \nresolution in favor of the action necessary to stop the dislocation and \nethnic cleansing of more than a million Kosovar Albanians. However, \nmost of the world was with us because there was a genuine emergency \nwith thousands dead and a million more driven from their homes. As soon \nas the American-led conflict was over, Russia joined the peacekeeping \neffort that is still underway.\n  In the case of Iraq, recent comments indicate that one or two \nSecurity Council members might never approve forces against Saddam \nHussein until he has actually used chemical, biological, or God forbid, \nnuclear weapons.\n  So, the question is how do we do our best to both diffuse the threat \nSaddam Hussein poses to his people, the region, including Israel, and \nthe United States, and at the same time, work to maximize our \ninternational support and strengthen the United Nations.\n  While there is no perfect approach to this thorny dilemma, and while \npeople of good faith and high intelligence can reach diametrically \nopposing conclusions, I believe the best course is to go to the United \nNations for a strong resolution that scraps the 1998 restrictions on \ninspections and calls for complete, unlimited inspections, with \ncooperation expected and demanded from Iraq.\n  I know the administration wants more, including an explicit \nauthorization to use force, but we may not be able to secure that now, \nperhaps even later. If we get a clear requirement for unfettered \ninspections, I believe the authority to use force to enforce that \nmandate is inherent in the original 1991 United Nations resolutions, as \nPresident Clinton recognized when he launched Operation Desert Fox in \n1998.\n  If we get the resolution the President seeks, and Saddam complies, \ndisarmament can proceed and the threat can be eliminated. Regime change \nwill, of course, take longer but we must still work for it, nurturing \nall reasonable forces of opposition.\n  If we get the resolution and Saddam does not comply, we can attack \nhim with far more support and legitimacy than we would have otherwise.\n  If we try and fail to get a resolution that simply calls for Saddam's \ncompliance with unlimited inspections, those who oppose even that will \nbe in an indefensible position. And, we will still have more support \nand legitimacy than if we insist now on a resolution that includes \nauthorizing military action and other requirements giving other nations \nsuperficially legitimate reasons to oppose Security Council action. \nThey will say, we never wanted a resolution at all and that we only \nsupport the U.N. when it does exactly want we want.\n  I believe international support and legitimacy are crucial. After \nshots are fired and bombs are dropped, not all consequences are \npredictable. While the military outcome is not in doubt, should we put \ntroops on the ground, there is still the matter of Saddam Hussein's \nbiological and chemical weapons. Today he has maximum incentive not to \nuse them or give them away. If he did either, the world would demand \nhis immediate removal. Once the battle is joined, with the outcome \ncertain, he will have maximum incentive to use weapons of mass \ndestruction and give what he can't use to terrorists who can torment us \nwith them long after he is gone. We cannot be paralyzed by this \npossibility, but we would be foolish to ignore it. According to recent \nreports, the CIA agrees with this analysis. A world united in sharing \nthe risk at least would make this occurrence less likely and more \nbearable and would be far more likely to share the considerable burden \nof rebuilding a secure and peaceful post-Saddam Iraq.\n  President Bush's speech in Cincinnati and the changes in policy that \nhave come forth from the administration since they first began \nbroaching this issue some weeks ago have made my vote easier.\n  Even though the resolution before the Senate is not as strong as I \nwould like in requiring the diplomatic route first and placing highest \npriority on a simple, clear requirement for unlimited inspections, I \ntake the President at his word that he will try hard to pass a United \nNations resolution and seek to avoid war, if possible.\n  Because bipartisan support for this resolution makes success in the \nUnited Nations more likely and war less likely, and because a good \nfaith effort by the United States, even if it fails, will bring more \nallies and legitimacy to our cause, I have concluded, after careful and \nserious consideration, that a vote for the resolution best serves the \nsecurity of our Nation. If we were to defeat this resolution or pass it \nwith only a few Democrats, I am concerned that those who want to \npretend this problem will go way with delay will oppose any United \nNations resolution calling for unrestricted inspections.\n  This is a difficult vote. This is probably the hardest decision I \nhave ever had to make. Any vote that may lead to war should be hard, \nbut I cast it with conviction. Perhaps my decision is influenced by my \n8 years of experience on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue in the \nWhite House watching my husband deal with serious challenges to our \nNation. I want this President, or any future President, to be in the \nstrongest possible position to lead our country in the United Nations \nor in war. Secondly, I want to ensure that Saddam Hussein makes no \nmistake about our national unity and support for the President's \nefforts to wage America's war against terrorists and weapons of mass \ndestruction. Thirdly, I want the men and women in our Armed Forces to \nknow that if they should be called upon to act against Iraq our country \nwill stand resolutely behind them.\n  My vote is not, however, a vote for any new doctrine of preemption or \nfor unilateralism or for the arrogance of American power or purpose, \nall of which carry grave dangers for our Nation, the rule of \ninternational law, and the peace and security of people throughout the \nworld.\n  Over 11 years have passed since the UN called on Saddam Hussein to \nrid himself of weapons of mass destruction as a condition of returning \nto the world community.\n  Time and time again, he has frustrated and denied these conditions. \nThis matter cannot be left hanging forever with consequences we would \nall live to regret. War can yet be avoided, but our responsibility to \nglobal security and the integrity of United Nations resolutions \nprotecting it cannot.\n  I urge the President to spare no effort to secure a clear, \nunambiguous demand by the United Nations for unlimited inspections.\n  Finally, on another personal note, I come to this decision from the \nperspective of a Senator from New York who has seen all too closely the \nconsequences of last year's terrible attacks on our Nation. In \nbalancing the\n\n[[Page S10290]]\n\nrisks of action versus inaction, I think New Yorkers, who have gone \nthrough the fires of hell, may be more attuned to the risk of not \nacting. I know I am.\n  So it is with conviction that I support this resolution as being in \nthe best interests of our Nation. A vote for it is not a vote to rush \nto war; it is a vote that puts awesome responsibility in the hands of \nour President. And we say to him: Use these powers wisely and as a last \nresort. And it is a vote that says clearly to Saddam Hussein: This is \nyour last chance; disarm or be disarmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I seek the floor in my own right. I \nunderstand the distinguished Senator from West Virginia offered me 20 \nminutes of his time. I seek the floor in my own right. As I understand, \nunder the present state of affairs, I have up to 1 hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the remainder of his 1 hour: \n47 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will vote for the Lieberman-Warner amendment to \nauthorize the use of military force against Iraq. And unlike my \ncolleagues from West Virginia and Maryland, I do not believe this is a \nrush to war. I believe it is a march to peace and security.\n  I believe that failure to overwhelmingly support this resolution is \nlikely to enhance the prospects that war will occur. And in line with \nwhat the distinguished Senator from New York just said, I believe \npassage of this, with strong support, is very likely to enhance the \nprospects that the Secretary of State will get a strong resolution out \nof the Security Council.\n  I will vote for this because we should be compelling Iraq to make \ngood on its obligations to the United Nations. Because while Iraq's \nillegal weapons of mass destruction program do not--do not--pose an \nimminent threat to our national security, in my view, they will, if \nleft unfettered. And because a strong vote in Congress, as I said, \nincreases the prospect for a tough, new U.N. resolution on weapons of \nmass destruction, it is likely to get weapons inspectors in, which, in \nturn, decreases the prospects of war, in my view.\n  I am among those who had serious reservations about and flat out \nstraight opposition to the first draft proposed by the White House on \nSeptember 19. It was much too broad. The draft raised more questions \nthan it answered. It was not clear whether the authorization requested \nby the President to use force was limited to Iraq or applicable to the \nregion as a whole.\n\n  It was not clear whether the objective was to compel Iraq to destroy \nits weapons of mass destruction programs, to liberate Kuwaiti \nprisoners, or to end Saddam Hussein's regime. It was not clear whether \nthe rationale for action was to enforce the U.N. Security Council \nresolutions that Saddam has flouted for the last decade or to implement \na new doctrine of preemption. And it was not clear whether the \nadministration considered working through the U.N. and working with \nallies important or irrelevant.\n  The second draft negotiated with congressional leadership--and I \nwould say I believe, in part, as a consequence of the efforts of my \ngood friend, Senator Lugar, and me, and roughly 23 or 24 Republicans--\ngot the attention of the administration. They were simultaneously \nnegotiating with the Senator from Indiana and me as well as the leader \nin the House. The leader in the House reached an agreement first. I \nthought that was unfortunate because I believe we could have had a \nbetter resolution had that not occurred.\n  Nonetheless, the second draft negotiated addressed some of these \nquestions but left others unanswered. Along with many of my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle--notably, Senator Lugar--I continued to seek \ngreater clarity about the focus of the proposed resolution.\n  President Bush brought the resolution into sharper focus this week in \nhis speech to the Nation. He said:\n\n       War is neither imminent nor inevitable.\n\n  He also said his objective was to disarm Iraq, that his rationale to \nenforce United Nations resolutions was not based upon preemption, and \nthat he desired to lead the world, and if war was necessary, it would \nbe with allies at our side.\n  Mr. President, the resolution now before the Congress, similarly, is \nclear and more focused than previous drafts. It is not perfect, but it \nacknowledges the core concerns that Senator Lugar, I, and others raised \nand that have been raised by such Senators as Hagel and Specter and \nmany others. Considered in the context of the President's speech this \nweek, and his address last month to the United Nations General \nAssembly, this resolution, though still imperfect, deserves our \nsupport. Let me explain why.\n  First, the objective is more clearly and carefully stated. The \nobjective is to compel Iraq to destroy its illegal weapons of mass \ndestruction and its programs to develop and produce missiles and more \nof those weapons.\n  Saddam is dangerous. The world would be a better place without him. \nBut the reason he poses a growing danger to the United States and its \nallies is that he possesses chemical and biological weapons and is \nseeking nuclear weapons, with the $2 billion a year he illegally skims \nfrom the U.N. oil-for-food program. For four years now, he has \nprevented United Nations inspectors from uncovering those weapons and \nverifying Iraq's disarmament, and he is in violation of the terms he \nagreed to allowing him to stay in power.\n  What essentially happened was, he sued for peace. What essentially \nhappened was, the U.N. resolutions were a reflection of what \nordinarily, if there were no U.N., would be in the form of a peace \nagreement.\n  This resolution authorizes the President to use force to\n\n     defend the national security of the United States against the \n     continuing threat posed by Iraq; and enforce all relevant \n     United Nations Security Council Resolutions. . . .\n\n  In my view, and as has been stated by the President and Secretary of \nState, the threat to the United States is Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction programs. The relevant U.N. resolutions are those related \nto Iraq's nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. And the fact that \nwe use the conjunctive clause, the word ``and,'' and not the word \n``or,'' means that the authorization we are granting to the President \nis tied to defending the national security of the United States in the \ncontext of enforcing the relevant U.N. resolutions relating to weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  This is not a blank check for the use of force against Iraq for any \nreason. It is an authorization for the use of force, if necessary, to \ncompel Iraq to disarm, as it promised after the Gulf War.\n  Some in the Administration have argued that our stated objectives \nshould be the end of Saddam Hussein's regime. Regime change is the \nultimate goal of American policy, as embodied in the sense-of-the-\nCongress provision of the Iraq Liberation Act in 1998. Indeed, an \neffective effort to disarm Iraq could well result in regime change. \nAfter all, such an effort would force Saddam to make a hard choice--\neither give up his weapons or give up power--and he has made the wrong \nchoices many times before.\n  In his own words, the President said:\n\n       Taking these steps would also change the nature of the \n     Iraqi regime itself. America hopes the regime will make that \n     choice.\n\n  But this resolution does not make Saddam's removal its explicit goal. \nTo have done so, in my view, would run the risk of alienating other \ncountries who do not share that goal and whose support we need to \ndisarm Iraq and possibly to rebuild it. And it would significantly \nweaken our hand at the United Nations.\n  Nor does this resolution give the President the authorization to go \nto war over Bahraini prisoners, reparations owed to Kuwait, foreign \nMIAs, the return of Kuwait's national archives, or Saddam's ties to \nterrorism and human rights abuses. These are serious problems. The \nUnited Nations must continue to insist they be resolved, including \nmaintaining embargoes and tightening and strengthening those sanctions \nagainst Iraq. But I doubt seriously the American people will support \ngoing to war to rectify any of them; nor will our allies.\n  The Secretary of State, in testimony before the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, made clear that our core objective is disarmament. I quote:\n\n       I think it is unlikely that the President would use force \n     if [Iraq] complied with the weapons of mass destruction \n     conditions. . . .\n\n[[Page S10291]]\n\n     we all know that the major problem . . . the President is \n     focused on and the danger to us and to the world are the \n     weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  By the way, even if my reading is incorrect and he would be able to \ngo to liberate Bahraini prisoners, does anybody in this body think the \nPresident of the United States would risk American forces and, in a \nvery crass sense, his presidency by going in with American forces \nunilaterally to make sure that Bahraini prisoners were in fact \nreleased? That is fiction.\n  This week the President stated the objective clearly and concisely. \nHe said:\n\n       Saddam Hussein must disarm himself or, for the sake of \n     peace, we will lead a coalition to disarm him.\n\n  The President is right to focus on disarming Iraq and not on regime \nchange.\n  Second, the rationale is more tightly focused. It is to enforce the \nU.N. Security Council resolutions on weapons of mass destruction that \nSaddam has defied for more than a decade. This is a man who waged a war \nof aggression, lost the war, and sued for peace. The terms of surrender \ndictated by the United Nations require him to declare and destroy his \nweapons of mass destruction programs. He has not done so.\n  This resolution sets out in detail Saddam's decade of defying the \nSecurity Council resolutions on disarmament. It states that Iraq \n``remains in material and unacceptable breach of its international \nobligations,'' through its weapons of mass destruction programs. It \nauthorizes the President to enforce all ``relevant U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions regarding Iraq,'' with force, if necessary.\n  As the President said this week:\n\n       America is challenging all nations to take the resolutions \n     of the United Nations Security Council seriously.\n\n  That is what this is about. Yet some administration supporters have \nargued using force against Iraq is justified on the basis of a new \ndoctrine of preemption, a doctrine that would represent the most far-\nreaching change in our foreign policy since the end of the cold war. In \nfact, the concept of preemption has long been part of our foreign \npolicy tool kit. It is a doctrine well established under international \nlaw.\n  What we are talking about here in this new policy is a policy of \nprevention, striking first at someone who may some day pose a threat to \nus, even if that threat is not imminent today. This policy merits a \nserious national debate, but not adoption by this body, nor is it \ncontained in this resolution.\n\n  The speed and stealth with which an outlaw state or terrorist could \nuse weapons of mass destruction and the catastrophic damage they could \ninflict require us to consider new ways of acting, not reacting. But \nthat is not what this is about.\n  It would be dangerous to rush to embrace as a new principle of \nAmerican foreign policy a rule that gives every nation the right to act \npreventively. The former Secretary of State, Secretary Henry Kissinger, \nmade this point powerfully in his testimony before my committee 2 weeks \nago. I quote him:\n\n       As the most powerful nation in the world, the United States \n     has a special unilateral capacity and indeed obligation to \n     lead in implementing its convictions. But it also has a \n     special obligation to justify its actions by principles that \n     transcend the assertions of preponderant power. It cannot be \n     in either the American national interest or the world's \n     interest to develop principles that grant every nation an \n     unfettered right of preemption against its own definition of \n     threats to its security.\n\n  Dr. Kissinger is right. What message would declaring a policy of \nprevention send to the Indians and Pakistanis, the Chinese and the \nTaiwanese, the Israelis and the Arabs, the Russians and Georgians?\n  This resolution does not send that message because it does not \nendorse the prevention doctrine. It does not need to. Because, as the \nPresident has argued, this is about compelling Saddam Hussein to make \ngood on his requirement and obligation to disarm.\n  Third, this resolution makes clear the President's determination to \nbuild international support for our Iraq policy. Our allies throughout \nthe world and in the region have important contributions to make in the \neffort to disarm Iraq and to rebuild Iraq, if we go to war. And we \ndepend upon their continued cooperation in the unfinished war against \nterrorism. The United States has a singular capacity to act alone, if \nnecessary. We must--and this resolution does--preserve our right to do \nso. But acting alone in Iraq would cost us significantly more in lost \nlives, in dollars spent, and influence dissipated around the world. \nActing alone must be a last resort, not a defiant retort to those not \nyet convinced of our policy.\n  This resolution emphasizes the importance of international support, \nmanifested through the United Nations Security Council. It states that:\n\n       The Congress of the United States supports the efforts by \n     the President to--\n       (1) strictly enforce through the United Nations Security \n     Council all relevant Security Council resolutions applicable \n     to Iraq and encourages him in those efforts; and,\n       (2) obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security \n     Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of delay, \n     evasion and noncompliance. . . .\n\n  Similarly, the President, in going to the United Nations over the \nstrong objection of half his administration, made clear his desire to \nwork with others, not around them. In his speech this week, he talked \nabout his determination ``to lead the world'' in confronting the Iraqi \nproblem. He stated that if we act militarily, we will act ``with allies \nat our side.''\n  I am convinced he will follow through on this commitment.\n  In short, the combination of this resolution and the President's own \nwords in recent speeches, both publicly and privately, give me \nconfidence that most of our core concerns have been addressed.\n  I also take confidence from how far this administration has come on \nIraq over the past year. Many in this Chamber predicted, and many who \noppose this resolution predicted, that the administration would use the \nterrible events of September 11 as an excuse to strike back at Iraq. \nThis, despite any credible evidence that Iraq was involved in the \nterrorist attacks on America.\n  Both The New York Times and The Washington Post have reported that in \nthe days following 9/11, the most senior Pentagon officials urged the \nPresident to consider setting his sights on Iraq, not Afghanistan. I \ncan say from personal conversations, I know that to be true. As a \nmatter of fact, I gathered my Foreign Relations Committee staff not \nlong after 9/11, when talk of going to Afghanistan was in this Chamber \nand at the administration. I suggested, based on conversations I had \nwith some, be careful, prepare. We are not going to Afghanistan. We are \ngoing to Iraq.\n  I know there was a proposal that was being promoted to the President \nthat he should use this as an excuse to go to Iraq. Secretary Rumsfeld \nis reported to have argued there would be a big buildup of forces with \nnot that many good targets in Afghanistan.\n  At some point, the United States would have to deal with Iraq and is \nthis not the opportunity? he apparently suggested--not to me; that is \nas reported. Many predicted the administration would ignore the U.N. \nand the need to build international support for its Iraqi policy. That \nis not surprising because senior administration officials said as much.\n  During the spring and early summer, literally dozens of articles \nflatly stated that the President planned a unilateral attack against \nIraq. As late as August 29 of this year, The New York Times reported:\n\n       Officials in Washington and Crawford, TX, are engaged in an \n     intense debate over whether they should seek to involve the \n     United Nations one last time. . . . As one top adviser \n     described the argument, Mr. Bush must decide ``whether to go \n     it alone or go to the United Nations.'' He went to the United \n     Nations.\n\n  Many predicted the administration would refuse to give the weapons \ninspectors one last chance to disarm. That is not surprising. That \nprediction would have been made because administrative officials \nconsistently disparaged inspections.\n  Richard Perle, senior adviser to the Pentagon, said:\n\n       The inspectors are not going to find anything. . . .They \n     will flounder if they are permitted to return.\n\n  Vice President Cheney, as late as August 26 of this year, took this \nline:\n\n       A person would be right to question any suggestion that we \n     should just get inspectors\n\n[[Page S10292]]\n\n     back into Iraq and then our worries will be over. A return of \n     inspectors would provide no insurance whatsoever of Saddam's \n     compliance with U.N. resolutions.\n\n  I don't know how many Sunday shows I did from June through now, where \nevery interviewer would say: But, Senator, you are wrong, the President \nis going to act alone. And they read me quote after quote from high \nofficials.\n  Thank God for Colin Powell. Thank God for Colin Powell because that \nwas the other half being argued by the administration quietly, saying: \nMr. President, do not listen to those voices who counsel ``no \ninspectors and do not go back to the U.N.''\n  Many predicted the administration would not seek authorization from \nCongress for the use of force and, again, that is not surprising. As \nlate as August 29 of this year, the White House counsel--the White \nHouse counsel--reportedly told the President that he had all the \nauthority he needs to wage war against Iraq--there was a big deal about \nleaking a memorandum from the White House counsel to the world that \nCongress need not be involved, Mr. President. I had two private \nmeetings with the President myself, where I made clear that I thought \nthat was dead wrong and he would be--to use the slang on the east side \nof my city--``in a world of hurt'' if he attempted to do that.\n  The President said to me personally he was going to come to Congress \nif he sought authority. What did he do? He came to Congress. But it is \nnot strange that my colleagues up here would believe he would not do \nthat. The White House press secretary actually reiterated that \nconclusion of the White House counsel at a White House briefing. Each \nprediction by those who thought the President would make, in my view, \nthe wrong choice, seemed very well founded because it was based on the \nbeliefs and statements of very senior administration officials, \nincluding the Vice President of the United States.\n  We all know the lore around here--that the Vice President of the \nUnited States is the most powerful man in the administration. Some even \nsuggest it goes beyond that. But guess what? Each prediction proved to \nbe wrong, as some of us, quite frankly, predicted all along.\n  My colleague from New York may remember my getting a little bit of a \nsarcastic response in the Democratic Caucus when I suggested there was \nno possibility there would be a war before November; there was no \npossibility of an October surprise; there was no possibility that he \nwould go and seek power to go to war, if need be, absent congressional \nauthorization. There was no possibility he would fail to go to the U.N. \nIt is not just because that is the only thing I believe a rational \nPresident could do, but because he told me--and I suspect many others--\nthat that is what he would do.\n  Mr. President, President Bush did not lash out precipitously after 9/\n11. He did not snub the U.N. or our allies. He did not dismiss a new \ninspection regime. He did not ignore the Congress. At each pivotal \nmoment, he has chosen a course of moderation and deliberation. I \nbelieve he will continue to do so--at least that is my fervent hope. I \nwish he would turn down the rhetorical excess in some cases because I \nthink it undercuts the decision he ends up making. But in each case, in \nmy view, he has made the right rational and calm, deliberate decision.\n  As I noted a few moments ago, the President said this week that the \nuse of force in Iraq is neither ``imminent nor inevitable,'' and that \nmakes sense because while the threat from Iraq is real and growing, its \nimminence and inevitability in terms of America's security have been \nexaggerated.\n  For two decades, Saddam Hussein has relentlessly pursued weapons of \nmass destruction. There is a broad agreement that he retains chemical \nand biological weapons, the means to manufacture those weapons and \nmodified Scud missiles, and that he is actively seeking a nuclear \ncapability. It remains less clear how effective his delivery vehicles \nare, whether they be the al-Hussein missiles, with a 650 kilometer \nrange, short-range missiles, or untested and unmanned aerial vehicles \nfor the dispersion of chemical and biological weapons.\n  Shifting weather conditions, the likely incineration of much of the \nchemical or biological agent in a warhead explosion, and the potential \nblowback on Iraqi forces, all complicate the Iraqi use of these \nweapons. But we are right to be concerned that, given time and a free \nhand, Saddam would improve this technology.\n  Other countries have, or seek, weapons of mass destruction. Saddam \nactually used them against his neighbors, against his own people. He \nhas a lengthy track record of aggression--first, in Iran, then Kuwait. \nHe has brutally repressed Iraqi civilians--the Kurds in the North, then \nthe Shias in the south, and then the Kurds again. And the combination \nof Saddam Hussein and weapons of mass destruction is dangerous, \ndestabilizing, and deadly.\n  Ultimately, either those weapons must be dislodged from Iraq, or \nSaddam must be dislodged from power. But exactly what threat does the \ncombination of Saddam and weapons of mass destruction pose to the \nUnited States? How urgent is the problem? Some argue the danger is \nthreefold: one, Iraq could use these weapons against us; two, it could \nuse them to blackmail us; three, it could become a surreptitious \nsupplier to terrorist groups.\n  Others question these scenarios. For example, Brent Scowcroft, \nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush's National Security Adviser, and \nchairman of President Bush's foreign intelligence advisory board, \nrecently wrote:\n\n       Threatening to use these weapons for blackmail--much less \n     their actual use--would open [Saddam] and his entire regime \n     to a devastating response by the U.S. While Saddam is \n     thoroughly evil, he is above all a power-hungry survivor.\n\n  Similarly, Scowcroft wrote ``there is scant evidence to tie Saddam to \nterrorist organizations, and even less to the September 11 attacks. \nIndeed, Saddam's goals have little in common with the terrorists who \nthreaten us . . . and he is unlikely to risk his investment in weapons \nof mass destruction, much less his country, by handing such weapons to \nterrorists who would use them for their own purposes and leave Baghdad \nas a return address.''\n  Daniel Benjamin, former Director of Counter-terrorism on the National \nSecurity Council staff, and co-author of the remarkable new book, ``The \nAge of Sacred Terror,'' wrote recently in The New York Times the \nfollowing:\n\n       Iraq and Al Qaeda are not obvious allies. In fact, they are \n     natural enemies. . . .To contemporary jihadists, Saddam \n     Hussein is another in a line of dangerous secularists, an \n     enemy of the faith. . . .Saddam Hussein has long recognized \n     that Al Qaeda and like-minded Islamists represent a threat to \n     his regime. Consequently, he has shown no interest in working \n     with them against their common enemy, the United States. . . \n     . Iraq has indeed sponsored terrorism in the past, but always \n     of a traditional variety: it sought to eliminate Iraqi \n     opponents abroad or, when conspiring against others, to \n     inflict enough harm to show the costs of confronting it. But \n     Mr. Hussein has remained true to the unwritten rules of state \n     sponsorship of terrorism: never get involved with a group \n     that cannot be controlled, and never give a weapons of mass \n     destruction to terrorists who might use it against you.\n\n  I reiterate here, just as Mark Twain said, ``The reports of my death \nare much exaggerated,'' the reports of al-Qaida in Iraq are much \nexaggerated.\n  Our own intelligence community, in testimony before the Foreign \nRelations, Armed Services, and Intelligence Committees--that has been \ndeclassified--concluded that the probability of Iraq initiating an \nattack against the United States with weapons of mass destruction is \n``low''--l-o-w--low. They also have concluded that ``Baghdad for now \nappears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks . . \n. with chemical or biological weapons against the United States.''\n  I believe it is unlikely Saddam Hussein will use weapons of mass \ndestruction against us unless he is attacked. To do so would invite \nimmediate annihilation, and I am skeptical that he would become a \nsupplier to terrorist groups. He would risk being caught in the act or \nhaving those weapons turned against him by groups who disdain Saddam as \nmuch as they despise us, and he would be giving away what is to him the \nultimate source and symbol of his power, the only thing that makes him \nunique among the thugs in the region.\n  Of course, Saddam has miscalculated before, and we are right to be \nconcerned about the possibility, however remote, that he will do it \nagain, but we are wrong on this floor to exaggerate\n\n[[Page S10293]]\n\nand suggest this is the reason and justification for going against \nSaddam.\n  What I do believe is that Saddam's primary goal is to dominate his \nregion. His history, his actions, and his statements make that clear. \nWeapons are a means to that end for him, a terrible tool of \nintimidation that he could use to bully his people and his neighbors.\n  During the gulf war, the knowledge that Saddam Hussein had chemical \nand biological weapons did not deter us from expelling his forces from \nKuwait. We gave him clear warning that using these weapons against our \ntroops would invite a devastating response. Let me remind everybody, he \ndid not use them. But a nuclear weapon could well change Saddam's \ncalculus. It could give Saddam an inflated sense of his invisibility. \nIt could lead him to conclude erroneously that he finally had the great \nequalizer against American power and that he could fuel a new spasm of \naggression against his neighbors or the Kurds in the mistaken belief \nthat we would be deterred for fear that, if we put anyone on the \nground, they would be annihilated with his theater or tactical nuclear \nweapon.\n  We cannot let Saddam Hussein get his hands on nuclear weapons. In \nparticular, we must deny Iraq the necessary fissile material, highly \nenriched uranium, or weapons grade plutonium needed for a nuclear \nweapon.\n  According to an unclassified letter released by the Director of \nCentral Intelligence this week:\n\n       Iraq is unlikely to produce indigenously enough weapons \n     grade material for a deliverable nuclear weapon until the \n     last half of this decade.\n\n  Therefore, if Iraq wants a nuclear capability sooner, it will need to \nturn to foreign sources for fissile material which could shorten the \ntimetable for an Iraqi nuclear weapon to about a year. This reality \nunderscores the importance of U.S. and international efforts not only \nto disarm Iraq, but also to reduce and better secure fissile materials \nin the former Soviet Union, the most logical source of black market \npurchases or theft.\n  Concerning Iraq, our first step should be the one the President \napparently has chosen: to get the weapons inspectors back into Iraq. \nThere is disagreement about the value of weapons inspections. Skeptics, \nparticularly our Vice President, contend that inspections can never \nguarantee the complete disarmament of Iraqi weapons, especially given \nthe prevalence of dual-use materials and mobile facilities for the \nproduction of chemical and biological weapons.\n\n  Proponents believe that inspectors heighten the barrier to \ndevelopment and production of WMD and will buy time until a regime \nchange in Iraq occurs. They point to the success of UNSCOM and IAEA.\n  For example, the British white paper on Iraq's WMD issued last month, \nwhich was quoted by those who wish to move against Iraq, says:\n\n       Despite the conduct of the Iraqi authorities toward them, \n     both UNSCOM and IAEA action teams have valuable records of \n     achievement in discovering and exposing Iraq's biological \n     weapons programs and destroying very large quantities of \n     chemical weapons stocks and missiles, as well as the \n     infrastructure for Iraq's nuclear weapons program.\n\n  It has been argued that UNSCOM's most notable achievements were the \nresult of fortuitous defections. In fact, much of UNSCOM's success was \ndue to diligent detective work in Iraq. But let's assume that \ndefections and not detection are the key to success. Isn't the best way \nto encourage defections, isn't the best way to get firsthand \ninformation about Iraq's weapons programs to have inspectors back on \nthe ground talking to the key people?\n  I agree with President Bush that given a new mandate and the \nauthority to go any place, any time, with no advance warning, U.N. \ninspections can work. They can succeed in discovering and destroying \nmuch of Saddam's chemical and biological arsenals and his missile \nprogram. They can delay and derail his efforts to acquire nuclear \nweapons and, at the very least, they will give us a clearer picture of \nwhat Saddam has, force him to focus on hiding his weapons and not \nbuilding more, and it will buy us time to build a strong coalition to \nact if he refuses to disarm.\n  There is no question that with regard to Iraq, we have a real and \ngrowing problem. But I also believe we have time to deal with that \nproblem in a way that isolates Saddam and does not isolate the United \nStates of America . . . that makes the use of force the final option, \nnot the first one . . . that produces the desired results, not \nunintended consequences. That is the course President Bush has chosen, \nin my view.\n  Now it is incumbent upon the United Nations and the U.S. Congress to \nhelp him stay the course. The United Nations Security Council must \ndeliver a tough new resolution that gives the weapons inspectors the \nauthority they need to get the job done. As the President put it, the \ninspectors ``must have access to any site at any time without \npreconditions, without delay, and without exceptions.''\n  Mr. President, the resolution should set clear deadlines for \ncompliance, and it should make clear the consequences if Saddam Hussein \nfails to disarm, including authorizing willing U.N. members to use \nforce to compel compliance.\n  I also agree with the President that a key component of any \ninspections regime must be the U.N.'s ability to interview those with \nknowledge of Iraq's weapons programs in a climate free of fear and \nintimidation, including being able to take them outside of Iraq. \nOffering sanctuary to those who tell the truth would also deprive \nSaddam Hussein of their expertise.\n  To that end, this week, Senator Specter and I introduced legislation \ncalled ``The Iraqi Scientist Liberation Act'' that would admit to our \ncountry up to 500 Iraqi scientists, engineers, and technicians, and \ntheir families who give reliable information on Saddam's programs to \nus, to the United Nations, or to the International Atomic Energy \nAgency.\n  It is also critical the Congress send the right message to the United \nNations Security Council. Its members must not doubt our determination \nto deal with the problems posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, \nincluding our willingness to use force, if necessary.\n  The stronger the vote in favor of this resolution, the stronger the \nlikelihood, in my view, that the Security Council will approve a tough \nU.N. resolution. That is because the U.N. will conclude if we do not \nact, America will. So we'd better.\n  The tougher a U.N. resolution, the less likely it is that we will \nhave to use force in Iraq. That is because such a resolution would \nfinally force Saddam to face the choice between inspectors and \ninvaders, between giving up his weapons and giving up power, and there \nis at least a chance that he might make the right choice.\n  There is also a chance Saddam will once again miscalculate, that he \nwill misjudge our resolve, and in that event we must be prepared to use \nforce with others if we can, and alone if we must.\n  The American people must be prepared. They must be prepared for the \npossible consequences of military action. They must be prepared for the \ncost of rebuilding Iraq as the President said he is committed to do. \nThey must be prepared for the tradeoffs that may be asked of them \nbetween competing priorities. They must be prepared for all these \nthings and more because no matter how well conceived, no matter how \nwell thought out a foreign policy, it cannot be sustained without the \ninformed consent of the American people.\n  If it comes to that, if it comes to war, I fully expect the President \nwill come back to the American people and tell us what is expected of \nus. As a matter of fact, when he met with the congressional leadership \nand the committee chairmen about 10 to 15 days ago--I forget the exact \ndate--we were all around the Cabinet table and at one point he turned \nto me and he said: Mr. Chairman, what do you think?\n  And I said: Mr. President, I will be with you if you make an earnest \neffort to go through the United Nations, if you try to do this with our \nallies and friends; if in fact the U.N. does not support our effort, as \nin Kosovo, and if you are willing to be square with the American \npeople, Mr. President, of what sacrifices we are going to ask of them, \nparticularly the need to have a significant number of American forces \nin place in Iraq after Saddam Hussein is taken down.\n  In the presence of all my colleagues at that meeting, he said: I will \ndo that.\n  He has never broken his word.\n\n[[Page S10294]]\n\n  He has made two very important speeches so far--one at the U.N. and \none to the American people--about the danger of Saddam Hussein, but no \none yet has told the people of Georgia, the people of Delaware, the \npeople of this country what we will be asking of them because it will \nbe profound. It may be necessary, but it will be profound. As I said, \nif it comes to war, the President, I am confident, will go to the \nAmerican people.\n  In his speech this week, he made a compelling case that Iraq's \nfailure to disarm is our problem as well as the world's, but he has not \nyet made the case to the American people that the United States may \nhave to solve this problem alone or with relatively few others, nor has \nhe told us of the sacrifices that such a course of action could \ninvolve.\n  I am confident he will do so, if and when it proves necessary, but I \nalso want to be clear about the issues the President must address \nbefore committing our Armed Forces to combat in Iraq, as a moral \nobligation to level with our people.\n  First, the consequences of military action: Attacking Iraq could and \nprobably will go smoothly. We have the finest fighting force in the \nworld. Our defense budget exceeds that of the next 15 countries \ncombined. According to expert testimony my committee received this \nsummer, Iraq's conventional forces are significantly weaker than they \nwere during the Gulf War. As a leading expert in the Middle East, Mr. \nFouad Ajami told the committee there is a strong likelihood the Iraqis \nwill welcome us as liberators.\n\n  While it would be reasonable to expect the best, it would be \nfoolhardy not to prepare for the worst. There is a danger in assuming \nthat attacking Iraq will be, as some suggest, ``a cakewalk.'' We should \nall heed the powerful words of military analyst, Anthony Cordesman, who \ntestified before the Foreign Relations Committee in July. He said to my \ncommittee:\n\n       I think it is incredibly dangerous to be dismissive [of the \n     difficulty]. It is very easy to send people home unused and \n     alive. It is costly to send them home in body bags because we \n     did not have a sufficient force when we engaged. And to be \n     careless about this war, to me, would be a disaster . . . \n     This is not a game, and it is not something to be decided \n     from an armchair.\n\n  There is a danger in attacking Iraq. There is a danger that attacking \nIraq could precipitate what we are trying to prevent: Saddam's use of \nweapons of mass destruction against our troops.\n  My friend from Georgia who is presiding is a military man. He is a \nformer marine. He is a tough guy. He is level headed and straight. He \nmight be interested that last Sunday, as I came down to the memorial \nfor firefighters--he knows I commute every day and I never come to \nWashington on Sunday--but there was a tribute to fallen firefighters \nwhich occurs every year and I was asked to speak. As I got off the \ntrain, I ran into a four-star--I do not want to identify him too \nclosely--general in one of our branches who held a very high position \nvery recently and still holds a very high position. I asked him what he \nthought about the possibility of this war, and he said he did not like \nit.\n  He said two things to me, and I say this to the Presiding Officer, an \nex-marine. He said there are two things that will be fundamentally \ndifferent from ever before: We have never gone to war in an environment \nthat could possibly be totally contaminated before we get there; and, \nnumber two, we have never gone house to house in a city of 4 million \npeople.\n  This all may work perfectly well. This all may go just so nicely. But \nto imply to the American people that is a surety would be immoral, \ndisingenuous, and would reap a whirlwind if it does not occur.\n  The American people are tough. They will do what they think is \nnecessary for our security and they will make sacrifices. But I will \nhave no part if we go to war providing pablum to them that somehow this \nis going to likely be an overwhelmingly easy undertaking.\n  If we notice, everybody says the American people support this war. \nThat is not true. They support this war if it is a 100-day war like the \nlast war was. They do not support the President's ability to go to war \nunilaterally. If we look at all the polling data, what they support is \nif we go with our allies in response to a genuine threat, which I think \nexists, and if it is not going to be costly in terms of the loss of \nhuman life, American soldiers, then they overwhelmingly support it. \nOver half still support it even if there is some loss of life, but \nhardly anyone supports it if it is alone or if there is a significant \nloss of life.\n  As CIA Director George Tenet stated in a letter to Senator Graham \nthis week:\n\n       Should Saddam conclude that a U.S.-led attack could no \n     longer be deterred, he probably--\n\n  Let me say that again--\n\n     He probably would become much less constrained in adopting \n     terrorist actions. Such terrorism might involve . . . \n     chemical and biological weapons. Saddam might decide that the \n     extreme step of assisting Islamist terrorists in conducting a \n     WMD attack against the United States would be his last chance \n     to exact vengeance by taking a large number of victims with \n     him.\n\n  There is a danger that Saddam would seek to spark a wider war. I just \ndid one of the shows we all do with Charlie Rose. He quoted to me what \nI knew privately from my discussions with him: the former commander of \nCENTCOM testifying that he saw no need to go into Iraq now, and the \ncost would be high.\n  There is a danger that Saddam would seek to spark a wider war. Many \nexperts have expressed concern to my committee that if attacked Saddam \nHussein would lash out at Israel. Last month, The New York Times \nreported that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told senior \nadministration officials that Israel would strike back if Iraq attacks \nIsrael. Then, key Arab countries could come under tremendous pressure \nto break with us and confront Israel. It would be wrong for us to tell \nIsrael what they should or should not do in their self-defense, but it \nwould also be wrong to ignore the risk that a war against Saddam \nHussein will ignite a much larger conflagration.\n  There is a danger that Saddam's downfall could lead to widespread \ncivil unrest and reprisals. There is only one thing I disagree with in \nthe President's speech on Monday. He said what could be worse than \nSaddam Hussein? I can tell you, a lot.\n\n  As I said, there is a danger that Saddam's downfall could lead to \nwidespread civil unrest and reprisal. Chaos could invite the Kurds to \nseize valuable oil fields; the Turks to cross the border in an effort \nto prevent a Kurdish state from arising; and Iran and even Syria to \nmove in to fill a vacuum.\n  Not one of these scenarios is inevitable. None should be used as an \nexcuse for inaction. But each must figure into our planning and into \nthe minds of the American people if we ultimately use force against \nIraq. We must be honest with the American people.\n  In his speech this week, the President made it clear that if military \naction is necessary, ``the United States and our allies will help the \nIraqi people rebuild their economy and create the institutions of \nliberty in a unified Iraq and peace with its neighbors.''\n  This is a much more complicated country than Afghanistan. We are not \ndone in Afghanistan. We have not kept our commitment in Afghanistan. We \nare taking on a big deal here. I know the Presiding Officer and my \ncolleague from Ohio and my colleague from Vermont know Iraq is an \nartificially constructed nation. When has there been a circumstance in \nIraq when there has been anything remotely approaching a democratic \nrepublic? I cannot think of it in the history of Iraq as defined now. \nThe Kurds are Indo-European Sunnis, the Sunnis are Arab Sunnis, the \nShiites, who make up 60 percent of the population primarily between the \nTigris and Euphrates Rivers, are Shiites who have been at war with the \nSunnis. The Iranians are Shiite. There are 700,000 Iraqi Shiites in \nIran.\n  This is complicated stuff. But to listen to some of my colleagues on \nthe floor who blow this off like, no problem, take down Saddam, there \nis a James Madison waiting to step into the vacuum, we will have a \ndemocratic republic, it will set a new tone and tenor, as the Vice \nPresident said, for all of the Middle East, because we will have a new \ndemocracy there, that is a big deal. It is a big undertaking.\n  Why did the President say this? This is a critical commitment, one I \nwholeheartedly endorse, but it is not done out of altruism, but out of \na hard-boiled calculation that in Iraq we cannot afford to trade a \ndespot for chaos.\n\n[[Page S10295]]\n\nNone of this will be cost free. It will require a significant \ninvestment of military, financial, and human resources.\n  Let's start with the cost of war. Last month the White House economic \nadviser estimated the cost of the military campaign in Iraq at between \n$100 and $200 billion. My friends in the Senate are all economic \nconservatives. Where are we going to get the money? I say to my \nfriends, as I said in committee, those who want to see a national \nhealth insurance policy, forget it for a while. Those who want to make \npermanent the present tax cut, forget it for a while. As they say in \nparts of my State, ``you ain't got the money.''\n  It doesn't mean we shouldn't move on Iraq, but it means we should be \nhonest with the American people, and tell them what the estimated cost \nby this administration is. By the way, that estimated cost is similar \nto what the Congressional Budget Office suggested. The higher cost \nestimates would result from a lengthy campaign and external factors \nsuch as a spike in oil prices if that occurs. That is just to win the \nwar. The cost of securing the peace could be significantly higher and \ncould extend years into the future.\n  On the other hand, maybe we will end up with an Iraqi Government in \nplace. There is plenty of money in Iraq. They can fund their own \nreconstruction. And that may happen. I am not being facetious. But it \nis not anywhere near certain.\n  I say ``could'' because there are those who believe our commitment to \nIraq the ``day after'' need not involve exorbitant expenditures. Former \nDefense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told my committee in August, and \nSecretary Rumsfeld repeated it last month, that the United States would \nnot have to stay too long in Iraq. They and others argue that Iraq has \na talented population and considerable resources to pay for its own \nreconstruction.\n  The problem is, one-third of that population hates the other two-\nthirds of the population. They say Iraq will quickly be able to \norganize itself politically, economically, and militarily into a \npeaceful, unified nation, free of weapons of mass destruction.\n  The American people need to know that most experts believe Iraq will \nrequire considerable assistance politically, militarily, and \neconomically. Indeed, they say we should speak not of ``the day after'' \nbut of ``the decade after.'' My committee heard testimony in July from \na military expert in post-conflict reconstruction. The fellow who \nheaded up that department in the Pentagon stated that 75,000 troops \nwould be required at a cost of $16 billion for just the first year, to \nmaintain order, preserve Iraq's integrity, and secure its weapons of \nmass destruction sites. Just to do that. Just to do that. Other experts \npredict the United States will have to engage substantial resources in \nIraq, which has no history of democracy, for many more years.\n  When my cowboy friends say, ``Why do we need anybody? Let's go get \nthem,'' I don't want all 75,000 of the forces being American. Anybody \nhappen to notice recently that in Kuwait American military personnel \nare being picked off? Anybody happen to notice that? Anybody happen to \nnotice the targets in Afghanistan? Where have we been? The American \npeople need to know what the experts know. We have an obligation, the \nPresident has an obligation, to tell them, if the need arises.\n  In a recent study in the Atlantic Monthly, James Fallows summed up \nthe significant challenges that Iraqis will not be able to handle on \ntheir own. This is overwhelmingly agreed upon by left, right, and \ncenter. He says they will not be able on their own to handle the \nfollowing: Cleaning up the after-effects of battle and malicious \ndestruction Saddam Hussein may create with chemical and biological \nweapons or by sabotaging his own oil fields; providing basic \nhumanitarian needs in the short term such as food, water, and medical \ncare; dealing with refugees and displaced persons, the 700,000 Shiites \nin Iran--I remind Members of the 700,000 in Iran; catching Saddam \nHussein if he tries to flee--we are still looking for Osama bin Laden. \nWe are still looking for Omar the tent maker. We are still looking for \nthese guys. We don't have them; Providing police protection and \npreventing reprisal killings; denazification of Baathist officials and \nsecurity services; aiding in the formation of a new government; \nensuring Iraq's territorial integrity and dealing with possible Iranian \nand Turkish intervention; rebuilding the oil industry while ensuring a \nsmooth reentry of Iraqi oil into the world market.\n  That is a finite list that everyone acknowledges no new government in \nIraq could do quickly. Those who argue most vigorously that a post-\nSaddam Iraq can be a model and source of inspiration for democracy in \nthe region and throughout the Muslim world must be prepared to back the \nmassive, long term American commitment. To set that objective, but then \nto believe it can be done on the cheap, is a recipe for failure.\n  Let me quote from Mr. Gingrich. This is a news report in The New York \nTimes.\n\n       The advisers, who include former House Speaker Newt \n     Gingrich and Mr. Perle, argue the White House should create a \n     high-level interagency group to coordinate military and \n     reconstruction planning before an invasion takes place. That \n     sort of powerful council could overcome the bureaucratic and \n     philosophic divisions that have hindered reconstruction \n     planning, the advisers contend.\n       ``It was a mistake we made in Afghanistan,'' said Mr. \n     Gingrich who sits on the Defense Policy Board. ``You \n     shouldn't go into a country militarily without having thought \n     through what it should look like afterwards.''\n\n  The mere fact that these men on the board are saying we should do \nthis is evidence it has not been done yet.\n  We must be clear with the American people that we are committing to \nIraq for the long haul; not just the day after, but the decade after.\n  Finally, let's consider the possible tradeoffs here.\n  The President has argued that confronting Iraq would not detract from \nthe unfinished war against terrorism. I believe he is right. We should \nbe able to walk and chew gum at the same time. But if military action \ncomes, it will take a herculean effort for senior leaders of our \nGovernment to stay focused on two major undertakings at once. War is \nintense. A new front against Iraq must not distract us from job number \none--taking down al-Qaida.\n  Let's also be clear that this could involve sacrifices. For example, \nthe war on terrorism is putting intense demands on Navy Seals, Army \nGreen Berets, Delta Commandos, Air Force ground controllers, and Arabic \nlinguists. Units have been deployed to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Georgia, \nYemen, Africa, and the Philippines, and last month the commander of \nUnited States special-operation forces requested an additional $23 \nbillion over the next 5 years to prosecute the war against al-Qaida and \nother terrorist groups. Not--not--Iraq. Our intelligence services have \nalso redirected resources to the war on terrorism.\n  How are we going to pay for all this? Can we take on Iraq, prosecute \nthe war on terrorism, and maintain the President's tax cut for the \nwealthiest Americans? Can we afford to repeal the estate tax for the \ntop 2 percent of the population who pay it? What would be the prospects \nfor national health insurance and prescription drug benefits in the \nnear term?\n  The point is, we will do what we have to do to protect our national \nsecurity, but let's not kid ourselves that it can come down cost free, \nwithout tradeoffs, and without setting priorities.\n  Setting priorities and making hard choices is what governing is all \nabout. So is being forthright with the American people about what is \nexpected of them. We should not be afraid to ask our fellow Americans \nto sacrifice for a vital cause if we conclude we should go to war. \nGeneration after generation of Americans has done so willingly and will \ndo it again if that is what they are called upon to do. But we must be \nstraight with them.\n  In conclusion, few resolutions that come before the Congress are as \ngrave and consequential as the one before us today. We have heard \npowerful arguments on both sides of the resolution, and concerning the \nvarious amendments that have been presented. That is how it should be. \nWe have come a long way during the last year. The administration that \nmany thought would ignore the United Nations, ignore the Congress, has \nand is seeking the support of both.\n  We have come a long way in 3 weeks, a long way since the White House \nfirst offered its draft resolution. This resolution and the President's \nwords make it clear that the administration's objective is to disarm \nIraq and that the\n\n[[Page S10296]]\n\nrationale to enforce Iraq's obligations to the United Nations is the \nreason we would go, and that its determination is to work with others, \nnot alone. The President has made it clear that war is neither imminent \nnor inevitable.\n  I am confident that the reason the President, thankfully, disregarded \nthe advice of some in the administration--that he understands the \nsignificant need for others to support us--is that fighting two wars, a \nwar in Iraq and a war against terrorism, can be greatly assisted the \nmore the world is with us. We do not need them if it comes to that. But \nthe cost we will pay will be significantly higher.\n  I compliment the President for recognizing that. I am absolutely \nconfident the President will not take us to war alone. I am absolutely \nconfident we will enhance his ability to get the world to be with us by \nus voting for this resolution. I am absolutely confident, if it comes \ntime and need to go to war, with others or alone, the President will \nkeep his commitment to make the third most important speech in his \nlife, to come to the American people and tell them what is expected of \nthem, what is being asked of them.\n  To do any less would be to repeat the sin of Vietnam. And the sin of \nVietnam, no matter what our view on Vietnam is, is not whether we went \nor didn't go. But the sin, in my view, is the failure of two Presidents \nto level with the American people of what the costs would be, what the \ncontinued involvement would require, and what was being asked of them.\n  We cannot, must not, and, if I have anything to do with it, we will \nnot do that again.\n  I thank the Chair for its consideration and its patience. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have exhausted the last unanimous consent \norder that has been entered here. We have a lot of Senators who have \nindicated a desire to speak, and they have the right to do that. What I \nwould like to do is this. Both cloakrooms have worked to come up with a \nlist of speakers. We have a very long list, but we have learned from \nsad experience here this week that we should not make it a really long \nlist.\n  So what I suggest to my colleague, Senator McCain, is that we go down \nthe list for four or five Senators and then we will come back again and \ntry to get another list. We have a long list, but rather than enter \nit--we tried that earlier this week, and everyone should understand it \nwill not work because people do not use all their time so others are \nnot here when it is time to start. But if we have a few Senators, it \nworks better.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of speakers start with Senator \nDeWine for 35 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. For 45.\n  Mr. REID. OK, that is fine.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Forty-five.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Collins for 20 minutes. The reason we have this is \nwe have had a long string of Democrats who have spoken: Senator Kohl, 7 \nminutes; Senator Harkin, 7 minutes; Senator Schumer, 30 minutes; \nSenator Specter, 45 minutes; and Senator Carper, 20 minutes. We would \nend it at that time--not end it, but we would be back to enter another \nlist and find out if we have had any added to it or taken from it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am sorry, I will not object, but I couldn't hear.\n  Mr. REID. What I said is we will come back after this list is \ncompleted and see if there are any additions or deletions and try to \nget another list. We have a very long list here but, believe me, it \nwill not work to stick it in from top to bottom.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator from Nevada repeat the list \nagain?\n  Mr. REID. DeWine, 45 minutes; Collins, 20 minutes; Kohl, 7 minutes; \nHarkin, 7 minutes; Schumer, 30 minutes; Specter, 45 minutes; Carper, 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to everyone within the sound of my voice, \neveryone has time to speak if they can get the floor. We have a list \nhere to make it so people are not trying to get the attention of the \nChair.\n  I hope Senators will be considerate. There is only 30 hours. If \nsomebody comes and takes an hour, it does not leave time for others. \nSome have already spoken. I think those who have spoken--I hope they \nwill be considerate of a lot of Senators who have not spoken.\n  The fact that we have allotted all this time doesn't mean everyone \nhas to use every minute of the time allotted. So those Senators who are \nin this queue, if they would be around in case someone doesn't show up \nor is stuck in traffic or whatever the case might be, we could finish a \nlot quicker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to begin by thanking all my \ncolleagues who have participated in this very crucial and historic \ndebate. I must say I was struck last Friday by the magnificent debate \nbetween Senator Byrd and Senator Warner. I think their debate on Friday \nrepresented what the Senate is all about, and I congratulate both of \nthem. Really, every Member who has come down here has had something to \ncontribute.\n  It is clear that each Member who came down here has thought long and \nhard about this very important vote.\n  Throughout my Congressional career, I have believed that the United \nStates must lead in foreign affairs. In doing so, our foreign policy \nmust reinforce and promote our own core values of democracy, free \nmarkets, human rights, and the rule of law. And, I am not at all \nashamed to say that our most important export to the international \ncommunity is our ideals and our ideas.\n  The first U.S. President I remember as a child is Dwight D. \nEisenhower. We know that he ran for President because of his strong \nbelief that the United States needed to lead in the world. He believed \nthat by leading and by being involved in the world--and not isolated \nfrom it--we would have the best chance of guaranteeing peace, freedom, \nand stability. As President Eisenhower said in his January 1961 \nfarewell address:\n\n       America's leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon \n     our unmatched material progress, riches and military \n     strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of \n     world peace and human betterment.\n\n  He understood that we have a moral obligation, as the leader of the \nFree World, to use our power to promote freedom and stability and to \nhelp alleviate suffering around the globe. And in that process, he \nunderstood the importance and the necessity of working with our \npartners through organizations, such as NATO.\n  And though it is vital that we be engaged in world affairs and work \nwith other nations whenever possible, ultimately we cannot escape the \nfact that when the world looks for leadership, it can look to only one \nplace--and that place is, of course, the United States of America.\n  History has put us here. And, if the United States does not lead, \nthere is no one else who can lead--and frankly, no one else who will \nlead.\n  That is why, in the 1980s, when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives, I supported efforts to establish stability and \ndemocracy in Central America. The United States led--and it made a \ndifference. Significant progress was made in Central America. \nDemocracies emerged.\n  And, significant progress was made throughout the Western Hemisphere. \nIn 1981, 16 of the 33 countries in our hemisphere were ruled by \nauthoritarian regimes. Today, all but one of those nations--Cuba--have \ndemocratically elected heads of government.\n  They are certainly not all perfect and maybe those nations don't \nconform exactly with how we see democracy, but they certainly are \nbetter off than they were 25 years ago.\n  The United States led. It made a difference. It paid off.\n  That is why, throughout my career, I have supported U.S. leadership \nefforts--efforts to export our democratic values to other areas of the \nworld,\n\n[[Page S10297]]\n\nusing tools, such as foreign trade and foreign aid.\n  Speaking of foreign aid, though I wasn't in Congress at the time, I \nsupported U.S. leadership through NAFTA. I voted in favor of Trade \nPromotion Authority to give the President fast track or enhanced \ntrading abilities with our global partners. I voted in favor of the \nAndean Trade Preferences Act to expand the economic benefits of trade \nwith the nations of the Andean region. I voted in favor of the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act and the expanded Caribbean Basin Initiative. \nAnd, I support efforts to negotiate free trade agreements within our \nWestern Hemisphere.\n  All of these efforts require strong U.S. leadership. So, too, does an \nunderutilized tool of our foreign policy--and that is foreign aid.\n  First, we don't utilize it enough. Currently, our foreign assistance \nbudget comprises less than one percent of our overall budget, and is \nbarely 0.1 percent of our Gross Domestic Product.\n  Second, we aren't creative enough with the limited resources we do \nhave in our foreign assistance budget. And so, here, too, the United \nStates needs to lead.\n  There are things we can do with this assistance. We can and we must \ndo more to help end suffering throughout the world. We can and we must \ndo more to help alleviate the worldwide AIDS pandemic. We can and we \nmust do more to feed starving children worldwide. We can and must do \nmore to help implement the rule of law in developing democracies. We \ncan and we must do more to foster agricultural and economic development \nin poverty-stricken, disease-ridden, war-ravaged parts of our world. \nAnd, as the leader of the Free World, we also have a moral obligation \nto bring stability and peace to volatile, violent regions around the \nglobe.\n  Candidly, sometimes the only way to do that is through the use of our \nmilitary. That's why I supported military action in Bosnia in 1995 and \nin Kosovo in 1999. The simple reality is that the job could not get \ndone without U.S. leadership. We had to go in. We had to lead. It was \nthe right thing to do, and we did it.\n  And so, Mr. President, it may seem paradoxical now that I have found \nthe decision concerning this Resolution to be very, very difficult. It \nis difficult, I believe, principally for two reasons.\n  Let me outline them for the Senate.\n  First, the resolution before us is an authorization of force to be \nused by the President--at his discretion--at some point in the future. \nIt is not a declaration of war. And, it does not say that war will take \nplace.\n  But, it does authorize the President ``to use the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order \nto: Defend the national security of the United States against the \ncontinuing threat posed by Iraq; and enforce all relevant United \nNations Security Council Resolutions regarding Iraq.''\n  While unusual, this type of resolution is not without precedent. \nCongress passed the Gulf of Tonkin resolution in 1964, which said this:\n\n       Congress approves and supports the determination of the \n     President as Commander in Chief, to take all necessary \n     measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the \n     United States and to prevent further aggression.\n\n  I went back to the Congressional Record of 1964 and read some of \nSenator Gruening's and Senator Morse's remarks to get a better \nunderstanding of why they dissented--why they voted against this \nresolution. I also read comments from those who voted ``yes.''\n  However, it is noteworthy that the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was not \nthe first time Congress had passed a resolution to give the President \nthe authority to use force--at his discretion--at some point in the \nfuture. Actually, Congress passed two such resolutions during the \nEisenhower Administration: one in 1955 regarding Formosa and one in \n1957 regarding the Middle East.\n  So while there is precedent, this type of resolution to grant the \nPresident the authority to use force, at his discretion, at some point \nin the future, is certainly unusual, and so we have an obligation to \ntreat this matter with great caution. Granting the President this kind \nof power is indeed a very grave matter.\n  The second reason this decision, for me, has been so difficult is \nthat the consequences of war would be so serious. A possible war \nagainst Iraq would have very real and very serious consequences, many \nof them unforeseen today.\n  I believe the American people need to understand this. My colleague, \nSenator Biden, who preceded me, made that point very well. I believe we \nhave an obligation during this debate to explain to the American people \nwhat war with Iraq might mean. We have an obligation to be brutally \nfrank in telling the American people about these consequences of war.\n  What are they? What are the risks of war with Iraq?\n  First, Saddam Hussein may very well use chemical and biological \nweapons against our troops. If we went to war, we would be attempting \nto remove Saddam from power. Therefore, unlike the Persian Gulf war, \nthis time he is likely to actually use those chemical and biological \nweapons against our troops, or at least attempt to.\n  Second, we know that war with Iraq dramatically increases the \npossibility of attacks against United States troops stationed in other \nplaces abroad and United States civilians throughout the world.\n  Third, we know that war with Iraq increases the possibility of \nattacks against Americans right here at home, in our mainland.\n  This has already been read on the floor and discussed, but I would \nlike to read to my colleagues some information recently declassified by \nthe CIA. In a letter to Senator Graham dated October 7--Monday of this \nweek--the CIA released the following:\n\n       Baghdad, for now, appears to be drawing a line short of \n     conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or biological \n     weapons against the United States.\n       Should Saddam conclude that a U.S.-led attack could no \n     longer be deterred, he probably would become much less \n     constrained in adopting terrorist actions. Such terrorism \n     might involve conventional means, as with Iraq's unsuccessful \n     attempt at a terrorist offensive in 1991, or [through] \n     chemical or biological weapons.\n       Saddam might decide that the extreme step of assisting \n     Islamist terrorists in conducting a weapons of mass \n     destruction attack against the United States would be his \n     last chance to exact vengeance by taking a large number of \n     victims with him.\n\n  This information is certainly chilling.\n  We also know that war with Iraq increases the likelihood that Saddam \nwill launch Scud missiles against Israel, this time maybe with \nbiological or chemical agents attached to the missiles. In fact, Iraq \nhas admitted to the weaponization of thousands of liters of anthrax, \nbotulinim toxin, and aflatoxin for use with Scud warheads, aerial \nbombs, and aircraft.\n  Furthermore, if attacked, what would Israel do? Would Israel, this \ntime, retaliate? In the Persian Gulf war, Israel held back, but would \nthey this time? And if they did not, in such a scenario, what would \nother countries do? What would Syria do, for example? What are the \nchances of the entire Middle East literally going up in flames?\n  At the conclusion of a war with Iraq--we would win the war; we know \nthat--but at the conclusion of a war with Iraq, there very well may be \nbloody, fractious battles among the different ethnic groups residing in \nIraq. Pent up hostilities among Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds--just to \nmention a few--would be difficult to restrain, easily resulting in \nfamilies warring against families and neighbors against neighbors, all \nfighting village to village and house to house. And there simply would \nnot be enough United States troops or allies you could place into Iraq \nto stop that from happening.\n  What are the unintended global consequences of the United States \nusing preemptive action? How does this change the dynamics of the \nworld? What would it mean for the India-Pakistan nuclear standoff? What \nwould it mean for China and Taiwan? Would these nations be less \nrestrained in using preemptive strikes? These are questions to which we \ndo not know the answers.\n  Finally, what will Iraq look like after the war? What kind of \nhumanitarian assistance will be needed? How many people will we have to \nfeed? What is our plan now for reconstruction? What does it cost? Who \nwill help? What other countries will we be able to involve in helping \nus?\n  We can expect to pay for a large part of this. And we can expect our \ntroops\n\n[[Page S10298]]\n\nto be involved for an extended, indefinite period of time--not days, \nnot months, but years. And there could be no doubt about that.\n  So, yes, Mr. President, there are grave consequences of going to war \nwith Iraq. We cannot predict the future. We do not know exactly how \nSaddam would react. But it is vital that the American people understand \nthe sobering reality of a war with Iraq; that all Americans understand \nthe uncertainty and the risks and the dire consequences.\n  Yet we also know that inaction is not a choice when it comes to the \nsituation in Iraq. Inaction is just not a choice. We know the status \nquo is unacceptable. We know things have languished too long. We know \nSaddam Hussein's regime is in possession of chemical and biological \nweapons. And we know they are working, as frantically as they can, to \ndevelop nuclear weapons.\n  The fear is, also, that Saddam Hussein would eventually put these \nweapons into the hands of other terrorist groups, terrorist groups such \nas al-Qaida, terrorist groups that have no qualms about targeting U.S. \ncitizens anywhere in the world, terrorist groups that have networks \nalready established around the world. When that handoff would be made, \nthe consequences would be unbelievable.\n  President Bush made very clear in his speech on Monday night in \nCincinnati:\n\n       Saddam Hussein is a threat to peace, and he must disarm.\n\n  So I commend President Bush for putting Iraq back on the world stage \nin his very forceful speech at the United Nations. He has taken Saddam \nHussein's evil regime by the throat and dragged it back in front of the \neyes of the international community. And he has forced the United \nNations to confront Saddam's rampant and flagrant disregard of 10 \nyears' worth of U.N. Security Council resolutions. He has forced the \nU.N. to confront its failure to enforce past resolutions regarding \nweapons inspections. And, rightly so, President Bush has forced both \nthe U.N. and our own country to confront this global threat and to deal \nwith it. I commend the President for his leadership.\n  None of us in this body disagrees about what Saddam Hussein is. We \nknow he is a power-hungry dictator, the embodiment of pure evil. The \nlitany, ably recited here day after day, detailing Hussein's thirst for \npower, is by no means exaggerated, nor is it understated. And there is \nsimply no logic to his actions. Just think back to his attempt to \nassassinate former President Bush shortly after President Clinton took \noffice. Even in his perverse view of the world, what in the world could \nthat have accomplished from his point of view?\n  Clearly, Saddam is ruthless. He is diabolical. He is a cold-blooded \nkiller. He has launched Scud missiles against his neighbors. He has \ndiverted much of the $10 billion worth of goods now entering Iraq every \nyear--money he gets from oil--he has diverted that money he is supposed \nto use for humanitarian purposes, to help his own people, to develop \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  He has murdered his own people. He has killed or injured more than \n20,000 Kurds with mustard gas and sarin.\n  In short, Saddam is a 20th century Adolf Hitler, straddling 21st \ncentury weapons of mass destruction. No one in this body disagrees \nSaddam Hussein is an evil despot, but reasonable people can still \ndisagree about our policy for disarming Hussein; reasonable people can \ndisagree with the wording of the resolution we are debating; reasonable \npeople can disagree about the timing; and reasonable people can \ndisagree about how we proceed at the United Nations.\n  This is a very difficult decision. There are very legitimate issues \nof controversy.\n  Yes, the costs will be high, very high, if we go to war. Again, that \nis why this decision has for me been so very difficult. It is the most \nserious vote I have cast in the 8 years I have been in the Senate.\n  None of us take the gravity of this vote lightly. Over the last \nseveral weeks I have spent many hours in Intelligence Committee \nhearings and briefings and other briefings gathering as much \nintelligence and information as humanly possible. I have met with \nnumerous current and former high-ranking officials from the military, \nthe CIA, the State Department. I met personally with President Bush.\n  At the end of the day, we still must weigh all of the costs and all \nof the consequences of a potential war with Iraq against the potential \nfor peace and stability and lives saved that will come with the \ndisarmament of Saddam Hussein.\n  Let's be honest, though. The fact is, the ghost of the 1964 Gulf of \nTonkin resolution haunts this Chamber, just as the tragedy of Vietnam \nand the over 58,000 U.S. lives that were lost hang heavy in the heart \nof America. We should be haunted by the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, and \nwe should be haunted and troubled by the Vietnam war.\n  However, it is instructive, as I mentioned earlier, to remember that \nthe Gulf of Tonkin resolution was not the first time Congress gave the \nPresident the authority to commit U.S. Armed Forces at his discretion \nat some time in the future.\n  In January 1955, when Dwight Eisenhower was President, the Chinese \nCommunists were threatening to take over the Chinese nationalists in \nFormosa. It was a very serious time in our history. Believing that the \ntime had come to draw the line--those are President Eisenhower's \nwords--to draw the line and hold back the Communist aggression, \nPresident Eisenhower asked Congress to pass a resolution giving him the \nauthority ``to employ the Armed Forces of the United States as he deems \nnecessary for the specific purpose of securing and protecting Formosa \nagainst armed attack.''\n  Congress granted President Eisenhower this authority with an \noverwhelming vote, 410 to 3 in the House, and 85 to 3 in the Senate. \nLater President Eisenhower said that while he went to Congress for \nseveral reasons, his real reason was ``to serve notice on the \nCommunists that they are not going to be able to get away with it.''\n  Because of that resolution, the Chinese Communists in 1955 did not \nact. War was avoided. There have been problems. There have been \ntensions ever since. But war at that crucial time was avoided.\n  By passing the Formosa resolution, Congress sent a clear, unequivocal \nsignal to the Chinese Communists that the United States would defend \nFormosa, that Congress would support President Eisenhower, and that our \ncountry was, in fact, united.\n  It is instructive that during that debate, there was an attempt in \nthe Senate, in the Congress, to change the wording and to be more \nspecific and to mention President Eisenhower, in defending Formosa, had \nthe specific authority to defend Quemoy and Matsu, two little islands \nclose to mainland China, far away from Formosa, but controlled by \nFormosa at the time. President Eisenhower said, no, do not do that; do \nnot be that specific in the resolution.\n\n  President Eisenhower was looking for the authorization to protect \nFormosa, but he also wanted the discretion to decide how to do it. And \nhe also did not want to tell the Communist Chinese exactly what he \nwould do.\n  With the flexibility and discretion to use force as he deemed \nnecessary, President Eisenhower left the Communists guessing about the \nways in which the United States would act, but they had no doubt that \nwe would act.\n  That is why I believe we must pass the resolution before us. We need \na tough resolution that gives the President the authority he needs to \ndisarm Saddam Hussein. We need a tough resolution that also gives the \nPresident flexibility and discretion. We have that before us. We need a \ntough resolution that does not tie the President's hands.\n  Through the resolution before us, this Senate and this Congress is \nsaying to Saddam Hussein that he is on notice. Saddam Hussein, we are \nsaying, you are not going to be able to flagrantly disregard U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions any more. You are not going to be able to \nget away with building weapons of mass destruction. You are not going \nto be able to threaten our lives and the lives of our children and the \nlives of our grandchildren and the peace and security of the world.\n  In the final analysis, we are left with the sober realization that \nwhen it comes to Saddam Hussein, there really are no good choices. When \nit comes to him, lives are being lost in his own\n\n[[Page S10299]]\n\ncountry now, and many more could be lost around the world in the future \nif we allow him to continue his weapons of mass destruction obsession. \nLeft unrestrained, Saddam Hussein will only become more dangerous, more \ndiabolical, and certainly more deadly.\n  So I believe when you weigh the risk of action versus the risk of \ninaction, we, as the leader of the free world, simply have a moral \nobligation to act. As I already said, we simply cannot, as a nation, \nescape the fact that when the world looks for leadership, it can look \nto only one place today. That place is the United States of America.\n  We have an obligation to lead the efforts to disarm Saddam Hussein. \nIn the process, we may tragically end up at war with Iraq. But my \nprayer, my prayer is that by passing this resolution, we will not have \nto go to war against Iraq. My prayer is that congressional unity will \nsignal to Saddam Hussein and to the international community that we do, \nin fact, mean business.\n  My hope is we can get a tough new U.N. Security Council resolution \npassed, giving weapons inspectors unfettered access to every mile, \nevery square foot, every inch of Iraq. We increase the chances for \npeace by telling Saddam Hussein and his evil regime that our Nation is \nunited and that we do, in fact, speak with one voice. We increase the \nchances for peace by giving the President the strongest possible hand, \nwhile at the same time giving him flexibility.\n  Finally, I must say I am convinced President George Bush will do \nabsolutely everything he can to avoid war.\n  Mr. President, I do not know if war can be avoided, but I do know if \nwe are serious about disarming Saddam Hussein of his weapons of mass \ndestruction, our best chance of avoiding war is through the passage of \na tough resolution. That is why I will vote in favor of this \nresolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before I give my speech, I commend my \nfriend, the Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine, for a very thoughtful \npresentation this evening. He and I have had many discussions about how \ndifficult this decision has been for both of us. We have reached many \nof the same conclusions. But I just want to salute him for a very \nthoughtful and thorough analysis of the resolution and the challenges \nbefore us.\n  The decision to authorize the use of military force is the most \nsignificant vote that a Member of the Senate can ever cast. The \nConstitution clearly vests this responsibility in Congress, a duty that \nrests heavily on the shoulders of each and every Member.\n  As a Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am keenly aware \nof the sacrifices and dangers faced by our young men and women in the \nmilitary. They are ready to answer the call to combat, ready to fight \nthe war against terrorism, ready to defend our freedoms around the \nglobe.\n  In the wake of the attacks on our country on September 11, the Senate \nvote to authorize the war against terrorism was rapid, unanimous, and \nclear-cut. By contrast, whether to authorize the use of military force \nagainst Iraq is a far more difficult and complex question. It requires \na thorough analysis of the nature and urgency of the threat and an \nevaluation of all possible responses.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, \nand the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security and \nProliferation, I have received many briefings on the dangers posed by \nlawless regimes in Iraq, Iran, and North Korea during the past 5 years. \nAnd during the past 2 months, I have attended several highly \nclassified, in-depth briefings on Iraq from the CIA, the National \nSecurity Agency, the Department of Defense, the State Department, and \nthe White House. I have questioned the experts--I have questioned them \nclosely--including former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger and \nformer National Security Adviser Samuel Berger, as well as Secretary \nRumsfeld, at public hearings before the Armed Services Committee.\n\n  I have read studies and assessments, both classified and public, \nconducted by the administration, the British Joint Intelligence \nCommittee, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, and many \nothers. I talked at length with Secretary Colin Powell about the \nappropriate strategy to respond to Iraq's development of weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  Let me first discuss my conclusions about the nature and the extent \nof the threat posed by the Iraqi regime and its continued defiance of \nthe United Nations resolutions. In 1991, Iraq accepted a cease-fire \nagreement in the form of United Nations Security Council Resolution \n678, to end the gulf war. The Iraqi regime was required to \nunconditionally accept the destruction, removal, or rendering harmless \nunder international supervision of all of its chemical and biological \nagents.\n  In addition, the resolution prohibited Iraq from acquiring or \ndeveloping nuclear weapons and required the destruction of all \nballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometers. From a \nseries of Iraqi declarations to the U.N. subsequent to this resolution, \nwe know that Iraq, by its own admission, had by 1991 produced thousands \nof tons of deadly chemical weapons, such as mustard gas, sarin, and VX, \nas well as very large quantities of biological agents, including \nanthrax and ricin. Most experts believe Iraq's declarations grossly \nunderstated the true sense of its chemical and biological programs. But \neven the admitted amounts were sufficient to kill hundreds of thousands \nof people.\n  For a time in the 1990s, the U.N. inspectors succeeded in destroying \nquantities of these weapons, as well as the associated production \nfacilities, ballistic missiles, and much of the infrastructure for \nIraq's nuclear weapons program. Subsequently, however, the Iraqi \nregime's harassment, obstruction, and deception made it impossible for \nthe inspectors to continue their work, and they were withdrawn.\n  At the time they left in 1998, the inspectors were unable to account \nfor very large discrepancies between the weapons that were declared and \nthe amounts that were destroyed. For example, at least 1.5 tons of the \ndeadly nerve agent VX were unaccounted for. Just under 10 milligrams of \nVX can cause a quick and painful death.\n  The CIA has concluded all key aspects of Iraq's offensive biological \nand chemical weapons program, including research and development, \nproduction and weaponization, are active and, in some cases, larger and \nmore advanced than before the gulf war.\n  In addition to the weapons unaccounted for in the post-gulf war \ninspections, there is significant evidence that since 1998, Saddam has \nexpanded his stockpile of chemical and biological weapons; rebuilt and \nexpanded manufacturing sites, including mobile biological production \nfacilities; developed more effective delivery systems, such as unmanned \ndrones; and sought to procure materials for a nuclear bomb.\n  The reports demonstrating Iraq's violation of U.N. resolutions are \nnumerous, compelling, and indisputable. They are based on the findings \nof U.N. weapons inspectors, credible reports from Iraqi defectors, \nsophisticated surveillance equipment, and other strong evidence.\n  Even more troubling is the evidence compiled by the American and \nBritish intelligence agencies that Iraq has converted its L-29 jet \ntrainers to allow them to be used as unmanned aerial vehicles, capable \nof delivering chemical and biological agents over a large area.\n  While the evidence of Iraq's pursuit of biological and chemical \nweapons is overwhelming, it is more difficult to determine the state of \nIraq's development of nuclear weapons. Numerous reports suggest, \nhowever, a renewed determination by Saddam Hussein to obtain the \nmaterials for a nuclear bomb.\n  A September report by the International Institute for Strategic \nStudies paints a chilling picture of Saddam's quest for nuclear \nweapons. Had the gulf war not intervened, Iraq ``could have accumulated \na nuclear stockpile of a dozen or so weapons by the end of the \ndecade,'' according to the report.\n  It further concludes that the scientific and technical expertise of \nIraq's nuclear program remains intact, and the British Government has \nrevealed that Iraqi nuclear personnel were ordered to resume work on \nnuclear projects in 1998.\n  According to British intelligence, Iraq has also attempted to obtain \nuranium from Africa. This is extraordinarily troubling. Since Iraq has \nno\n\n[[Page S10300]]\n\nactive civil nuclear power program or nuclear powerplants, it simply \nhas no peaceful reason to attempt to secure uranium.\n  In addition, the Iraqi Government has attempted to procure tens of \nthousands of high-strength aluminum tubes that could be used in \ncentrifuges designed to enrich uranium to produce the fissile material \nnecessary for a nuclear bomb.\n  How soon could Iraq acquire nuclear weapons? The International \nInstitute for Strategic Studies estimates that Iraq is probably years \naway from producing nuclear weapons if it has to rely on indigenously \nproduced material. It points out if Iraq were to acquire nuclear \nmaterial from a foreign source, the timeframe could be reduced to a \nmatter of months.\n  This is the scenario the institute calls the nuclear wild card. An \nindependent assessment conducted by Professor Anthony Cordesman of the \nCenter for Strategic and International Studies, confirms the growing \nthreat posed by Iraq. The professor states that Saddam Hussein seeks \nweapons to offset American superiority and high-tech weaponry. In other \nwords, while the United States has developed conventional weapons to be \nas surgical as possible and to limit unintended casualties, Iraq \ndevelops its weapons to be as blunt and as destructive as possible, to \ninstill fear in its enemies and its neighbors.\n  In short, Saddam Hussein has continued to develop a stockpile of the \ndeadliest chemical and biological agents known to mankind and has \ncontinued to seek nuclear weapons in defiance of his international \nobligations.\n  The more difficult question is whether the growing and serious threat \nposed by Saddam Hussein is sufficiently imminent to warrant the \nauthorization of a military strike by the United States and its allies \nshould diplomatic means of disarming Iraq fail.\n  The President correctly noted in his recent speech that the passage \nof this authorization does not mean that war is imminent and \nunavoidable. In fact, the resolution before us represents a \nconsiderable improvement over the administration's earlier draft which \nI would have opposed because of its insufficient emphasis on pursuing \ndiplomatic means first and working through the United Nations Security \nCouncil.\n  The bipartisan resolution, by contrast, specifically requires a \nPresidential determination that further reliance on diplomatic or other \npeaceful means alone would not adequately protect our national security \nor lead to the enforcement of the relevant U.N. resolutions. But \nnevertheless, the difficult question remains of whether the threat is \nso urgent that a military strike may be required and should be \nauthorized by this resolution.\n  The evidence of Saddam's massive buildup of the most dangerous \nweapons is compelling, but as Mr. Berger pointed out in his testimony \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee, the threat is not defined \nby capability alone. We have to probe Saddam Hussein's intentions, as \nwell as his capability, to determine the threat. In that regard, if, as \nShakespeare tells us, the past is prolog, the history of Saddam's \nregime gives us great cause for concern.\n  While none of us can predict for certain whether or when Saddam would \nstrike, there are simply far too many warning signs in his past \nbehavior and in his present undertakings. His coldblooded willingness \nto use chemical weapons against his own people, as well as his enemies; \nhis aggressive invasion of two nations; his blatant defiance of \ninternational sanctions; his continued efforts to procure the materials \nto build a nuclear bomb; and his determined progress to develop a more \neffective means of delivering chemical and biological weapons all \nstrongly suggest an intention and an ability to use these weapons.\n\n  As the assessment of the British Government states, the evidence \nshows that Saddam Hussein does not regard these weapons of mass \ndestruction as only weapons of last resort. He is ready to use them and \ndetermined to retain them. In fact, British intelligence reports that \nsome of the weapons are deployable within 45 minutes of an order to use \nthem.\n  The history of Saddam Hussein's rule over Iraq is a history of war \nand aggression against his enemies, his neighbors, and his own people. \nThroughout the decade of the 1980s, Saddam Hussein used chemical \nweapons to kill thousands of civilians, and Iraq has the means, through \nbillions of dollars in oil revenues, to continue to develop, procure, \nor steal the materials necessary for its weapons.\n  The risks are simply too catastrophic for the world to allow Iraq to \ncontinue on its present course, but is a military response the only \nanswer?\n  From the beginning of this debate, I have emphasized my belief that \nmilitary force must be the last resort, not the first alternative. \nToday I still hold out the hope that military action will not prove \nnecessary to disarm this dangerous regime. A strong United Nations \nresolution to compel Iraq to declare its weapons and to accept \nunfettered, rigorous inspections may well be successful in convincing \nSaddam that he must disarm.\n  I believe our policy should be focused on disarming Iraq rather than \non regime change, much as I would like Saddam Hussein to be deposed.\n  In making what has been a very difficult decision, I was persuaded \nultimately to support this resolution by an extensive discussion with \nSecretary Powell. He has convinced me the process for effective action \nby the United Nations to disarm Iraq depends on the credible threat of \nthe use of force, and that is the reason ultimately that I will decide \nto cast my vote in favor of this resolution.\n  Secretary Powell told me his ability to secure a strong resolution \nfrom the U.N. Security Council will be strengthened enormously by a \nstrong, bipartisan congressional vote for this authorization.\n  Similarly, as Secretary Schlesinger testified, the greater degree to \nwhich the President and the Congress are united in purpose with respect \nto Iraq, the greater is the likelihood the United Nations will take a \nfirm and appropriate stand toward Iraq.\n  Only if Saddam understands we are prepared to use military force will \na peaceful means of disarming him have any chance to succeed. All \nAmericans share the goal of eliminating this threat without war, but we \ndiffer on how to achieve that goal.\n  In my view, there are times in dealing with a tyrant when the best, \nindeed perhaps the only, chance to avoid war is to express, in \nunmistakable terms, our willingness to wage it. And this is one of \nthose times.\n  Some understandably ask: Why now? Has not our current policy \ncontained Saddam?\n  It has, only if allowing him to acquire the capability to kill and \ndestroy on a scale that far exceeds his past efforts means that we have \ncontained him. No, the truth is we have not really contained Saddam. We \nhave largely ignored him, a strategy that simply delays the inevitable \nwhile the stakes grow ever higher.\n  The reason we must deal with this threat now is both clear, \nconvincing, and chilling. Given Saddam's insatiable desire to possess \nchemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, this danger will not \ndisappear on its own, and the price we may have to pay today to \neliminate this threat will prove modest compared to the price we will \nhave to pay tomorrow.\n  As difficult as the decision to authorize military action is, one \nneed only consider how much more difficult it will be when Saddam has a \nnuclear bomb.\n  Finally, let me emphasize my strong belief that the United States \nshould act in concert with our allies, as we pursue a new Security \nCouncil resolution, or in the event we have to resort to military \nforce. While the United States must always retain the right to defend \nitself, our prospects for dealing effectively with the Iraqi threat, \nour standing in the community of nations, and our ability to continue \nto wage an effective global effort against terrorism depend on our \nforging a multilateral coalition.\n  The President deserves great credit for putting together a coalition \nof some 90 nations to combat terrorism. That same kind of effort must \nbe devoted to building a coalition to confront and disarm the Iraqi \nregime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n\n[[Page S10301]]\n\n  Mr. REID. On the continuing saga of speeches, there have been a \ncouple of changes. Senator Cantwell will speak in place of Senator \nHarkin for 10 minutes. Instead of 30 minutes, Senator Schumer will \nspeak for 25 minutes, and Senator Specter will speak for 30 minutes \nrather than 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to make a very brief comment. I \nthought Senator Collins' and Senator DeWine's statements were \noutstanding. They are to be congratulated. I think it added a great \ndeal to this debate and discussion.\n  I do not object to the change in the lineup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution before \nthe Senate. There is no more serious vote we as Senators take than to \nauthorize war. To do so, we must believe that there is great cause--a \ngreat threat to America. I cast my vote today with the great hope that \nthis show of unity from the American Government and from the American \npeople, along with the actions of the international community, will \nachieve our stated goal of disarming Iraq without war.\n  I will vote for this authorization because, after great \nconsideration, I believe Saddam Hussein's acquisition of weapons of \nmass destruction is a great threat. I believe disarming Saddam is a \ngreat cause. And I believe that moving to disarm Saddam--in concert \nwith the international community--is the President's great goal.\n  There is no doubt that the threat Saddam Hussein and his weapons pose \nto this country and to world peace is real. More than a decade has \npassed since we defeated Saddam, but he has not changed. He is the same \nrepressive dictator, willing to overrun his neighbors, and to use \nweapons of mass destruction against his own people.\n  We know that Saddam's regime has produced and is continuing to \nproduce massive quantities of biological and chemical agents. We know \nmuch less about his current nuclear capabilities. But there can be no \ndoubt that he is doing everything in his power to acquire nuclear \nweapons.\n  While there is good reason to believe that Saddam Hussein is not \ninterested in jeopardizing his hold on power, we cannot predict what \nSaddam will do with these capabilities should he have them. The best we \ncan do is to rely on the past as a guide to what the future may hold. \nAnd, the future is now colored by the events of September 11 and the \nsubsequent anthrax attacks of last year. These have given us a \ndisturbing glimpse at a possible worst case scenario. Given Saddam \nHussein's track record--his ejection of weapons inspectors and his \nmurderous ways--I believe the security of our nation depends on \ndisarming Iraq and containing this regime notorious for its deceptions \nand ruthlessness.\n\n  Let me be clear on that point. My vote today is a vote for \ndisarmament, not a vote for regime change. While it is clear that Iraq \nis a rogue regime of the worst kind, going into overthrow it would be \nenormously destabilizing. There are many repressive governments around \nthe world, some of which have access to weapons of mass destruction. \nThere are many ruthless and aggressive nations around the world that \nhave threatened their neighbors. Yet, we cannot be the world's \npoliceman, offering to make the world safe by eliminating each and \nevery tyrant. Should the President choose to use force against Iraq, it \nshould be for the purpose of ensuring unfettered weapons inspections \nand full disarmament. If Saddam Hussein no longer rules as a result of \nour actions, then I say--find--but for us to take action with the \nprimary purpose of overthrowing the Iraqi government would be wrong.\n  The President has vowed to seek the support of the international \ncommunity against Iraq, and my vote today is cast accepting and \nsupporting that position fully. I Believe we should not commit U.S. \ntroops abroad without the support of the international community. The \ncosts are too great for us to take unilateral action unless we have no \nother choice. International involvement will strengthen our hand \nagainst Saddam Hussein, increasing the likelihood that we will be able \nto resume inspections and disarm Iraq.\n  In order for the President to use force, the resolution requires the \nPresident to make a formal determination that relying on diplomatic and \npeaceful means will not adequately protect our national security, or \nlead to the enforcement of U.N. Security Council resolutions. I am \nconfident that this administration is doing everything in its power to \nengage the international community, and to work with our allies to \ncontain Iraq. I am comforted to see the Administration working with the \nUnited Nations on a stronger resolution. The President has rightly \nchallenged the U.N. to put some teeth in the Security Council \nresolutions which have been flouted by Iraq, and he has given the \ninternational community notice that there must be accountability for \nthe U.N. resolutions to have any meaning.\n  Mr. President, my vote today is a vote to support the President in \nhis efforts to disarm Saddam Hussein. My vote is not an endorsement of \na policy of preemptive war, whether it is initiated by the United \nStates or any other country. My vote today is to authorize the \nPresident to gather a world force against the threat of a dangerous \nregime armed with chemical, biological, and possibly nuclear weapons, \nand to disarm that regime. And finally, my vote today is to authorize \nthe President to go to war, in the hope that this strong statement of \nour commitment to disarming Iraq will enable us to do so without war.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the time be charged to Senator \nCantwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Following Senator Schumer is Senator Specter. Senator \nSchumer is here and I ask unanimous consent that he be next in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am honored to be part of this historic \ndebate. Before I get into the substance of my remarks, I thank all of \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their excellent debate. I \nhave listened to a great deal of it. This is how the Senate ought to \nwork and ought to be. This is a fine day for the Senate.\n  Today we are faced with the most solemn decision a lawmaker can make: \nwhether or not to authorize the use of military force. I approach this \ndecision with caution, deliberation, and seriousness.\n  As is our tradition, there has been a great debate on this issue over \nthe last 2 months. We have discussed multiple strategies for dealing \nwith Saddam Hussein, and advanced many arguments for and against the \nuse of military force. Some of these remain under consideration, others \nhave been wisely tabled.\n  For example, the President's original plan of not consulting Congress \nor the United Nations has thankfully been abandoned.\n  In considering our next step, I have spent considerable time \nlistening to experts, attending briefings, talking with constituents, \nand even praying to arrive at a sound conclusion.\n  I believe that there are two points--one on each side, standing in \nequipoise--that focus my attention, and that embody the tension felt by \nall of us.\n  On the one hand, going to war is the most serious, even awesome \ndecision--awesome in the biblical sense of angels trembling before \nGod--that a lawmaker is called on to make.\n  Invasion means that thousands of our sons and daughters, the flowers \nof their generation, will be put in immediate harm's way should we \ninvade.\n  I have an 18-year-old daughter, who along with her sister is the joy \nof my life. When I think of thousands of young people her age who have \nvolunteered to serve, and of the previous generations of Americans who \nhave willingly laid down their lives in past wars, and to whom we are \neternally grateful, I am filled with awe and dread.\n  Poised against the solemnity of war is the fact that a major, if not \nthe primary function of government is to secure the safety of its \npeople--to protect the citizenry from threats, both foreign and \ndomestic.\n  Discharging this responsibility is the very essence of a state and, \nif a real danger exists, the government has a\n\n[[Page S10302]]\n\nsolemn obligation to protect its citizenry.\n  These two looming issues push and pull against one another and yield \nthe ultimate question we debate today` Does Saddam Hussein threaten the \ncitizenry of America to the point that we must now consider the \nunthinkable option of authorizing war in order to protect ourselves?\n  Saddam Hussein is an evil man, a dictator who oppresses his people \nand flouts the mandate of the international community.\n  While this behavior is reprehensible, it is Hussein's vigorous \npursuit of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, and his present \nand potential future support for terrorist acts and organizations, that \nmake him a terrible danger to the people to the United States.\n  If our other efforts to thwart the threat posed by Hussein do not \nwork, is war justified? If justified, how long can we leave Hussein \nalone before we need to act?\n  The struggle for these answers come in a brand new context. Our's is \na brave new post 9/11 world, a time and place where things are \ndifferent and more dangerous than before, much as we wish they weren't.\n  Those who would use terror--or those who would aid and abet that \nterror--pose a new danger to every one of us living in the United \nStates, whether in midtown Manhattan or the wheat fields of Kansas.\n  I have seen firsthand the devastation that comes from being \nunprepared and unprotected. On September 12, I peered into the dark and \nsmoky crater at the World Trade Center with horror, an image that still \nburns in my memory. I have met with the families of victims and heard \nabout their losses, and shed tears over the evil and mendacity of our \nenemies.\n  I know it is my solemn obligation to do everything I can to ensure \nthat my city, State, and country never again endure such an atrocity. \nYet, at the same time, I know that war must be our last resort.\n  When I consider that Hussein could either use or give to terrorists \nweapons of mass destruction--biological, chemical or nuclear--and that \nhe might just be made enough to do it--I find, after careful research, \nthe answer to my question: we cannot afford to leave him alone over the \nnext 5 or even 3 years.\n  I say this with caution and worry. But I have searched my mind and my \nsoul and cannot escape this conclusion: Saddam Hussein left unfettered \nwill at some point create such a danger to our lives that we cannot \nafford to leave him be.\n  In the post 9/11 world, inaction is not an option: at some point, \nHussein must be de-fanged.\n  The question is how and when?\n  Do we mobilize our military for battle? Do we take pains to ensure \nthat other possible options are exhausted first? I say yes to both--\nproceed on parallel tracks: prepared for the worst and work toward, and \npray for, the best; empower the President to act to protect our \nnational security but hope it will not be necessary.\n  Let me first address the question of how by making three points.\n  One, we must certainly try less costly, less ultimate options before \nwe choose the last resort, war.\n  Our first option must be working with our allies at the United \nNations to secure a strict resolution that will compel Saddam Hussein \nto disarm and submit to unlimited and unrestricted inspections.\n  The administration believes a unified Congress that authorizes the \nPresident to wage war will importune the United Nations to take the \nkind of vigorous and unified action that has eluded that body for the \nlast 11 years: real inspections, real sanctions, real threats of \nmilitary force. I hope and pray they are right.\n  Let me repeat: inspections and sanctions backed by the threat of \nmilitary force. These must come first. These are the reasons to favor \nthis resolution.\n  And if after exhausting these options, Saddam Hussein remains a \nthreat, I believe other nations will support and follow us as we pursue \nthe last option, war.\n  Working cooperatively with our allies in the United Nations must be a \nparamount priority for us all. We need their help not simply to force \neffective disarmament in Iraq; they are also key players in an historic \nfight--the war on terror.\n  They provide us with intelligence to protect ourselves from future \nattack; they permit us to pursue our enemies in foreign lands so that \nour foes know that they have no haven from justice; and they cooperate \nto help us choke off terrorists' financial support.\n  Without their help and co-operation, the war on terror would be much \nmore difficult to wage. Therefore, their support for our efforts on \nIraq is essential for our safety as a nation.\n  This new resolution puts far more emphasis on international \ncooperation first and is a substantial improvement over what the \nPresident originally proposed.\n  Unfortunately, time and again, Hussein has shown that the only \nlanguage he understands is the language of power. By empowering the \nPresident to use force, we will send a message to both Hussein and the \nnations of the world that the threat of force is real and that we are \nserious about disarming him.\n  Without this possibility, Hussein will never allow inspections, and \nthe probability of more terror and horror will increase. A determined \nU.N., backed by the possibility of force, may finally convince Saddam \nHussein to submit to the real inspections he has evaded for the last 11 \nyears.\n  Second, should we go to war, the President must see to it that we \ndon't lose vigilance in other aspects of the war on terror, apart form \nIraq, both abroad and at home.\n  Al-Qaida and other groups will continue to target our citizens; we \nmust not let down our guard. Countries like Syria and Iran will \ncontinue to aid and abet terrorists; we must keep a watchful eye.\n  The President and the Secretary of Defense have assured us that, if \nwar become necessary, our military can launch a successful invasion of \nIraq without compromising these efforts.\n  In addition, if there is a war in Iraq, we must not let it diminish \nour efforts to make our homeland more secure--our airports, sea ports, \nrail lines, nuclear facilities, and our communications infrastructure \nall remain unacceptably vulnerable.\n  I have been quite critical of the administration on this point and \nagain urge them to refocus their efforts. We are about to spend \nbillions of dollars to reduce threats abroad; we should spend a similar \namount to safeguard ourselves at home.\n  Third, the President must begin to pay attention to our economy. Up \nto this point, he has failed to do so. The American people are \nparticularly nervous about our economic future and the prospect of war \nonly deepens these fears. The President and Congress must address this \nissue immediately.\n  People must have secure, family-supporting jobs, access to quality \nhealth care, and the ability to pay for necessities like college \ntuition and prescription drugs. Our epoque of prosperity has quickly \ngiven way to an era of uncertainty.\n  I believe we can reverse that trend. Our Nation is big enough and \nstrong enough to secure our safety abroad and increase our prosperity \nat home. I urge the President to pay equal attention to both causes, \nwhich he has not done up to now.\n  As I have discussed, I believe at some point we will have to confront \nSaddam Hussein. We should coordinate with our allies in the United \nNations; maintain focus on terrorist threats at home and abroad; and \nmake a concerted effort to revive our economy.\n  That is how our Government can secure the safety of its people.\n  The second question is when to act. Evidence suggests that we \nprobably have some time before the growing threat posed by Saddam \nHussein would require military action. If I were President, I would not \ngo to war now. My next step would be, as ours must be, to explore fully \nthe compelling force of a determined United Nations.\n  Given the President's recent statements of support for action through \nthe U.N.; if he were to invade Iraq now after passage of the \nresolution, he would have completely misled Congress and the American \npeople.\n  As he said in Cincinnati on Monday.\n\n       Approving this resolution does not mean that military \n     action is imminent or unavoidable. The resolution will tell \n     the United Nations, and all nations, that America speaks with \n     one voice and it is determined to make demands of the \n     civilized world mean something.\n\n\n[[Page S10303]]\n\n\n  I will, therefore, take the President at his word and do my very best \nto hold him to it.\n  I realize the resolution before us would allow the President to act \nsooner than that. If I had drafted the resolution, it would surely have \nbeen different. However, if each of us insisted on our own resolution, \nwe would have 535 resolutions, each with one vote, no concensus--only \nparalysis.\n  In our post 9/11 world, there are no good choices, only less bad \nones. As we move toward final passage, the choice before us is this \nresolution--imperfect as it is--or none at all.\n  Saddam Hussein, his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and the \nwill he has shown to use them, makes the non-at-all option \nunacceptable.\n  So I will vote for this resolution. More than anything else we can \ndo, this resolution will show Hussein and nay naysayers in the United \nNations that we are serious about this war on terrorism. We understand \nthe challenges of this brave new world and we are prepared to meet \nthem.\n  We do not want to send our sons and daughters to war, yet we can \nnever again find ourselves unprepared: the risks are far too great.\n  Certainly action--any type of action--poses real danger and must be \ntaken with great caution and concern. But sometimes doing nothing is \nriskier than acting. This is one of those moments.\n  Therefore, I will cautiously cast my vote for the Lieberman \nresolution. I pray that we shall not have to use the awesome authority \nit grants.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it cannot be repeated too often in the \nChamber of the Senate, the gravity of the action which we are about to \ntake. The House of Representatives has already considered and passed a \nsimilar resolution. For some time now it has been apparent the die has \nbeen cast.\n  Of all of the constitutional responsibilities entrusted to Congress, \nthe authority and responsibility to declare war is the most important. \nThis will be the second most important vote which I will have cast in \nthe 22 years I have had the privilege of serving in the Senate. The \nother vote was the authorization for the use of force against Iraq in \n1991. Now, the same situation confronts us because, albeit by 20/20 \nhindsight, we did not finish the job in 1991.\n  The question is: What course of action would be most likely to avoid \nviolence--that is, an attack on the United States or other peaceful \ncountries, or an attack on Iraq? The most desirable objective would be \nto achieve the disarmament of Iraq in accordance with the commitments \nwhich Iraq made at the conclusion of the Gulf War: to disarm; not to \nproduce chemical or biological weapons, which Iraq has violated; and \nnot to produce nuclear weapons. Iraq has been doing its utmost to \ncreate nuclear weapons.\n  The coalition, which was formed in 1991 by then-President Bush, is \nthe preferable way to go at the present time. We know Saddam Hussein is \ncruel, repressive, and evil. There are hardly sufficient adjectives in \nthe lexicon to adequately describe his vicious character. That has long \nsince been recognized and was the point of a resolution which this \nSenator introduced on March 3, 1998, to constitute a war crimes \ntribunal and to try Saddam Hussein as a war criminal because he had \nviolated the basic laws against humanity. He had engaged in \nreprehensible conduct. That resolution passed the Senate by a vote of \n93 to 0 on March 13, 1998.\n\n  Rather than take time to delineate all of his acts of barbarism and \ncruelty, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this resolution be \nprinted in the Congressional Record at the conclusion of my \npresentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, all the rules have changed since \nSeptember 11 of last year. We now know that in the United States, we \nare no longer invulnerable to attack by outside powers. The breadth of \nthe Atlantic and the Pacific no longer protect us. We learned a very \nbitter lesson on September 11 that has to be taken into account in our \ncurrent conduct.\n  By 20/20 hindsight, it is apparent that we should have acted against \nOsama bin Laden and al-Qaida long before September 11. Osama bin Laden \nwas under indictment for killing Americans in Mogadishu in 1993. Osama \nbin Laden was later indicted for the embassy bombings in Africa in \n1998. We knew Osama bin Laden was implicated in the terrorism against \nthe destroyer USS Cole. We knew Osama bin Laden had carried on a \nworldwide jihad aimed at the United States, and we have not yet \ndetermined the full extent of our knowledge of bin Laden. However, it \nis my personal view, having served as chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee of the 104th Congress, that had we put all of the so-called \ndots together on one screen, we would have had a virtual blueprint as \nto what al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden would do.\n  Now we have the risk as to what to do about Saddam Hussein and what \nto do about Iraq. There is considerable unrest in the United States \ntoday about whatever course of action we take.\n  In a series of town meetings for the last 3 months, I have had many \nconstituents say to me: Why does the United States want to start a war? \nThe United States has never started a war in the past. The United \nStates has only finished wars. Certainly were it not for the experience \non September 11 last year, I think we would not have considered \npreemptive action. However, the authorities and international law do \ncontemplate action where there is a threat--a significant threat.\n  Hugo Grotius, considered the father of international law, said in his \n1925 book ``The Law of War and Peace'' that a nation may use self-\ndefense in anticipation of attack when there is ``present danger.'' He \nsaid, ``It is lawful to kill him who is preparing to kill.''\n  There is no doubt that there is present danger. Is Saddam Hussein \npreparing to attack the United States or other peace-loving nations? \nThere is a real question as to why he would amass chemical weapons in \ngreat quantity, biological weapons in great quantity, delivery systems \ncapable of reaching the United States, and search for nuclear weapons \nwhich we are not sure of, but he may be very close.\n  Another foremost authority on international law, Elihu Root, said in \n1914 that international law did not require a nation to wait to use \nforce in self-defense until it is too late to protect itself.\n  This is the essential legal backdrop where we must consider what \nshould be done. There are a number of alternatives we can take.\n  First, we can do nothing--no resolution, no action--and simply let \nSaddam Hussein continue to flout his commitments made to the United \nNations. However, my view is, after a lot of careful deliberation, \nanalysis, and study, that the risk of inaction is worse than the risk \nof action. There are major risks in action.\n  We have to consider what losses there will be on United States \npersonnel, British personnel, or whoever may join us. We have to \nconsider the risk to Israel, which is in the neighborhood of Iraq. Iraq \nis still at war with Israel. During the Persian Gulf War in 1991, some \n39 Scud missiles were rained down on Israel. While they have a missile \ndefense system, it is not adequate to protect the whole nation. \nNotwithstanding that, Prime Minister Sharon has made public \nannouncements that he endorses United States military action against \nIraq.\n  The risks of not doing anything may subject the United States to a \nrepeat of September 11, which could be even more cataclysmic. We \ncontinue to worry about al-Qaida, which has shown a ruthless disregard \nfor human life and the most barbaric kind of conduct. The risks with \nSaddam Hussein are comparable.\n  Then how do we approach the matter to have the best likelihood of \nproducing the kind of coalition put together by President Bush in 1991? \nPresident Bush, in 1991, was able to motivate the Arab world to move \nagainst Saddam Hussein, as well as the traditional allies.\n  I gave very careful consideration to the amendment proposed by the \nSenator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, where he proposed that we ought to \ngrant the President authority to use force, but only after a United \nNations resolution authorizing the use of force.\n\n[[Page S10304]]\n\n  The advantage of the Levin amendment was that we would have \nmultilateral action, very much like the Gulf War in 1991. The \ndisadvantage would be that we would be subject to the veto of Russia, \nChina, or even France, and that ultimately the United States would be \nceding a considerable quantum of national sovereignty if we gave up our \nright to decide what course of conduct we should take, which is in our \nnational interest.\n  I carefully considered an amendment which had been prepared and \ncirculated by Senator Lugar and Senator Biden. That resolution \nemphasized that the President should exhaust all possible means for an \ninternational coalition. However, if the President found it impossible \nto organize an international coalition and believed that the interests \nof the United States were threatened, in self-defense the President \ncould act on his own or in conjunction with Great Britain. However, the \nPresident would not have to await U.N. action.\n\n  It would seem to me the proposal of Senator Biden and Senator Lugar \nwas the best idea, and I had agreed to cosponsor that resolution or an \namendment offered which contained the essence of that resolution.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Biden-\nLugar resolution be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. STABENOW). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. When Senator Biden and Senator Lugar decided not to \noffer that amendment, I decided to offer it myself. I was surprised \nthat the Biden-Lugar amendment was not offered before 1 o'clock \nyesterday, which was the deadline. I worked with the Parliamentarian to \nstructure a procedure to offer this as a second-degree amendment, and \nfor reasons which were detailed in an earlier speech on the Senate \nfloor, a unanimous consent agreement, in my absence, was entered into, \nand the pending first-degree amendments, to which this would have been \namended, were withdrawn.\n  I do not want to get too much into the arcane details of our Senate \nprocedure, but I was foreclosed from offering that amendment, and I \nthink it is very unfortunate the Senate did not have an opportunity to \nconsider the Biden-Lugar amendment. I am not sanguine to say it would \nhave been enacted, but, on a matter of this importance, I felt very \nstrongly that procedural rules should not bar the Senate from \nconsideration, especially when those procedural rules had been complied \nwith until, as I say, the unanimous consent agreement, in my absence, \nin effect, pulled the rug out from under me.\n  I am concerned that the scope of the present resolution goes a little \nfar in authorizing the President to use ``all means that he determines \nto be appropriate,'' which is a subjective test, contrasted with the \n1991 authorization which said the President was authorized to use force \nin order to implement Security Council resolutions. It is too late in \nthe day to press that distinction, but I think it is important to note.\n  Similarly, I think it is important to note the potential historical \nimpact of the pending resolution which, in effect, delegates to the \nPresident the authority to declare war.\n  Make no mistake about it, this resolution for the use of force is the \nequivalent of a declaration of war, and Congress has the authority to \ndeclare war. However, we are saying in effect that the President may \ndecide at some future time whether war should be declared.\n  In an earlier presentation on the Senate floor, I detailed, to \nsubstantial extent, the considerations and concerns I had about the \nconstitutionality of that kind of a delegation of power.\n  So, in sum, we are faced with a tough decision for the first time in \nthe history of this country to use preemptive action. I commend \nPresident Bush for coming to Congress. Originally he said he did not \nneed to do so and would not do so. Later, he modified that, saying that \nwhile he might not have to, he was coming to Congress. He initially \ntalked about unilateral action, and since has worked very hard in the \nUnited Nations.\n  It may be that the practical effect of what the President is doing \nnow, through Secretary of State Colin Powell, amounts to what was \nsought in the Biden-Lugar resolution, and I do believe the likelihood \nof getting UN action is better if we proceed to give the President the \nauthority to act without UN support because if we said, as Senator \nLevin proposed, that his authority to use force would be conditioned on \na UN resolution, it would be, in effect, an open invitation to the UN \nnot to act, knowing the President and the United States, were limited \nfrom acting if the UN did not, and subjecting our national interests to \nChina, Russia, or France's veto.\n\n  So I do believe, of all the alternatives, giving the President this \npower without conditioning it on previous UN resolutions is the best \nway to get the United Nations to act to enforce the obligations which \nIraq has to the United Nations, running since 1991, which have been in \ndesperate breach.\n  So I do intend to vote for the pending resolution. I supported the \namendment by Senator Byrd to the effect that nothing in this resolution \nshould be deemed to impede or affect the constitutional authority of \nthe Congress to declare war. Ordinarily you would not think a statute \nor a resolution would jeopardize constitutional authority, which is \nparamount, but I am concerned about the issue of erosion, and that is \nwhy I supported Senator Byrd in the amendment that nothing in this \nresolution should undercut the authority of Congress to declare war.\n  On this solemn occasion, when it appears now highly likely--or \nperhaps more accurately, virtually certain--that this resolution will \nbe enacted by both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and \nthat we are on a very difficult course, it is hoped that the tremendous \npower of the United States, in conjunction with other countries, will \nbe sufficient to bring Saddam Hussein to his senses, if he has any, \nthat he ought to submit to inspections. If he does not submit to \ninspections, then it is confirmation that he, in fact, has something to \nhide and there is something really at risk.\n  So among the very many complex considerations, it is my considered \njudgment the adoption of this resolution is the best course for our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 78\n\n       Whereas the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg \n     was convened to try individuals for crimes against \n     international law committed during World War II;\n       Whereas the Nuremberg tribunal provision which held that \n     ``crimes against international law are committed by men, not \n     by abstract entities, and only by punishing individuals who \n     commit such crimes can the provisions of international law be \n     enforced'' is as valid today as it was in 1946;\n       Whereas, on August 2, 1990, and without provocation, Iraq \n     initiated a war of aggression against the sovereign state of \n     Kuwait;\n       Whereas the Charter of the United Nations imposes on its \n     members the obligations to ``refrain in their international \n     relations from the threat or use of force against the \n     territorial integrity or political independence of any \n     state'';\n       Whereas the leaders of the Government of Iraq, a country \n     which is a member of the United Nations, did violate this \n     provision of the United Nations Charter;\n       Whereas the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of \n     Civilian Persons in Times of War (the Fourth Geneva \n     Convention) imposes certain obligations upon a belligerent \n     State, occupying another country by force of arms, in order \n     to protect the civilian population of the occupied territory \n     from some of the ravages of the conflict;\n       Whereas both Iraq and Kuwait are parties to the Fourth \n     Geneva Convention;\n       Whereas the public testimony of witnesses and victims has \n     indicated that Iraqi officials violated Article 27 of the \n     Fourth Geneva Convention by their inhumane treatment and acts \n     of violence against the Kuwaiti civilian population;\n       Whereas the public testimony of witnesses and victims has \n     indicated that Iraqi officials violated Articles 31 and 32 of \n     the Fourth Geneva Convention by subjecting Kuwait civilians \n     to physical coercion, suffering and extermination in order to \n     obtain information;\n       Whereas, in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, from \n     January 18, 1991, to February 25, 1991, Iraq did fire 39 \n     missiles on Israel in 18 separate attacks with the intent of \n     making it a party to war and with the intent of killing or \n     injuring innocent civilians, killing 2 persons directly, \n     killing 12 people indirectly (through heart attacks, improper \n     use of gas masks, choking), and injuring more than 200 \n     persons;\n       Whereas Article 146 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states \n     that persons committing ``grave breaches'' are to be \n     apprehended and subjected to trial;\n       Whereas, on several occasions, the United Nations Security \n     Council has found Iraq's\n\n[[Page S10305]]\n\n     treatment of Kuwaiti civilians to be in violation of \n     international law;\n       Whereas, in Revolution 665, adopted on August 25, 1990, the \n     United Nations Security Council deplored ``the loss of \n     innocent life stemming from the Iraq invasion of Kuwait'';\n       Whereas, in Revolution 670, adopted by the United Nations \n     Security Council on September 25, 1990, it condemned further \n     ``the treatment by Iraqi forces on Kuwait nationals and \n     reaffirmed that the Fourth Geneva Convention applied to \n     Kuwait'';\n       Whereas, in Resolution 674, the United Nations Security \n     Council demanded that Iraq cease mistreating and oppressing \n     Kuwaiti nationals in violation of the Convention and reminded \n     Iraq that it would be liable for any damage or injury \n     suffered by Kuwaiti nationals due to Iraq's invasion and \n     illegal occupation;\n       Whereas Iraq is a party to the Prisoners of War Convention \n     and there is evidence and testimony that during the Persian \n     Gulf War, Iraq violated articles of the Convention by its \n     physical and psychological abuse of military and civilian \n     POW's including members of the international press;\n       Whereas Iraq has committed deliberate and calculated crimes \n     of environmental terrorism, inflicting grave risk to the \n     health and well-being of innocent civilians in the region by \n     its willful ignition of 732 Kuwaiti oil wells in January and \n     February, 1991:\n       Whereas President Clinton found ``compelling evidence'' \n     that the Iraqi Intelligence Service directed and pursued an \n     operation to assassinate former President George Bush in \n     April 1993 when he visited Kuwait;\n       Whereas Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials have \n     systematically attempted to destroy the Kurdish population in \n     Iraq through the use of chemical weapons against civilian \n     Kurds, campaigns in 1987-88 which resulted in the \n     disappearance of more than 182,000 persons and the \n     destruction of more than 4,000 villages, the placement of \n     more than 10 million landmines in Iraqi Kurdistan, and ethnic \n     cleansing in the city of Kirkuk;\n       Whereas the Republic of Iraq is a signatory to \n     international agreements including the Universal Declaration \n     on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights, the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and the POW Convention, \n     and is obligated to comply with these international \n     agreements;\n       Whereas section 8 of Resolution 687 of the United Nations \n     Security Council, adopted on April 3, 1991, requires Iraq to \n     unconditionally accept the destruction, removal, or \n     rendering harmless, under international supervision of all \n     chemical and biological weapons and all stocks of agents \n     and all related subsystems and components and all \n     research, development, support, and manufacturing \n     facilities;\n       Whereas Saddam Hussein and the Republic of Iraq have \n     persistently and flagrantly violated the terms of Resolution \n     687 with respect to elimination of weapons of mass \n     destruction and inspections by international supervisors;\n       Whereas there is good reason to believe that Iraq continues \n     to have stockpiles of chemical and biological munitions, \n     missiles capable of transporting such agents, and the \n     capacity to produce such weapons of mass destruction, putting \n     the international community at risk;\n       Whereas, on February 22, 1993, the United Nations Security \n     Council adopted Resolution 808 establishing an international \n     tribunal to try individuals accused of violations of \n     international law in the former Yugoslavia;\n       Whereas, on November 8, 1994, the United Nations Security \n     Council adopted Resolution 955 establishing an international \n     tribunal to try individuals accused of the commission of \n     violations of international law in Rwanda;\n       Whereas more than 70 individuals have faced indictments \n     handed down by the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     Former Yugoslavia in the Hague for war crimes and crimes \n     against humanity in the former Yugoslavia, leading in the \n     first trial to the sentencing of a Serb jailer to 20 years in \n     prison;\n       Whereas the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda has \n     indicted 31 individuals, with three trials occurring at \n     present and 27 individuals in custody;\n       Whereas the United States has to date spent more than $24 \n     million for the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     Former Yugoslavia and more than $20 million for the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda;\n       Whereas officials such as former President George Bush, \n     Vice President Al Gore, General Normal Schwarzkopf and others \n     have labeled Saddam Hussein a war criminal and called for his \n     indictment;\n       Whereas a failure to try and punish leaders and other \n     persons for crimes, against international law establishes a \n     dangerous precedent and negatively impacts the value of \n     deterrence to future illegal acts;\n       Resolved, by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n       That the President should--\n       (1) call for the creation of a commission under the \n     auspices of the United Nations to establish an international \n     record of the criminal culpability of Saddam Hussein and \n     other Iraqi officials;\n       (2) call for the United Nations to form an international \n     criminal tribunal for the purpose of indicting, prosecuting, \n     and imprisoning Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials who \n     are responsible for crimes against humanity, genocide, and \n     other violations of international law; and\n       (3) upon the creation of such an international criminal \n     tribunal, week the reprogramming of necessary funds to \n     support the efforts of the tribunal, including the gathering \n     of evidence necessary to indict, prosecute and imprison \n     Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials.\n                                  ____\n\n\n

Res  \n\n       Authorizing the use of the United States Armed Forces \n     pursuant to a new resolution of the United Nations Security \n     Council seeking to enforce the destruction and dismantlement \n     of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program and prohibited \n     ballistic missiles program or pursuant to the United States \n     right of individual or collective self-defense if the \n     Security Council fails to act.\n       Whereas under United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     687 (1991), which effected a formal cease-fire following the \n     Persian Gulf War, Iraq agreed to destroy or dismantle, under \n     international supervision, its nuclear, chemical, and \n     biological weapons programs (hereafter in this joint \n     resolution referred to as Iraq's ``weapons of mass \n     destruction program''), as well as its program to develop or \n     acquire ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 \n     kilometers (hereafter in this joint resolution referred to as \n     Iraq's ``prohibited ballistic missile program''), and \n     undertook unconditionally not to develop any such weapons \n     thereafter.\n       Whereas on numerous occasions since 1991, the United \n     Nations Security Council has reaffirmed Resolution 687, most \n     recently in Resolution 1284, which established a new weapons \n     inspection regime to ensure Iraqi compliance with its \n     obligations under Resolution 687;\n       Whereas on numerous occasions since 1991, the United States \n     and the United Nations Security Council have condemned Iraq's \n     failure to fulfill its obligations under Resolution 687 to \n     destroy or dismantle its weapons of mass destruction program \n     and its prohibited ballistic missile program;\n       Whereas Iraq under Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons in \n     its war with Iran in the 1980s and against the Kurdish \n     population in northern Iraq in 1988;\n       Whereas since 1990, the United States has considered Iraq \n     to be a state sponsor of terrorism;\n       Whereas Iraq's failure to comply with its international \n     obligations to destroy or dismantle its weapons of mass \n     destruction program and its prohibited ballistic missile \n     program, its record of using weapons of mass destruction, its \n     record of using force against neighboring states, and its \n     support for international terrorism require a strong \n     diplomatic, and if necessary, military response by the \n     international community, led by the United States: Now, \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Authorization for the Use of \n     Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.''\n\n     SECTION 2. AUTHORIZATION FOR THE USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED \n                   FORCES.\n\n       (a) Authorization for the Use of Force.--The President, \n     subject to subsection (b), is authorized to use United States \n     Armed Forces--\n       (1) to enforce United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     687, and other resolutions approved by the Council which \n     govern Iraqi compliance with Resolution 687, in order to \n     secure the dismantlement or destruction of Iraq's weapons of \n     mass destruction program and its prohibited ballistic missile \n     program; or\n       (2) in the exercise of individual or collective self-\n     defense, to defend the United States or allied nations \n     against a grave threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass \n     destruction program and its prohibited ballistic missile \n     program.\n       (b) Requirement for Determination That Use of Force is \n     Necessary.--Before exercising the authority granted by \n     subsection (a), the President shall make available to the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro \n     tempore of the Senate his determination that--\n       (1) the United States has attempted to seek, through the \n     United Nations Security Council, adoption of a resolution \n     that after September 12, 2002 under Chapter VII of the United \n     Nations Charter authorizing the action described in \n     subsection (a)(1), and such resolution has been adopted; or\n       (2) that the threat to the United States or allied nations \n     posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program and \n     prohibited ballistic missile program is so grave that the use \n     of force is necessary pursuant to subsection (a)(2), \n     notwithstanding the failure of the Security Council to \n     approve a resolution described in paragraph (1).\n\n     SECTION 3. CONSULTATION AND REPORTS.\n\n       (a) Consultation.--The President shall keep Congress fully \n     and currently informed on matters relevant to this joint \n     resolution.\n       (b) Initial Report.--\n       (1) As soon as practicable, but not later than 30 days \n     after exercising the authority under subsection 2(a), the \n     President shall submit to Congress a report setting forth \n     information--\n       (A) about the degree to which other nations will assist the \n     United States in the use of force in Iraq;\n       (B) regarding measures the United States is taking, or \n     preparaing to take, to protect\n\n[[Page S10306]]\n\n     key allies in the region from armed attack by Iraq; and\n       (C) on planning to establish a secure environment in the \n     immediate aftermath of the use of force (including estimated \n     expenditures by the United States and allied nations), and, \n     if necessary, prepare for the political and economic \n     reconstruction of Iraq following the use of force.\n       (2) Classification of report.-- The report required by \n     paragraph (1) may be submitted in classified form.\n       (c) Subsequent Reports.--Following transmittal of the \n     report required by subsection (b), the President shall submit \n     a report to Congress every 60 days thereafter on the status \n     of United States diplomatic, military and reconstruction \n     operations with respect to Iraq.\n\n     SECTION 4. WAR POWERS RESOLUTION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Specific Statutory Authorization.--Consistent with \n     section 8(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution, the Congress \n     declares that section 2 is intended to constitute specific \n     statutory authorization within the meaning of section 5(b) of \n     the War Powers Resolution.\n       (b) Applicability of Other Requirements.--Nothing in this \n     resolution supersedes any requirement of the War Powers \n     Resolution.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, just so the record is clear, he is filling \nthe spot Senator Carper had.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator from Nevada very much.\n  Madam President, we are here today to debate one of the most \ndifficult decisions that I, at least, have ever had to make in my 18 \nyears in the Senate. There is no doubt in my mind Saddam Hussein is a \ndespicable dictator, a war criminal, a regional menace, and a real and \ngrowing threat to the United States. The difficulty of this decision is \nthat while Saddam Hussein represents a threat, each of the options for \ndealing with him poses a threat--to America's service members, to our \ncitizens, and to our role in the world at large.\n  It is clear none of the options that confront us are easy or risk \nfree. For all of us, the upcoming vote on this critical issue will \nreflect our best judgment on which path will minimize the risk to our \nfellow Americans because we all know the risk cannot be eliminated. And \nthat judgment will, in turn, depend on a complex interaction of many \nfactors, some of which we do not know and perhaps cannot know.\n  It is clear military operations against Saddam Hussein, of the sort \nthat are being discussed, pose serious risks, and we should all admit \nto that. Any military campaign runs very serious risks to our service \nmembers. On paper, we surely have an overwhelming advantage against \nSaddam Hussein--in the skill, the technology, and, of course, \ndedication of our Armed Forces.\n  We defeated Saddam quickly and conclusively in 1991. In the decade \nsince, our force effectiveness has improved dramatically, while many of \nSaddam's capabilities have deteriorated. But a new battle against \nSaddam Hussein, if it comes to that, will be very different and much \nmore difficult.\n  A U.S. victory might be quick, and it might be painless. One hopes \nthat will be the case, but it may not be so. The American people need \nto know a war against Saddam will have high costs, including loss of \nAmerican lives. Our confident assertions that Saddam Hussein will \nquickly be deposed by his own people have in the past been too \noptimistic.\n  Presumably, Saddam Hussein will be more determined to use all the \nweapons and tactics in his arsenal, if he believes that our ultimate \ngoal is to remove him from power. The administration assures us our \ntroops have equipment and uniforms that will protect them from that \nrisk, should that risk arise. We can only hope to God they are right.\n  We also acknowledge that any military operations against Saddam \nHussein pose potential risks to our own homeland. Saddam's government \nhas contact with many international terrorist organizations that likely \nhave cells here in the United States.\n  Finally, we also need to recognize that should we go to war with \nIraq, it could have a serious impact on America's role in the world and \nthe way the rest of the world responds, therefore, to America's \nleadership.\n  We are told that if Saddam Hussein is overthrown, American soldiers \nwould be welcomed into Baghdad with liberation parades. That may be \ntrue. But it is true the people who have suffered most at Saddam's \nhands are, of course, his own citizens.\n  For many people around the world, an American-led victory over Saddam \nHussein would not be cause for celebration. No matter how strong our \ncase, there will inevitably be some who will see a U.S.-led action \nagainst Iraq as a cause for concern. At its most extreme, that concern \nfeeds the terrorist paranoia that drives their mission to hurt America. \nWe can affect how deep that sentiment runs by how we conduct \nourselves--whether we work with allies, whether we show ourselves to be \ncommitted to the reconstruction of Iraq and to the reconciliation with \nthe Arab world. But we ignore all of that at our peril.\n  Clearly, there are many risks associated with the resolution we are \nconsidering today, but it is equally clear that doing nothing and \npreserving the status quo also poses serious risks. Those risks are \nless visible, and their frame of time is less certain. But after a \ngreat deal of consultation and soul searching, I have come to the \nconclusion that the risks to our citizens and to our Nation of doing \nnothing are too great to bear.\n  There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working \naggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear \nweapons within the next 5 years. He could have it earlier if he is able \nto obtain fissile materials on the outside market, which is possible--\ndifficult but possible. We also should remember we have always \nunderestimated the progress that Saddam Hussein has been able to make \nin the development of weapons of mass destruction.\n  When Saddam Hussein obtains nuclear capabilities, the constraints \nthat he feels will diminish dramatically, and the risk to America's \nhomeland, as well as to America's allies, will increase even more \ndramatically. Our existing policies to contain or counter Saddam will \nbecome, therefore, irrelevant.\n  Americans will return to a situation like we faced in the cold war, \nwaking each morning knowing that we are at risk from nuclear blackmail \nby a dictatorship that has declared itself to be our enemy, only back \nthen our Communist foes--in those so-called good old days, which, of \ncourse, they were not, but in making the comparison between now and \nthen, our Communist foes were a rational and predictable bureaucracy. \nThis time our nuclear foe would be an unpredictable and often \nirrational individual, a dictator who has demonstrated that he is \nprepared to violate international law and initiate unprovoked attacks \nwhen he believes it serves any of his whims or purposes to so do.\n\n  The global community in the form of the United Nations has declared \nrepeatedly, through multiple resolutions, that the frightening prospect \nof a nuclear-armed Saddam cannot come to pass, but the U.N. has been \nunable to enforce these resolutions. We must eliminate that threat now \nbefore it is too late. But that isn't just a future threat. Saddam's \nexisting biological and chemical weapons capabilities pose real threats \nto America today, tomorrow.\n  Saddam has used chemical weapons before, both against Iraq's enemies \nand against his own people. He is working to develop delivery systems \nlike missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles that could bring these \ndeadly weapons against U.S. forces and U.S. facilities in the Middle \nEast. He could make these weapons available to many terrorist groups, \nthird parties, which have contact with his government. Those groups, in \nturn, could bring those weapons into the United States and unleash a \ndevastating attack against our citizens. I fear that greatly.\n  We cannot know for certain that Saddam will use the weapons of mass \ndestruction that he currently possesses or that he will use them \nagainst us. But as we do know, Saddam has the capability to do that. We \nknow that very\n\n[[Page S10307]]\n\nwell. Rebuilding that capability has been a higher priority for Saddam \nthan the welfare of his own people, and he has ill will toward \nAmericans.\n  I am forced to conclude on all the evidence that Saddam poses a \nsignificant risk. Some argue it would be totally irrational for Saddam \nHussein to initiate an attack against the mainland United States and \nbelieve he would not do so. But if Saddam thought he could attack \nAmerica through terrorist proxies and cover the trail back to Baghdad, \nhe might not think it is so irrational. If he thought, as he got older \nand looked around an impoverished and isolated Iraq, his principal \nlegacy to the Arab world to be a brutal attack on the United States, he \nmight not think it is so irrational. If he thought the U.S. would be \ntoo paralyzed with fear to respond, he might not think it was too \nirrational.\n  Saddam has misjudged what he can get away with and how the United \nStates and the world will respond many times before. At the end of the \nday, we cannot let the security of the American citizens rest in the \nhands of somebody whose track record gives us every reason to fear that \nhe is prepared to use the weapons he has used against his enemies \nbefore.\n  As the attacks of September 11 demonstrated, the immense \ndestructiveness of modern technology means we can no longer afford to \nwait around for a smoking gun. The fact that an attack on our homeland \nhas not occurred since September 11 cannot give us any false sense of \nsecurity that one will not occur in the future or on any day. We no \nlonger have that luxury.\n  September 11 changed America. It made us realize we must deal \ndifferently with the very real threat, the overwhelming threat and \nreality of terrorism, whether it comes from shadowy groups operating in \nthe mountains of Afghanistan or in 70 other countries around the world \nor in our own country.\n  There has been some debate over how ``imminent'' a threat Iraq poses. \nI do believe Iraq poses an imminent threat. I also believe after \nSeptember 11, that question is increasingly outdated.\n  It is in the nature of these weapons that he has and the way they are \ntargeted against civilian populations, that documented capability and \ndemonstrated intent may be the only warning we get. To insist on \nfurther evidence could put some of our fellow Americans at risk. Can we \nafford to take that chance? I do not think we can.\n  The President has rightly called Saddam Hussein's efforts to develop \nweapons of mass destruction a grave and gathering threat to Americans. \nThe global community has tried but has failed to address that threat \nover the past decade. I have come to the inescapable conclusion that \nthe threat posed to America by Saddam's weapons of mass destruction is \nso serious that despite the risks--and we should not minimize the \nrisks--we must authorize the President to take the necessary steps to \ndeal with that threat. So I will vote for the Lieberman-McCain \nresolution.\n  This is a difficult vote, but I could not sleep knowing that, faced \nwith this grave danger to the people of my State and to all Americans, \nI have voted for nothing more than continuing the policies that have \nfailed to address this problem over the years.\n  Two months ago, or even a month ago, I would have been reluctant to \nsupport this resolution. At the time, it appeared that the \nadministration's principal goal was a unilateral invasion of Iraq, \nclear and simple, without fully exploring every option to resolve this \npeacefully, without trying to enlist the support of other countries, \nwithout any limitation on the use of United States force in the Middle \nEast region.\n  The original use of force resolution that the White House sent to the \nCongress was far too broad in its scope and ignored the possibility \nthat diplomatic efforts might just be able to resolve this crisis \nwithout bloodshed. Moreover, it appeared that the administration \nplanned to cut back its efforts in the war on terrorism and shift all \nof its attention and resources to Iraq, and that would have been a \ntragic mistake.\n  I believe the war against global terrorist networks remains the \ngreatest current threat to the security of America over the long term \nand to our forces overseas. We have seen that in Kuwait in just the \nlast week. America cannot be diverted or distracted from our war on \nterrorism. In the past month or so, in my judgment, we have begun to \nsee an encouraging shift in the administration's approach. The \nPresident stated earlier this week that war is neither imminent nor \nunavoidable. The administration has assured us that whatever action we \ntake toward Iraq, it will not be permitted to divert resources or \nattention from the war on terrorism internationally.\n  Secretary Powell has been working with the U.N. Security Council to \nput together a new resolution to make clear that Iraq must disarm, or \nface the consequences. We have already begun to see some encouraging \nmovement on the issue of Iraqi disarmament. Other Security Council \nmembers--I mentioned France and Russia, as well as other Arab States in \nthe Middle East--have begun to talk seriously about forcing Saddam to \ncomply with the U.N. resolutions. Saddam Hussein has begun to make \noffers on inspections and disarmament, offers that, while inadequate so \nfar, indicate that he has at least begun to move off his hardline \nposition against inspections.\n  Obviously, much important and very hard work remains to be done. That \nwill take tough negotiating with the other members of the U.N. and a \nfirm line with Iraq. We need to be realistic about how best to move \nforward.\n  Any headway we are making toward getting Saddam to disarm has not \noccurred in a vacuum. U.N. members did not just suddenly decide to \ndebate a new resolution forcing Iraq to disarm. Saddam Hussein did not \njust suddenly decide to reinvite U.N. inspectors and to remove the \nroadblocks that had hindered their efforts in the past. Progress is \noccurring because the President told the United Nations General \nAssembly that if the U.N. is not prepared to enforce its resolution on \nIraqi disarmament, the United States will be forced to act.\n\n  At this point, America's best opportunity to move the United Nations \nand Iraq to a peaceful resolution of this crisis is by making clear \nthat the United States is prepared to act on our own, if necessary, as \none nation, indivisible. Sometimes, the rest of the world looks to \nAmerica not just for the diversity of our debate, or the vitality of \nour ideals, but for the firm resolve that the world's leader must \ndemonstrate if intractable global problems are to be solved--and \ndangerous ones at that. So that is the context in which I am \napproaching this vote.\n  This resolution does authorize the use of force, if necessary. Saddam \nHussein represents a grave threat to the United States, and I have \nconcluded we must use force to deal with him if all other means fail. \nThat is just the core issue. It is the only core issue. And whether we \nvote on it now, or in January, or in 6 months, or in 1 year, that is \nthe issue we will all have to confront.\n  War--if it comes to that--will cost money. I and the Presiding \nOfficer dearly wish we could use that money for other domestic \npurposes--to address the very real needs that West Virginia, Michigan, \nand other States face in this tough economy. But, ultimately, defending \nAmerica's citizens from danger, their safety, and their security is a \nresponsibility whose costs we must bear because this is not just a \nresolution authorizing war; in my judgment, it is a resolution that \ncould provide a path to peace. I hope that by voting on this resolution \nnow, while the negotiations at the U.N. are continuing, this resolution \nwill show to the world that the American people are united in our \nresolve to deal with the Iraqi threat, and it will strengthen the hand \nof the administration in making a final effort to try to get the U.N. \nto deal with the issue. Given the difficulty of trying to build a \ncoalition in the United Nations, I could not, in good conscience, tie \nthe President's hands.\n  The administration is in negotiations on which the safety and \nsecurity of all Americans depend. I believe we must give the President \nthe authority he will need, if there is any hope to bring those \nnegotiations to a successful conclusion. So I will vote for the \nLieberman-McCain resolution. Preventing a war with Saddam Hussein--\nwhether now or later--must be a top priority. I believe this resolution \nwill strengthen the President's hand to resolve that crisis.\n\n[[Page S10308]]\n\n  By my vote, I say to the U.N. and our allies that America is united \nin our resolve to deal with Saddam Hussein and that the U.N. must act \nto eliminate the weapons of mass destruction.\n  By my vote, I say to Saddam Hussein: Disarm or the United States will \nbe forced to act. We have that resolve.\n  September 11 changed our world forever. We may not like it, but it is \nthe world in which we live. When there is a grave threat to Americans' \nlives, we have a responsibility to take action to prevent it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have had a number of unanimous consent \nrequests granted that listed the order of speakers. In effect, now, we \nhave a new one that will make more sense. We have cleared this with \nboth cloakrooms:\n  Senator Sessions will be recognized for 30 minutes; Senator Carper \nwill be recognized for 20 minutes; Senator Ensign will be recognized \nfor 20 minutes; Senator Cantwell will be recognized for 30 minutes; \nSenator Bob Smith will be recognized for 15 minutes; Senator Bob Graham \nwill be recognized for 30 minutes; Senator Conrad will be recognized \nfor 30 minutes.\n  Following these speakers, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nvote on final passage of H.J. Res. 114, as under the previous order. \nAfter that, if anybody else wishes to speak--and we have a number of \npeople who have indicated they would like to--they can do that. It will \nbe probably 12:30 or 1 o'clock if everybody uses their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, people have been granted this time. If \nthey could read a little bit faster or eliminate a paragraph or two, \nsome people would appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, very briefly, I thank the Senator from \nNevada. As I understand it, I ask the Senator from Nevada, we have \nSenator Gordon Smith, Senator Shelby, Senator Fitzgerald, Senator \nSantorum, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Dayton, Senator Murkowski, and \nSenator Mikulski who are still scheduled to speak after that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair, and I thank the leadership for the \nwork they have put into this bill. I thank Senator McCain. It is great \nto see Senator John Warner here. He helped write the 1991 gulf war \nresolution and led its successful vote in this body, which served the \nbody exceedingly well. That was a courageous act that he led at that \ntime.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my colleague for his kind \nremarks.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, any contemplation of the use of military \nforce is a very serious matter and calls for the Congress, the peoples' \nrepresentatives, to be engaged and to discuss and debate the issue. I \ndo not believe the Lord is pleased when his children fight--and \naccording to my faith, all people are creatures of one Lord and \nprecious in his sight.\n  In my view the resort to war can never be considered something to \nglory in but must be viewed as an act that is taken as a result of \nhuman failure, and where after serious consideration, it is concluded \nthat alternatives are worse.\n  When the status quo presents more dangers than the war the most just, \nthe most logical, the most moral thing is to fight. I wish it were not \nso but my experience and my best judgement tells me this is the way we \nlive in this transitory world. I truly respect the pacifist--it is a \nposition with a long and honored tradition in my faith--but whether it \nis by judgement or lack of faith, I do not go there.\n  To have a just war one must reasonably believe the ultimate goal of \nthe violence will be to produce a good result--a better condition than \nexisted before. And while as leaders of the people of the United States \nwe must focus primarily on the just national security interests of our \ncountry, we, as enlightened, moral and decent people, ought to ask \nourselves, whether our actions will ultimately benefit the world and \neven our adversary. Will the future for all be better or not?\n  Further, we should consider our national heritage of promoting peace, \nfreedom and prosperity. War obviously destroys peace, but if the result \ncan be to create a safer and more peaceful world, war can be an \ninstrument of peace.\n  Afghanistan has had two decades of war. Our strong military action to \ntotally defeat the Taliban government has given that brutalized country \nits best chance for peace, freedom and prosperity in generations. We \ncannot guarantee it, but great optimism exists for a positive future \nthat could never have been possible under the oppressive, hateful, \nbigoted Taliban.\n  The practitioners of the art of ``realpolitic'' may sneer at the \nconcept of free countries in the Arab world, but I am proud of the \nresults of our military action in Afghanistan, not only because it \nrepresented just retribution for their support of attacks on the United \nStates but also because we have left that oppressed country better than \nwe found it. We liberated the people of Afghanistan from the most \nbrutal circumstances.\n  Can anyone forget the scenes of men beating women on the streets for \nthe most insignificant or imagined acts? No, I am proud of our wise and \nbrilliant use of force.\n  I also remember such actions played a positive role in our nation's \nfounding. Indeed, one can go down to Yorktown, as I did recently, and \nvisit the site of the final American victory over the British. As one \nconsiders that climactic victory, after years of war and many defeats \ninflicted by the skilled British military, one learns that our victory \nwould not have been possible but for the intervention of the large \nFrench fleet at Yorktown, and that fleet's victory over the British in \na major battle.\n  With no ability to retreat or resupply, the cornered General \nCornwallis had no choice but to surrender. This French action aided our \nliberation immensely and have served as a bond of loyalty between our \nnations even to this day. If the French were justified in the use of \nmilitary force to help liberate us, may not our use of force in years \nto come be seen by the world and the people of Iraq in the same \npositive way. Can such a positive result be guaranteed? Of course not, \nbut I and many others believe the chances for any improved Iraq's \ngovernment are greater than some think.\n  Still, we must clearly remember that we cannot guarantee any nation, \nso liberated, future success. There are limits on our power, our reach \nand our resources. I am very pleased that under the leadership of \nPresident Bush and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, we have only a few \nmore soldiers in Afghanistan than we have in Kosovo. The fate of \nAfghanistan will be up to their people ultimately. We can help, and we \nhave, but their final fate will be in their hands--as it should be.\n  It is also important to consider that the threats to the United \nStates do not come from free and prosperous states but failing ones. \nThey fail because of flawed governments.\n  Thus, I say the President is right to reject a half century of \nvalueless, cynical, diplomatic wordplay, words that sound good but are \ntotally disconnected from reality, and to establish a new foreign \npolicy based on our venerable heritage of honest and direct discussion \nof issues and values.\n\n  I am somewhat puzzled that those who have long advocated our taking \nsteps to aid poor countries in the world do not recognize the \npossibilities for good that can come from a change in government. It \nseems there is still a strong strain of ``blame America first'' about. \nMany had rather complain about our imperfections, real or imagined, \nthan to see the possibilities for a better world.\n  I strongly believe that America is a force for good in the world. The \nLondon based ``Economist'' magazine has recently produced a special \ninsert for that magazine called ``Present at the Creation: A Survey of \nAmerica's World Role''. It concludes that a strong America is good for \nthe world and notes that America's national interest, ``offers the \nclearest match there is to a world interest. The desire for unimpeded \ntrade, the rule of law, safety and security, the protection of property \nand the free movement of property and capital match world needs, not \njust American ones.''\n\n[[Page S10309]]\n\n  We are a good, decent and, yes, powerful world leader. I am proud of \nour history of being, time after time, on the right side of world \nissues and am very pleased we have a President that understands the new \nworld we are in and who has the courage worthy of the great people he \nleads.\n  It is important to point out that if force cannot be avoided, our \naction will not be against the people of Iraq or the nation of Iraq, \nbut it will be against the brutal, illegal, Saddam Hussein regime. It \nis a regime that has caused more destruction than any existing in the \nworld today. The people of Iraq will be the greatest beneficiaries of \nour victory. At this moment, pursuant to U.N. resolutions, our forces \nare attempting to enforce an embargo against Iraq. It has been only \npartially successful and it is leaking more and more. The Arab world \ncomplains, with much truth, that the embargo only hurts the people, the \nchildren of Iraq. Saddam Hussein continues to build places and weapons \nof mass destruction while his people suffer.\n  It has been eleven years. How long must the United States continue to \ncarry this burden to enforce a policy that is not significantly hurting \nthe regime but hurts innocent civilians? How can we justify this \nmorally?\n  There are certainly dangers in military action. While we can hope and \nbelieve that if war commences it will go well and that our people will \nbe viewed as liberators and that many Iraqi forces will not fight but \ndefect to our side. We cannot know that. While I am certain we will \nprevail, I cannot know for certain how tough this war will be. We must \nrecognize there are dangers. The American people understand there are \nrisks and so do all of us. One thing is sure, our magnificent military \nwill work tirelessly to prevail in this conflict with the lowest \npossible number of personnel killed or injured. But, we know the risks \nare great and losses could be great. While our forces will work to \nminimize civilian casualties and to solicit Iraqi military units to \ndefect, such is not certain. There could be civilian losses.\n  As to the risk of an attack on Israel, cited by many, we should ask \nwhat Israel has to say about it. They are clear. It is a decision that \nis left to the United States. If you must act, do so. Israel is \nprepared to take the risk.\n  Well, that's the big picture as I see it. Our motive is good, our \ngoals positive and realistic, and our leaders honest, careful, \nprincipled and have the courage to act on those beliefs. Some jaded \npoliticos sneer and say that this is just politics, but I know it is \nnot. I know the vision that President Bush has to protect his people \nand improve the world. His courage has already placed him at personal \nrisk. These people, after all, have tried to assassinate one former \nPresident of the United States. In addition, in acting on his beliefs, \nhe is laying it all on the line. He has told us repeatedly he would not \nlook to polls to decide what actions he should take as our leader.\n  President Bush is acting honorably and with integrity. He is \ninforming the American people, consulting with Congress, conferring \nwith world leaders and trying to work with the U.N. apparatus. He has \naltered his tactics to win support from others, but his goal has not \nchanged. Ultimately, if his views are proven false, and all the \npredicted disasters come true then he will surely pay the price at the \nballot box. But, I don't think so. Neither do most of those in this \nbody. I think he is correct and though the road may be difficult and \ndangerous, I am confident his Iraq policies will succeed as have his \npolicies in Afghanistan. I truly believe that peace, freedom, security \nand prosperity will be enhanced not reduced as a result of our actions.\n  It is important to recognize that while this resolution could lead to \nwar, it also offers the best chance we have to avoid war and to achieve \nsecurity. The distinguished Democratic Chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee has objected to the President's statement that he \nhas not decided to go to war while he asks for a resolution to allow \nwar. But, this is not contradictory. This Congress knows the score. We \nknow Saddam Hussein's deceitful manipulations, his lies, his violence \nagainst the Iraqi people and their neighbors, and the constant attacks \nagainst our aircraft, even firing on them with missiles this last week. \nWe know he only allowed inspectors into Iraq in 1991 to save his \nregime. He did it out of fear.\n\n  I agree with former President Clinton's National Security Advisor, \nSandy Berger, who said at an Armed Services hearing, that he thinks it \nis unlikely that Saddam will ever accept ``unfettered'' inspections. A \nstrong resolution is essential so that Saddam Hussein knows there will \nnot be another Congressional session to meet and discuss these same \nissues again. He must know without the slightest doubt, that the man he \nis dealing with, President George W. Bush, has full and complete \nauthority, as commander-in-chief, to use our armed forces to protect \nour security and to remove him from power, if need be, if he does not \ncomply and disarm.\n  Who knows, in that case maybe he will relent. Nothing clears the mind \nso well as the absence of alternatives.\n  Maybe he would choose to abdicate and allow a new government to be \nformed. Maybe parts of his army would defect, or parts of his country \nwould revolt. Indeed, the ``Washington Times'', running an article from \nthe ``London Daily Telegraph'' reports yesterday that\n\n       Members of Saddam Hussein's inner circle are defecting to \n     the opposition or making discreet offers for peace in the \n     hope of being spared retribution if the Bagdad dictator is \n     toppled, according to Iraqi exiles.\n\n  One defector came from the Iraqi security services, which form the \nregime's nerve center. Kurdish groups say:\n\n       They have received secret approaches from military \n     commanders offering to turn their weapons on Saddam when the \n     war begins.\n\n  Columnist Morton Kondracke wrote today that there are many \npossibilities for a regime change without a war. He notes Idi Amin took \nexile. As the pressure mounts, as the circle tightens, these are among \npossibilities for achieving our goals short of a full scale conflict.\n  Yes, it is quite true that the President has requested our \nauthorization to use force, but he still hopes he will not have to use \nit. For us to not grant him that authority would be only to allow the \nPresident to continue negotiations but require him to come back to \nCongress another time (while we are in recess perhaps) for an \nauthorization to use force. To state that position is to expose its \nfatal flaw. Such an action would eliminate any chance for a real \nagreement.\n  Saddam Hussein will know what we have done. He will know that the \nPresident cannot until Congress meets again. He will know that the \nfateful moment has not come, and that he can continue to delay and \nmaneuver. Clearly, we must authorize the use of force if the President \nfinds it necessary. Otherwise this whole process is a charade. I am \nconfident a majority in this body understand this fundamental concept, \nor else, the strong vote that is coming would not occur.\n  Some say, we are acting unilaterally, ``upsetting'' the little \nnations. But, it was not the United States that invaded Iran resulting \nin a prolonged and brutal war costing over one million lives. It was \nnot the United States that invaded Kuwait, precipitating an \ninternational effort, overwhelmingly led by America, to roll back \nSaddam's conquest. It was not the United States that has systematically \nviolated 16 U.N. resolutions--resolutions Saddam Hussein agreed to in \norder to save his regime.\n  The unilateralist is Saddam Hussein. The United States, on the other \nhand, has worked assiduously with our allies, Arab nations, other \nnations and the United Nations to develop a policy that will end the \nmenace presented by Saddam Hussein.\n  Only the ``blame America first crowd'' would make such an argument. \nIndeed, we have been patient many times over these eleven years. So \npatient, so docile, that it has encouraged Saddam Hussein to \nmiscalculation.\n\n  Amazingly, several Senators have objected to the resolution because \nthey believe we must have the full support of the United Nations. This \nis suggested in several ways.\n  They argue, ``Why now?'' Why not let the United Nations vote first. \nWhy not have the Congress ``come in behind a U. N. resolution?''\n  This argument is dangerous and counter-productive to our goals. \nUnless, of course, one's real goal is simply\n\n[[Page S10310]]\n\nto wish the whole matter to go away and to not bring it to a head.\n  First, a U.N. Resolution is very hard to obtain. The primary problem \nis that any resolution can be vetoed by any one of the permanent \nsecurity council members, which includes China, Russia and France. \nThese countries may demand concessions in exchange for their votes. \nThey may just refuse. No reason is required.\n  Secondly, this is our military. Funded, built and staffed by \nAmericans. The American people did not sacrifice to create the greatest \nmilitary in history to allow China, Russia or even France to have a \nveto over its use. It is no wonder that these nations would like, \nthrough the mechanism of the United Nations, to seize control over our \nmilitary and to use it as they will. The wonder is why we are even \ndiscussing it seriously. Of course, we want to solicit the United \nNation's support and aid. After all, Saddam Hussein is in violation of \nsixteen U.N. Resolutions. Why is the U.N. not anxious to act to bring \nhim into compliance? Former Secretary of Defense James Schlessinger \nsaid recently in an Armed Services hearing that,\n\n       This is a test of whether the United Nations--in the face \n     of perennial defiance by Saddam Hussein of its resolutions, \n     and indeed by his own promises--will, like the League of \n     Nations a century ago, turn out to be an institution given \n     only to talk.\n\n  The President has frankly and courageously framed the question to the \nU.N. He has stated plainly that Saddam Hussein is in violation of \nsixteen U.N. Resolutions and is a danger to the region and the world. \nHe has made it clear that it is his duty to protect the American people \nfrom this threat and that he intends to do so. But, he expressed \nsupport for the U.N. programs and urged the U.N. to take action, to be \na relevant player in this crisis. He urged the U.N. not to sit on the \nsidelines. He made it clear that no change was unacceptable. Since then \nhe has worked steadfastly to win the necessary support in the U.N. and \nthe Security Council. He has humored, maneuvered, pleaded and, I am \nsure ``promised'' to gain support. Maybe the U.N. will arouse itself \nand take action. Nothing could do more for its credibility.\n  But there are limits. This Congress must not crawfish or we will \nthereby tell Russia or France that they have a veto over our actions. \nIt will encourage their resistance. If Russia knows Congress has \nallowed them to decide the issue, their power is even greater--it is \nabsolute.\n  Now, if members of this body oppose bringing the Iraq matter to a \nhead and oppose any use of military force then let them come out and \nsay so. It is wrong, however, and harmful to America to take an \nindirect approach that gives the appearance of support but which would \nundermine the execution of our policy.\n  Yes, it would be very desirable to have U.N. support to deal with the \nIraq problem. But, the best way to get it is to let them know we will \nact even if they don't.\n  I agree with former Secretary of Defense James Schlessinger that \nwhile the doctrine of prevention is sound and historical and has been \napplied in tougher cases than this, it is not necessary here. \nSchlessinger rightly says that,\n\n       In an ongoing conflict, the issue of pre-emption is close \n     to meaningless.\n\n  The truth is, we have been at war with Iraq since 1991. In essence, \nSaddam Hussein sued for peace to save his regime. The world in effect \nsaid we will end hostilities, but you must give up your weapons of mass \ndestruction and agree to full inspections to prove that you have.\n  Since then, we fly missions every day to enforce the northern and \nsouthern no-fly zones. Iraq fires surface-to-air missiles at our planes \nalmost daily and we bomb in response regularly. Iraq has shot down \nthree of our predator, unmanned aircraft, in recent months. We defend \nthe Kurds. We keep forces in Kuwait and in the region to deter another \nattack by Iraq. The war has never ended. In 1988, the Congress voted \nfor the ``Iraq Liberation Act''. We declared it U.S. policy to effect a \nregime change in Iraq and authorized the President to carry out that \npolicy. In fact, it gave five million dollars to Iraqi resistance \nforces and called for trying Iraqi leaders for war crimes.\n\n  Those who are reluctant to use force have focused on concerns about \nthe idea of using pre-emptive force to protect our security. They have \nforgotten the war has never ended, that our aircraft pilots are being \nfired at daily.\n  It is undisputed that our actions are taken as part of a U.N. program \nto protect the world from Saddam Hussein's aggression.\n  Thus, we have every basis to use force to enforce the agreements \nSaddam Hussein made and to react to the hostile fire he brings to bear \nagainst us.\n  My fear is that the President is being forced to deal with the \ntendency to move to the lowest common denominator that always results \nfrom U.N. negotiations, and will not be able to obtain the clarity we \nneed from any resolution approved by the Security Council. So far, he \nhas been courageous and effective. Let us stand with him so we can \nenhance the chances of a good resolution, not undermine his efforts \nwith a lack of support.\n  Regardless, it must continue to be clear that no one nation or group \nof nations will be allowed to block our duty to defend our people. \nEspecially when we are dealing with a regime that violates U.N. \nresolutions and continually directs hostile fire at U.S. forces.\n  This is an important time for America. We have a duty to protect our \nnation and our deployed forces from attack. We have the ability to do \nso. Our superb military personnel stand ready to put themselves at risk \nto promote our just national interests.\n  We are fully justified in acting under the venerable doctrine of \npreventing an attack upon ourselves. When there is a smoking gun or a \nmushroom cloud it is too late.\n  For those who have anxiety about the pre-emption doctrine, and I do \nnot in this case, I urge them to remember that we have been in an \nactual state of military hostilities with Iraq almost since 1991. He \nshoots at our pilots and aircraft regularly. He has violated, in 16 \nways, the conditions that he agreed to save his evil regime.\n  Let's not waiver, let's not delay, let's not go wobbly. Let us \nproduce a strong vote for this strong resolution. Then the situation \nwill become clear. We will say to Saddam Hussein, once and for all, you \nwill disarm or, like the Taliban, you will fall.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I come before the Senate this evening to \njoin in this debate, to express my support for our Nation's effort to \naddress the threat Saddam Hussein poses, and to lay out the concerns \nthat I believe must be addressed if we are to succeed in disarming \nIraq. The President has called upon Congress and the American people to \nsupport his administration in its effort to eliminate Saddam Hussein's \nhold on weapons of mass destruction. The Congress has responded by \ntaking up this resolution authorizing the use of force, if needed, to \nstrip Iraq of those weapons and the ability to deliver them. A number \nof serious questions have been raised in this historic debate. It is \ncritical that President Bush and the Congress fulfill our obligation to \nall Americans, and to the international community, by ensuring that \nthose questions are faithfully addressed.\n  Saddam Hussein has shown himself to be an implacable foe of the \nUnited States. It is essential that we confront the threat that he \nrepresents. The question is not whether we confront it, but how we \nconfront it. We must make every effort to build a multilateral \ncoalition. If we do so, we raise the likelihood of bringing a measure \nof stability to a turbulent part of the world. If we do so, we can \nminimize the impact of any conflict on the Iraqi people, on Iraq's \nneighbors and on American and allied forces. And if we do so, we will \nserve to strengthen, not undermine, the international laws and \ninstitutions that have served us well in the years since World War II.\n  Leadership is a responsibility that cannot be taken lightly. \nLeadership in deciding whether to resort to military force requires the \ngreatest deliberation and consideration. Secretary of Defense Donald \nRumsfeld, in recent testimony before the House Armed Services \nCommittee, said that ``no one with any sense considers war a first \nchoice--it is the last thing that any rational person wants to do. And \nit is important that the issues surrounding this decision be discussed \nand debated.''\n\n[[Page S10311]]\n\n  It is clear to me that millions of Americans are discussing and \ndebating the issues (that are before us this evening. I have heard from \nDelawareans throughout my state. I have heard from veterans who know \nthe harsh realities of war. I have heard children who can scarcely \nimagine it. I am comforted by the fact that the American people, and \ntheir representative in Congress, have been thoughtful and deliberate \nin discussing the challenges that we face and how we might confront \nthose challenges.\n  This is not the first time that I have faced the question of how we \nought to deal with Saddam Hussein's intransigence in the facet of \ninternational law. As a Member of the House of Representatives, I voted \nin 1991, along with many members of this body, to authorize President \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush to use military force to expel the armed \nforces of Iraq from Kuwait. I am proud of that vote, and I am prouder \nstill of the American and allied forces that went on to liberate \nKuwait.\n  Having engaged in that debate, and witnessed Saddam Hussein's refusal \nto yield except when confronted with the threat of force, I have no \nillusions about the danger he poses to regional stability and \ninternational security today. I am concerned that Iraq remains in \nviolation of more than a dozen Security Council resolutions. I am \nalarmed that the regime of Saddam Hussein continues to develop weapons \nof mass destruction in violation of the international agreements it \npromised to comply with at the end of the gulf war. Above all, I feel \nstrongly that we must not allow Saddam Hussein to develop the capacity \nto acquire or deploy nuclear weapons.\n  This past Monday night, President Bush addressed our Nation. He \nreminded us that there are significant risks to the United States both \nin acting and in not acting. If we choose not to act, we must remember \nthat, in Saddam Hussein, we are talking about a man who has invaded his \nneighbors, showing a reckless disregard for the stability of a volatile \nregion. We are talking about a man who has risked his own survival, and \nthat of his regime, to indulge his own vengeance. Finally, we are \ntalking about a man who has used weapons of mass destruction before, \neven against his own people.\n  The need for action, however, does not preempt the need for an \nobjective and open debate on the course of action we choose and the \nconsequences of our subsequent actions. Bringing the weight of the \nworld's disapproval to bear on Iraq; demanding unfettered inspections \nof every potential weapons site; and preparing for any military or \ndiplomatic contingency offers us the best chance to face down our foe \nnow and to ensure his permanent disarmament.\n  Like many in this chamber, I believe that it is essential for us to \nwork closely with the international community to reinstate inspections \nthat will lead to Iraq's disarmament. But it's imperative that such \ninspections be unhindered. Inspectors must have the freedom to go where \nthey want, when they want. They must have the right to talk to whomever \nthey wish and to provide immediate amnesty to any Iraqis who provide \ninformation that might place them at risk of reprisal from the regime. \nInspections are only valuable if they are truly a means of stripping \nSaddam Hussein of his weapons of mass destruction and his ability to \ndeliver them. If Saddam Hussein's regime is unwilling to accept this \nlevel of intrusion, both he and Iraq must be prepared to accept the \nconsequences, including the likelihood of a war they will lose.\n  Looking back, one of the principal reasons we were so successful in \nthe gulf war was because former President Bush and his administration \ndid the hard work necessary to build a broad, strong international \ncoalition before unleashing our military might. Our current President \nand his aides similarly did the hard work necessary to build such a \ncoalition after the attacks on our country last fall. This up-front \ninvestment has paid off in the arrests of Al Qaeda operatives \nthroughout the globe, as well as in the elimination of the regime that \nwas harboring them in Afghanstan--though the war on terror is far from \nover. These are prime examples of America's global leadership in action \nat its very best. They are examples that we should emulate now.\n  If we fail to uphold our international leadership responsibilities, \nand act without regard to the views and interests of our allies, we \ninvite our isolation in the world. We undermine our position as a \npreeminent force in global policy and order. We make more difficult the \ntask of securing the assistance of the international community in \nhelping Iraq to return as a responsible member of the community of \nnations. We invite additional terrorist attacks on Americans at home \nand abroad, as well as put the fragile governments of many Muslim \nnations further at risk. Moreover, if we are perceived to act without \nthe sanction of international law or authorization of the United \nNations, we further fuel anti-American resentment in the Arab world, \nthereby increasing the threat to Israel. On the other hand, if we make \nan effort to work in concert with our allies, we have the opportunity \nto strengthen the international institutions that will be critical in \naddressing future threats.\n  At a time when 24-hour news networks have made the images of war \ninstantly accessible, our nation's recent military successes have made \nthe awful realities of war appear ever more remote: images of laser-\nguided bombs falling on indistinguishable targets; missiles lighting up \nthe night sky. For an entire generation of Americans, our military \nefforts have come to be seen almost as a casualty-free video game, \nwhere no one gets hurt and few families face the knowledge that their \nson or daughter will not be coming home.\n  But like a handful of my colleagues here in the Senate, I have known \na different side to war, having seen if first-hand. During my 23 years \nin the Navy, including service in Southeast Asia, we witnessed \nsoldiers, sailors, and airmen leaving for missions from which they \nwould never return. I've met countless veterans who left part of \nthemselves on the battlefield. Some of those heroes serve in this very \nbody today.\n  War can--and often does--enact a terrible price. It should be entered \ninto as a last resort. So, the decision we face this week, which may \nlead to war, is not one that I take lightly. Nor do any of us.\n  For the past 11 years, people in this country and elsewhere have \nsecond-guessed the decision of former President Bush to stop short of \nentering Baghdad in 1991. I have never criticized that decision. That \nflat, open sands on which our soldiers fought and won is a far \ndifferent--and less dangerous--terrain than the streets of major Iraqi \ncities. There, our enemy's tactical advantage likely would have enacted \na far heavier toll on American lives.\n  If the course of events in this decade ultimately leads to another \nconflict with Iraq, and I hope it does not, the risks associated with \nurban warfare may well become a reality this time. Before they do, it \nis critical that we prepare ourselves, and the American people, for the \nlosses we may endure in a military campaign of that nature.\n  We must also face head-on the fact that, if war should occur, \nliberating Baghdad from Hussein's power will not solve every problem in \nthe region. It will, however, force us to find answers to a difficult \nset of new questions. Among them, how will we operate in Iraq after a \nmilitary victory? A number of competing factions will vie for control \nif Saddam Hussein is removed from power. Who will we support? How will \nwe convince them to work together? We will need a coherent policy to \nhelp Iraq make the transition to political and economic stability. We \nwill also need a great deal of patience and fortitude. Otherwise, we \nrisk creating a less stable and more explosive Iraq than we face today \nand, worse yet, an even more volatile region.\n  We have learned from our missions in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan \nthat bringing meaningful change to unstable nations requires enormous \ntime, resources, and effort. We have been relatively successful in \nrestoring stability in Bosnia and Kosovo, but it has not been without a \npainstaking commitment over many years. Indeed, the U.S. and our NATO \nallies continue to maintain a significant troop presence in both of \nthose nations.\n  Afghanistan, on the other hand, has demonstrated how minimal troop \ncommitments can impair efforts to restore peace in a war-ravaged \nnation. Hamid Karzai and his coalition government continue to express \nAfghanistan's ongoing need for adequate support and resources from the \nU.S. and other nations if the Afghan people are to realize\n\n[[Page S10312]]\n\nthe peace and democracy of which they dream.\n  In a post-war Iraq, the need for ongoing U.S. and allied intervention \nis likely to be far greater and far more costly. Experts in military \noperations maintain that creating a more stable Iraq will require the \ncontinued presence of between 50,000 to 100,000 troops. Not for a few \nweeks or months, but for several years.\n  There is another question that I believe must be addressed as we move \nforward: How will we bear the financial burdens of such a mission? It \nis impossible to place a price tag on the lives that might be saved by \ndisarming Saddam Hussein. At the same time, it would be fiscally \nirresponsible to take on such an operation without at least considering \nthe impact of a potential war on our already fragile economy. Over the \npast 2 years, we have watched the stock market plummet, making its \nsharpest decline in 70 years. The budget surplus that we worked so hard \nto achieve in the 1990's is gone. All the while, current estimates \nproject the likely cost of U.S. military action in Iraq to be in the \nrange of $100 billion. These estimates do not include the prospect of \nlong-term peacekeeping operations in the event of a regime change. The \npresence of tens of thousands of U.S. troops for months--maybe years--\nonce the fighting has ended will cost billions more. This is a cost we \nshould not bear alone.\n  I believe the principles and questions I have laid out today were \nbest embodied in, and addressed by, the bipartisan resolution drafted \nearlier this month by Senate Richard Lugar and my fellow Senator from \nDelaware, Joe Biden--two Senators of intellect and skill in the area of \ninternational diplomacy. The Biden-Lugar draft resolution focused on \nthe most critical task at hand--disarming Saddam Hussein. Senators \nBiden and Lugar carefully crafted this resolution to give President \nBush the flexibility he needs to garner international support now for a \ntough, new U.N. Security Council resolution. Their draft resolution \nalso provided the President with the authority to unleash U.S. military \nforce against Iraq should he determine that Iraq's continued \nintransigence makes such action necessary. I'm disappointed that we \nwill not have the opportunity to vote on that alternative this week. \nHaving said that though, I do believe that the Biden-Lugar proposal \ncontributed appreciatively to the change in direction that this debate \nhas taken in recent weeks, particularly in its emphasis on acting \ntogether with our allies. That change in tone was clearly evident in \nthe address of President Bush to the American people this past Monday \nnight. What he said encouraged me and served to reassure much of our \nnation.\n  The President spoke of the importance of working with the United \nNations to craft a tough inspection regimen in Iraq. I agree with him. \nThe President said that the U.N. must be ``an effective organization \nthat helps keep the peace.'' I agree with him. The President told the \nAmerican people that our primary goal in this endeavor is to strip \nSaddam Hussein of his ability to manufacture and deploy weapons of mass \ndestruction. Again, I agree with him. We also heard the President state \nthat he hopes the policy he has laid out will not require military \naction, although he acknowledged that it might. I hope it will not. We \nall share that hope in the Senate as members of this body prepare to \ncast our votes and to authorize the use of force if certain conditions \nare met.\n  In closing, let me say for much of our Nation's history, the United \nStates has been an instrument for peace and justice and a better life \nfor the people of many nations throughout the world. That is our \nheritage. It is one of which we can be proud.\n  There have been times in our history when we have had to go it alone. \nBut history has shown that we have been most successful when we \nprovided the leadership that compelled other nations to join us in a \njust cause--two World Wars, the Cold War, the Persian Gulf War, Bosnia, \nKosovo, Afghanistan, and the war on terrorism. Stripping Saddam \nHussein, once and for all, of the weapons that would enable him to \ncreate havoc and great loss of life is a just cause. Other nations know \nthat, too.\n  If we make the case to them forcefully, skillfully, and persistently \nin the weeks ahead, they will join us. I am certain of it. The burden \nbefore us--disarming Iraq--is one we should not bear alone. If the \nPresident uses the powers inherent in this resolution authorizing the \nuse of force with great skill and diplomacy, we will not have to bear \nthis burden, and face this challenge, alone. An armada of nations, \nagain, will join us, and together we will make this world, at least for \na little while, a safer and saner place in which to live.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized for 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, as our nation appears to draw closer to \nwar, I rise with full consciousness of the burden that each of us has \nto help guide our nation during this time of peril. It is indeed a \nheavy burden to bear, but nothing compared to the burden of those who \nserve in our military.\n  The vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq is one of the most \ndifficult and important votes any of us will ever cast. We need to \napproach this issue as if we are sending our very own children to war \nbecause, in effect, we are voting to send our nation's children to war.\n  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld recently told Congress that ``a \ndecision to use military force is never easy. No one with any sense \nconsiders war a first choice.'' The risks of war are real but the risks \nof inaction may be even greater. As Ronald Reagan put it in his first \ninaugural address, ``I do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no \nmatter what we do. I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do \nnothing.''\n  The threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime is growing with each \npassing day. He has, at this moment, chemical and biological weapons he \ncould use against us or share with terrorist networks that threaten us. \nHe is pursuing nuclear weapons. He has used chemical weapons against \nhis own people, and against foreign forces. He has invaded two of his \nneighbors and fired ballistic missiles at four of his neighbors. He \nsupports terrorist networks, and has harbored senior al-Qaida \nterrorists in Baghdad since September 11. He has a long-standing \nhostility toward the United States, because we have denied him his \nambition to occupy the territory of his neighbors and dominate the \nPersian Gulf region. He has openly praised the September 11th attacks, \nand his state-run press has called them ``God's punishment.'' He has \nwarned that Americans should understand that ``every Iraqi [can] become \na missile.''\n  Each of us needs to carefully weigh the risks posed by his regime the \nrisk of acting and the risk of doing nothing in the face of this \nthreat. And Mr. President, I submit that the risk of inaction far \noutweigh the risk of war in Iraq. Here is why:\n\n  For most of our history, America has been able to rely on our \ngeography to protect us. Two oceans, and friendly neighbors, provided a \nbuffer against enemies who might want to attack us. After September \n11th, we now know our invulnerability has passed away. We are not only \nvulnerable to terrorists who use airplanes as missiles we are \nvulnerable to terrorist networks and terrorist states that want to use \nweapons of mass destruction against us.\n  As Secretary Rumsfeld has pointed out, when the threats came from \nconventional weapons, our country could afford to wait for an attack to \nhappen, absorb the first blow, regroup, and then respond militarily. In \nthe age of weapons of mass destruction, however, we can no longer \nafford to wait.\n  In this new security environment, we must become more proactive in \nour efforts to prevent attacks that have the potential to be far worse \nthan that of September 11. We must make sure when possible that those \nwho have the desire to attack us are prevented from having the means \nwith which to carry out those attacks. We have a right and an \nobligation to take anticipatory action in our own self-defense.\n  This certainly would not be the first time that our nation engaged in \npreventative military action in defense of our homeland. During the \nCuban Missile Crisis, President Kennedy ordered a military blockade of \nCuba in 1962, an act of war under international law. This was done even \nthough the Soviets were not engaged in an armed attack, nor were the \nmissiles an imminent threat.\n  Today, Saddam Hussein poses a similar threat. And we should give this \nPresident the authority he needs to\n\n[[Page S10313]]\n\ndeal with the Iraqi threat now, before it reaches our shores.\n  Saddam Hussein poses a very real and imminent danger to the United \nStates. According to the CIA, Iraq ``has broad capability to attack'' \nthe U.S. ``with chemical or biological weapons and could build a \nnuclear bomb within a year if it obtains fissile material from \nabroad.'' Iraq ``probably'' has ``stockpiled more than 100 tons of \nmustard gas and other chemical weapons. Iraq has developed `large \nscale' capability to produce anthrax and other bioweapons in mobile \nfacilities that are easy to hide and hard to destroy.''\n  The longer we wait, the stronger he becomes, and the harder he will \nbe to defeat. Saddam Hussein's regime hosts terrorist networks and has \ndirectly ordered acts of terror on foreign soil. He has used weapons of \nmass murder before, and would not hesitate to use them again.\n\n  Moreover, Saddam Hussein's ongoing defiance of U.N. Security Council \nresolutions has made clear that he has no intention of disarming or \ndiscontinuing his weapons of mass destruction programs.\n  Remember, our goal is not to get weapons inspectors back into Iraq. \nOur goal is disarmament. And Saddam Hussein has shown that he is not \nwilling to disarm. To the contrary, he has proven willing to pay an \nenormously high price to maintain his weapons of mass destruction \naspirations. Under U.N. sanctions, he has given up about $180 billion \nin oil revenue to keep his weapons of mass destruction. As Richard \nButler, a former U.N. chief weapons inspector has said, ``The \nfundamental problem with Iraq remains the nature of the regime, itself. \nSaddam Hussein is a homicidal dictator who is addicted to weapons of \nmass destruction.''\n  Congress recognized that fact in 1998 when it passed The Iraq \nLiberation Act stating that, ``It should be the policy of the United \nStates to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein \nfrom power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic \ngovernment to replace that regime.'' We knew then what we know now--\nthat regime change and disarmament are inextricably linked.\n  Just like there are career criminals there are career criminal \nregimes. Leniency only incites them to more violence. They are driven; \nthey are compulsive. And unless they are constantly thwarted they will \ncontinue to prey on the weak and defenseless.\n  We cannot stake the lives of tens of thousands of innocent American \ncitizens on the hope that Saddam Hussein will never use his weapons of \nmass destruction against us. He has already proven that he cannot be \ntrusted, and that he poses a great threat to the peace and stability of \nthe world. This is a critical moment for the United States. If Saddam \nHussein is appeased with more talk of weakened, compromised weapons \ninspections, which he has repeatedly defied, we risk leaving our \ncountry open for another catastrophic attack, one potentially far worse \nthan the heinous acts of September 11th.\n  As we debate how to deal with the Iraqi threat, we must never forget \nthat in Saddam Hussein we are dealing not just with a homicidal \ndictator; we are confronting Evil that is akin to Stalin and Hitler.\n  Just ask former Iraqi general, Najib Salhi. He defected from Iraq and \nwas living in Amman, Jordan when one day he came home to find a package \nfrom Saddam Hussein's intelligence service. He opened it to find a \nvideo tape.\n  When he put it into the VCR, he saw what he thought was a \npornographic film--till he realized, to his horror, that he was \nwatching the rape of one of his closest female relatives. The message \nwas clear. They wanted to blackmail him into silence.\n  That is the face of Evil.\n  Or consider the fact that Saddam Hussein's regime has admitted to \nhaving weaponized aflotoxin--the only country in the world known to \nhave done so. As former CIA Director Jim Woolsey has stated, ``The only \nuse of aflatoxin is that it creates cancer, long-term cancer, \nespecially in children.''\n  Aflatoxin has no military value. It has no battlefield use. It takes \ntens of years to kill its victim. It is a weapons whose only purpose is \nto kill innocent people for murder's sake. Richard Spertzel, the former \nchief biological weapons inspector for UNSCOM, declared that aflatoxin \nis ``a devilish weapon. From a moral standpoint, aflatoxin is the \ncruelest weapon--it means watching children die slowly of liver \ncancer.''\n  That is the face of Evil.\n  Look at the attacks Saddam Hussein has ordered on his own people--on \nthousands of innocent men, women, and children--in Halabja, using a \nchemical weapons cocktail. Those attacks are causing cancer and genetic \nmutations that will be felt in this generation and the next.\n  That is the face of Evil.\n  Saddam Hussein is a man who has personally shot and killed members of \nhis own cabinet; who has ordered his opponents to be burned alive in \nvats of acid; who forces those suspected of disloyalty to watch the \ngang rape of their mothers, daughters, wives, and sisters; who not only \ntortures dissidents, but tortures their children in front of them.\n  He is the living incarnation of an Evil that cannot be appeased and \ncannot be deterred, and must be confronted and defeated.\n  He has murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent people--and is \npursuing weapons that will allow him to extend his deadly reach across \noceans and continents--that will give him the capability to kill our \npeople--our children, our families.\n  The President has rightly called Saddam Hussein ``a student of \nStalin.'' And I applaud him for his resolve in confronting the dangers \nposed by the Iraqi Regime.\n  The President has awakened the world to the existence of evil in our \nmidst--and challenged the world to confront that evil before it \nconfronts us, at the cost of millions of lives.\n  It is a natural reaction to flee in the face of evil. It is little \nwonder that much of the world has been reluctant to stand its ground \nand face down Saddam Hussein, which is why the President's leadership \nhas been critical, and why it is so important for the United States \nCongress to show similar resolve, and demonstrate our unity with the \nPresident.\n  In showing steadfastness and steely determination, the President made \nclear to the Iraqi regime, and the world, that we were not going to \nrepeat the tired old pattern of meeting Iraq's threats with inaction. \nAnd that leadership has had an impact. One by one we have seen nations \njoin the U.S. in recognition that Saddam must go. Some have said so \npublicly, others privately. Let there be no doubt: if we go to war, we \nwill not be going it alone.\n  Thanks to our President, the world understands that there is a price \nto be paid for defying the United States when our survival is at stake. \nAnd I believe that a strong show of support by Congress will strengthen \nthe President's hand at the United Nations.\n  While we greatly value the support of our allies in the war on \nterror, we must never give other nations the authority to stop us from \ndefending our freedom or from acting in our own self-defense. We must \ndo what we feel is right in protecting America, whether or not we have \nthe approval of France, Russia, China or any of the other nations which \ncurrently sit on the U.N. Security Council.\n  None of us takes the prospect of war lightly. War is difficult and \ndangerous, and lives will be lost. I understand the concerns many \nAmericans have about war in Iraq, and I fully appreciate the sacrifice \nAmerican families make when they lose a loved-one in the fight to keep \nAmerica and the rest of the world free from tyranny and oppression.\n  This country lives, freedom lives, because brave men and women were \nwilling to die for it--willing to risk their lives, and give their \nlives, for a cause greater than themselves. As scripture teaches \n``there is no greater love than this: that a man lay down his life for \nhis friends.'' We are all concerned for the well being of our troops, \nand we thank them for their willingness to keep America safe from the \nevil that has been made so apparent in the last year.\n  While I value diplomacy and rhetoric, there comes a time when force \nis inevitable--when our choice is not between war and peace, but \nbetween war today, when our enemy is weaker, or war tomorrow, when our \nenemy is stronger. That is the choice we face today.\n\n[[Page S10314]]\n\n  We have tried diplomacy. We have imposed sanctions. We have sent \ninspectors. All attempts to reason with the Iraqi Regime have failed. \nThe only language Saddam Hussein understands is force.\n  Indeed, in a way, we are already at war with Iraq. Since hostilities \nended in 1991, Iraq has repeatedly violated the ceasefire conditions \nwhich were set out at the close of the Gulf War. Just ask our brave \npilots who are being shot almost every day as they patrol the no-fly \nzones over Iraq.\n  After President Bush's speech to the U.N., Saddam Hussein sent a \nletter to the U.N. promising to ``allow the return of United Nations \nweapons inspectors to Iraq without conditions.'' He went on to say that \nIraq ``based its decision concerning the return of inspectors on its \ndesire to complete the implementation of the relevant Security Council \nresolutions and to remove any doubts that Iraq still possesses weapons \nof mass destruction.''\n  Hours after that letter arrived at the U.N., Iraq was shooting at \nU.S. aircraft implementing those same relevant U.N. Security Council \nresolutions. Since 1992, the Iraqis have used anti-aircraft artillery, \nor Triple-A, against our aircraft in the northern and southern no-fly \nzones. In fact, over the last three years Iraqi Triple-A has fired at \ncoalition aircraft over 1,000 times. This year to date they have fired \non us over 400 times--and since that September 16 letter where Saddam \npledged his support for U.N. resolutions they have fired on coalition \naircraft more than 70 times. It appears that Iraq has actually stepped \nup its firing on U.S. and British planes since he agreed to cooperate \nwith the U.N. Actions speak louder than words. And for 11 years Saddam \nHussein's actions have shown that he is bent upon pursuing weapons of \nmass destruction at all costs.\n  After all, three days after Saddam Hussein's September 16th letter \npledging the unconditional return of weapons inspectors, Iraq's foreign \nminister stated U.N. resolutions were ``unjust and at odds with the \nU.N. charter and international law.'' He further declared, ``Iraq \ndemands that its inalienable rights are met, including respect for its \nsovereignty, security and the lifting of the blockade imposed on it.'' \nThen Baghdad stated that the 1998 Memorandum of Understanding which \nexempted certain presidential palaces must stand. I am sure we will \nhear from time to time that Baghdad is once again stating that \nunconditional inspections could take place. The words change, but the \nactions stay the same. They keep right on firing at our pilots.\n  Madam President, on September 11, 3,000 innocent citizens were \nkilled. If their deaths are to have any meaning, our nation must not \nforget the lesson they gave their lives for us to learn. The era of our \ninvulnerability is over. Evil exists--it is real, it is out there, and \nit seeks our destruction. If we ignore it, it will not go away. It will \ncontinue to stalk us, and kill more of our people.\n  It must be confronted and it must be defeated.\n  ``There is a time for all things,'' the Rev. Peter Muhlenberg told \nhis congregation on the eve of the Revolutionary War, ``a time to \npreach and a time to pray. But those times have passed away. There is a \ntime to fight, and that time has now come.''\n  We have listened and we have prayed. Now we must fight.\n  For the best honor we can bestow on those who have died for our \nnation, and those who will die for our nation, is victory. Victory over \nterrorism. And if the President believes it is necessary to secure our \nfreedom, victory over the regime of Saddam Hussein.\n  Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nGraham's and Senator Cantwell's time be changed. Senator Graham will go \nbefore Senator Cantwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I rise this evening to speak to my colleagues, more \nimportantly to speak to the people of the United States and, \nespecially, my fellow Floridians.\n  In my service in the Senate I have not shied away from authorizing \nthe use of force when I believed it was in our Nation's interests.\n  I voted to use force in the Persian Gulf in 1991. I voted to use \nforce in Bosnia in 1992. I voted to use force in Kosovo in 1999.\n  I have given the President of the United States a presumption of \ncorrectness in his assessment of our national security interest.\n  But, Madam President, tonight I am going to vote no on this \nresolution. The reason is this resolution is too timid. It is too \nlimiting. It is too weak. This resolution fails to recognize the new \nreality of the era of terrorism. And that reality is that war abroad \nwill, without assertive security actions, increase the prospects of \nterrorist attacks here at home.\n  In fact, war on Iraq alone leaves Americans more vulnerable to the \nNo. 1 threat facing us today, those international terrorist \norganizations that have the capability to inflict upon us a repeat of \nthe tragedy of September 11.\n  The resolution I had hoped we would pass would contain what the \nPresident has asked for relative to the use of force against Saddam \nHussein's regime in Iraq, and more.\n  It also should provide the President all necessary authorities to use \nforce against the international terrorist groups that will probably \nstrike the United States as the regime of Saddam Hussein crumbles.\n  I offered an amendment on this floor yesterday that would have given \nthe President the authorities he needs to deal with the threat posed by \nthe five deadliest terrorist organizations in addition to al-Qaida--\nthat would gladly join Saddam Hussein in his retaliatory strike.\n  Those five organizations have already killed hundreds of Americans. \nThose five organizations have ties to countries that could provide them \nwith weapons of mass destruction. Those five organizations have the \ncapability to strike within our homeland. They have recruited, trained, \nand placed operatives in our hometowns.\n  I argued that the President should have the option to set priorities \nand choose our targets, and to be able to preempt terrorists before \nthey can order strikes against us in our homeland. Unfortunately, that \namendment was rejected.\n  Some said I was incorrect in my contention that the President, as \nCommander in Chief, lacks the power to expand the war on terrorism \nbeyond al-Qaida. I disagree. But I will not repeat the legal arguments \nthat I made yesterday.\n  But even accepting the fact that others may disagree, how is it in \nthe interest of our Nation's security to leave the question in doubt as \nto whether the President has the authority to attack these \ninternational terrorist organizations that represent such a lethal \nthreat to the people of the United States?\n  There have been some past administrations which have allowed leaders \nof rogue states to be uncertain as to how America would respond if they \nused weapons of mass destruction. This administration should not repeat \nthat fundamental error.\n  If we want to deter the world's terrorists and madmen, shouldn't we \ntell them, in the most explicit terms, what they will face by U.S. \nretaliation to their action?\n  I also want to restate my conviction that this resolution forces the \nPresident to focus our military and intelligence resources on the wrong \ntarget. A historical example, which has been used repeatedly in this \ndebate, is the example of the 1930s: that England, France, and other \nnations, which would eventually join in the world's greatest alliance, \nslept while Hitler's power grew.\n  They say the equivalent of passing this resolution is to have \ndeclared war on Hitler. I disagree with that assessment of what this \nlesson of history means. In my judgment, passing this resolution \ntonight will be the equivalent of declaring war on Italy. That is not \nwhat we should be doing. We should not be declaring war just on \nMussolini's Italy. We should also be declaring war on Hitler's Germany.\n  There are good reasons to consider attacking today's Italy, by which \nI\n\n[[Page S10315]]\n\nmean Iraq. Saddam Hussein's regime has chemical and biological weapons \nand is trying to get nuclear capacity. But the briefings I have \nreceived suggest our efforts, for instance, to block him from obtaining \nnecessary nuclear materials have been largely successful, as evidenced \nby the recent intercept of centrifuge tubes, and that he is years away \nfrom having nuclear capability.\n  So why does it make sense to attack this era's Italy and not Germany, \nespecially when by attacking Italy, we are making Germany a more \nprobable adversary?\n  The CIA has warned us that international terrorist organizations will \nprobably use United States action against Iraq as a justification for \nstriking us here in the homeland. You might ask: What does the word \n``probably'' mean in intelligence speak. ``Probably'' means there is a \n75 percent or greater chance of the event occurring. And the event is \nthat international terrorist organizations will use United States \naction against Iraq as a justification for striking us here in the \nhomeland.\n  Let me read a declassified portion of a CIA report recently presented \nto the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence:\n\n       Baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of \n     conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or [chemical \n     and biological weapons] against the United States.\n       Should Saddam conclude that a U.S.-led attack could no \n     longer be deterred, he probably would become much less \n     constrained in adopting terrorist actions.\n       Such terrorism might involve conventional means . . . or \n     [chemical and biological weapons].\n       Saddam might decide that the extreme step of assisting \n     Islamic terrorists in conducting a [weapon of mass \n     destruction] attack against the United States would be his \n     last chance to exact vengeance by taking a large number of \n     victims with him.\n\n  In other words, the odds of another strike against the people of the \nUnited States by al-Qaida or one of the international terrorist groups \ngoes up when we attack Baghdad.\n  The President should be in the most advantageous position to protect \nAmericans, to launch preemptive strikes and hack off the heads of these \nsnakes. With the resolution before us, we are denying the President \nthat opportunity, and we are sending confusing signals to our people \nand our allies as to the sincerity of our commitment to the war on \nterrorism.\n  The American people and our allies gave President Bush their \nwholehearted support in the war on terrorism after September 11. They \ncheered our efforts to remove Osama bin Laden and the Taliban \ngovernment from Afghanistan. A year after we commenced that war, action \nin Afghanistan has ground to a virtual halt. Osama bin Laden remains at \nlarge, and we have not moved aggressively beyond Afghanistan to take on \nthe cells of al-Qaida operatives in other parts of the world.\n  We also know of sanctuaries, training camps where the next generation \nof terrorists are being trained and that those sanctuaries are going \nunattacked.\n  With sadness, I predict we will live to regret on this day, October \n10, 2002, we stood by, and we allowed those terrorist organizations to \ncontinue growing in the shadows. It may be days, weeks, months, or \nyears before they strike Americans again, but they will, and we will \nhave allowed them to grow that capability.\n  If we are going to pass this resolution--and I expect we will--there \nare several things we should say about the need to protect the American \npeople. Within the region of the Middle East and central Asia, we have \na constellation of challenges, threats, and commitments of the United \nStates. We need to use this period of time to begin to reduce the \nthreat environment in that area by active, sustained U.S. diplomacy on \ntwo half-century-old disputes: The dispute between Israel and \nPalestine, and the dispute over Kashmir, the festering sore between two \nnuclear powers, India and Pakistan.\n  Second, the President a year ago should have ordered all of the law \nenforcement agencies under his control to design a comprehensive means \nof determining the number, location, and capability of terrorists who \nare living among us. But tonight, no one in our government can fully \ntell us which, when, where, and how terrorist organizations might hurt \nus. This I consider to be a stunning admission and an unnecessary \nvulnerability.\n  At this late hour, such action should be of the most urgent priority. \nThis should be done, of course, within the confines of the protections \nafforded to all American persons by the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Third, we should be moving to detain all those who can be legally \ndetained who represent a threat to the United States.\n  Fourth, the President should direct the military forces of our \ncountry to prepare to execute a full-fledged war on terrorism. We must \ncomplete our mission in Afghanistan and then move to the next targets \nof al-Qaida cells.\n  Finally, I would advise the President to request of the Congress the \nauthorities he needs to execute the war on terror and to protect \nAmericans. Specifically, this should include the authority to use force \nagainst those international terrorist organizations with the greatest \ncapability to kill Americans here at home, with the greatest history of \nhaving used their evil intent against Americans, and with the largest \nnumber of terrorist operatives located within the United States.\n  Our people need to know their government is doing all it can to keep \nthem safe. Tonight many Americans are anxious and frightened, and they \nhave cause to be. One year ago letters carrying anthrax killed five \nAmericans, including one in my home State, and created great concern. \nThat case has not yet been solved.\n  One year later, here in the Capital region, a sniper is randomly \ntaking lives of innocent people going about their daily activities. \nJust hours ago, police confirmed the man who was shot last night while \npumping gas into his car at a service station is the eighth victim, six \nof whom are dead. And in today's Washington Post, a front page article \nhas the headline ``Probe Less Cohesive Than Advertised.''\n  It states:\n\n       Behind the scenes at the command central, however, \n     interviews with leading investigators suggest that while some \n     aspects of the massive effort are working well, others are \n     fraught with the same turf battles, politics, leaks and \n     confusion that historically have characterized manhunts of \n     this size.\n\n  Are these acts that we are trying to unravel those of a madman, a mad \nscientist, a terrorist? The honest answer is that we do not know. In \nthese frightening times, it is irresponsible to add to the anxiety of \nthe American people by going to war with Iraq--without taking the \nadditional steps required to curtail the possibility of more horrors \nbeing inflicted upon us here in our homeland. This resolution fails to \ntake those steps.\n  Different people have different opinions of what our national \nsecurity priorities should be. Clearly, some--including the President--\nbelieve the first priority should be regime change in Baghdad. Others \nbelieve our first priority should be to disarm Iraq by removing its \nweapons of mass destruction. As important as they may be, I have a \ndifferent view.\n  The United States has many challenges, threats, and commitments to \nrespond to, particularly in the region of the Middle East and central \nAsia. These include the Israel-Palestine conflict, the India-Pakistan \nstandoff, and the threats posed by weapons of mass destruction. Even if \nwe say the No. 1 issue in the region should be containing weapons of \nmass destruction--especially nuclear weapons--I frankly do not believe \nIraq should be our first concern. We do not know the full capabilities \nof the State of Israel, although we believe it has the full capacity to \ndefend itself against attacks, or the threat of an attack. We are aware \nof the significant capacity possessed by India, Pakistan, and Iran. I \ncan say without fear of contradiction that all of these possess \nsubstantially greater capabilities and means of delivering nuclear or \nother weapons of mass destruction than Iraq.\n  Of all the issues we care about, and those issues over which we have \nsome capability to determine the outcome, in my judgment, the No. 1 \npriority should be the war on terrorism and its threat to the people of \nthe United States in our homeland. Our top targets should be those \ngroups that have the greatest potential to repeat what happened on \nSeptember 11, killing thousands of Americans. Passing this\n\n[[Page S10316]]\n\ntimid resolution, I fear, will only increase the chances of Americans \nagain being killed. That is not a burden of probability I am prepared \nto accept. Therefore, I will vote no.\n  I close with the words spoken in one of the darkest periods of the \nhistory of the Western World. In 1941, Winston Churchill said:\n\n       Never, never, never believe any war will be smooth and \n     easy, or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can \n     measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter.\n       The statesman who yields to war fever must realize that \n     once the signal is given, he is no longer the master of \n     policy, but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable \n     events.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, how much time did the Senator from Florida \nuse?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator used 20 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. And he had 30 allocated to him. Therefore, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Mikulski be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, after careful consideration, I have \ndecided to oppose the Bush resolution on Iraq. This resolution would \ngive President Bush the unilateral authority he seeks to go to war \nagainst Iraq without international support or international resources. \nThe resolution includes only tepid language supporting diplomatic \nefforts at the United Nations.\n  The Senate is making a grave decision: Whether to give the President \nunlimited authority to go to war and send American military men and \nwomen into harm's way.\n  I take this responsibility very seriously. I have listened to the \nPresident and his advisors. I have consulted with experts and wise \nheads. I have participated in hearings and briefings as a member of the \nSenate, and particularly as a member of the Intelligence Committee. I \nhave listened intently to my own constituents.\n  The American people are deeply ambivalent. The American people want a \nsafer world, a world in which distant tyrants can't threaten us and our \nbases and our embassies and our treasured allies. The American people \nare counting on us to assess the Iraqi threat and to confront it with \nour allies. They and I firmly believe that Saddam Hussein is \nduplicitous, deceptive, and dangerous.\n  Iraq has grim and ghoulish weapons to carry out his evil plans. As \npart of the Gulf War cease-fire agreement, Saddam Hussein committed to \ndestroying its chemical and biological and nuclear weapons programs and \nlonger-range missiles. Instead, Saddam Hussein is trying to add nuclear \nweapons to an arsenal that already includes chemical and biological \nweapons and ballistic missiles.\n  These threats cannot be ignored and allowed to grow. But these are \nnot only threats to us. These are threats to the international \ncommunity, and the international community must share the \nresponsibility of addressing them.\n  I support a robust multinational response to the Iraqi threat. That's \nwhy I supported the Levin resolution, urging the United Nations \nSecurity Council to fulfill President Bush's request to demand Iraqi \ndisarmament, verified by unfettered inspections, and to authorize the \nuse of multinational force if Iraq refuses to comply.\n  If the UN refuses to act, then Congress would consider a request from \nthe President to authorize acting alone against Iraq.\n  Let me be very clear on one point. The United States always has the \nauthority to take military action in self-defense. That is our right \nunder international law, included as Article 51 of the United Nations \nCharter, and I support that.\n  President Bush says he has not yet decided whether the use of \nmilitary force is necessary, and I take him at his word.\n  The United States should first exhaust all diplomatic and other non-\nmilitary means.\n  The United States should give the United Nations the opportunity to \nfulfill its responsibility to address the Iraqi threat.\n  The United States should fully pursue whether the UN Security Council \nwill authorize the use of multinational force.\n  The Bush resolution, the White House resolution, would authorize the \nPresident to send our Armed Forces to war against Iraq without any \nfurther consideration by Congress.\n  Under the Levin resolution, which I cosponsored, Congress would \nremain in session, standing ready to promptly reconsider if the UN does \nnot meet the challenge.\n  I have had to ask myself, 'Why should the Senate wait to see what the \nUnited Nations will do before deciding on the unilateral use of force?\n  The answer is this:\n  Voting now in support of unilateral action would take the \ninternational community off the hook.\n  Why would the other members of the United Nations Security Council \nmake the tough decision to effectively authorize war against a member \nstate if they know the U.S. will do it by ourselves?\n  I believe this resolution would actually weaken the negotiating \nposition of the President and the Secretary of State at the United \nNations.\n  Why would other nations send their troops into harm's way if America \nis ready to send our troops without them?\n  Why would other nations join us to rebuild Iraq after a war if Uncle \nSam is willing to bear the financial burden, as well as the dangers?\n  I'm concerned about the prospect of America going it alone because \nI've thought about the risks and consequences.\n  The risks and consequences of acting alone are so much greater than \nthey would be for multinational action.\n  The risks to our troops are greater if allied forces do not join the \nmission.\n  The challenge in post-conflict Iraq is greater if other nations do \nnot share the burden and the cost.\n  The consequences for the war on terrorism are greater if we lose the \nessential cooperation of other nations in the effort to pursue al-Qaida \nand other terrorist groups. The consequences on our economy would be \nsevere.\n  A mandate from the United Nations would mean the international \ncommunity against Saddam instead of the United States against Iraq, and \nother countries in the region would join our coalition rather than \nobstructing or opposing us.\n  I recognize that I will likely be in the minority on this vote. The \nSenate and House of Representatives will probably grant the President \nthe broad authority he now seeks.\n  I will vote differently than the majority, but I want my \nconstituents, particularly our men and women in uniform, to know that I \nbelieve my vote represents the wisest, most prudent course with them in \nmind.\n  America's soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines will always have my \nfull and steadfast support. I stand accountable to the oath I took to \ndefend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. I \nhold myself accountable to my constituents, and I am prepared to defend \nthis vote because I think when history is written, it would have been \nwiser not to give authority to go it alone right now.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I can recall 11 years ago--12 years ago actually--I \nmade my maiden speech on the floor of the Senate. It was about Saddam \nHussein and going to war with President Bush in office. Here we are 12 \nyears later doing the same thing.\n  I rise today to again support the President in his duty, I believe, \nto stop Iraq from bringing weapons of mass destruction throughout the \nworld. When I addressed this topic in January of 1991, I said then that \nthere was a lot of talk about George Bush--President Bush 41--leading \nus into war. What I said then, and I will say now, is that was wrong. \nIt is Saddam Hussein who is leading us into war. The same holds true \ntoday as it did 12 years ago.\n  Those voices against the Desert Storm operation, some of whom are \nrepeating this same antiwar rhetoric today, are simply wrong. The \nwarmonger is Saddam Hussein. He is now moving us toward another major \nmilitary engagement with the stakes even higher than they were 12 years \nago.\n  Unfortunately, Desert Storm did not finish the job. There has been \nsome\n\n[[Page S10317]]\n\ncriticism about that. Given the data and facts President Bush had at \nthe time and with the U.N. resolution, he did what he had to do.\n  If we calculate the costs of air operations, no-fly zones, and other \nactivities over these past 12 years, containment has not worked. In \nthis age of weapons of mass destruction, relying on a policy of \ncontainment and deterrence is a risk we cannot and must not take.\n  I pulled out a copy of the speech I made in 1991. I do not know \nanyone in this body who wants war. I do not know anyone in America who \nwants war. I certainly do not. The President does not. Nobody wants \nwar. Yet we heard today on the floor that President Bush is leading us \ninto war, and that is wrong.\n\n  Thomas Paine, who is often quoted, over 200 years ago said: These are \nthe times that try men's souls. This is the time that American service \nmen and women are keenly aware of the enormous burden which the world \nevents have placed upon us. I said that in 1991, and it is true today.\n  Unfortunately, Saddam Hussein is still with us. The stakes are high. \nWe are in a virtual state of war now with Saddam Hussein and with Iraq, \nbut it has not produced the necessary results. Saddam is again \ndeveloping the potential to threaten us with weapons of mass \ndestruction and with terrorist attacks.\n  This threat has to be met. It just simply has to be met head on. And \nthe only answer is the overthrow of Saddam's regime one way or the \nother--domestically if possible, militarily if necessary. The stakes \nare simply too high not to do it.\n  I served in Vietnam. Others have served in war. We all know the \nstakes. If we do not do this, people may die. If we do this, people \nwill die. Imagine the tremendous burden that is placed now upon the \nPresident of the United States.\n  Democracies do not threaten democracies, and democracies do not start \nwars. We would all be much safer nations if everybody believed the way \nwe did, but that is not the way it is.\n  We have learned much in the wake of the vicious attack upon our \ncountry on September 11. Frankly, we were pretty much asleep. We were \ncomplacent. The terrorist attacks in Africa, the U.S.S. Cole, Khobar \nTowers, our barracks in Saudi Arabia--these losses were largely \ninflicted on our military and on our State Department personnel, but we \nwere still largely oblivious to the risks we faced right here on \nAmerican soil. We were not prepared for the devastation of 9/11 and the \nlives of nearly 3,000 innocent Americans lost. The total costs are \nimmeasurable. Some say as much as a trillion dollars, but how about in \nthe human loss? All the children orphaned, young people, men and women \nwho were embarking on careers--what they might have contributed to \nAmerica over the next several years we will never know.\n  What Saddam Hussein is doing has to be met. He is a threat to the \npeople of the world. He is indeed a threat to the world. I know. I have \nseen enough intelligence on this over the past several years to know--\nnot only to believe it but to know it. Weapons of mass destruction--\nnuclear, biological, and chemical, whatever they may be--can kill \nmillions in insidious ways throughout the world. We simply cannot let \nthis stand.\n  I know, having been there, the enormous burden felt by young men and \nwomen in uniform who will be there when and if this happens. They need \nour support. Have the debate, get the debate behind us, and get behind \nour men and women because they are going to have to do the work, and \nthey deserve our support, unlike Vietnam when the troops did not get \nthat support.\n  We need to find out where the links to al-Qaida are. They annihilate \ninnocent people by virtue of their religious faith or their national \nidentity. That is what they are doing. They will do it with terrorist \nbombs on their backs. They can do it with nuclear missiles or \nbiological or chemical missiles as well.\n  If there are some in doubt, I urge them to go down to the Holocaust \nMuseum and take a look and see what the cost of doing nothing is: 6 \nmillion innocent lives annihilated because we stood by as a world and \nlet it go too long, and then we finally stopped it. We cannot let this \ngo too long. Six million lives lost the way Hitler took them is \nhorrible, and as despicable as it was, it is nothing compared to the \nnumber of lives that can be taken in more evil and despicable ways now.\n  Some say we should not take preemptive action. Preemptive action? \nThere is already action taken against the United States of America. \nRemember the 3,000 people dead. This is not preemptive. We are \nreacting.\n  Our survival as a nation is at risk. Earlier this year in the wake of \nthe unprecedented and vicious attack in the United States and world by \nal-Qaida, President Bush came before the American people in his State \nof the Union Address and unveiled his advocacy for regime change in \nIraq.\n  That is a sound policy. And this is a terrible dilemma. How would you \nlike to be the President of the United States today, sitting in the \nWhite House contemplating what has to be done? Criticized if you take \naction, criticized if you don't; risking death if you do, risking death \nif you don't.\n  There is no time in American history where a decision has been more \nimportant. There is no more important debate, ever, in my view, in \nAmerican history where the stakes are higher than they are right now.\n  I am standing right now at the desk of Daniel Webster. He probably \nfrom this desk made some of the greatest speeches in the history of \nthis body, but none of them, whether they were about slavery or all the \ngreat issues of the day of the 1830s and 1840s, even come close to the \nimpact of what could happen by allowing this man, this despot, to move \nforward in the world unchecked.\n  We cannot rely on the United Nations, weapons inspectors, or Saddam's \nword that he is going to comply with inspections and disarm. I wish we \ncould. Neville Chamberlain thought that about Hitler, didn't he?\n  Saddam Hussein's brutal dictatorship has reigned for 30 years. During \nthese three decades, we have seen him attack Iran in a war that took a \nmillion lives; we have seen him repress, through murder and terror, \nethnic and political elements in Iraq; We have seen him use weapons of \nmass destruction on 250 occasions against the civilian population. He \nhad come close to producing a nuclear device before the gulf war and is \nsuccessfully continuing these efforts despite several years of failed \nweapons inspections. He has breached international law. He has invaded \nKuwait. He set oil wells on fire. He has threatened the stability of \nthe world. He prompted the use of military force to contain him, and \nSaddam Hussein has tried to assassinate a former President of the \nUnited States of America.\n  He is a sponsor of Islamic terrorism throughout the world, and his \nregime has harbored the likes and established relations with Osama bin \nLaden's al-Qaida. What more evidence do we need to act?\n  This resolution also touches my heart in another way. This resolution \nmakes very brief mention that Iraq has failed to account for an \nAmerican serviceman. It might be a small matter compared to the big \nissue of war with Iraq, but Captain Speicher, who was shot down over \nIraq, was the first pilot lost in the war. He was pronounced dead by \nthe Pentagon, but there is no evidence that he is dead. The information \nwas incorrect. His status changed in January 2001. I worked for 7 years \nto change that status and President Clinton, to his credit, prior to \nleaving office, changed that status. I give him great credit for that \nbecause he very well may be a prisoner held by Saddam Hussein today. In \nshort, whether he is a prisoner or not, Saddam Hussein knows what \nhappened to him. We do not. This is simply unacceptable.\n  By not seeking a regime change in Iraq, by not backing our policies \nwith military force, by not dismantling Saddam's regime and weapons of \nmass destruction, I am concerned America will repeat its folly and give \nSaddam the breathing room to produce a nuclear device, proliferate it, \nthreaten to use it, or use it. He will continue to support terrorism \nwhich devastated our Nation.\n  I supported the resolution on Iraq during the administration of \nPresident Bush 41, and I will support the resolution of this President \nBush to give him the power to authorize the use of military force \nagainst Iraq.\n  I will close with a comment I made in my closing remarks in 1991:\n\n\n[[Page S10318]]\n\n\n       Stand with the Commander in Chief. Have the courage to \n     stand with him who was elected by all of the American people. \n     Stand with him, and stand with our sons and daughters in the \n     Persian Gulf. Do not give Saddam Hussein a reason to doubt \n     our resolve. Stand together. Let us discard Saddam Hussein on \n     the garbage heap of history along with the other despots like \n     Khrushchev, Stalin, and Hitler. That is where he belongs, and \n     that is where we are going to put him sooner or later.\n\n  Unfortunately, it is a little bit later than we expected. We need not \nfear. We are the greatest Nation in the world, with the greatest \npeople, and I believe it is the right thing to confront this monster \nand do it now. That is why I will be supporting President Bush.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DURBIN). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized for 30 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss \nS.J. Res. 46, the Lieberman, Warner Bayh-McCain resolution, and the \nissue that everyone of my colleagues agree on--that Iraq is in serious \nviolation of its U.S. and U.N. agreements prohibiting its possession of \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  What my colleagues cannot agree on is how we should go about \ndisarming Iraq.\n  Let me add my views.\n  I believe that the best way to deal with the threat posed by Saddam \nHussein is to build a multinational coalition and engage the United \nNations.\n  But we can't ask the United Nations to disarm Saddam Hussein if we \nare not willing to disarm him ourselves.\n  Today's vote for S.J. Res. 46 is a statement of national resolve to \ndisarm Saddam Hussein. By showing our unity as a nation, we help the \nUnited States unite the world against his continued effort to use \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  History has shown that we have been very patient with Saddam Hussein.\n  First, let us remember that the United States and 34 other nations \nwere at war with Iraq in 1991.\n  After 3 months of war in which the U.S. coalition lost 556 lives and \n502 wounded--including seven young men from my home State--not to \nmention the estimated 100,000 Iraqis killed--we negotiated a cease-fire \nagreement with Iraq that ended our military campaign.\n  This cease-fire was approved in return for Saddam Hussein's promise \nthat he would unconditionally accept the destruction and removal of all \nbiological, chemical and nuclear weapons and to allow U.N. inspectors \nto verify the elimination of these programs.\n  This cease-fire agreement was even signed by the Iraq government.\n  We staked lives, resources, and diplomatic weight on that promise, \nand yet here we are today because of the non-compliance of that issue.\n  If military action is eventually taken by a UN-backed effort or \nmultinational US effort, that military action would not be a pre-\nemptive strike, but the enforcement of the Iraqi government cease fire \nagreement.\n  In fact, I would say we have been in a constant battle of enforcement \nfor 11 years on this enforcement issue.\n  Shortly after the cease-fire agreement in 1991, Saddam Hussein \nstarted to thwart the cease fire agreement.\n  For 7 years, inspectors were sent to Iraq to verify his promise to \ndisclose and destroy his cache of chemical, biological and nuclear \nweapons, and for 7 years Hussein obstructed the inspectors efforts.\n  Saddam Hussein did hide and inspectors did find weapons of mass \ndestruction--literally tons of them--most of which were unaccounted for \nin the final reports'' and in clear breach of the cease-fire agreement.\n  Saddam Hussein even bugged the UNSCOM offices in Bahrain and New \nYork, disguised weapons and hid them in various places. He leaked false \nintelligence and blatantly lied over, and as Sandra Mackey outlines in \nher book, ``The Reckoning, Iraq and the Legacy of Saddam Hussein,'' \n``Hussein's tactical war of cheat and retreat with UN arms inspectors \ngave him power to remain a world figure and gain a hold over his own \npeople.''\n  What has been our response and the response of the United Nations?\n  We have tried economic sanctions to get Iraq to comply with the \ndisarmament agreement--and they have failed miserably.\n  It is the innocent Iraqi people that feel the effects of sanctions, \nincluding hunger and a lack of medical care.\n  Saddam Hussein not only continues to eat well--hoarding much of the \naid and food imported into Iraq through the oil-for-food program--but \nhe builds palaces, and he devotes substantial riches toward developing \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  We have tried sending a strong signal to the United Nations.\n  In 1994, I joined my colleagues in the House of Representatives in \ncalling for the United Nations to take action on Iraq's noncompliance.\n  The House resolution went even further and urged the President and \nthe United Nations to establish a tribunal to charge Saddam Hussein as \na war criminal.\n  That vote showed a clear consensus eight years ago when members of \nthe House agreed that Saddam Hussein was neither a legitimate ruler nor \nan honest actor in the ceasefire and UN agreements.\n  In 1998, we increased military pressure in the region and even \nconducted a military strike under President Clinton called Operation \nDesert Fox--hoping that the threat of force and the destruction of \nmilitary installations would bring Hussein to reason and allow the \ninspectors back in.\n  While this limited military pressure produced some initial results, \nas soon as the United States turned down the heat Saddam Hussein went \nback to his old ways.\n  Where are we today.\n  For 11 years since our cease-fire agreement with Iraq we have tried \nto stop Iraq's effort to develop weapons of mass destruction.\n  In reality, our efforts have failed to stop his continued build-up of \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  The United Nations should never have allowed Saddam to negotiate the \nterms of inspections.\n  When he crossed the line in the sand that separated Iraq from Kuwait, \nHussein demonstrated to the world his absolute disregard for \ninternational law; and his defiance of the will of the international \ncommunity.\n  He also displayed, on a world platform, his utter disdain for the \nprinciples of human rights and a free society; and revealed to the \nworld a frightening weapons capacity, including chemical and biological \nweapons and substantial progress towards developing a nuclear weapon--\nall of which he intended to use to advance his regional ambitions and \nthreaten enemies.\n  Saddam Hussein is a global menace that we cannot simply wish away.\n  By doing nothing the world is not only failing to enforce the terms \nof a cease-fire that we fought for; but it is allowing a dangerous \nthreat to grow that deserves renewed immediacy.\n  This immediacy was demonstrated 13 months ago, when we witnessed the \ndevastating steps that terrorists were willing to take and we know that \nthis problem is not going away; and Saddam only increases the danger.\n  Some citizens say there are other countries in the world producing \nweapons of mass destruction and could be a source of aid to terrorists. \nWhy worry about Iraq?\n  I know of no other country that has posed such a unique threat by: \nViolating of US/UN cease-fire agreement to stop development of weapons \nof mass destruction; Using weapons of mass destruction in war or \nagainst its own people; and Refusing to help the U.S. in the \nAfghanistan war on terrorism and actually applauded the efforts of Al \nQuida of 9/11.\n  We are now considering a resolution that I believe will take a \npositive step towards effectively dealing with the threat of Saddam \nHussein, his failure to comply with the terms of the 1991 ceasefire \nagreement.\n  The best way to do that is to bolster the President's and the U.S. \nefforts by sending a message to the U.N. Security Council that we must \nact. This vote tells the President of the United States we agree Saddam \nHussein and his failure to comply with the cease-fire agreement \nconstitutes a serious breach and a threat to global stability.\n  The vote tells the President we firmly support his promise to go to \nthe United Nations Security Council and live up to the responsibilities \nto enforce a cease-fire agreement that Iraq has continued to try to \nsubvert. This vote is a statement of national resolve that Saddam \nHussein must be disarmed\n\n[[Page S10319]]\n\nby peaceful means, if necessary, but by showing our unity as a nation, \nthat we, the United States, will help eliminate this threat and will \nunite the world behind it.\n  Some have called this unconditional authorization. That is not the \ncase. Senators Lieberman, Warner, Bayh, and others have made great \nprogress on this legislation. There are conditions. It requires a \nlimited scope of operations in the Iraq theater, continued consultation \nwith Congress on military action, and serious reporting requirements to \ninform Congress of the commencement progress and plans of both \noperations and postwar strategies.\n  I make clear this resolution does not endorse a unilateral action. If \nfor some reason the U.N. Security Council does not act, I expect the \nPresident to make a major and aggressive diplomatic effort to enlist \nother partners around the globe in doing the right thing to stop \nHussein's efforts. The President has promised Members of Congress, \nincluding the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, that he would \nbe committed to developing a coalition of allies for military action. \nWe know how important these coalitions are. We expect the President to \nfulfill this promise.\n  My vote for this resolution does not mean I am convinced the \nadministration has answered all the questions. In fact, I believe the \nfollowing issues must be addressed--there are several--before the U.N. \nor the United States takes military action: First, it is clear we need \na continued, multilateral approach. The President must continue to make \nthe disarmament of Iraq a global issue. The rhetoric surrounding Iraq \nearlier this summer was unilateralist. It offended our allies and \nothers who might have been with us. It brandished the view around the \nworld that the United States is an arrogant power, and did serious \ndamage to our relationship with many important powers in the Middle \nEast region.\n  The President's September speech to the United Nations reflected a \nnew chapter and much needed improvement in the administration's efforts \nto confront Saddam Hussein. He made clear that the priority of the \nadministration was to mobilize an international effort to enforce the \ncease-fire.\n  Second, we must understand what our successful military strategy is. \nThis vote is not an endorsement of the President's military strategy, \nmainly because we have not been given what it is. However, there is \ngood reason to believe that this operation, which may require force to \nenter Baghdad, will prove substantially more complex and difficult and \ncostly than Operation Desert Storm--not only in its economic cost, but \nmost important, in the lives of soldiers and innocent Iraqi citizens. \nThis is, indeed, a troubling scenario. And if the administration \nultimately acts within the scope of this authorization, it must be up \nfront and honest with Congress and the American people in explaining \nwhat we are up against.\n  Third, we must have a postwar commitment strategy. This vote is not \nan endorsement of the President's postwar scenario either, largely \nbecause I have not seen details on that. We have heard some broad \noutlines, if, in fact, action by the U.N. or U.S. troops were taken. \nBut we need to realize the process of creating a peaceful and stable \npost-Saddam Iraq will be huge and expensive and politically volatile.\n  If the President does not commit to multilateral military action, we \nmust similarly commit ourself to a serious long-term strategy to bring \nabout freedom, representative democracy, and prosperity to the people \nof Iraq. This will require a substantial obligation and commitment.\n  Fourth, fighting the broader war on terrorism cannot be left behind. \nAnd while the President has made the point that this effort is related, \nwe need to make sure if we commit troops to the Persian Gulf, that we \nwill not be diminishing our other efforts on the war on terrorism.\n  Fifth, and probably the challenge that most of my colleagues have \ntried to address, maintaining the Middle East stability. I do remain \nvery concerned about the effective military action and the volatile \nsituation that may occur in the Middle East. The Israeli-Palestinian \nconflict remains in a disappointing and potentially volatile state. We \nmust be aware that any action in Iraq and the possible extension to \nIsrael poses a serious threat to the future peace in this region.\n  If the administration or the U.N. selects military action against \nIraq within the scope of this resolution, we must work aggressively \nthrough diplomatic channels to ensure that such action is kept separate \nand distinct from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n  And lastly, we must protect Iraqi civilians. We cannot diminish the \nserious concerns regarding the effective potential military action on \nthat population. They have been the victims of a brutal, harsh and \ninhumane dictator who has not only stripped away their political \nliberty and free expression but also distributed to Iraqi populations \neconomic deprivation, malnutrition, lack of medicine, and diverted \nbillions of dollars into other programs.\n  If the President of the United States or the U.N. determines that we \nshould move forward within the framework of this resolution and \nmilitary action must be taken, it must be used as a last resort.\n  The President needs to take leadership and work with Congress to \nincorporate the issues I have just mentioned and come back to Congress \nand consult with them.\n  I take this vote very seriously. The men and women in the Armed \nForces from Washington State may very well be called into action. \nWhether it be our troops at Fort Lewis, our refueling tankers flying \nout of Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane, our cargo planes from \nMcChord, our radio jammers or P-2 aircraft out of Whidbey Island, or \neven the men and women of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln who were recently \nin the Persian Gulf, or the thousands of men and women serving in \nWashington State--I hope our vote tonight with the President's \nmultilateral effort will lead to a successful result where we would not \nneed to use these personnel. But if we do, I know these men and women \nwill be ready to meet the task with conviction, resolve, and \nprofessionalism.\n  I do not now, nor have I ever believed, that military action is our \npreferred method to address international conflict. But I have seen \nover the last 11 years, Saddam Hussein has consistently failed to live \nup to the 1991 cease-fire agreement, and his noncompliance is a \ndangerous failure that this body must address. This problem is not \ngoing away. If anything, it will grow increasingly more dangerous as \nSaddam Hussein increases his chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons \nstockpile.\n  There is no question that we are looking for a strong and effective \nresponse from the United Nations Security Council, and I believe this \nvote sends an important message to the United Nations Security Council \nand gives the President the domestic backing he needs to get that \ninternational support. By being serious, forceful, and resolute in \nexpressing our dissatisfaction with Saddam Hussein for his continued \nnoncompliance, I think we are charting the best course for an \ninternational response. We are taking action in this body tonight, and \nwe want the international community to take action with us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous consent agreement, the \nChair recognizes the Senator from North Dakota for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in a few moments we will make one of the \nmost fateful decisions for our country. We will decide if we authorize \nthe President to take this Nation to war. As with every momentous \ndebate in this Chamber, our deliberations will resonate long into the \nfuture. Few decisions will have greater consequences to the people we \nrepresent and to the future of our Nation.\n  Before I ask young men and women to put themselves in harm's way, I \nmust be convinced we have exhausted every other possibility, pursued \nevery other avenue. For me, and I believe for the people I represent, \nwar must be the last resort.\n  As we debate the course this Nation will take, some facts are clear \nand unassailable. Saddam Hussein is a menace to the whole region of the \nMiddle East and a vicious tyrant who harms and oppresses his own \npeople. He has waged war against neighboring nations, and he has \nattacked the people of his own country. He has acquired\n\n[[Page S10320]]\n\nchemical and biological weapons. He is attempting to acquire nuclear \nweapons and the means to deliver those weapons using ballistic \nmissiles.\n  There is no question that Saddam Hussein is ignoring the will of the \nUnited Nations and that he has not honored the agreements he made \nfollowing the Gulf War. Saddam Hussein is a dangerous force in the \nworld.\n  I agree that we must take action. The question is, What course do we \ntake? How do we best protect the national security of our country?\n  A decade ago in the gulf war, Saddam Hussein launched a surprise \nattack on Kuwait and we rallied a powerful international response to \ndefeat him. Today, we debate a much different scenario. Saddam has not \ndirectly threatened his neighbors since the gulf war. In a recent \nthreat assessment from the Central Intelligence Agency, it concludes \nthat Iraq is not likely to initiate a chemical or biological attack on \nthe United States. Yet the President is contemplating a preemptive \ninvasion of Iraq with the goal of ousting Saddam Hussein and installing \na new regime. Never before in the history of this Nation has the \nCongress voted to authorize a preemptive attack on a country that has \nnot first attacked us or our allies.\n  Let me be clear. I do not oppose the use of force against this \nlawless and dangerous tyrant, but I cannot support the resolution \nbefore us as it stands. It is too broad and open-ended, and I do not \nbelieve it is in the national security interest of the United States. \nIn my judgment, an invasion of Iraq at this time would make the United \nStates less secure rather than more secure. It would make a dangerous \nworld even more dangerous.\n  First, we have unfinished business with the terrorists of al-Qaida. \nFor the past year we have all agreed that combating al-Qaida was our \nfirst priority. News reports just this morning warned us of the danger \nof renewed terrorist attacks against our country, organized and \norchestrated by al-Qaida. I believe defeating the terrorists who \nlaunched the attacks on the United States last September 11 must be our \nfirst priority before we launch a new war on a new front. Yet today the \nPresident asks us to take action against Iraq as a first priority. I \nbelieve that has the priority wrong.\n  Second, a unilateral invasion could prompt the very attack we seek to \npreempt. In just the last few days, the CIA has reported that there is \na very low probability Saddam Hussein would launch a biological or \nchemical attack against the United States or our interests in the \nregion. However, if we launch a unilateral invasion, the risk rises \ndramatically that a desperate Saddam would use biological and chemical \nweapons.\n  Brent Scowcroft, National Security Adviser to former President Bush, \nwrote that in the wake of an invasion:\n\n       Saddam would be likely to conclude he had nothing left to \n     lose, leading him to unleash whatever weapons of mass \n     destruction he possesses.\n\n  Third, an invasion of Iraq for the purposes of regime change would \nnecessitate a march on Baghdad. Such a course would expose our forces \non the ground to serious risks in hand-to-hand, street-by-street urban \nwarfare in a foreign capital. We would lose much of our advantage in \nsuperior airpower and technology. The military and civilian casualties \ncould be substantial.\n  The former Commander in Chief of the U.S. Central Command, retired \nMarine Corps General Joseph Hoar, testified before Congress:\n\n       In urban warfare you could run through battalions a day at \n     a time. All our advantages of command and control, \n     technology, mobility . . . are in part given up.\n\n  Those are sobering words--battalions a day at a time.\n  Fourth, a unilateral attack by the United States could destabilize an \nalready volatile and dangerous region and inflame anti-American \ninterests around the globe. An American invasion could doubtless impact \nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The backlash in Arab nations could \nfurther energize and deepen anti-American sentiment. Al-Qaida and other \nterrorist groups could gain more willing suicide bombers and raise even \ngreater financial resources from the wealthy nations of the region.\n  General Wesley Clark, the former Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, \nput it succinctly: ``If we go in unilaterally or without the full \nweight of the international organizations behind us, if we go in with a \nvery sparse number of allies. . . . we're liable to super-charge \nrecruiting for al Qaeda.'' Let me repeat that. ``We're liable to super-\ncharge recruiting for al Qaeda.''\n  Fifth, if this nation asserts that pre-emptive military attacks are \njustified in this conflict, what are the consequences for other \nconflicts around the globe? Would India or Pakistan claim the same \njustification in Kashmir, raising the prospect of nuclear war in South \nAsia? Could China use this precedent to attack Taiwan, potentially \ndrawing the U.S. into a major war with China? Could Russia use this \njustification to re-occupy parts of the former Soviet Union?\n  And sixth, while the financial costs of this effort should not drive \nthis debate, we cannot ignore them. The Congressional Budget Office has \njust estimated that an invasion of Iraq could cost this nation $6 \nbillion to $9 billion a month. That is a significant financial toll at \nany time, but particularly when we are still engaged in conflict in \nAfghanistan. The economic downturn makes the expense even harder to \nbear.\n  CBO estimates that the costs of an invasion plus a five-year \noccupation would reach some $272 billion. How will we pay for this? \nDoes the White House propose new taxes? Or are we to assume that this \nwill be paid for out of the Social Security trust funds? Will we go \ndeeper and deeper into debt? Or does the President suggest cuts in key \ndomestic programs, such as education, highways, or healthcare.\n  Which brings me to my final point. If our goal is to topple Saddam, \nwhat is our responsibility for the regime that follows:\n  Forming a new government in Iraq is far from simple. There is no \nclear successor to Saddam Hussein. Iraq is a country filled with \ncompeting ethnic groups and religious and tribal factions with no \nhistory of democracy.\n  I do not want to see our forces mired in a long occupation, in \ndangerous territory, in a destabilized region, subject to violence \nwithin Iraq. I do not want to see the United States responsible for the \nstability of Iraq, the economy of Iraq, and the political future of \nthat nation.\n  I began by saying that while I do not oppose the use of force against \nthis dictator, war must be our last resort. I believe history has \nimportant lessons for us.\n  Many other dangerous dictators have acquired weapons of mass \ndestruction, or tried to. Yet we successfully contained the Soviet \nUnion, Communist China, and North Korea and others without resorting to \na pre-emptive first strike. Again and again, we have seen the scenario. \nA vicious dictator amasses weapons of mass destruction, threatens his \nneighbors, and threatens the United States.\n  Always in the past, we have chosen containment and deterence--not \ninvasion. In the past, we have contained the dictator, rallied \ninternational support to isolate him, and together with our allies \ncarried out a disciplined, forceful and effective strategy of \ndeterrence. We did not launch an invasion.\n  Even when the Soviet Union placed nuclear missiles just 90 miles off \nour coastline, we did not invade. Rather, President John F. Kennedy \nissued an ultimatum--a successful ultimatum. We demanded the removal of \nthose missiles. We succeeded, and we brought the world back from the \nbrink of a nuclear conflict that might have engulfed the world.\n  Historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., recently asked: ``Why not . . . \ntry the combination of containment and deterrence that won us the Cold \nWar? Saddam is not likely to attack other countries. He knows that he \nwould be playing into Bush's hands. Retaliation would be prompt and \noverwhelming, and Saddam has no interest in suicide. The one situation \nthat might induce him to use his weaponry is a U.S. attack on Iraq.''\n  The historical lesson is clear. There are disciplined and forceful \nactions we can take against dictators and aggressors short of invasion, \nactions that can succeed.\n  Clearly, if Saddam Hussein were to attack this country--or if we had \nstrong evidence that an attack on this country were imminent--we would \nhave every right to defend ourselves. In that case, Saddam should have \nno\n\n[[Page S10321]]\n\ndoubt that the United States would obliterate him.\n  If the President has new knowledge on an imminent threat from Iraq \nthat contradicts the statement of his CIA Director just this week that \nan attack is unlikely, he should reveal it to this Congress. I believe \nin protecting our people and our allies from imminent danger. But I \nbelieve the President must present stronger evidence to the Congress \nand the American public before he reverses a strategy that has worked \nwell against dictators around the world. Before this nation strikes \nfirst, strikes unilaterally, strikes preemptively, we must know how \nthis threat is different from those that have come before.\n  Inaction and appeasement are not options. We must be prepared to use \nforce to defend out national security interests, with or without the \nsupport of the UN. And I support the use of force against Iraq in the \nfollowing circumstances.\n  We need no one's permission to fight back when attacked, and force \nwould be fully justified in the case of an Iraqi attack against this \ncountry or our allies. Force would also be justified if we were \npresented with clear and compelling evidence Saddam was preparing an \nimminent attack on this nation, or on our allies.\n  Additionally, the use of force would be justified if we were provided \nwith credible evidence that Saddam was linked to the September 11th \nattacks on this nation or if Saddam were to provide weapons of mass \ndestruction to terrorists.\n  Finally, I believe we must be prepared to use force in concert with \nour allies to destroy, Iraq's weapons of mass destruction if Saddam \nrefuses to comply with UN resolutions ordering him to disarm.\n  I support the use of force when it is in our national security \ninterest. I voted for the Levin amendment to authorize the use of force \nto disarm Saddam Hussein and affirm our right to self defense. I also \nvoted for the Durbin amendment to authorize the use of force to destroy \nIraq's weapons of mass destruction.\n  For all the reasons I have cited, I believe an invasion of Iraq must \nbe a last resort, not a first response. Instead, I believe we can and \nshould take a phased approach.\n  First, we should exhaust every option available to us at the United \nNations. Saddam has defied the U.N. in the past, but the growing U.S. \nand international pressure, and the imminent threat of military action \nmay give the process new life. Further, our allies will be more willing \nto join with us if we exhaust every option at the U.N.\n  Next, we should make every attempt to forge the same strong coalition \nof nations that brought Saddam to his knees during the Gulf War. The \nknowledge that he is an outlaw in the eyes of the world community will \nsend a powerful message to Saddam to comply with the U.N. resolutions \nhe agreed to after the Gulf War.\n  I believe we should issue an ultimatum to Saddam to allow weapons \ninspections and immediately disarm. If he does not comply we can then \ntake swift military action to force his compliance and deprive him of \nhis weapons. But I do not believe we should authorize an invasion of \nIraq tonight.\n  I know this vote will place me with a small minority of colleagues \nhere, but I must vote my conscience.\n  I say to the President and to my colleagues that while I do not \nsupport this resolution, I know it will pass. And if the President \nexercises the authority it grants him to launch a unilateral invasion \nof Iraq, I will stand with him. I will do everything in my power to \nsupport our troops and ask for the support of our allies. Like every \nAmerican on that day, I will pray for the safety of our soldiers in \nbattle, the wisdom of our leaders, a swift victory, and the lasting \npeace that has so far eluded the troubled peoples of the region.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to explain why I am voting \nagainst final passage of the Lieberman amendment. I have already \nexplained much of my reasoning during the debate on my earlier \namendment, but I wanted to state my opposition in one place.\n  Section 4 of the Lieberman amendment authorizes the President to use \nthe Armed Forces of the United States, one, ``against the continuing \nthreat posed by Iraq;'' and, two, to ``enforce all relevant United \nNations Security Council Resolutions regarding Iraq.''\n  This grant of authority under (1) above, with its threshold of \n``continuing threat,'' is virtually the issuance of a blank check to \nthe President to use U.S. military force, since the Findings section of \nthe amendment already contains the statement that ``Iraq poses a \ncontinuing threat to the national security of the United States.''\n  The only limitation on the President's authority is found in section \n4 of the amendment which requires that the President submit his \ndetermination to the Congress, within 48 hours after he exercises such \nauthority, that further diplomatic or other peaceful means alone will \nnot protect our national security or is not likely to lead to \nenforcement of all relevant Security Council Resolutions and that \nexercising such authority is consistent with the continuation of the \nUnited States and other countries actions against international \nterrorism.\n  This grant of authority is also unacceptable since it empowers the \nPresident to initiate the use of U.S. military force although the \nthreat against which it is used is not imminent. International law has \nrequired that there be an imminent threat before one initiates an \nattack under the rubric of self defense. The resolution's language \nregrettably, therefore, serves to implement the President's desire, as \nexpressed in his September 2002 National Security Strategy, to ``adapt \nthe concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of \ntoday's adversaries.'' This unfortunate precedent, if followed by, for \nexample, nation A as a justification to use aggressive military force \nin the name of self-defense against nation B that nation A perceives \nposes a continuing threat to it, although the threat is not imminent, \ncould lead to an increase in violence and aggression throughout the \nworld. And it could have extraordinary consequences for the world if \none or both of such nations possess nuclear weapons, such as India and \nPakistan.\n  The grant of authority under (2) above, to enforce all relevant U.N. \nSecurity Council Resolutions regarding Iraq is also unacceptable. For \ninstance, Iraq is presently in default on its obligations under \nrelevant Security Council Resolutions that require it to return Kuwaiti \narchives and property. It is exceedingly unwise to provide such a broad \ngrant of authority when the real threat that Iraq poses is because of \nits refusal to destroy its weapons of mass destruction and prohibited \ndelivery systems.\n  The Lieberman amendment also sends the wrong message to the United \nNations. It contradicts the thrust of the President's speech to the \nU.N. General Assembly on September 12 when he said ``We will work with \nthe U.N. Security Council for the necessary resolutions'' and ``We want \nthe United Nations to be effective, and respectful, and successful.'' \nThat is so because, at the same time that Secretary of State Powell is \ntrying to negotiate with the U.N. Security Council for the very \nresolution that the President said he wants, the Congress would be \nvesting extraordinary authority in the President of the United States \nto ``go it alone,'' to use U.S. military force whether or not the \nSecurity Council authorizes Members States to use military force to \nenforce its resolutions. By telling the Security Council, if you don't \nact, we will, we are letting them off the hook. We should, instead, as \nwe did at the time of the Gulf War, be putting all of our focus on \nhaving the Security Council adopt the requisite resolution and \ncommitting forces to implement it. We should be working to unite the \nworld community, not divide it.\n  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the Lieberman amendment \ncompounds all of these problems by authorizing the use of U.S. military \nforce at this time unilaterally, i.e., without U.N. Security Council \nauthorization. The unilateral, go-it-alone use of U.S. military force \ncarries with it all of the risks that could be avoided or, at least, \nreduced by acting multilaterally, i.e., with the strength and world-\nwide political acceptance that flows from U.N. authorization. If we act \nunilaterally, will we be able to secure the use of airbases, supply \nbases, and overflight rights that we need; will there be a reduction in \nthe international support we are receiving for the war on terrorism;\n\n[[Page S10322]]\n\nwill it destabilize an already volatile region and undermine \ngovernments such as Jordan and Pakistan; will Saddam Hussein and his \ngenerals be more likely to use weapons of mass destruction against our \nforces and other nations in the region; will we be undercutting efforts \nto get other nations to help us with the expensive, lengthy task of \nstabilizing a post-Saddam Iraq? These are serious short- and long-term \nrisks that will be exacerbated if we act unilaterally rather than \nmultilaterally.\n  Accordingly, and for all of these reasons, I will cast my vote \nagainst final passage of the Lieberman amendment.\n\n\n                Vote On Amendment No. 4856, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous consent agreement, the \nquestion now occurs on agreeing to amendment No. 4856, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 4856), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in 1991, just prior to the Persian Gulf \nwar, I was the author of legislation that would have allowed one parent \nof a dual military couple to receive a waiver from deployment to areas \nwhere combat is imminent.\n  I remain very concerned about this issue and fear that if the \nPresident decides to use force against Iraq, minor children may face a \nsituation in which both parents are deployed. The Military Family \nResource Center estimates that there are approximately 35,000 dual \nmilitary couples with children serving in the military today.\n  According to the Department of Defense, request for combat exceptions \ncan be submitted at any time and military personnel may apply for \nreassignment for humanitarian or compassionate reasons. However, there \nare no specific policies restricting both parents from being assigned \nto a war zone.\n  I hope the Senator from Virginia, the ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee, will join me in urging the Secretary of Defense to \ndo everything possible to see that dual military couples are not \ndeployed concurrently to a war zone.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand the Senator's concerns, and I believe that \nthe Department of Defense is already very sensitive to this situation, \nas reflected in the assignment policies of the military services. I \ntrust the Department will continue to make every reasonable effort, \nthrough existing practices and policies, to avoid situations in which \nboth parents would be deployed to a combat zone.\n  I thank the Senator from California for once again focusing attention \non this issue.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is an important issue that Senator \nBoxer has raised and that she has been concerned about for many years; \nthat is, when both parents of minor children are in the military, the \nSecretary of Defense should make every effort to ensure that both \nparents are not deployed in combat at the same time.\n  If we do indeed go to war against Iraq, this is an important issue \nthat needs to be addressed, and I thank the Senator from California for \nraising it.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr President, I rise today in support of the resolution \nauthorizing the use of military force against Iraq.\n  I support this resolution because the threat posed by the brutal \ndictatorship of Saddam Hussein is real, immediate, and growing.\n  The threat is real because Saddam possesses conventional, chemical, \nand biological weapons. He also is doing everything in his power to \nacquire the means to construct and field nuclear weapons.\n  The threat is real because Saddam has used his conventional and \nchemical weapons to attack his neighbors and his own people.\n  The threat is real because Saddam has openly defied the world and has \nmade no secret of his enmity toward the United States and our allies. \nSaddam even attempted to assassinate a former American President.\n  The threat is immediate and growing because Saddam has extensive and \ngrowing ties to terrorist organizations that have either attacked the \nUnited States or declared the United States to be a legitimate target \nof their twisted crusade that they call ``jihad.''\n  The threat is immediate and growing because Saddam has developed the \nability to deliver his poisons and pestilence by unmanned aerial \nvehicles that can easily be smuggled into the United States.\n  The threat is immediate and growing because Saddam has circumvented \nthe sanctions regime to such an extent that he is virtually \nunrestrained by resources in his pursuit of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Let me put this in a historical context.\n  Following its bloody war with Iran, Hussein's Iraq was heavily in \ndebt. While continuing to spend billions on weapons of mass destruction \nand long-range missiles, Saddam, in 1990, invaded and plundered Kuwait \nin order to help pay his bills. With that act, he made it clear that \nhis priority was to feed the war machine which kept him in power.\n  In 1991, Kuwait was liberated and the Persian Gulf war ended when \nSaddam Hussein committed to abide by U.N. Security Council resolutions. \nSince then, he has broken those commitments. He ignored U.N. weapons \nprohibitions and ruthlessly crushed rebellions of the Shia and the \nKurds.\n  Today, he continues to violate U.N. resolutions, the very commitments \nhe made to save his regime. His actions continue to impose terrible \nhardships on his own people. After a decade of sanctions, Saddams's \nunwillingness to relinquish his prohibited weapons programs continues \nto cost his country tens of billions of dollars.\n  There are those who believe that a new U.N. Security Council \nresolution and renewed inspections are the answer. In reality, \ninspections will accomplish little, delay the inevitable and provide \nSaddam with yet more time to field additional weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  U.N. Security Council Resolutions have required much of Saddam and \nproduced very little.\n  Starting in April 1991, Resolution 687 requires Iraq to declare \ndestroy, remove, or render harmless under U.N. or International Atomic \nEnergy Agency supervision and not to use, develop, construct, or \nacquire all chemical and biological weapons, all ballistic missiles \nwith ranges greater than 150 kilometers, and all nuclear weapons-usable \nmaterial, including related material, equipment, and facilities. What \nhas happened?\n  Saddam has refused to declare all parts of each WMD program, \nsubmitted several declarations as part of his aggressive efforts to \ndeny and deceive inspectors, and ensured that certain elements of the \nprogram would remain concealed. The prohibition against developing \ndelivery platforms with ranges greater than 150 km allowed Baghdad to \nresearch and develop shorter-range systems with applications for \nlonger-range systems.\n  Additionally, the prohibition did not affect Iraqi efforts to convert \nfull-size aircraft into unmanned aerial vehicles for use as potential \nWMD delivery systems with ranges far beyond 150 km.\n  Resolution 707 enacted in August 1991, requires Iraq to allow U.N. \nand International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, inspectors immediate and \nunrestricted access to any site they wish to inspect. it also demands \nthat Iraq provide full, final, and complete disclosure of all aspects \nof its WMD programs; cease immediately any attempt to conceal, move, or \ndestroy WMD-related material or equipment; allow UNSCOM and IAEA teams \nto use fixed-wing and helicopter flights throughout Iraq; and respond \nfully, completely, and promptly to any Special Commission questions or \nrequests. What has happened?\n  In 1996, Saddam negotiated with the UNSCOM Executive Chairman \nmodalities that it used to delay inspections, to restrict to four the \nnumber of inspectors allowed into any site Baghdad declared as \n``sensitive,'' and to prohibit them from visiting altogether sites \nregarded as sovereign. These modalities gave Iraq leverage over \nindividual inspections. Iraq eventually allowed larger numbers of \ninspectors into such sites but only after time consuming negotiations \nat each site.\n  Resolution 715 adopted in October 1991, requires Iraq to submit to \nlong-term monitoring of Iraqi WMD programs by UNSCOM and IAEA; approved \ndetailed plans called for in United Nations Security Council \nResolutions 687 and 707 for long-term monitoring.\n  In reality, Iraq generally accommodated U.N. monitors at declared \nsites but obstructed access and manipulated the monitoring process.\n\n[[Page S10323]]\n\n  Beginning in March 1996, Resolution 1051 established the Iraqi export \nand import monitoring system. This system requires U.N. members to \nprovide IAEA and UNSCOM with information on materials exported to Iraq \nthat may be applicable to WMD production, and requires Iraq to report \nimports of all dual-use items.\n  In reality, Iraq is negotiating contracts for the procurement, \noutside of U.N. controls, of dual-use items with WMD applications. The \nU.N. lacks the staff needed to conduct thorough inspections of goods at \nIraq's borders and to monitor imports inside Iraq.\n  In June 1996 the following resolutions were adopted: Resolutions \n1060, 1115, 1134, 1137, 1154, 1194, and 1205. These demand that Iraq \ncooperate with UNSCOM and allow inspection teams immediate, \nunconditional, and unrestricted access to facilities for inspection and \naccess to Iraqi officials for interviews. U.N. Security Council \nResolution 1137 condemns Saddam for his refusal to allow entry into \nIraq of UNSCOM officials on the grounds of their nationality and for \nhis threats to the safety of U.N. reconnaissance aircraft.\n  Throughout the inspection process in Iraq, Saddam consistently sought \nto impede and limit UNSCOM by blocking access to numerous facilities, \nsanitizing sites before the arrival of inspectors and routinely \nattempting to deny inspectors access to requested sites and \nindividuals. At times, Saddam would promise compliance to avoid \nconsequences, only to renege later.\n  Resolution 1154 enacted in March 1998, demands that Iraq comply with \nUNSCOM and IAEA inspections and endorses the Secretary General's \nmemorandum of understanding with Iraq, providing for ``severest \nconsequences'' if Iraq fails to comply.\n  Resolution 1194 adopted in September 1998, condemns Iraq's decision \nto suspend cooperation with UNSCOM and the IAEA.\n  Resolution 1205 adopted November 1998, condemns Iraq's decision to \ncease cooperation with UNSCOM.\n  These resolutions were meaningless without Iraqi compliance. Baghdad \nrefused to work with UNSCOM and instead negotiated with the Secretary \nGeneral, whom it believed would be more sympathetic to Iraq's needs.\n  Finally, in December 1999, Resolution 1284 established the United \nNations Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission, UNMOVIC, \nreplacing UNSCOM. The resolution demanded that Iraq allow the \ncommission's teams immediate, unconditional, and unrestricted access to \nany and all aspects of Iraq's WMD programs.\n  Iraq repeatedly has rejected the unrestricted return of U.N. arms \ninspectors and claims that it has satisfied all U.N. resolutions \nrelevant to disarmament. Compared with UNSCOM, Resolution 1284 gives \nthe UNMOVIC chairman less authority, gives the Security Council a \ngreater role in defining key disarmament tasks, and requires that \ninspectors be full-time U.N. employees.\n  Saddam has manipulated the U.N. before, and if permitted, he will do \nit again. Right now, Saddam is ``shuffling the deck'' to hide his \nprohibited items in anticipation of the return of inspectors.\n  I believe that inspectors will not set foot in Iraq until Baghdad is \nready for them. If they were to return, they would be starting from \nsquare one in a hostile and deceitful environment.\n  In a June 11, 2000 article, Charles Duelfer, the former deputy \nexecutive chairman for UNSCOM, noted that, ``. . . the attempt to \ndisarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction was doomed from the \nstart. This failure repeats the same mismatch between disarmament goals \nand disarmament mechanisms that frustrated efforts to disarm Germany . \n. .'' after the First World War.\n  In the Versailles Treaty of 1919, the victorious allies imposed \ndisarmament obligations upon a defeated Germany. An international \norganization called the Inter-Allied Control Commission was created to \nimplement those provisions. The Germans, however, were very adept at \ndenial and deception. Consequently, Germany was able to preserve \nillicit armaments and weapons production. The Germans argued that the \ninspectors were too demanding and acted like spies. Does this rhetoric \nsound familiar?\n  The lessons of appeasement are not intended solely for history \nclassrooms. These lessons are to be learned and where relevant, \napplied. Saddam Hussein's priorities have not changed and I do not \nbelieve that they ever will, so we must act before his alliance with \nterror finds it way to our shores.\n  Much has been said about how unprecedented it would be to engage in \nanticipatory self defense by taking military action against Iraq. In \none respect, this is true: it is a step that our country has \nhistorically tended to shy away from taking.\n  But ``unprecedented'' is not the same thing as illegal or improper. \nScholars have debated the idea of anticipatory self-defense for many \nyears, and while there is no consensus upon its exact meaning, the idea \nis clearly not foreign to international law.\n  Under article 2 of the United Nations Charter, countries may not use \nthe ``threat or use of force'' in a manner inconsistent with the \npurposes of the United Nations. Article 51 of the charter also \nrecognizes that countries have an inherent right of both individual and \ncollective self-defense.\n  Reading articles 2 and 51 together, it is clear to me that the right \nto self-defense can arise not only in response to the ``use'' of force \nbut also in response to the threat of the use of force.\n  That this must be the case should be clear to anyone familiar with \nthe dangers of the modern world. At some point in the past, it might \nhave been possible to wait until an attack actually occurs before \nstriking back. Today, however, such a rule would clearly be unworkable, \nso dangerously unworkable as to imperil the inherent right of self-\ndefense in the first place.\n  Today, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction make it \nmadness to wait until one is attacked first. These basic military \nrealities compel us to understand the idea of self-defense in response \nto a threat in broader ways than before.\n  To paraphrase U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, the law is \nnot a suicide pact.\n  The law does not require us to wait for a biological weapon such as \nsmallpox or a genetically engineered anthrax strain to be used to kill \npotentially millions of Americans before we have the right to attack \nthe would-be user.\n  Especially in this age of modern transportation, biological weapons \nknow no boundaries. From 1918 to 1919, the influenza pandemic killed \nbetween 20 and 40 million people worldwide. Today's biological weapons \nscientists have the capacity to cause even worse mayhem, not just to \nany single target country, but perhaps to everyone on the planet.\n  We have long recognized such principles in our domestic law. A \npoliceman, for instance, need not wait for a criminal to actually shoot \nat him before he can use lethal force in self-defense.\n  The United States has been involved in Iraq for years in attempting \nto enforce the many Security Council resolutions violated by Iraq. \nThroughout this entire period, Iraq has continually fired upon our \nforces, and those of our allies, with conventional weapons.\n  Iraq has a large and expanding biological and chemical weapons \nprogram. And he is doing everything in his power to add nuclear weapons \nand long-range ballistic missiles to his arsenal.\n  The law does not require us to wait to be attached with the other \nweapons in Saddam's arsenal before completing the task the Security \nCouncil has set for ending the threat Iraq poses to international peace \nand security. The law does not require this, and our security, and that \nof other countries in the region, and around the world, does not permit \nit.\n  I will close with these final thoughts. There are those at home and \nabroad who criticize U.S. intent to take action. I remind them that the \nUnited States did not pick this conflict. The United States doe not \nwant this fight, Saddam Hussein forced our hand by not complying with \nhis obligations under the 1991 cease fire. He forced our hand by not \ncomplying with U.N. resolutions. He forced our hand by building \nalliances with terrorists.\n  We do not make this decision lightly, we are very aware of the \npotential costs of taking action, but we are much more aware of the \ncosts of not taking action. As said by Edmond Burke, ``All that is \nnecessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.''\n\n[[Page S10324]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have decided that I will cast a vote \ntonight to authorize the President to use force if necessary to find \nand destroy any weapons of mass destruction under the control of Saddam \nHussein in Iraq.\n  Some of my colleagues have expressed the ease with which they will \nvote to authorize the use of force. For me it has been very difficult.\n  When we cast a vote that could send our sons and daughters to war, it \nis deadly serious business. It requires us to ask tough questions and \ndemand good answers.\n  And while I will vote to authorize the President to use force if \nnecessary, I do so with reservation because I believe very strongly \nthat force should be an option that is used only as a last resort, \nafter all other diplomatic and peaceful means have been exhausted. And, \nif force is necessary , it ought to be carried out with a coalition of \ncountries in whose interest it is to rid Iraq of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  I want to stress that I would never have voted for the resolution in \nthe form that the White House originally asked Congress to approve. \nThat proposal asked Congress to give the President a blank check to use \nforce, with or without the backing of other nations, not just to disarm \nIraq, but also to deal with unspecified threats to American interests \nanywhere in the region.\n  However, the Joint Resolution that Congress will vote on tonight is \nfundamentally different from the one the President sent to us. It was \nnarrowed substantially in scope through bipartisan negotiations.\n  First, this resolution focuses specifically on the threat posed by \nIraq, instead of giving the President broad and unfocused authorization \nto take action in the region, as the Administration originally sought. \nSecond, the resolution expresses the conviction that President Bush \nshould continue to work through the United Nations to secure Iraq's \ncompliance with U.N. resolutions. Third, this resolution makes it clear \nthat the President must exhaust diplomatic and peaceful efforts before \nhe can use force against Iraq. And fourth, this resolution protects the \nbalance of power by requiring the President to comply with the War \nPowers Act.\n  I believe it is the right course to go to the United Nations, extract \nfrom the Security Council the tough new resolution requested by the \nPresident, and then coercively enforce that resolution with a coalition \nof countries who will not only bear the burden of fighting along side \nus if it is required, but who will also bear the expensive burden of \noccupation, peace keeping and nation building following any military \naction.\n  My fervent hope is that the Joint Resolution we pass tonight \nauthorizing the President to use force if necessary to disarm Iraq will \nspur the United Nations Security Council to take similar action. And I \nhope that the action of Congress and the United Nations together will \nconvince Saddam Hussein to allow complete and unfettered inspections \nand to cooperate in the elimination of any weapons of mass destruction \nthat he still possesses.\n  With a backdrop of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United \nStates and the clear and present danger to our country of future \nterrorist attacks, coupled with the evidence that Saddam Hussein is \naggressively trying to acquire nuclear weapons, I finally concluded \nthat, if we err in this matter, we must err on the side of our national \nsecurity interests. The stakes are too high, and the consequences too \ndeadly to do otherwise.\n  The final point I will make about this resolution is that our \nconfrontation with Iraq is dramatically different from our \nconfrontation with any other ``rogue'' country. Saddam Hussein has \nconsistently defied the terms of surrender to which he agreed at the \nend of the Gulf War in 1991. We know that he lied about his weapons of \nmass destruction and hid them from United Nations inspectors. We know \nthat he secretly continued to produce chemical and biological agents. \nWe know that he is still trying to acquire nuclear weapons.\n  I've been to the Incerlik Air Base in Turkey where American fighter \npilots fly air cover over the Northern Iraq no-fly zone. I know \nfirsthand that Iraq continues to fire on our pilots who are just doing \nwhat Saddam Hussein promised to allow under the terms of the Gulf War \nsurrender.\n  I know there are some who say, ``well, let's not be so hasty. There's \nanother way, let's explore other options.'' But the fact is we have \nworked for 10 years without success to force Iraq to comply with the \nterms of its surrender following the Gulf War. So, to those who say \nlet's give them more time, I say this situation is unique. Iraq has had \na decade to comply, and the tyrant who runs it has demonstrated that he \nhas no intention of complying without the threat of the use of force.\n  I will vote for this resolution because I think that it is important \nthat we unite behind our President to deal with the clear and present \ndanger that Iraq poses to our national security. But I want to point \nout a few concerns about aspects of this administration's foreign \npolicy which I consider to be very troubling.\n  Recently the Bush administration released a new 33-page National \nSecurity Policy document that has alarmed even our closest allies \nbecause it declares that it is America's new policy to maintain \noverwhelming military might and to use preemptive force whenever and \nwherever it suits our national interests.\n  Few would deny that the United States has the right to go after \nterrorists or rogue states preemptively if we are in serious danger of \nbeing attacked by a weapon of mass destruction. So what in the world \nwas the administration thinking when it decided to release this \ndocument at the same time that our diplomats around the world are \nseeking the support of the international community for action against \nSaddam Hussein?\n  In my judgment, this is an example of the Bush administration's \napproach to foreign policy that has largely abandoned the successful \nstrategies we've employed for decades to weld together alliances and \ncoalitions of our allies to tackle the threats and challenges of an \nunstable world.\n  Another issue that relates to this debate is America's role in the \ninternational effort to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  One of the centerpieces of the debate about the danger Iraq poses for \nthe rest of the world is that Saddam Hussein might soon possess a \nnuclear weapon. I acknowledge the danger that would pose for the region \nand the rest of the world, but I want to ask those who are experiencing \nseizures over that prospect: where is their concern about the larger \ndanger posed by the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries and to \nterrorists?\n  Year after year, and time after time those who now appear most \nalarmed about the prospect that Iraq would possess even one nuclear \nweapon, are the same people who are unwilling to exert U.S. leadership \nin the international effort to stop the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons.\n  For example, President Bush has appointed John Bolton to be the \nAssistant Secretary of State responsible for arms control even though \nBolton's stated position is that he doesn't believe in arms control. \nThis administration, and its supporters in Congress, have demonstrated \na lack of interest in making any effort to stop the spread of nuclear \nweapons.\n  They oppose the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty even though a \nblue-ribbon panel of the National Academies of Science recently \nconcluded that the treaty would significantly enhance U.S. security by \nslowing the spread of nuclear weapons.\n  And this administration and its supporters want to deploy a new \ngeneration of ``designer'' nuclear weapons that could be used like \nconventional weapons. Nothing would do more to undermine international \nefforts to stigmatize countries that aspire to become nuclear powers.\n  Perhaps now the prospect of a country like Iraq acquiring one nuclear \nweapon will convince the Bush administration that safeguarding the \nnuclear weapons that exist around the world, reducing nuclear \nstockpiles, and stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons to other \ncountries and to terrorists must be among this country's top \npriorities.\n  There are somewhere in the neighborhood of 25,000-30,000 nuclear \nweapons in the world today. A fair number of them are not very well \ncontrolled,\n\n[[Page S10325]]\n\nparticularly in Russia, which has thousands of nuclear weapons in \nstorage facilities that fall far short of American security standards. \nRussia also has enough highly enriched uranium and weapons-grade \nplutonium for 80,000 nuclear weapons. Much of it is poorly protected \nagainst theft or diversion.\n  One nuclear weapon in the wrong hands will make the devastating \ntragedy of 9/11 seem like a small incident by comparison. That is why \nthis issue is so critical, and it is why I raise it now to point out \nthe inconsistency of those who are pushing so hard to use force against \nIraq but who are so unwilling to exhibit any muscle in dealing with the \nbroader and potentially more devastating problem of the proliferation \nof nuclear weapons.\n  So I will vote for this Joint Resolution because I am convinced it is \ntime for the United States to assume leadership in the effort to disarm \nSaddam Hussein and make Iraq live up to the commitments it made after \nthe Gulf War. But I hope that President Bush will help prevent further \nIraqs by stepping forward and exerting US leadership in the \ninternational effort to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons \nand other weapons of mass destruction.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I am here to speak in support of the \nresolution before us, which I cosponsored. I believe we must vote for \nthis resolution not because we want war, but because the national \nsecurity of our country requires action. The prospect of using force to \nprotect our security is the most difficult decision a Nation must ever \nmake.\n  We all agree that this is not an easy decision. It carries many \nrisks. If force proves necessary, it will also carry costs, certainly \nin resources, and perhaps in lives. After careful consideration, I \nbelieve that the risks of inaction are far greater than the risks of \naction.\n  Saddam Hussein's regime represents a grave threat to America and our \nallies, including our vital ally, Israel. For more than two decades, \nSaddam Hussein has sought weapons of mass destruction through every \navailable means. We know that he has chemical and biological weapons. \nHe has already used them against his neighbors and his own people, and \nis trying to build more. We know that he is doing everything he can to \nbuild nuclear weapons, and we know that each day he gets closer to \nachieving that goal.\n  Iraq has continued to seek nuclear weapons and develop its arsenal in \ndefiance of the collective will of the international community, as \nexpressed through the United Nations Security Council. It is violating \nthe terms of the 1991 cease-fire that ended the Gulf war and as many as \n16 Security Council resolutions, including 11 resolutions concerning \nIraq's efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction.\n  By ignoring these resolutions, Saddam Hussein is undermining the \ncredibility of the United Nations, openly violating international law, \nand making a mockery of the very idea of collective action that is so \nimportant to the United States and its allies.\n  We cannot allow Saddam Hussein to get nuclear weapons in violation of \nhis own commitments, our commitments, and the world's commitments.\n  This resolution will send a clear message to Iraq and the world: \nAmerica is united in its determination to eliminate forever the threat \nof Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.\n  The United States must do as much as possible to build a new United \nNations Security Council coalition against Saddam Hussein.\n  Although the administration was far too slow to start this diplomatic \nprocess, squandering valuable time to bring nations to our side, I \nsupport its recent efforts to forge a new U.N. Security Council \nresolution to disarm Iraq.\n  If inspectors go back into Iraq, they should do so with parameters \nthat are air-tight, water-tight, and Saddam-tight. They should be \nallowed to see what they want when they want, anytime, anywhere, \nwithout warning, and without delay.\n  Yet if the Security Council is prevented from supporting this new \neffort, then the United States must be prepared to act with as many \nallies as possible to address this threat.\n  We must achieve the central goal of disarming Iraq. Of course, the \nbest outcome would be a peaceful resolution of this issue. No one here \nwants war. We all hope that Saddam Hussein meets his obligations to \nexisting Security Council Resolutions and agrees to disarm, but after \n11 years of watching Hussein play shell-games with his weapons \nprograms, there is little reason to believe he has any intention to \ncomply with an even tougher resolution. We cannot trust Saddam Hussein, \nand we would be irresponsible to do so.\n  That is why we must be prepared to use force, if necessary, to disarm \nSaddam Hussein, and eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction once \nand for all.\n  Almost no one disagrees with these basic facts: that Saddam Hussein \nis a tyrant and a menace; that he has weapons of mass destruction and \nthat he is doing everything in his power to get nuclear weapons; that \nhe has supported terrorists; that he is a grave threat to the region, \nto vital allies like Israel, and to the United States; and that he is \nthwarting the will of the international community and undermining the \nUnited Nations' credibility.\n  Yet some question why Congress should act now to give the President \nthe authority to act against Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  I believe we should act now for two reasons: first, bipartisan \ncongressional action on a strong, unambiguous resolution, like the one \nbefore us now, will strengthen America's hand as we seek support from \nthe Security Council and seek to enlist the cooperation of our allies.\n  If the administration continues its strong, if belated, diplomacy, \nbacked by the bipartisan resolve of the Congress, I believe the United \nStates will succeed in rallying many allies to our side.\n  Second, strong domestic support and a broad international coalition \nwill make it less likely that force would need to be used. Saddam \nHussein has one last chance to adhere to his obligations and disarm, \nand his past behavior shows that the only chance he will comply is if \nhe is threatened with force.\n  Of course, there is no guarantee that he will comply even if \nthreatened by force, but we must try.\n  Others argue that if even our allies support us, we should not \nsupport this resolution because confronting Iraq now would undermine \nthe long-term fight against terrorist groups like al-Qaida. Yet, I \nbelieve that this is not an either-or choice. Our national security \nrequires us to do both, and we can.\n  The resolution before us today is significantly better than the one \nthe president initially submitted. It is not a blank check. It contains \nseveral provisions that I and many of my colleagues have long argued \nwere required.\n  First, it gives the administration the authority to use all necessary \nmeans to eliminate the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Second, it calls on the administration to do as much as possible to \nforge a new U.N. Security Council mandate, understanding that if new \nSecurity Council action proves impossible, the United States must be \nprepared to act with as many allies as will join us.\n  Third, it requires the administration to report to Congress on its \nplans to assist with Iraq's transition to democracy after Saddam \nHussein is gone.\n  It is in America's national interest to help build an Iraq at peace \nwith itself and its neighbors, because a democratic, tolerant and \naccountable Iraq will be a peaceful regional partner. Such an Iraq \ncould serve as a model for the entire Arab world.\n  So far, we have not heard nearly enough from the administration about \nits plans for assisting the Iraqi people as they rebuild their lives \nand create a new, democratic government. The president has said that \nthe U.S. will help, but he hasn't offered any details about how.\n  As we have learned in Afghanistan, this administration's words are \nnot enough. This resolution will require the administration to move \nbeyond its words and share with Congress, and the world, its concrete \nplans for how America will support a post-Saddam Iraq.\n  Finally, in taking this action, Congress must make clear that any \nactions against Iraq are part of a broader strategy to strengthen \nAmerican security in the Middle East, and indeed around the world.\n  We must do more to support existing non-proliferation and disarmament\n\n[[Page S10326]]\n\nprograms that can help prevent access to the weapons-grade materials \nthat tyrants like Saddam Hussein want. We must demand America's active \nand continuous involvement in addressing the crisis between Israel and \nthe Palestinians, and promoting democratization throughout the Arab \nworld. We must commit to developing a national strategy for energy \nsecurity, one that would reduce our reliance on the Middle East for \nsuch critical resources.\n  The decision we must make now is one a nation never seeks. Yet when \nconfronted with a danger as great as Saddam Hussein, it is a decision \nwe must make. America's security requires nothing less.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak out on the issue of \nIraq. This conceivably is one of the most important issues that we as a \ngoverning body will address in what remains of the 107th Congress.\n  Let me start by saying that Saddam Hussein is a dangerous man. As \nmany of my colleagues have already pointed out, he has actively engaged \nin attacking Americans in the region. He has actively engaged in \ndeploying chemical and biological weapons against his own people. He \nhas participated in genocide against his own people. He has continually \ndeceived U.N. weapons inspectors. He has failed to comply with U.N. \nresolutions to disarm his weapons of mass destruction. He was involved \nin an assassination attempt against former President George Bush \nsenior. He has committed serious acts of aggression against his \nneighbors.\n  These are all acts of a man that cannot be trusted.\n  Back in 1998, the Senate passed the Iraqi Liberation Act that \ndeclared it should be the policy of the United States to seek to remove \nSaddam Hussein from power in Iraq and replace him with a democratic \ngovernment. I supported this bill and believe that Saddam continues to \nbe a detriment to his people. The Iraqi people deserve a chance to be \nfree from a vicious dictator.\n  Our actions today go far beyond declaring Saddam a danger to his \npeople and to the rest of the world. Our actions today will authorize \nthe use of force in the case Saddam refuses once again to defy U.N. \nresolutions and disarm. Our actions today could send our sons and \ndaughters to battle. And, our actions today, if not handled cautiously, \ncould erupt into a conflict we as a nation are not prepared to address. \nThis is not something we can take lightly.\n  Last week, a bipartisan group of Congressmen and Senators brokered an \nagreement with the President and produced a resolution that strikes a \ngood balance between diplomacy and force. The resolution supports \nexhausting diplomatic means to disarm Saddam prior to engaging in the \nuse of force. It also provides the President with adequate flexibility \nto do what needs to be done in the case that Saddam refuses to disarm. \nI have cosponsored this bipartisan agreement and believe that the focus \nof the resolution is appropriate.\n  I believe that a strong resolution is necessary to protect the \nAmerican people from threats posed by Saddam Hussein. And while I \nbelieve we should strive to garner the support of the U.N. and our \nallies around the world, we must ensure that we don't limit our ability \nto act to protect American lives.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I have the privilege of serving \nin what was, for 30 years, Mark Hatfield's seat in the United States \nSenate. And as those who served with him know, no one is more dedicated \nto peace than Mark Hatfield. As I have thought about the question of \ngoing to war with Iraq, I find myself mindful of Senator Hatfield, and \nI am likewise committed to working for peace.\n  I am also very mindful of the Oregonians who have expressed to me \ntheir hopes and prayers for peace. And it is precisely because I want \npeace that I stand today to express my support for this resolution.\n  I believe in peace and diplomacy. These values have guided my service \non the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And rather than an immediate \ndeclaration of war, I strongly believe that this resolution is but one \nstep in a continuing diplomatic process.\n  I have no doubt that Saddam Hussein presents an imminent threat to \nAmerica, our freedom and our way of life. The proof lies in Baghdad. \nOver the last decade we have collected a considerable body of evidence \nthat Hussein is amassing weapons of mass destruction, weapons that he \nhas already used on his own people.\n  It is only with a heavy heart that any of us can reach the solemn \nconclusion that our young men and women may have to risk their lives in \ndefense of our Nation. But the heavy weight of proof moves us now to \nprevent the loss of more American lives.\n  More than a decade ago, the United States led a coalition of nations \nagainst the tyrannical regime of Saddam Hussein. The United Nations \nresolutions that followed Saddam's surrender required Iraq, among other \nthings, to halt its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs, \naccount for POWs from the Gulf War, and cease its support for \nterrorism. Since that time, Saddam Hussein has continually and \nflagrantly violated the U.N.'s requirements. In less than 12 years, he \nhas defied 16 Security Council resolutions and provoked at least 30 \nCouncil statements condemning these violations. He has exploited the \ngoodwill of the international community, oppressed his people, \ndevastated his nation and developed weapons of mass destruction.\n  Today, as it was then, we are called as Americans not simply to \ncontribute to an international coalition, but to lead it. That \nobligation became all the more clear when last year's terrorist attacks \nushered in an era when threats are more tangible, where civilians are \nat risk, and where deterrence no longer works. I believe the free \nnations of the world will again join us in the fight against tyranny, \nand I still hold out hope that the danger Iraq poses can be eliminated \nwithout war.\n  But today, we must choose whether to allow Saddam Hussein to continue \nthreatening the civilized world or to disarm him. I believe we must \nchoose the latter. We will first exhaust every peaceful means in our \neffort, but confront him we must.\n  Saddam Hussein has attacked Iran, Israel, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. He \nrecently called on the people of the Arab world to attack the United \nStates and he is an avowed enemy of the democracy in the Middle East, \nIsrael. He is a man who murdered his own people in chemical attacks and \nsystematically attempted to destroy an ethnic minority in his nation. \nTo believe that Saddam Hussein would hesitate to launch future attacks \nwould be to turn a blind eye to a lethal mix of weapons of mass \ndestruction and terrorists waiting to use them.\n  In addition to the arms we are certain he has, overwhelming evidence \nindicates that he continues to develop weapons of mass destruction with \nthe full intention of using them. High level Iraqi defectors have \nprovided similar evidence of biological and nuclear weapons programs, \nevidence that is substantiated by Saddam's actions. We know that he has \nsold $3 billion worth of oil illegally this year, money that is \nunaccounted for, while importing materials used in nuclear enrichment \nprograms. All the while, he has called Iraq's nuclear scientists ``the \nsalvation of his nation.''\n  On September 12, President Bush outlined these facts when he spoke to \nthe United Nations. As he said then, Saddam is truly defying the U.N., \nnot only the United States. The 16 resolutions Iraq has violated were \nnot issued by the U.S. Congress, but by the U.N. Security Council, the \nhighest body of international diplomacy. While few reasonable people \nwould disagree that Saddam Hussein is dangerous and will attack America \nand its allies whenever it is possible, the President was correct in \nseeking international support for confronting Iraq.\n  Diplomacy and efforts toward peace are always preferable to war. But \nif war is unavoidable, it is best to have the backing of the world \ncommunity. Immediately following the president's call to action, \ninternational support began to increase. And the president continues to \nbuild on that support. I believe that with the passage of this \nresolution we will see our allies join in lending our sons and \ndaughters in seeking a peaceful regime in Iraq.\n  The United Nations now has the opportunity to prove itself to be an \nimportant world body. It is incumbent upon the U.N., and especially the \nSecurity Council, to ensure that if Saddam\n\n[[Page S10327]]\n\nHussein fails to fulfill his most recent commitments to weapons \ninspectors, he does not do so with impunity.\n  I would like to conclude by telling you about a trip I made earlier \nthis year, I traveled to Coos Bay, OR to attend the memorial service of \na remarkable young man named Byran Bertrand. Bryan was a 23-year-old \nMarine who gave his life for his country when his C-130 crashed into a \nmountain near the Afghan-Pakistan border. The memorial service program \nincluded excerpts from the last letter that Bryan had send this \nparents.\n  In this letter he explained why he had turned down the opportunity to \nreturn to duty in the United States. ``You know me,'' wrote the former \nhigh school athlete, ``I always hated sitting on the bench.''\n  In those words, we can find our calling as a Nation. If Saddam \nHussein does not comply with United Nations resolutions and if he \ncontinues to build and stockpile weapons of mass destruction, then \nAmerica can no longer sit on the bench. We must take the heavy mantle \nof leadership to seek a peaceful regime change. This burden rests on \nthe President, on the Congress, but more importantly, it rests on the \npeople of the United States. For it is the American people, 3,000 of \nwhom died on September 11, 2001, who are Saddam's targets. We are \ntargets because ours is a Nation that is the beacon of liberty in the \nworld. We must never forget that, and we must never take it for \ngranted.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the debate here in this chamber is being \nheld in community halls, meeting places and living rooms across America \nand across Iowa. Many Iowans have told me in recent weeks that going to \nwar should be the last resort for our Nation and I agree with them.\n  Saddam Hussein is a brutal dictator, who has brought nothing but pain \nand suffering to the Iraqi people and threat and instability to his \nneighbors throughout the Persian Gulf and the Middle East. He invaded \nIran before he invaded Kuwait. He has aided and abetted the suicide \nbombers. He is guilty of countless crimes against humanity. He has even \nused chemical weapons against men, women and children in his own \ncountry. I understand the grave danger posed to America and the whole \ninternational community by weapons of mass destruction in the hands of \na reckless dictator like Saddam Hussein. Since the terrorist hijackings \nand anthrax attacks in America last year, which wantonly took the lives \nof more than 3,000 people, all Americans are rightly concerned about \nthe safety of our homeland and united in supporting the brave men and \nwomen who defend us and the cause of freedom around the world.\n  While there is not definite evidence of prior close collaboration \nbetween the al-Qaeda criminals who attacked our nation last year and \nSaddam Hussein, there is no doubt they might find common cause in \nattacking us and our allies at any time. Simply put: it is clear to me \nthat the current situation in Iraq is an on-going tragedy for the Iraqi \npeople and an unacceptable menace for us, his neighbors, and the world. \nPresident Bush is to be commended for calling on the United Nations to \nconfront this menace and Iraq's flagrant disregard of past Security \nCouncil Resolutions. It remains to be seen whether and how the UN \nSecurity Council will meet head-on the direct challenge posed by the \ncontinued failure of Saddam Hussein and the Government of Iraq to fully \ncomply with 16 resolutions approved by the Council since 1991, \nincluding an ironclad requirement that Iraq destroy all of its \nbiological and chemical weapons, dismantle its nuclear program, and \nsubmit to rigorous international inspections to verify its compliance.\n  But there is a right way and a wrong way to confront Saddam Hussein \nand to force him to relinquish all of the weapons of mass destruction \nat his disposal. Our policy, and certainly any fateful decision to \nactually go to war, must be made after careful deliberation and in full \naccordance with the U.S. Constitution and our Nation's laws. No \nPresident of either political party should be allowed to take our \nnation into war like the one that is now possible solely on his or her \nown authority. That is why last July Senator Specter and I were the \nfirst members of the Senate to introduce bipartisan legislation to \nrequire the Congress to debate and vote on a resolution to require the \nCongress to debate and vote on a resolution authorizing the use of \nforce by American armed forces against Iraq before the President issued \nsuch an order. I think the President was right to provide \nadditional information to the Congress and the American people and to \nput this issue before the Congress with the draft resolution of three \nweeks ago.\n\n  In my view, that first draft amounted to a blank check for the \nPresident to go to war with Iraq and other countries in the region, \nwhenever he saw fit, and regardless of whether we had the backing of \nour allies inside and outside the region or in the international \ncommunity. I have said that I could not have supported that resolution. \nIt was too broad, too unqualified, and too far-reaching. I am glad that \nsince then Republican and Democratic Senators across the political \nspectrum have recognized the need to narrow and improve upon the \nPresident's initial request. Senators Biden and Levin, Chairmen of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee and Armed Services Committee \nrespectively, held essential hearings and formulated thoughtful \nlegislative proposals. Their work reaffirms that the focus of U.S. \npolicy should be to secure the disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction and the establishment of a new, effective international \ninspections regime to enforce that policy. Their careful approach also \nunderscores the urgency and importance of maximizing our diplomatic \nefforts to secure the strongest possible U.N. Security Council \nresolution to force Saddam Hussein to relinquish his pursuit of weapons \nof mass destruction once and for all.\n  I also took to heart the President's statement in his address to the \nnation Monday night in which he said that the pending congressional \nresolution giving him the right to use force if necessary, ``does not \nmean that military action is imminent or unavoidable.'' That statement \nis consistent with the approach I believe in, which can maximize the \nstrength of our coalition and the success of our policy. Accordingly, \nat this point in time, I believe the President and the Congress should \nbe united and focused like a laser on getting the strongest possible, \nenforceable resolution through the U.N. Security Council. That is why I \nwill vote for the Levin resolution and why I ultimately will vote for \nthe Lieberman resolution, too, if that is the final choice. But I want \nto be very clear that in voting for these resolutions, this Senator is \nnot voting for immediate war with Iraq. I am voting for them in order \nto give the President and Secretary of State Powell the \nmaximum leverage to persuade the UN Security Council to promptly \napprove a new, tough, resolution that requires Iraq to immediately \nallow unconditional, unfettered inspections designed to secure the \ncomplete disarmament of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. \nThere should be clear consequences that follow from his failure to \ncomply. And the UN inspectors should be given enough time to complete \ntheir work and to determine whether Iraq can be disarmed short of going \nto war.\n\n  I am concerned that if we immediately move to unilateral U.S. \nmilitary action or in concert with only our British allies we will \nweaken our coalition efforts to wage and win the international fight \nagainst terrorism. This would also undermine international respect for \nthe rule of law and the multilateral problem-solving institutions that \nAmerica helped to create and which have served as the foundation for \nprincipled U.S. leadership in the world for 50 years and more. Indeed, \nI am concerned that precipitous U.S. military action against Iraq could \nresult in our nation and world becoming less rather than more stable \nand secure. Under the terms of these resolutions, the President will be \nrequired to report to the Congress every 60 days on on-going diplomatic \nefforts at the UN Security Council and elsewhere to establish a tough \nnew inspections regime and to force Saddam Hussein to destroy his \nweapons of mass destruction. At that time, we will have the opportunity \nto examine the issues again. Nobody knows for certain at this time, \nincluding the President of the United States, how best to compel Iraq \nto get rid of all of its weapons of mass destruction. But we do know, \nwe all\n\n[[Page S10328]]\n\nagree, that war must be a last resort, not a first response. We must \nwork with the international community as much as possible to find new \nand enforceable means to deal with the Iraqi danger in ways that make \nthis a safe world.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the resolution authorizing the use of \nforce against Iraq is before us.\n  We are being asked to decide some fundamental questions about the \nworld in which we live. But more significantly, we are being asked to \ndecide what kind of world we choose for our children.\n  Essentially, the question is this: Is the world going to be safer \ntoday, tomorrow and in the years ahead if the United States leads an \neffort to rid the world of not only Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, \nbut of a ruthless terrorist-supporting despot as well?\n  Here is what we have learned.\n  There is agreement that Saddam Hussein is amassing weapons of mass \ndestruction--chemical, biological, and even nuclear--but some continue \nto naively believe that diplomatic initiatives and weapon inspections \nmust be given a chance to succeed. There is consensus that Iraq is a \nstate sponsor of terrorism, but some believe that America should not \nact alone against Iraq and that an attack on Iraq will detract from our \nongoing pursuit of al-Qaida. There is concurrence that Saddam Hussein \nis a mass murderer of Iraqi, Kurdish, Kuwaiti and Iranian men, women, \nand children, but some believe that Iraq poses no immediate threat to \nthe American people or those in Saddam's backyard, including our \nallies.\n  My views on this issue could not be more clear: Our Commander in \nChief has requested the authority to use force against Iraq to ``defend \nthe national security of the United States against the continuing \nthreat posed by Iraq'' and Congress must authorize it and must do so \nnow.\n  Nine days after the al-Qaida attacks on our soil, President Bush \npromised Congress and the world that America would bring the war on \nterrorism to the terrorists wherever they may hide. He intends to do \njust that in Iraq. This Congress and our entire nation stood as one \nwith President Bush following the September 11th attacks. A year later, \nwe must continue to stand behind his outstanding leadership in \ncombating terrorism around the globe. This war on terrorism will not \nend--it must not end--until terrorists and their supporters are \ndestroyed.\n  Let me say to my colleagues who suggest that diplomatic initiatives \nand weapon inspections can prevent the coming conflict with Iraq to \nlook at recent history. Saddam Hussein has violated each and every one \nof the 16 U.N. Security Council Resolutions pertaining to Iraq. His \narmed forces continue to fire on American and coalition aircraft in the \nno-fly zone. Al-Qaida terrorists continue to leave footprints on Iraqi \nsoil. And Saddam Hussein and his henchmen continue to make billions of \ndollars by exploiting the U.N.'s oil for food program and through other \nillicit activities.\n  Although the regime recently proved that it can fool some \nembarrassingly naive visiting American lawmakers into believing its \nempty assurances of cooperation and compliance, they are not duping \nthis Senator--or the President.\n  More importantly, the American people will not follow the lead of \nthese modern-day Neville Chamberlains and allow the United States to be \nplayed for a fool. For it is only a fool who does not learn from past \nmistakes, and the world has ten years of Iraqi lies from which to \nlearn. Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly a day after \nthe anniversary of the September 11th attacks, President Bush \nchallenged the United Nations to maintain its relevancy in a world \nchallenged by terror:\n\n       Iraq has answered a decade of U.N. demands with a decade of \n     defiance. . . . [America] will work with the U.N. Security \n     Council to meet our common challenge. If Iraq's regime defies \n     us again, the world must move deliberately, decisively to \n     hold Iraq to account. We will work with the U.N. Security \n     Council for the necessary resolutions.\n\n  The fact is that President Bush is giving the United Nations and the \ninternational community a final chance to disarm Saddam Hussein through \ndiplomatic means. But under no illusions of Saddam Hussein's violent \nand irrational character, the President has made clear that if reason \nfails, force will prevail. I am reminded of President Franklin \nRoosevelt insights into Nazi Germany and Adolph Hitler: ``No man can \ntame a tiger into a kitten by stroking it. There can be no appeasement \nwith ruthlessness. There can be no reasoning with an incendiary bomb.''\n  Unfortunately, some of my colleagues seem to ignore this indisputable \ntruth--and the fact that America is at war against global terrorists. \nFormer Vice President Al Gore's recent attack on the President for his \nconduct of the war was ill-timed and ill-advised. A self proclaimed \nhawk, Mr. Gore alleged in a recent speech that in a single year, \nPresident Bush ``squandered the international outpouring of sympathy, \ngoodwill, and solidarity that followed the attacks of September 11th \nand converted it into anger and apprehension aimed much more at the \nUnited States than at the terrorist network. . . . '' This is utter \nnonsense, and the American people are right to expect more from a \nformer national leader.\n  Mr. Gore seems to have forgotten that in a single year the Bush \nadministration liberated the people of Afghanistan from oppressive \nTaliban rule, destroyed and disrupted al-Qaida operations in South Asia \nand throughout the world, and bolstered homeland defense for the \nAmerican people. If Mr. Gore belittles the victory in Afghanistan--\nagainst what he describes as a ``fifth rate military power''--why was \nit that his own administration failed to take decisive action to topple \nthe Taliban and al-Qaida? One might surmise that they were too busy \n``feeling pain'' to inflict any.\n  Mr. Gore's characterization of the pre-emptive use of force to \nprevent terrorist attacks as ``a troubling new element'' of U.S. \nforeign policy is similarly misguided. In the post-September 11th \nworld, the Bush doctrine of pre-emption makes plain old common sense. \nWho among us disagrees that terrorists should be destroyed before they \nhave a chance to again bring death and destruction on our family, \nfriends, or neighbors? What do we say to the victims of a terrorist \nattack that we could have prevented--sorry, but Moscow, Paris, or \nBeijing objected to pre-emptive action?\n  The fact is that that America has the right and the responsibility to \nprotect and defend its citizens against terrorism--be it from al Qaida \nterrorists or weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\n  Let me also dispel the myth that military action against Iraq will \ndetract from ongoing operations against al-Qaida. Secretary of Defense \nDonald Rumsfeld testified before Congress last month that ``. . . Iraq \nis part of the global war on terror. Stopping terrorist regimes from \nacquiring weapons of mass destruction is a key objective of that war. \nAnd we can fight all elements of the global war on terrorism \nsimultaneously.''\n  We have no choice but to fight these threats simultaneously. Our \nnation is at war. Given Saddam Hussein's use of chemical and biological \nweapons against his own people and his neighbors, it is reckless to \ndismiss the immediacy of the threats posed by his regime to the United \nStates. We already know that he is a mass murderer and that he is armed \nand dangerous--to treat him otherwise is folly.\n  Saddam Hussein is also a danger to the region. Those nations \nreluctant to confront him would be wise to take note of the British \nGovernment's assessment that Iraq is capable of deploying chemical and \nbiological weapons within 45 minutes.\n  With Fort Campbell and the 101st Airborne Division in Kentucky, I \nunderstand firsthand what risks are posed to our military personnel by \nan attack on Iraq. Having fired the opening shots of Operation Desert \nStorm more than a decade ago, the Screaming Eagles are no strangers to \nthat country. They--and the Special Forces soldiers of the 5th Group \nand the Night Stalkers of Task Force 160--are professionals, the best \nof best. America is fortunate to have such dedicated patriots serving \non our front lines. We can be secure in the knowledge that if these \ntroops return to the region, they will answer the call with the same \ndetermination and dedication as they did in 1991.\n  Let me conclude by saying that we did not ask for this war on \nterrorism.\n\n[[Page S10329]]\n\nBut we will fight it and win it--on our terms and conditions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to state \nthat, after much deliberation, I have decided to vote for the \nresolution introduced by Senators Lieberman, Warner, Bayh and McCain.\n  In two prior floor statements, I have expressed my views. I serve as \nthe senior Senator from California, representing 35 million people. \nThat is a formidable task. People have weighed in by the tens of \nthousands. If I were just to cast a representative vote based on those \nwho have voiced their opinions with my office--and with no other \nfactors--I would have to vote against this resolution. But as a member \nof the Intelligence Committee, as someone who has read and discussed \nand studied the history of Iraq, the record of obfuscation and the \nterror Saddam Hussein has sown, one comes to the conclusion that he \nremains a consequential threat.\n  Although the ties between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida are tenuous, \nthere should be no question that his entire government is forged and \nheld together by terror: The terror of secret police in station wagons \non street corners watching; The terror forged through assassinations \nand brutal murders of anyone who disagrees with him; And yes even of \nhis own family members.\n  While the distance between the United States and Iraq is great, \nSaddam Hussein's ability to use his chemical and biological weapons \nagainst us is not constrained by geography--it can be accomplished in a \nnumber of different ways--which is what makes this threat so real and \npersuasive. I supported the Levin amendment, which authorized use of \nforce pursuant to U.N. Security Council action, because it was the \nstrongest resolution supporting a multilateral effort. I believe a \nmultilateral effort, through the United Nations, provides a strong \nmoral imprimatur and as such is preferable to America's taking \npreemptive action that could have consequences tomorrow and years after \nthat--consequences we cannot imagine or even begin to understand today.\n  The original resolution sent to Congress by the President would have \nauthorized a broad and sweeping use of force whenever or wherever he \ndeemed necessary--literally any place on earth. It would have \nauthorized the newly promulgated national security strategy of \nunilateral preemptive use of force in the defense of the nation in the \nwar on terror. The resolution before us does not grant such a sweeping \nuse of force. Rather, the use of force is confined to Iraq and targeted \ntoward forcing Iraq to comply with 16 Security Council resolutions \npassed in the wake of the Persian Gulf war in 1991.\n  Most importantly, I believe the Lieberman resolution becomes a \ncatalyst to encourage prompt, forceful and effective action by the \nUnited Nations to compel this long sought-after and much-evaded \ndisarmament of weapons of mass destruction. Disarming Iraq under Saddam \nHussein is necessary and vital to the safety and security of America, \nthe Persian Gulf and the Middle East--let there be no doubt about this. \nBut the decision to cast this vote does not come lightly. I continue to \nhave serious concerns that there are those in the administration who \nwould seek to use this authorization for a unilateral, preemptive \nattack against Iraq. I believe this would be a terrible mistake.\n  But I am reassured by statements made by the President in his address \nto the United Nations on September 12, which conveyed a major shift in \nthe administration's approach--turning away from a preemptive strategy \nand, instead, engaging and challenging the U.N. Security Council to \ncompel Iraq's disarmament and back this with force. I deeply believe \nthat it is vital for the U.N. Security Council to approve a new, robust \nresolution requiring full and unconditional access to search for and \ndestroy all weapons of mass destruction. Unfortunately, the Security \nCouncil has not yet taken this action. Nor do we, at this time, know if \nthey will.\n  If one believes Iraq is a real threat, and I do, and if the United \nNations fails to act, then the only alternative is military action led \nby the United States. Ironically, this authorization of use of force \nmay well prompt the Security Council to act. Because if they do not, \nthe United Nations becomes a paper tiger unable to enforce its mandates \nand unwilling to meet the challenge of this new day of danger.\n  For the past 11 years, Saddam Hussein has prevaricated, manipulated, \ndeceived and violated every agreement he has made to disarm. If the \npast is prologue, this record means that arms inspections, alone, will \nnot force disarmament. The great danger is a nuclear one. If Saddam \nHussein achieves nuclear capability, the risk increases exponentially \nand the balance of power shifts radically in a deeply menacing way. As \nI said on this floor in earlier remarks, I believe that Saddam Hussein \nrules by terror and has squirreled away stores of biological and \nchemical weapons. He has used them on Kurdish villages and in his \ninvasion of Iran.\n  Evidence indicates that he is engaged in developing nuclear weapons. \nHowever, today the best authorities I could find indicate he does not \nyet have nuclear capability. But this is only a question of time. And \nwe cannot let Saddam Hussein become a nuclear power.\n  And, so, it is my intention to vote yes on the resolution before us. \nI do so with the hope that the United Nations will rise to the \nchallenge and with the trust that the administration forge a coalition \nrather than go it alone. And I do so with the fervent prayer that it \nwill not be necessary to place America's fighting forces or innocent \ncivilians anywhere in harm's way.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as Members of this body, there is no \nissue we face as grave and important as determining whether we should \nauthorize force against Iraq that might place our men and women in \nuniform in mortal danger in order to protect the freedoms we cherish, \nand extend these freedoms to the people of Iraq, through the \ndisarmament of a tyrant committed to harming his own people and the \nrest of the world. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, and as \na citizen, I have given great consideration and thought to this course \nof action. Can I in good conscience authorize the use of force that \ncould place someone's child, or my child, or someone's husband, wife, \nmother, or father in harm's way? Should the President commit troops to \nIraq, American blood will certainly be shed. But, the authorization of \nforce is recourse we must take.\n  For 11 years, Saddam Hussein has openly violated 16 U.N. resolutions \ncalling on him to disarm; cease his production of weapons of mass \ndestruction; and stop the ethnic cleansing of his own people. For 11 \nyears, the people of Iraq have suffered. Furthermore, Saddam Hussein \nhas made the world a much more dangerous place. His relish to produce \nchemical, biological, and nuclear weapons has only increased since the \nend of the Gulf War. Now, we have learned that he is harboring al-Qaida \nterrorists; strengthening his ties to al-Qaida; and financing terrorist \norganizations that promote suicide bomb attacks in Israel.\n  I am confident that the enactment of this resolution will give our \nPresident the tools he needs to bring the world community together to \ndisarm this brutal tyrant through diplomacy. But, this resolution also \ngives the President authority to follow diplomacy with force, if \nnecessary, to ensure that the threats Saddam Hussein brings to the \nworld are neutralized.\n  The threat from Saddam Hussein's WMD programs is real and growing \nevery day we fail to take action to disarm him. He has used WMD against \nhis own people and his neighbors. We should not wonder whether he has \nany interest in using them against the U.S. or our allies.\n  As chair of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, along \nwith Senator Roberts, the Subcommittee held a hearing in February to \ninvestigate the status of his WMD programs since inspectors left and \nthe threat those weapons could pose to the U.S. At that hearing, the \nSubcommittee was faced with the blunt findings that Saddam successfully \nhid weapons while U.N. inspectors were in Iraq. Moreover, there are no \nmechanisms in place to prohibit Iraq from ramping up its production of \nbiological and chemical weapons, and its quest for nuclear weapons.\n  At the hearing, Anthony Cordesman, from the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies, stated Iraq admitted in 1995, ``that it had \nproduced\n\n[[Page S10330]]\n\n30,000 liters of bulk biological agents. Iraq admitted it produced \nanthrax, botulinum toxins, and aflatoxins.'' We must remember it took \nonly a few grams of Anthrax to throw the Senate and the East Coast of \nthe U.S. into disarray. Worse yet, Iraq admitted it had affixed these \nbiological agents to missile warheads and bombs.\n  Dr. Cordesman went on to say that UNSCOM believed Iraq had produced \nas much as 120,000 liters of biological weapons, not the 30,000 it \nadmitted--enough to kill millions. Furthermore, UNSCOM has been out of \nIraq for 4 years, yet UNSCOM stated that Iraq could reconstitute its \nbiological weapons program within a matter of weeks after UNSCOM's \ndeparture. Imagine the destruction that could be caused by Saddam \nHussein with his unchecked inventory of hundreds of thousands of liters \nof biological weapons. Again, he has the capability to injure or kill \nmillions.\n  The Subcommittee also received testimony that Iraq has actively \nrebuilt its chemical weapons programs since UNSCOM was thrown out of \nIraq. UNSCOM reported to the Security Council that Iraq withheld \ninformation related to Iraq's chemical weapons program. UNSCOM \nuncovered only a small portion of Iraq's chemical weapons. In fact, \nIraq confiscated information gathered by UNSCOM regarding Iraq's \nchemical weapons, so the information could not be transmitted to the \nSecurity Council. Iraq also told UNSCOM Iraq had not armed missiles \nwith VX gas--one of the deadliest of nerve agents. Yet, in 1998, UNSCOM \ndiscovered missiles tipped with VX. Soon after, UNSCOM was told to \nleave Iraq and Iraq has resumed chemical weapons production. It takes \nonly 10 milligrams of VX to kill a person. A wine bottle full of VX \ncould kill at least 75 people. We must find out how much VX Saddam has, \nand destroy it.\n  Moreover, Saddam Hussein is devoting much of his defense budget to \nbecoming a nuclear power. After the Gulf War, we learned from the U.N. \nweapons inspectors that Iraq was within 1 year of developing nuclear \nweapons. Prior to the war, we thought Iraq was 5 to 7 years away. Since \n1998, we cannot say with any certainty that we know the status of \nIraq's nuclear program. Once again, Saddam could be less than a year \naway from a nuclear bomb. The world must know how close he is, and he \nmust stop his nuclear development. Once he develops a nuclear program, \nwe will never be able to shut it down.\n  For these reasons, we cannot take our time in passing this \nresolution. We must act now. Saddam Hussein has shown, on numerous \noccasions, his willingness to use WMD to attack his countrymen and his \nneighbors. He has killed 20,000 Iraqis in 40 villages with WMD. As \nPresident Bush said two nights ago, ``Saddam Hussein is a homicidal \ndictator who is addicted to weapons of mass destruction.''\n  I want to read from Charles Duelfer's testimony before the Emerging \nThreats and Capabilities Subcommittee's hearing on Iraq's WMD programs \non February 27, 2002. Mr. Duelfer was the Deputy Executive Chairman of \nUNSCOM. He said that it is inconceivable that Iraq did not resume its \nWMD programs after UNSCOM left. Mr. Duelfer said it is difficult ``to \nimagine circumstances under which this regime would end these \nprograms'' of WMD because . . . ``the regime in Baghdad will devote \nfull resources to its weapons programs . . . This has not changed even \nunder sanctions . . . The regime seeks to dominate the region . . . The \nuse of force comes naturally'' to Saddam Hussein. WMD are his tools to \ndominate the region. If we wait to pass this resolution, Saddam will \nonly continue to enlarge his WMD program; threaten the Middle East; and \nthen threaten the U.S. He will never end his programs unless the world \nreins down on him to eliminate his tremendous capacity for killing.\n\n  This resolution is the proper tool to give the Administration a firm \nhand in negotiating with the world to disarm Saddam Hussein and \neliminate his capacity to kill. We should pass the Lieberman-McCain \nResolution immediately and overwhelmingly to show the world we are \nunited. We must not tie the President's hands and the hands of \nSecretary Powell to negotiate a new Security Council Resolution that \ncalls for the disarmament of Iraq--and the threat of force against Iraq \nif Saddam does not abide by the resolution. We can bring the Security \nCouncil on board if we can show them the United States stands together \nto disarm Saddam Hussein. If this body is divided, the U.N., and \nespecially Saddam Hussein, will pay us no mind.\n  The best outcome is a new Security Council resolution that calls for \nunfettered inspections throughout Iraq, including Saddam's presidential \npalaces; the disarmament of all WMD; and the threat of force should \nSaddam Hussein not comply. That outcome has a better chance of becoming \na reality if we pass this resolution.\n  The new U.N. resolution the President and Secretary Powell seek is \nour best chance to avoid a war. But the threat of force must be present \nto enforce a new resolution because Saddam only understands force. \nAgain, Charles Duelfer testified before the Iraqis were perfectly \nwilling to thumb their nose at UNSCOM because the U.N. had not \nauthorized force to make Iraq comply.\n  Iraq's Deputy Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, regularly told Mr. \nDuelfer, ``You are not General MacArthur (referring to MacArthur's \noccupation/disarmament of the Japanese) . . . Therefore, there are \nlimits to what you can do.'' What Aziz meant was you have no authorized \nforce; you have no army with you to make us show you what we have and \nwhere it is. A new resolution will only work if the threat of force \nlurks behind any Iraqi failure to obey.\n  This resolution is also a narrowly tailored authorization of force. \nIt seeks peace before war to enforce past and future U.N. resolutions \nagainst Iraq. This resolution does not give the President carte blanche \nto use force throughout the Middle East for any reason. Force is only \nauthorized to bring Iraq into compliance with U.N. resolutions--so that \nIraq disarms its WMD; ceases production of WMD; does not threaten its \nneighbors, and does not repress and commit atrocities against its \ncitizens with WMD.\n  This resolution correctly authorizes force for the violation of all \n16 U.N. resolutions, because Saddam's crimes against humanity should \nconcern America as much as his WMD capabilities.\n  America has been a tremendous defender of human rights. But, at \ntimes, we have not always defended the victims of ruthless dictators.\n  In Rwanda, 800,000 Rwandans were slaughtered in 12 months, yet \nAmerica did nothing to stop the ethnic cleansing. America's failure to \nact in Rwanda could be the lowest point in American history. We should \nnot make the same mistake by turning a blind eye to the Kurds and \nShiites Saddam has tortured for years. Any resolution to dismantle his \nWMD must also call for him to end ethnic cleansing in Iraq.\n  In 1944, two Jews who escaped Auschwitz--and revealed the horrors of \nconcentration camps to the world--asked the U.S. War Department and the \nWar Refugee Board to bomb train tracks leading to Auschwitz so no more \nJews could be brought there. U.S. bombers were already bombing fuel \ndumps near Auschwitz. Yet the War Refugee Board refused this simple \nrequest. John McCloy, the head of the Refugee Board, denied the \nrequest. He stated the operation did ``not warrant the use of our \nresources.'' How could saving lives not warrant the use of American \nresources? As a result, between 500,000 and 800,000 Jews died at \nAuschwitz in the final year of WWII. These lives could have been saved, \nbut we did not make it a priority.\n  We shouldn't now say that human rights are not worthy of U.S. and \ninternational diplomacy. We should not say that we are unwilling to \ndisarm a dictator who brutalizes his people. If we do, we will have \nfailed the world, again.\n  Fortunately, I think this body and the American people do care about \nhuman rights. We stood up for human rights in Kosovo. We used force \nagainst a sovereign leader, Milosevic, who was committed to the \ngenocide of ethnic Albanians. Through American force, Milosevic was \nremoved from power and indicted for numerous war crimes. We did the \nright thing for an oppressed people. And, I must remind you President \nClinton did not seek Congressional authorization to use force in \nKosovo. Today, unlike in Kosovo, the President does seek Congressional \napproval for force in an effort to seek a unified American front to \ndisarm another leader threatening his people and the world.\n  But, I must say, again, that force is a last option under this \nresolution. The\n\n[[Page S10331]]\n\nresolution requires the president not to use force until he presents \nhis determination to Congress that diplomacy is no longer an option. \nThis resolution is not a call to arms. The President will not roll \ntanks into Iraq as soon as we pass the Lieberman-McCain resolution. As \nthe President said on Monday, ``War is neither desirable nor \ninevitable.'' War can be avoided.\n  The President will seek Security Council support and support from \nother allies to bring about a diplomatic answer to disarm Saddam \nHussein. I have no doubt that the President's first hope is to \nneutralize the Iraqi threat without invading Iraq.\n  But, if a Security Council resolution cannot be achieved and Saddam \ncontinues to jeopardize the livelihood of Americans--or if Saddam \nviolates any future resolution--the President should have the authority \nto use force. Because his most important job as Commander in Chief is \nto keep the American people safe from a tyrant.\n  In conclusion, I want to, once again, reiterate my support for the \nLieberman-McCain resolution. As a co-sponsor, this resolution is \nAmerica's best effort to stand united to show the world, and especially \nSaddam Hussein, that we are committed to disarm Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction, which are a clear and present danger to America and the \nworld. Hopefully, this can be accomplished diplomatically with the \nworld-wide support. But, this resolution also sends a clear signal that \nwe are willing to use force to change Iraq's ways if Iraq continues to \nthreaten the U.S.; if Iraq disobeys a new Security Council resolution; \nor if the President determines all diplomatic efforts have been \nexhausted. At that time, force may be necessary for America to defend \nherself. This resolution is the proper mix of diplomacy and force. As \nPresident Kennedy said, ``Either alone, will fail.'' I hope the Senate \nwill pass this resolution overwhelmingly to show solidarity and resolve \nto our friends and our enemies.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise tonight to address the important \nresolution pending before the Senate concerning the authority to use \nmilitary force against the Republic of Iraq. I firmly believe that this \nresolution we are debating will strengthen the hand of President Bush \nand the international community in forcing Saddam Hussein to disarm and \nto ensure his compliance with all relevant United Nations Security \nCouncil resolutions.\n  I believe President Bush will do everything possible before deciding \nto commit U.S. military forces against Saddam Hussein's regime. The \nPresident has not decided to employ military force, nor does this \nresolution demand that he do so. Rather, the resolution signals to the \nPresident that Congress stands behind his decision to employ military \nforce if Saddam Hussein fails to disarm or abide by all relevant United \nNations Security Council resolutions.\n  When he addressed the United Nations on September 12, 2002, President \nBush convincingly and accurately presented the case against Saddam \nHussein and his flouting of international norms and agreements. \nPresident Bush rightly called attention to Saddam Hussein's abysmal \ntrack record on complying with the terms of disarmament he accepted at \nthe conclusion of the Persian Gulf war. In so doing, President Bush \nbucked current international attitudes that would prefer that we not \ncall attention to his regime's activities.\n  Ever since the conclusion of the Persian Gulf war, we have seen \nSaddam behave with contempt towards those countries that see value in \nthe United Nations resolutions and that ultimately seek a peaceful and \nstable Middle East. For more than 10 years, the world looked the other \nway and ignored the problem with the hope that Saddam Hussein and his \nregime would go away. Regretfully, Saddam Hussein has displayed \nremarkable staying power and a powerful appetite for acquiring weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  I commend President Bush for seeking congressional authorization for \npossible military action against Iraq and for consulting with Congress \non the drafting of a truly bipartisan resolution. In response to those \nwho condemn the United States for displaying ``unilateralism,'' \nPresident Bush took his case to the United Nations and forced the world \nto acknowledge the realities of the Iraqi transgressions. The President \nis also right to seek a United Nations Security Council resolution \nauthorizing a return of weapons inspectors to Iraq. These inspectors \nmust have unfettered access to suspected weapons sites in Iraq. There \ncan be no conditions or dickering over Iraq's national sovereignty. \nSaddam Hussein lost a war he initiated, he sued for peace, and he needs \nto accept the terms and conditions he pledged to honor. To expect \nanything less would be to condone his transgressions.\n  The President is being practical by raising the ``what if'' element \nto the debate. History has shown Saddam will go to elaborate measures \nto conceal and elude efforts to uncover his weapons of mass destruction \ncapabilities and development efforts. It is only prudent that the U.S. \nCongress and all members of the U.N. Security Council consider \nauthorizing measures to force Iraq's compliance with efforts to ensure \ndisarmament. Earlier today, the House of Representatives passed this \nsame resolution on a vote of 296 to 133, and I firmly believe that \noverwhelming bicameral approval of this resolution will strengthen the \nhand of the President in securing the strongest possible United Nations \nSecurity Council resolution.\n  In plain terms, the threat posed by Saddam Hussein is analogous to \nthe threat posed by a drunk driver. The drunk driver is a threat to all \non and in close proximity to the road. Behind the wheel of a rolling \nweapon, it is only a matter of time before the drunk driver crashes \ninto another car, kills an innocent bystander or causes immense damage \nto someone's personal property. Saddam is this drunk driver careening \nalong the road, a threat to all those innocents who have the misfortune \nto cross his path. It is time to get Saddam off the road before he can \nkill or injure innocents who cross his path.\n  For those who are critical of discussion or references to ``regime \nchange,'' I call to your attention section 3 of the Iraq Liberation Act \nof 1998, P.L. 105-338. Section 3 of the act states: ``It should be the \npolicy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime \nheaded by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the \nemergence of a democratic government to replace that regime.'' Through \nthis provision, Congress has already expressed its views on this \nsubject. I applaud the efforts of the Bush administration to engage \nIraqi opponents of Saddam Hussein and to work with these groups to \nprovide a democratic alternative to this tyrant.\n  The United States has a strong record of restoring order and \ncultivating democracy in post-conflict regions of the globe. Examples \nsuch as post-World War II Germany and Japan are stellar illustrations \nof how the U.S. has worked to better defeated nations that strayed from \nthe norms and rules of acceptable international behavior. In addition, \nunlike Afghanistan, Iraq is a wealthy nation with natural resources, an \neducated populace and a middle class--all elements that will bolster \nthe chances of democracy thriving in this country. There is no reason \nto expect that with a concerted effort by the U.S. and other democratic \nnations that Iraq cannot join Israel as the only other Middle Eastern \ndemocracy.\n  But perhaps most important, benign neglect is not morally acceptable. \nLooking the other way will not and cannot improve the situation in Iraq \nand the threat Saddam Hussein poses to the world. There is a parallel \nbetween today's situation and the situation that confronted the \ncivilized Western World of the 1930s. In that era, democratic leaders \nsought to appease the ambitions of Adolph Hitler and the Third Reich. \nWorld War II, the Holocaust and millions of military and civilian \ncasualties are the outcome of that deferral of action.\n  President Bush's effort to compel compliance with applicable U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions is our best chance for peaceful \ndisarmament. Not one speaker here in the Senate has indicated that the \nstatus quo is acceptable or reasonable. It is painfully clear that one \nway or another we--preferably the U.S. in concert with our allies and \nthe support of the United Nations--must deal with Saddam and his threat \nto our interests, our allies' interests, the stability of the Middle \nEast and the interests of the civilized world.\n\n[[Page S10332]]\n\n  In conclusion, given the events of September 11th, given the past \ntransgressions of Saddam Hussein, and given the threat posed to the \nworld by his weapons of mass destruction programs, it is imperative \nthat we provide President Bush with the strongest hand possible to seek \ncompliance with all applicable U.N. Security Council resolutions. The \nattacks of September 11th and the fateful decisions not taken in the \n1930s illustrate that there is a cost to not taking corrective action \nin a prompt and decisive fashion.\n  It is my sincere hope that this resolution will rally the United \nNations Security Council to draft a strong resolution forcing the \ndisarmament of Saddam Hussein and his regime of terror. If the U.N. \nfails to act, the U.S. must do what is in the best interest of our \nnational security interests and disarm Saddam Hussein. Today represents \nour best opportunity for peaceful disarmament disarmament on our terms \nand according to standards established by the U.N. and other civilized \nnations. To do or expect anything less is to shirk our moral obligation \nto meet the national security obligations of our country.\n  It is for this reason that I will vote in favor of the bipartisan \nresolution which is before us now.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have a dilemma where we recognize \nthat one individual, who has repeatedly defied the will of the \ninternational community, almost certainly has control over a \nconcentration of weapons of mass destruction.\n  We have already seen this individual's willingness to use these \nweapons against his own people and against Iranian forces during the \nIran-Iraq war.\n  So the question is, is it inevitable that sooner or later Saddam \nHussein will again use weapons of mass destruction, and if so, against \nwhom?\n  There is concern that if the United States and her allies use force \nagainst Iraq, Saddam will attempt to use his weapons of mass \ndestruction in order to remain in power. It is a legitimate concern and \none that must not be taken lightly.\n  But I ask my colleagues, if we are hesitant now, how hesitant will we \nbe when Saddam Hussein possesses a nuclear capability? And what will \nSaddam do when he knows we are unwilling to take action?\n  We have seen Saddam's willingness to invade his neighbors--Iran and \nKuwait. How much farther would Saddam have gone had he not been stopped \nby U.S.-led coalition forces?\n  In 1981, Israeli aircraft destroyed an Iraqi military reactor capable \nof producing nuclear weapons in a surprise, preemptive strike. Israel \nfaced tremendous criticism from the world, but a decade later, during \nthe gulf war, allied forces did not face a nuclear weapon capability \nfrom Iraq.\n  Last month, Secretary Rumsfeld testified before the Senate Armed \nForces Committee that prior to Operation Desert Storm, the best \nintelligence estimates were that Iraq was at least 5 to 7 years away \nfrom having nuclear weapons. Yet, when coalition forces entered Iraq, \nwe found that Iraq was 6 months to one year away, not 5 to 7 years.\n  How close is Saddam today from acquiring nuclear weapons capability? \nWe don't know. We have not been able to place weapons inspectors in \nIraq since 1998. Recent reports indicate one to five years, but just \nlike 1991, we don't know for sure.\n  We do know that Saddam Hussein has developed weapons of mass \ndestruction--weapons such as anthrax, VX, sarin and mustard gas. Are \nthese weapons a country would use to defend itself? Or are these the \nweapons of an aggressor that would go to whatever means necessary to \nprevail?\n  And let's not forget about the threat of proliferation--the threat of \nSaddam sharing these weapons with like minded terrorist organizations \nwho would not hesitate to use them against the United States and our \nallies.\n  Had we known in advance the tragic events of September 11, 2001, \nthere is no doubt that the United States would have taken preemptive \naction against the al-Qaida terrorist network.\n  Every month, every year that Saddam Hussein remains in defiance of \nU.N. Security Council resolutions, we face an even larger, more deadly \nthreat to the security of this great nation. As the President has said, \nto ignore these threats is to encourage them.\n  I am hopeful that the use of military action will not be necessary. \nThat Saddam Hussein will fulfill the requirements of the United Nations \nSecurity Council. That he will allow full and unobstructed access to \nU.N. weapons inspectors to destroy all of Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction. But past history does not give much cause for hope.\n  In the 11 years since the Persian Gulf War, Saddam Hussein has \nblatantly ignored 16 U.N. Security Council Resolutions calling for the \ntotal destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Eleven years; \n16 Resolutions.\n  This is not a game. We are currently in a limited war with Iraq. So \nfar in 2002, Iraq has fired on Allied fighter planes 409 times, 14 \ntimes this past weekend alone. Iraqi forces have fired anti-aircraft \nartillery 1,000 times, launched 600 rockets and fired nearly 60 \nsurface-to-air missiles. Since Iraq set a letter accepting the return \nof weapons inspectors on September 16, they have fired on Allied forces \n70 times.\n  The time for appeasement is over. We have seen the policy of \nappeasement prove ineffectual in the past. The League of Nations was \nunable to stop Germany from rearming itself and threatening her \nneighbors. Its policy of appeasement only served to advance Hitler's \nambitions.\n  The United Nations now finds itself in a similar situation. It can \nchoose to either enforce its own resolutions passed by the Security \nCouncil, or find itself irrelevant in the view of the world.\n  The U.N. Security Council is expected to soon take up its 17th \nresolution regarding Iraq. They deserve to hear, not just from the \nPresident of the United States, but the Congress of the United States \nas well.\n  We can wait. We can react after the fact. But at what point do we \nact? When do we recognize that Saddam is a threat, that he does train \nal-Qaida, that he does fund the terrorists? At a certain point in time, \nwe have to face reality.\n  What if we left this session of the Congress without authorizing the \nPresident to take the appropriate action needed to defend the national \nsecurity of the United States against the threat posed by Iraq?\n  How would we feel if--God forbid--Saddam was to take action and take \nAmerican lives? We would feel we had been derelict in our obligation.\n  We have an obligation to provide for the security of the people of \nthe United States. Do we follow a policy of appeasement?\n  Allowing Saddam Hussein to continue to build his weapons of mass \ndestruction?\n  To continue to play a cat and mouse game of allowing weapons \ninspectors in, only to place conditions on their actions?\n  To continue to defy the international community, without fear of \nreprisal?\n  To take the chance that those terrorist networks that Saddam supports \nwill not take action against the United States--with Saddam's weapons \nof mass destruction?\n  It is oil that built Iraq and it is oil dollars that keep Saddam in \npower.\n  Oil dollars fund the weapons, the research, and the training camps \nfor terrorists that give Saddam a global reach.\n  Do we continue to import hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil from \nIraq each day? In September 2002, it is estimated the U.S. imported \n550,000 barrels a day. In September of 2001, we imported 1.2 million \nbarrels a day--and broke an 11 year record.\n  The GAO reports Saddam received $6.6 billion in illegal revenue \nthrough smuggled oil since 1997, $1.5 billion in 2001 alone.\n  The number of vessels smuggling oil has dramatically risen in the \npast few months. In June through August, the Multi-national \nInterception Force boarded 297 vessels--nearly 100 per month--with \n225,000 barrels of oil. Prior to that, the boarded an average of 12 \nvessels per month.\n  This is the Iraqi oil that powers our economy, fuels our school \nbuses, and provides jet fuel for our fighters.\n  No longer should Iraq count on the United States to fund its regime.\n  We must pass an energy bill that helps reduce our dangerous \ndependence on Iraq. America must not be held victim to the whims of \nSaudi kings and Middle Eastern dictators.\n\n[[Page S10333]]\n\n  We have an obligation to the American people. We have an obligation \nto send a strong, unified voice to the United Nations--Congress and the \nPresident, hand in hand--that it is time to stop appeasing Saddam.\n  It is time to enforce the multitude of resolutions already passed and \nit is time to remove the deadly threat posed by Saddam Hussein.\n  And if the United Nations is not willing to enforce its own \nresolutions, if the United Nations is not willing to make itself \nrelevant, then the United States must not be afraid to stand up, to \nensure that the national security of the United States is not \nendangered by the actions of Saddam Hussein.\n  I support this resolution. It is time to send a clear message to \nSaddam that we will no longer stand by while he develops these weapons \nthat threaten the stability of the region, while he continues to defy \nthe will of the international community, and while he poses a threat to \nthe national security of the United States.\n  We cannot afford the risks of inaction. Not after the lessons we have \nlearned from September 11.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today as the Mother of two sons \nas well as a proud member of this body.\n  I have come to my decision on this grave matter after going to every \nlength to gather as much information as I could, then weighing it \ncarefully with the general sentiment in my state that we should be very \nthoughtful. My constituents want us to consider the consequences of \nwar.\n  I have asked the same questions of the President and his national \nsecurity team that my constituents asked me. I understand that there \nare no easy choices when confronting a menace like Saddam Hussein. I \nhave decided to support the Lieberman-Bayh resolution because I believe \nit gives the President the authority to act with military force if \nnecessary while holding him accountable for a preferred, peaceful \nsolution.\n  I look at my sons every day and wonder what kind of a world we are \ncreating for them. I am sad that September 11, 2001 has forever changed \nour perspective on their future and ours. I regret that I cannot be \nsure that my boys will always be safe from terrorism. But, I am ever \nmore resolved that we have a responsibility to eliminate the Saddam \nHusseins and Osama bin Ladens of the world. These are people who bear \nan irrational hatred toward America and the liberty and justice that we \nstand for. They have converted that hatred into weapons stockpiles and \nterrorist networks that threaten our way of life. We cannot stand idly \nby while they gain strength and underestimate our resolve.\n  Today, I make a difficult choice. I choose to give our President the \nauthority to take military action against Iraq if necessary because I \nbelieve him when he says he does not want to go to war. I take our \nPresident at his word that disarming Saddam Hussein peacefully is his \nfirst choice. I support the notion that a unified Congress sends a \nstrong message to our allies and gives our Secretary of State more \nleverage as he negotiates a new and tougher U.N. resolution that \nmandates weapons inspections in Iraq with military consequences if \nSaddam resists.\n  Saddam Hussein is a ruthless dictator. He has set himself apart from \ndictators of the past by using biological weapons against his own \npeople. He has used them before and I don't want to be left with regret \nif he were to use them against our military or diplomatic personnel \noverseas, or even our allies. Our objective must be to disarm him \nbefore he can unleash his arsenal of chemical and biological weapons or \nbefore he can complete work on a nuclear weapon.\n  The time has come to no longer abide the threat that Saddam Hussein \nbrings to everything that is good in this world. The time has come to \neliminate his tools of destruction. Whether we do it alone or with the \nsupport of our allies, there can be no question that disarmament of \nIraq cannot happen without the significant involvement, in fact the \nleadership, of the United States.\n  So I have concluded that Saddam Hussein understands only one kind of \ncommunication. A strongly worded U.N. resolution with the solid \nmilitary backing of the Security Council may change his mind about \ncooperating. If it doesn't, he must know that his evil and treachery \nwill have consequences.\n  Today I believe that the risk of doing nothing outweighs the risk of \ntaking action. President Bush has pledged to me and the nation that he \nwill exhaust a peaceful solution before resorting to a military \nsolution. And I intend to hold him to his word.\n  I vote for this resolution with a heavy heart but also with the \nknowledge that we can't have it both ways. We cannot wish terrorism \naway without taking the necessary steps to ensure that our country, and \ncertainly our children, are safe and free.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we face no more serious decision in our \ndemocracy than whether to go to war. America's values and interests are \nserved best if war is a last resort. I do not believe America should go \nto war against Iraq unless and until other reasonable alternatives are \nexhausted, and I will vote against this resolution authorizing the use \nof force against Iraq.\n  Too often in this debate, we have failed to address the real effects \nof unilateral war with Iraq. The more we debate the war, the more we \nlearn of the danger of going to war alone, the danger that it will \ncause to our urgent war against al-Qaida and terrorism, the danger that \nSaddam may be provoked into using his weapons of mass destruction \nagainst us or against Israel, the danger that allies we need will \nrefuse to support us on other major challenges in the years ahead, and \nthe dangerous new instability that could be caused in that volatile \nregion if we go to war alone.\n  Because the threat of Saddam is real, I commend President Bush for \ntaking America's case to the United Nations. We have a better prospect \nof disarming Iraq with the world behind us, than with our allies on the \nsidelines, or even at odds with our mission.\n  As we approach a vote on this important question, I offer the \nstrongest possible affirmation that good and decent people on all sides \nof this debate who may in the end stand on opposing sides of this \ndecision, are equally committed to our national security.\n  The life and death issue of war and peace is too important to be left \nto politics. And I disagree with those who suggest that this fateful \nissue cannot or should not be contested vigorously, publicly, and all \nacross America. When it is the people's sons and daughters who will \nrisk and even lose their lives, then the people should hear and be \nheard, speak and be listened to.\n  But there is a difference between honest public dialogue and partisan \nappeals. There is a difference between questioning policy and \nquestioning motives. There are Republicans and Democrats who support \nthe immediate use of force, and Republicans and Democrats who have \nraised doubts and dissented.\n  In this serious time for America and many American families, no one \nshould poison the public square by attacking the patriotism of \nopponents, or by assailing proponents as more interested in the cause \nof politics than in the merits of their cause. I reject this, as should \nwe all.\n  Let me say it plainly: I not only concede, but I am convinced that \nPresident Bush believes genuinely in the course he urges upon us. And \nlet me say with the same plainness: Those who agree with that course \nhave an equal obligation--to resist any temptation to convert \npatriotism into politics. It is possible to love America while \nconcluding that it is not now wise to go to war. The standard that \nshould guide us is especially clear when lives are on the line: We must \nask what is right for country and not party.\n  That is the true spirit of September 11, not unthinking unanimity, \nbut a clear-minded unity in or determination to defeat terrorism, to \ndefend our values and the value of life itself.\n  Just a year ago, the American people and the Congress rallied behind \nthe President and our Armed Forces as we went to war in Afghanistan. \nal-Qaida and the Taliban protectors who gave them sanctuary in \nAfghanistan posed a clear, present and continuing danger. The need to \ndestroy al-Qaida was urgent and undeniable.\n  In the months that followed September 11, the Bush administration \nmarshaled an international coalition. Today, 90 countries are enlisted \nin the effort, from providing troops to providing law enforcement, \nintelligence, and other critical support.\n\n[[Page S10334]]\n\n  But I am concerned that using force against Iraq before other means \nare tried will sorely test both the integrity and effectiveness of the \ncoalition. Just one year into the campaign against al-Qaida, the \nadministration is shifting focus, resources and energy to Iraq. The \nchange is priority is coming before we have fully eliminated the threat \nfrom al-Qaida, before we know whether Osama bin Laden is dead or alive, \nand before we can be assured that the fragile post-Taiban government in \nAfghanistan will consolidate its authority.\n  No one disputes that America has lasting and important interests in \nthe Persian Gulf, or that Iraq poses a significant challenge to U.S. \ninterests. There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein's regime is a serious \ndanger, that he is tyrant, and that his pursuit of lethal weapons of \nmass destruction cannot be tolerated. The question is not whether he \nshould be disarmed, but how.\n  How can we best achieve this objective in a way that minimizes the \nrisks to our country? How can we ignore the danger to our young men and \nwomen in uniform, to our ally Israel, to regional stability, the \ninternational community, and victory against terrorism?\n  There is clearly a threat from Iraq, and there is clearly a danger, \nbut the administration has not made a convincing case that we face such \nan imminent threat to our national security that a unilateral American \nstrike and an immediate war are necessary.\n  Nor has the administration laid out the cost in blood and treasure of \nthis operation.\n  With all the talk of war, the administration has not explicitly \nacknowledged, let alone explained to the American people, the immense \npost-war commitment that will be required to create a stable Iraq.\n  The President's challenge to the United Nations requires a renewed \neffort to enforce the will of the international community to disarm \nSaddam. Resorting to war is not America's only or best ocurse at this \njuncture. There are realistic alternatives between doing nothing and \ndeclaring unilateral or immediate war. War should be a last resort. Let \nus follow that course, and the world will be with us--even if, in the \nend, we have to move to the ultimate sanction of armed conflict.\n  The Bush administration says America can fight a war in Iraq without \nundermining our most pressing national security priority, the war \nagainst Al-Qaida. But I believe it is inevitable that a war in Iraq \nwithout serious international support will weaken our effort to ensure \nthat Al-Qaida terrorists can never, never, never threaten American \nlives again.\n  Unfortunately, the threat from al-Qaida is still imminent. The \nNation's armed forces and law enforcement are on constant high alert. \nAmerica may have broken up the al-Qaida network in Afghanistan and \nscattered its operatives across many lands. But we have not broken its \nwill to kill Americans.\n  As I said earlier, we still don't know the fate, the location, or the \noperational capacity of Osama bin Laden himself. But we do know that \nal-Qaida is still there, and still here in America, and will do all it \ncan to strike at America's heart and heartland again. But we don't know \nwhen, where, or how this may happen.\n  On March 12, CIA Director Tenet testified before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee that al-Qaida remains ``the most immediate and \nserious threat'' to our country, ``despite the progress we have made in \nAfghanistan and in disrupting the network elsewhere.''\n  Even with the Taliban out of power, Afghanistan remains fragile. \nSecurity remains tenuous. Warlords still dominate many regions. Our \nreconstruction effort, which is vital to long-term stability and \nsecurity, is halting and inadequate. Some al-Qaida operatives, no one \nknows how many, have faded into the general population. Terrorist \nattacks are on the rise. President Karzai, who has already survived one \nassassination attempt, is still struggling to solidify his hold on \npower. And although neighboring Pakistan has been our ally, its \nstability is far from certain.\n  We know all this, and we also know that it is an open secret in \nWashington that the Nation's uniformed military leadership is skeptical \nabout the wisdom of war with Iraq. They share the concern that it may \nadversely affect the ongoing war against al-Qaida and the continuing \neffort in Afghanistan by draining resources and armed forces already \nstretched so thin that many Reservists have been called for a second \nyear of duty, and record numbers of service members have been kept on \nactive duty beyond their obligated service.\n  They said that spy satellite, reconnaissance aircraft and other \nintelligence analysts with regional or linguistic expertise would have \nto be reassigned.\n  To succeed in our global war against al-Qaida and terrorism, the \nUnited States depends on military, law enforcement, and intelligence \nsupport from many other nations. We depend on Russia and countries in \nthe former Soviet Union that border Afghanistan for military \ncooperation. We depend on countries from Portugal to Pakistan to the \nPhilippines for information about al-Qaida's plans and intentions. \nBecause of these relationships, terrorist plots are being foiled and \nal-Qaida operatives are being arrested.\n  Support from our allies has been indispensable in the war on \nterrorism, and has had real results: In December 2001, Singapore \nofficials arrested 13 members of a group with ties to al-Qaida that had \nplanned to bomb the U.S. embassy and U.S. commercial and military \ntargets in Singapore. Malaysia has arrested nearly 50 suspected al-\nQaida terrorists since September 11th. In March 2002, a joint U.S.-\nPakistani police operation arrested 29 al-Qaida suspects, believed to \ninclude Abu Zubayday, a key bin Laden deputy. In May 2002, Morocco \narrested three alleged al-Qaida members in connection with a plot to \nattack American and British naval ships in the Straits of Gibraltar. In \nJune, Moroccan authorities also detained Abu Zubair, nicknamed ``the \nbear''--a top associate of Abu Zubaydah. In June 2002, Saudi Arabia \narrested seven al-Qaida members on suspicion of planning terrorist \nattacks. One of them, a Sudanese, had allegedly been involved in a \nmissile attack near a Saudi airbase used by U.S. forces. The United \nStates has worked closely with Yemen to combat terrorism, and the \nYemeni government recently reported that it is holding 85 suspects \naccused of links to al-Qaida and other militant groups.\n  These arrests may seem small in number. But we know only too well \nthat only 19 al-Qaida terrorists were responsible for the murder of \nnearly 3000 Americans on September 11.\n  It is far from clear that these essential relationships, which are \nyielding tangible law enforcement results, will survive the strain of \nunilateral war with Iraq that comes before the alternatives are tried, \nor without the support of an international coalition.\n  A largely unilateral American war that is widely perceived in the \nMuslim world as untimely or unjust could worsen not lessen the threat \nof terrorism. War with Iraq before a genuine attempt at inspection and \ndisarmament, or without genuine international support, could swell the \nranks of al-Qaida sympathizers and trigger an escalation in terrorist \nacts. As General Clark told the Senate Armed Services Committee, it \nwould ``super-charge recruiting for al-Qaida.\n  General Hoar advised the Committee on September 232 that America's \nfirst and primary effort should be to defeat al-Qaida. In a September \n10th article, General Clark wrote: ``Unilateral U.S. action today would \ndisrupt the war against al-Qaida.'' We ignore such wisdom and advice \nfrom many of the best of our military at our own peril.\n  We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and \ndeveloping weapons of mass destruction. Our intelligence community is \ndeeply concerned about the acquisition of such weapons by Iran, North \nKorea, Libya, Syria and other nations. But information from the \nintelligence community over the past six months does not point to Iraq \nas an imminent threat to the United States or a major proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  In public hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee in \nMarch, CIA Director George Tenet described Iraq as a threat but not as \na proliferator, saying that Saddam Hussein, and I quote, ``is \ndetermined to thwart U.N. sanctions, press ahead\n\n[[Page S10335]]\n\nwith weapons of mass destruction, and resurrect the military force he \nhad before the Gulf War.'' That is unacceptable, but it is also \npossible that it could be stopped short of war.\n  In recent weeks, in briefings and in hearings in the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, I have seen no persuasive evidence that Saddam is \nnot today deterred from attacking U.S. interests by America's \noverwhelming military superiority.\n\n  I have heard no persuasive evidence that Saddam is on the threshold \nof acquiring the nuclear weapons he has sought for more than 20 years.\n  And the Administration has offered no persuasive evidence that Saddam \nwould transfer chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction to \nal-Qaida or any other terrorist organization. As General Joseph Hoar, \nthe former Commander of Central Command told the members of the Armed \nServices Committee, a case has not been made to connect al-Qaida and \nIraq.\n  To the contrary, there is no clear and convincing pattern of Iraqi \nrelations with either al-Qaida or the Taliban.\n  Moreover, in August, former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft \nwrote that there is ``scant evidence'' linking Saddam Hussein to \nterrorist organizations, and ``even less to the September 11 attacks.'' \nHe concluded that Saddam would not regard it as in his interest to risk \nhis country or his investment in weapons of mass destruction by \ntransferring them to terrorists who would use them and ``leave Baghdad \nas the return address.''\n  Some who advocate military action against Iraq assert that air \nstrikes will do the job quickly and decisively, and that the operation \nwill be complete in 72 hours. But there is again no persuasive evidence \nthat air strikes alone over the course of several days will \nincapacitate Saddam and destroy his weapons of mass destruction. \nExperts have informed us that we do not have sufficient intelligence \nabout military targets in Iraq. Saddam may well hide his most lethal \nweapons in mosques, schools and hospitals. If our forces attempt to \nstrike such targets, untold numbers of Iraqi civilians could be killed.\n  In the gulf war, many of Saddam's soldiers quickly retreated because \nthey did not believe the invasion of Kuwait was justified. But when \nIraq's survival is at stake, it is more likely that they will fight to \nthe end. Saddam and his military may well abandon the desert, retreat \nto Baghdad, and engage in urban, guerrilla warfare.\n  Many believe that our armed forces may need to occupy Baghdad, which \nhas over 5 million residents. In our September 23 hearing, General \nClark told the committee that we would need a large military force and \na plan for urban warfare. General Hoar said that our military would \nhave to be prepared to fight block by block in Baghdad, and that we \ncould lose a battalion of soldiers a day in casualties. Urban fighting \nwould, he said, look like the last brutal 15 minutes of the movie \n``Saving Private Ryan.''\n  We know that the senior military leadership is concerned about the \nlong-term consequences of an occupation. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld \ntestified in September that if force were used in Iraq, disarmament \nwould take some period of time. As he said, ``one would think there \nwould have to be a military presence, undoubtedly a coalition presence \nor a U.N. presence, for a period of time.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the cost of \nan occupation force would be $1 billion to $4 billion a month, \ndepending on the size of the force, and military experts have suggested \nthat up to 200,000 peace keepers might be needed for the occupation. \nHowever, and let me emphasize this, the Congressional Budget Office \nconcluded that current U.S. Army forces would be unable to support the \nneeded troop rotations for a prolonged 200,000-person occupation.\n  I do not accept the idea that trying other alternatives is either \nfutile or perilous--that the risks of waiting are greater than the \nrisks of war. Indeed, in launching a war against Iraq now, the United \nStates may precipitate the very threat that we are intent on \npreventing--weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorists. If \nSaddam's regime and his very survival are threatened, then his view of \nhis interests may be profoundly altered: He may decide he has nothing \nto lose by using weapons of mass destruction himself or by sharing them \nwith terrorists.\n  Indeed, in an October 7 letter to Senator Graham, Chairman of the \nSenate Intelligence committee, CIA Director George Tenet stated this \nrisk. He said, ``Baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of \nconducting terrorist attacks with conventional or C.B.W. against the \nUnited States.''\n  In discussing the scenario of a military attack, the CIA Director \nsaid, ``Should Saddam conclude that a U.S.-led attack could no longer \nbe deterred, he probably would become much less constrained in adopting \nterrorist actions . . . Saddam might decide that the extreme step of \nassisting Islamist terrorists in conducting a W.M.D. attack against the \nUnited States would be his last chance to exact vengeance by taking a \nlarge number of victims with him.\n  In the same letter, the CIA declassified an exchange between Senator \nLevin and a senior intelligence witness. When asked about the \nlikelihood of Saddam using weapons of mass destruction without \nprovocation, the intelligence witness said, ``My judgment would be that \nthe probability of him initiating an attack . . .  in the foreseeable \nfuture, given the conditions we understand now, the likelihood I think \nwould be low.'' When asked about the likelihood that Saddam would use \nweapons of mass destruction if he thought his regime was in danger, the \nwitness said, ``Pretty high, in my view.''\n  Before the Gulf War in 1991, Secretary of State James Baker met with \nthe Iraqis and threatened Hussein with ``catastrophe'' if he employed \nweapons of mass destruction. In that war, although Saddam launched 39 \nScud missiles at Israel, he did not use the chemical or biological \nweapons he had.\n  If Saddam's regime and survival are threatened, he will have nothing \nto lose, and may use everything at his disposal. Israeli Prime Minister \nAriel Sharon has announced that instead of its forbearance in the 1991 \ngulf war, this time Israel will respond if attacked. If weapons of mass \ndestruction land on Israeli soil, killing innocent civilians, the \nexperts I have consulted believe Israel will retaliate, and possibly \nwith nuclear weapons.\n  This escalation, spiraling out of control, could draw the Arab world \ninto a regional war in which our Arab allies side with Iraq, against \nthe United States and against Israel. And that would represent a \nfundamental threat to Israel, to the region, to the world economy and \ninternational order.\n  Nor can we rule out the possibility that Saddam would assault \nAmerican force with chemical or biological weapons. Despite advances in \nprotecting our troops, we may not yet have the capability to safeguard \nall of them. The Congressional General Accounting Office published a \nreport on October 1 which clearly suggests that our forces are not \nadequately prepared for a chemical or biological attack, even though \nthe Defense Department has been taking significant actions to provide \nsuch protection.\n\n  The GAO emphasizes the importance of chemical and biological defense \ntraining, the medical readiness of units to conduct operations in a \ncontaminated environment, and the critical need for an adequate supply \nof required protective gear.\n  Our forces are already stretched thin in other ways. Our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen and Marines are serving their country with great \ndistinction. Just under 70,000 Reservists and National Guardsmen have \nbeen mobilized for the war against terrorism. Many reservists who were \ninitially recalled for the war in Afghanistan have been either de-\nmobilized or extended for a second year. They are concerned about the \nimpact a war against Iraq will have on their families and on their \njobs. Many employers who are struggling in the current sagging economy \nare also deeply concerned about the stability of their workforce. These \npatriotic Americans are willing to sacrifice, but they deserve to know \nthat all reasonable alternatives to war have been exhausted.\n  If we embark upon a premature or unilateral military campaign against \nIraq, or a campaign only with Britain, our forces will have to serve in \neven greater numbers, for longer periods,\n\n[[Page S10336]]\n\nand with graver risks. Our force strength will be stretched even \nthinner. If in the end we must go to war, the burden should be shared \nwith allies, and an alliance is less likely if war becomes an immediate \nresponse.\n  Even with the major technological gains demonstrated in Afghanistan, \nthe logistics and manpower required in a war with Iraq would be \nextraordinarily challenging if we could not marshal a real coalition of \nregional and international allies. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, General Richard Myers, told the Senate Armed Services Committee \ntwo week ago that because of the high demand placed on some of our \nforces, coalition partners would be necessary to mitigate the risk of \nwar in Iraq.\n  President Bush made the right decision on September 12 when he \nexpressed America's willingness to work with the United Nations to \nprevent Iraq from using chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. The \nPresident's address to the General Assembly challenging the United \nNations to enforce its long list of Security Council Resolutions on \nIraq was powerful, and for me, it was persuasive.\n  The President reports important progress has been made in urging many \nnations to join us in insisting that Saddam Hussein's regime be held \naccountable. The meetings already held between the U.N. and the Iraqi \ngovernment on resuming inspections reflects the new international \nresolve to ensure that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are \nidentified and destroyed. Yet, the resolution before us would allow the \nPresident to go it alone against Iraq without seeing our U.N. \ninitiative through, and without exhausting the alternatives.\n  To maintain the credibility he built when he went to the U.N., the \nPresident must follow the logic of his own argument. Before we go to \nwar, we should give the international community to chance to meet the \nPresident's challenge, to renew its resolve to disarm Saddam Hussein \ncompletely and effectively.\n  Some have argued that inspections have already been tried, and that \nthey have failed. They argue that the international community has \nexhausted the option of inspections, and that immediate war is now \njustified. I disagree.\n  I have spoken to former inspectors and non-proliferation experts who \nare convinced that 7 years of inspections significantly impeded \nSaddam's efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, they \nare convinced that inspections can work effectively again.\n  According to Rolf Ekeus, who served as the executive chairman of the \nU.N. Special Commission on Iraq from 1991 to 1997, inspectors ensured \nthat not much was left of Iraq's once massive weapons programs at the \ntime they departed.\n  In fact, the seven years of inspections that took place until 1998 \nsucceeded in virtually eliminating Saddam's ability to develop a \nnuclear weapon in Iraq during that period. Even with Iraq's \nobstructions, those inspections resulted in the demolition of large \nquantities of chemical and biological weapons. The inspection program, \nbefore its forced termination in 1998, had accomplished far more \ndisarmament than the gulf war itself.\n  President Bush acknowledged the successes of the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency, or I.A.E.A., in thwarting Saddam's nuclear ambitions in \nhis October 7 address to the Nation. He said, ``Before being barred \nfrom Iraq in 1998, the International Atomic Energy Agency dismantled \nextensive nuclear weapons-related facilities, including three uranium-\nenrichment sites.''\n  A CIA assessment, released to the public in October 2002, says: \n``Before its departure from Iraq, the IAEA made significant strides \ntoward dismantling Iraq's nuclear weapons program and unearthing the \nnature and scope of Iraq's past nuclear activities.''\n  Even the assessment of Iraq's WMD program published by the British \nGovernment to demand action in the United Nations against Iraq \nacknowledges the success of inspections. It says: ``Despite the conduct \nof the Iraqi authorities towards them, both, the UN, and the IAEA \nAction Team have valuable records of achievement in discovering and \nexposing Iraq's biological weapons program and destroying very large \nquantities of chemical weapons stocks and missiles as well as the \ninfrastructure for Iraq's nuclear weapons programme.''\n  Among the U.N.'s significant achievements cited in the assessment \nare: The destruction of 40,000 munitions for chemical weapons, 2,610 \ntons of chemical precursors, and 411 tons of chemical warfare agent. \nThe dismantling of Iraq's prime chemical weapons development production \ncomplex. The destruction of 48 Scud-type missiles, 11 mobile launchers \nand 56 sites, 30 warheads filled with chemical agents, and 20 \nconventional warheads. The destruction of the al-Hakam biological \nweapons facility and a range of production equipment. The removal and \ndestruction of the infrastructure of the nuclear weapons program, \nincluding a weaponization and testing facility.\n  Experts on inspections advise that it would be extremely hard for \nIraq to carry on an active and even secret WMD program while \ninspections are being conducted, especially with the inspection \ntechnology that has been developed over the last ten years. One former \nnuclear inspector told me that he found it hard to keep Iraqi \nscientists quiet about Iraq's nuclear program, once they started to \ntalk.\n  Given these assessments, there is every reason to believe that \nunrestricted and unconditional inspections can again be effective in \nensuring the destruction of weapons of mass destruction. It is an \noption that must be given a clear chance before going to war again.\n  So this should be the first aim of our policy, to get U.N. inspectors \nback into Iraq without conditions. I hope the Security Council will \napprove a new resolution requiring the Government of Iraq to accept \nunlimited and unconditional inspections and the destruction of any \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  The resolution should set a short timetable for the resumption of \ninspections. I would hope that inspections could resume, at the latest, \nby the end of October.\n  The resolution should also require the head of the U.N. inspection \nteam to report to the Security Council every two weeks. No delaying \ntactics should be tolerated, and if they occur, Saddam should know that \nhe will lose his last chance to avoid war.\n  The Security Council Resolution should authorize the use of force, if \nthe inspection process is unsatisfactory. And there should be no doubt \nin Baghdad that the United States Congress would then be prepared to \nauthorize force as well.\n  The return of inspectors with unfettered access and the ability to \ndestroy what they find not only could remove any weapons of mass \ndestruction from Saddam's arsenal. They could also be more effective \nthan an immediate or unilateral war in ensuring that these deadly \nweapons would not fall into terrorist hands.\n  Before going to war again, we should seek to resume the inspections \nnow--and set a non-negotiable demand of no obstruction, no delay, no \nmore weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\n  We know that our actions against Iraq do not occur in a vacuum. The \nworld is watching. The Administration's decisions to abandon the Kyoto \nProtocol on global warming, to unilaterally withdraw from the ABM \nTreaty, and to reject ratification of the Treaty on the International \nCriminal Court have left the unmistakable impression across the globe \nthat the United States wants to write its own international rules.\n  In February, Secretary of State Powell testified that there was \nsignificant concern among the Europeans earlier last year about \n``unbridled U.S. unilateralism,'' because ``the U.S. was going off on \nits own without a care for the rest of the world.'' Further unilateral \naction on our part, especially on the all-important issue of war, could \ntrigger a new global anti-Americanism that causes peoples and \ngovernments to question our motives and actions on a wide range of \nissues.\n  We should not embark on a unilateral war, without fully considering \nthe potentially destabilizing impact on our allies in the region.\n  If we insist on attacking Iraq alone without the clear support of the \ninternational community, we could inflame anti-Americanism in the \npredominantly Muslim countries throughout the Middle East and South \nAsia. In an article this month in the New York Times, an expert at the \nBrookings Institution wrote that regardless of our\n\n[[Page S10337]]\n\nreal objectives, most Arabs and Muslims will see ``American \nimperialism'' in a war with Iraq.\n  This expert says that a war with Iraq would ``render the Middle East \nmore . . . unstable than it is today.'' Middle Eastern leaders could be \nfaced with mass street protests over a highly unpopular American \nstrike.\n  Jordan's King Abdullah, who is a trusted friend of America, is deeply \nconcerned that war will inflame the large Palestinian population and \ninflame Islamic views. Iraq is one of Jordan's largest trading \npartners, and King Abdullah is understandably concerned about a \npotentially devastating impact on the Jordanian economy. Some experts \nhave suggested that King Abdullah may lose power if war breaks out. \nAlready the Jordanian Government is working actively to discourage \npopular outbursts against war with Iraq.\n  In Egypt, President Mubarak is concerned that war with Iraq will \nfurther ignite strong Islamist sentiment.\n  We also need to consider the possibility that Iran would try to \nincrease its strength and influence in Southern Iraq in a post-Saddam \nera. More than 50 percent of the Iraqi population is Shiite, just as in \nIran, and if the Iranian Government senses a vacuum, it very well might \ntry to increase its influence in Iraq.\n  The United States must clearly act to defend our national security \nagainst an imminent threat. In doing so, the President will have the \nfull support of Congress and the American people. But when an imminent \nthreat does not exist, and when reasonable alternatives are available, \nas they are now, we must use them before resorting to war.\n  What can be gained here is success and in the event of failure, \ngreater credibility for an armed response, greater international \nsupport, and the prospect of victory with less loss of American life.\n  So what is to be lost by pursuing this policy before Congress \nauthorizes sending young Americans into another and in this case \nperhaps unnecessary war?\n  Even the case against Saddam is, in important respects, a case \nagainst immediate or unilateral war. If Prime Minister Blair is correct \nin saying that Iraq can launch chemical or biological warheads in 45 \nminutes, what kind of sense does it make to put our soldiers in the \npath of that danger without exhausting every reasonable means to disarm \nIraq through the United Nations?\n  Clearly we must halt Saddam Hussein's quest for weapons of mass \ndestruction. Yes, we may reach the point where our only choice is \nconflict with like-minded allies at our side, if not in a multilateral \naction authorized by the Security Council. But we are not there yet.\n  The evidence does not take us there; events do not compel us there \nand both the war against terrorism and our wider interests in the \nregion and the world summon us to a course that is sensible, graduated, \nand genuinely strong--not because it moves swiftly to battle, but \nbecause it moves resolutely to the objective of disarming Iraq \npeacefully if possible, and militarily if necessary.\n  In his October 7 address to the nation, President Bush said \nCongressional approval of a resolution authorizing the use of force \ndoes not mean that war with Iraq is ``imminent or unavoidable.'' The \nPresident himself has not decided that our nation should go to war. \nYet, Congress is being asked to authorize war now. He may decide not to \nuse that authority. But this resolution leaves it to the President to \nmake the decision on his own, without further recourse to Congress or \nto the American people.\n  The power to declare war is the most solemn responsibility given to \nCongress by the Constitution. We must not delegate that responsibility \nto the President in advance.\n  Let me close by recalling the events of an autumn of danger four \ndecades ago. When missiles were discovered in Cuba--missiles more \nthreatening to us than anything Saddam has today, some in the highest \ncouncils of government urged an immediate and unilateral strike. \nInstead the United States took its case to the United Nations, won the \nendorsement of the Organization of American States, and brought along \neven our most skeptical allies. We imposed a blockade, demanded \ninspection, and insisted on the removal of the missiles.\n  When an earlier President outlined that choice to the American people \nand the world, he spoke of it in realistic terms not with a sense that \nthe first step would necessarily be the final step, but with a resolve \nthat it must be tried.\n  As he said then, ``Action is required . . . and these actions [now] \nmay only be the beginning. We will not prematurely or unnecessarily \nrisk the costs of . . . war--but neither will we shrink from that risk \nat any time it must be faced.''\n  In 2002, we too can and must be both resolute and measured. In that \nway, the United States prevailed without war in the greatest \nconfrontation of the Cold War. Now, on Iraq, let us build international \nsupport, try the United Nations, and pursue disarmament before we turn \nto armed conflict.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for the \npending resolution. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the Lieberman-\nWarner-McCain resolution because I believe it is in our national \nsecurity interests to deal with the threat posed by Iraq. The world \nwould be a far safer place without Saddam Hussein, and as long as he \nremains in power, he will continue to be a threat to the region, to the \nUnited States, and to his own people.\n  Saddam Hussein is a destabilizing force in the Middle East. A quick \nreview of history reveals he has invaded two of his neighbors--Iran and \nKuwait--causing massive destruction, killing hundreds of thousands of \npeople, and bankrupting his country. During the gulf war, he launched \nballistic missiles at civilian populations in Israel. He opposes the \nMiddle East peace process and has provided financial rewards to the \nfamilies of suicide bombers. He supports organizations engaged in \nterrorism and committed to the overthrow of governments within the \nregion. It is clear that Saddam Hussein is an opponent of stability in \nthe Middle East, and our efforts to build a lasting peace in the region \nis in jeopardy as long as he remains in power.\n  In addition to being a threat to his neighbors, Saddam Hussein is a \nthreat to the United States and to our vital national security \ninterests. There can be no doubt that Iraq has continued its drive to \ndevelop weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. \nAfter the gulf war, Saddam Hussein agreed to open up his country to \ninternational inspectors, to destroy his weapons stockpiles, and to \nhalt all weapons of mass destruction development programs. Despite near \ncontinual obstruction by Iraq, international weapons inspectors were \nable to uncover a portion of his extensive chemical and biological \nweapons, and gain vital information about his effort to develop nuclear \nweapons.\n  However, the weapons inspectors' progress was thwarted when Saddam \nHussein forced them to leave the country in 1998. For 4 years, he has \nbeen able to pursue chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons \ncapabilities outside the watchful eye of the international community. \nWhile Iraq has agreed to allow the weapons inspectors to return, I am \nskeptical that Saddam Hussein will keep his word and allow unfettered \naccess to suspect sites. Already there are indications that the \nagreement under which the inspectors will return allows Iraq to forbid \nentrance into certain key locations. Without full and guaranteed access \nto all sites, this inspection regime is likely to fail and prove to be \njust another delaying tactic.\n  Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction is in \nitself a threat to the United States, but equally concerning is his \nties to international terrorism. It is clear that Iraq is in violation \nof its obligation to renounce terrorism and to halt its support for \nterrorist organizations. Recently, the Bush administration announced \nthat it has evidence linking Saddam Hussein with international \nterrorists. A link between Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction \nand al-Qaida terrorists would be the gravest threat facing our Nation \nand would require immediate action by the United States.\n  Given this threat, and the fact that Iraq is in violation of 16 \nseparate United Nations Security Council resolutions, the United States \nis well within its rights to act militarily to protect\n\n[[Page S10338]]\n\nthe safety of the American people. I disagree with those who argue our \nactions must be tied to prior approval by the United Nations. The \ndefense of our Nation should not be dictated by other countries or \ninternational organizations. If necessary, the United States should be \nprepared to act alone.\n  However, I strongly support efforts to build international support \nprior to military action against Iraq. The support of our allies, and \nthe international community as a whole, will increase the chances of \nsuccess for our policy in Iraq and in the ongoing fight against global \nterrorism. One reason why I support the pending resolution is that I \nbelieve a strong vote by Congress will signal our national unity and \nmake it more likely that the President will succeed in creating a \nstrong international coalition.\n  While much of our focus has been on preparing for possible military \naction against Iraq, and working with the international community to \nresume inspections of Iraq's suspected weapons of mass destruction \nsites, I believe we must also begin the process of planning for a post-\nSaddam Hussein Iraq. As a part of this, we must begin to talk to the \nIraqi people and enlist their support in the fight against Saddam \nHussein. There can be no doubt that no one has suffered more from \nSaddam Hussein's regime than the people of Iraq.\n  The list of crimes Saddam Hussein has perpetrated against his own \ncitizens is shocking. Since 1997, he has killed over 2,500 prisoners--\nmany of whom were jailed simply for their opposition to his regime. He \nhas repressed both the Kurds in the north and the Shiites in the south \nby causing environmental devastation, demolishing homes, destroying \nvillages, and creating hundreds of thousands of internally displaced \npeople throughout the country. In 1988 in the village of Halabja, he \nused chemical weapons to kill more than 5,000 innocent Iraqi civilians. \nAnd while thousands of his people starve, Saddam Hussein diverts much \nneeded food and medicine from the U.N.'s Oil for Food Program for his \nown enrichment.\n  Given his history, the Iraqi people should no doubt welcome the end \nof Saddam Hussein's brutal regime. We should ask for their support in \nousting Saddam by assuring them that our goal is nothing short of \nhelping them establish a functioning, democratic society. Iraq enjoys a \nwealth of natural resources and a well-educated, innovative population. \nThe Iraqi people may well thrive once they are allowed to harness the \npower of democracy and free markets.\n  I believe we can succeed in helping the Iraqi people create a better \ncountry. It will be difficult and will take a long-term commitment from \nthe United States. But ultimately, the success of our efforts in Iraq \nwill be judged by our ability to make sure that Saddam Hussein is not \nsimply replaced by another dictator who will pursue weapons of mass \ndestruction, invade his neighbors, and support global terrorism.\n  This vote has particular significance to me. My son, Brooks, is \ncurrently serving in the 101st Airborne. The 101st is one of the Army \ndivisions that has been identified by military leaders as likely to \nprosecute the war against Iraq. I know that a vote in favor of this \nresolution may be a vote to send my own son to war. Given this, I do \nnot take this vote lightly. I am very proud of my son, and of the \nthousands of South Dakotans serving in our Armed Forces, and I know \nthey are prepared to do what is necessary to protect the United States.\n  I will vote for this resolution because I know putting a stop to \nIraq's weapons of mass destruction program and ending Saddam Hussein's \nbrutal dictatorship is in our national security interests and vital to \nprotecting the American people. While this approach is not without \ndanger, the greatest danger of all would be in a failure of the U.S. \nand the world community to act in a decisive and urgent manner.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, what weapons, exactly, does Saddam \nHussein have, and what could he do with them? When we are talking about \nthis dangerous dictator, that is not a hypothetical question. We can \nsee what he has done already with the chemicals he has developed. We \ndon't have to imagine; we need only extrapolate.\n  Saddam Hussein not only has large and growing stockpiles of chemical \nand biological weapons. He alone among the dictators of the world has \nshown a willingness to use them.\n  In the 1980s Iran-Iraq War, Iraqi troops repeatedly used poison gas, \nincluding mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin, against Iranian \nsoldiers. And Saddam has repeatedly attacked Kurds in the north with \nchemical weapons, namely nerve agents and mustard gas, the most \nhorrifying single attack coming in Halabja in 1988.\n  It is one thing to see nations accumulate dangerous weapons for \npurely deterrent and defensive purposes. It is another entirely to see \na dictator develop such weapons and deploy them to murder opponents of \nhis regime and wage offensive war against a neighbor.\n  That is why we must look with special scrutiny on Saddam's \nstockpiles.\n  When the U.N. inspectors were forced out of Iraq in 1998, here is \nwhat was unaccounted for: up to 360 tons of bulk chemical warfare \nagents, including one and a half tons of VX nerve agent; up to 3,00 \ntons of precursor chemicals; growth media sufficient to produce 26,000 \nliters of anthrax spores; and over 30,000 special munitions for \ndelivery of chemical and biological agents.\n  Those are just the leftovers that we know about. Then add to that all \nthe deadly weapons that Saddam has been cooking up over the last 11 \nyears. We know Iraq continues to produce chemical agents for chemical \nweapons. We know Saddam has rebuilt previously destroyed production \nplants across Iraq. We know he has retained the key personnel formerly \nengaged in the chemical weapons program. He has mustard gas, VX nerve \nagent, and a range of other chemical weapons.\n  The record repeats itself with biological weapons. Intelligence shows \nus that production has continued. Facilities formerly used for \nbiological weapons have been rebuilt. Equipment has been purchased. And \nSaddam has retained the personnel who worked on it before the gulf war. \nIndeed, UNSCOM found that Iraq was working to build mobile biological \nweapons facilities which are easier to conceal. It appears that they \nnow have such facilities. The biological agents we believe Iraq can \nproduce include anthrax, botulinum, toxin, aflatoxin and ricin.\n  Perhaps we recite the litany, ``chemical, biological, working on \nnuclear,'' so often that it loses some of its meaning. British Prime \nMinister Tony Blair has warned against us developing a kind of ``word \nfatigue'' when it comes to these weapons, and I take that warning to \nheart.\n  ``New Yorker'' writer Jeffrey Goldberg has traveled to the region and \ndone significant reporting on Saddam's capabilities and his \nintentions--on his deadly weapons and his brutal will. Let me read a \npiece Mr. Goldberg wrote in the online magazine Slate that puts \nSaddam's possession of at least one of these toxins in sharp relief. I \nquote:\n\n       In 1995, the government of Saddam Hussein admitted to \n     United Nations weapons inspectors that its scientists had \n     weaponized a biological agent called aflatoxin. Charles \n     Duelfer, the former deputy executive chairman of the now--\n     defunct UNSCOM, told me earlier this year that the Iraqi \n     admission was startling because aflatoxin has no possible \n     battlefield use. Aflatoxin, which is made from fungi that \n     occur in moldy grains, does only one thing well: It causes \n     liver cancer. In fact, it induces it particularly well in \n     children. Its effects are far from immediate. The joke among \n     weapons inspectors is that aflatoxin would stop a lieutenant \n     from making colonel, but it would not stop soldiers from \n     advancing across a battlefield.\n       I quoted Duelfer, in an article that appeared in the New \n     Yorker, saying that ``we kept pressing the Iraqis to discuss \n     the concept of use of aflatoxin.'' They never came up with an \n     adequate explanation, he said. They did admit, however, that \n     they had loaded aflatoxin into two warheads capable of being \n     fitted onto Scud missiles.\n\n  Richard Spertzel, who was the chief biological weapons inspector for \nUNSCOM, told me that aflatoxin is ``a devilish weapon. From a moral \nstandpoint, aflatoxin is the cruelest weapons, it means watching \nchildren die slowly of liver cancer.''\n  Spertzel went on to say that, to his knowledge, Iraq is the only \ncountry ever to weaponize aflatoxin.\n\n       In an advertisement that appeared in the New York Times on \n     Tuesday, a group of worthies called upon the American people \n     to summon the courage to question the war plans of President \n     Bush. The advertisement, which was sponsored by Common Cause, \n     asks, in reference to the Saddam regime, ``Of all the \n     repugnant dictatorships, why this one?'' . . .\n\n[[Page S10339]]\n\n       . . . There are, of course, many repugnant dictators in the \n     world; a dozen or so in the Middle East alone. But Saddam \n     Hussein is a figure of singular repugnance, and singular \n     danger. To review: There is no dictator in power anywhere in \n     the world who has, so far in his career, invaded two \n     neighboring countries; fired ballistic missiles at the \n     civilians of two other neighboring countries; tried to have \n     assassinated an ex-president of the United States; harbored \n     al-Quaida fugitives; attacked civilians with chemical \n     weapons; attacked the soldiers of an enemy country with \n     chemical weapons; conducted biological weapons experiments on \n     human subjects; committed genocide; and then there is, of \n     course, the matter of the weaponized aflatoxin, a tool of \n     mass murder and nothing else.\n       I do not know how any thinking person could believe that \n     Saddam Hussein is a run-of-the-mill dictator. No one else \n     comes close . . . to matching his extraordinary and \n     variegated record of malevolence.\n       Earlier this year, while traveling across northern Iraq, I \n     interviewed more than 100 survivors of Saddam's campaign of \n     chemical genocide. I will not recite the statistics, or \n     recount the horror stories here, except to say that I met \n     enough barren and cancer-ridden women in Iraqi Kurdistan to \n     last me several lifetimes.\n       So: Saddam Hussein is uniquely evil, the only ruler in \n     power today--and the first one since Hitler--to commit \n     chemical genocide. Is that enough of a reason to remove him \n     from power? I would say yes, if ``never again'' is in fact \n     actually to mean ``never again.''\n\n  That is why every day this man remains in power is a day of danger \nfor the American people, the Iraqi people, and, indeed, the people of \nthe world.\n  Let me give you one more example that is as disturbing as aflatoxin. \nIt is botulinum toxin, the cause of botulism, which comes from bacteria \nfound in the soil. After the gulf war, United Nations weapons \ninspectors found that Iraq had produced tons of botulinum toxin, some \nof it loaded into missiles and bombs. Let me repeat. Years ago, \ninspectors found tons, some of it weaponized. So we know Saddam has \nexperience with this weapon.\n  For smallpox, there is a vaccine. Anthrax and other bacterial agents \ncan be treated with antibiotics. But botulism is a toxin, a poisonous \nchemical made by bacteria. Let than a handful of pure botulinum toxin, \nevenly dispersed in an aerosol, would be enough to kill more than a \nmillion people. The only treatment for botulism poisoning is an anti-\ntoxin made from horse serum, and it only works about half the time.\n  There is a horror story for every biological or chemical agent in \nthis man's arsenal. I don't need to go through them all. We only need \nto understand that these horror stories could come true if we do not \nconfront Saddam's devious designs.\n  Some insist, and I don't understand this claim, that chemical and \nbiological weapons aren't all that troubling. They say we need only \nreally worry about nuclear weapons.\n  Given what I have just explained, I think that is a dangerous \nassumption. But assume for a moment that Saddam has no chemical weapons \nand no biological weapons. Would there be cause for forceful United \nNations action, and, failing that, American military action?\n  I say, yes, without a doubt.\n  There is now a consensus belief that Saddam could have an atomic \nweapon within months of acquiring fissile material. Based on the best \nestimates, his regime could manufacture the fuel itself within as \nlittle as 3 years. There is no way to measure now long it might take \nSaddam to acquire the fuel from an outside source. He could be \nattempting to do so as we speak. Indeed, it would be naive to assume \notherwise.\n  This leads to a critical question, and perhaps the threshold question \nin the debate. How long do my fellow Senators suggest we wait? Until we \nknow, beyond dispute, if there is ever such evidence beyond dispute, \nthat Saddam is 1 month away from obtaining a nuclear weapon and the \nmeans to deliver it? Until we know beyond dispute that he is a week \naway? Or perhaps we should wait until he has it?\n  In 1996, the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, reported that \nIraq had all the materials for a bomb except for the fissile material \nitself--either plutonium or highly enriched uranium. It is now 6 years \nlater.\n  The debate about whether Saddam is an ``imminent'' threat is an \ninteresting one. What better defines imminence than the facts that I \nhave just outlined?\n  In fact, we must admit that the only conclusive proof of imminence \ncould come in the hindsight, when innocents are sorting through the \nrubble and counting the injured or the dead. As National Security \nAdvisor Condaleeza Rice said, the smoking gun could be a mushroom \ncloud. Or add to that a yellow cloud of mustard gas, an invisible cloud \nof sarin gas, or the slow and silent spread of smallpox.\n  I know, despite all this evidence, much of which is beyond dispute, \nsome say, ``There is no new evidence.''\n  I have two answers to that. One, we don't need new evidence. The \nexisting evidence of his capabilities and intent is more than enough to \npaint a poisonous picture.\n  Two, there is, in fact, new evidence. For instance, the fact that, \nonce acquiring fissile material, Saddam will be just months of \ndeveloping a nuclear weapon, is new. And it underlines the urgency of \ndefanging this dictator immediately.\n  In fact, here is a brief review what we know about what Saddam has \ndone since the departure of the U.N. weapons inspections in 1998. \nBritish Prime Minister Tony Blair laid this out to the Parliament last \nmonth.\n  Since 1998, we know that Saddam has sought or attempted to buy: \nspecialized vacuum pumps, the type needed for the gas centrifuge to \nenrich uranium; an entire magnet production lien of the type for use in \nthe motors and top bearings of gas centrifuges; dual use products such \nas Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride and fluoride gas; a filament winding \nmachine, which can be used to manufacture carbon fiber gas centrifuge \nrotors; 60,000 or more specialized aluminum tubes, which are subject to \nstrict controls due to their potential use in the construction of gas \ncentrifuges.\n  And Saddam has been trying to buy significant quantities of uranium, \nthough we do not know whether he has been successful. Key personnel \nfrom his old nuclear weapons program are at work again. Iraq claims \nthat this is for a civil nuclear power program but it has no nuclear \npowerplants.\n\n  We can search for the most innocuous possible explanation, of each \nand every disturbing piece of evidence, or we can look realistically at \nthe totality of the evidence.\n  And what about delivery systems?\n  Iraq is supposed to only have limited missile capability for \nconventional weaponry. But we know that a significant number of longer-\nrange missiles were concealed from the previous inspectors, including \nup to 20 extended range Scud missiles. We know that 2001, Iraq's plans \nentered a new stage and that now, the regime's development of weapons \nwith a range over 600 miles. Hundreds of key personnel are working on \nthe delivery systems.\n  The danger will not abate unless we make it abate. it will only grow. \nAnd we will be forced to simply wait and see how, when, and against \nwhom Saddam will use these weapons.\n  What more do we need to know?\n  Some say that removing Saddam Hussein from power would compromise the \nwider war against terrorism. But to me, the two are inextricably \nlinked.\n  First, remember that Iraq under Saddam is one of only seven nations \nin the world to be designated by our State Department as a state \nsponsor of terrorism. He provides aid, funding, and training to \nterrorists who have killed Americans and others. He hosted the Abu \nNidal Organization, whose leader was found dead in Baghdad in August. \nHe gives money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers.\n  Second, Saddam himself meets the definition of a terrorist, someone \nwho attacks civilians to achieve a political purpose. He has done so \nrepeatedly against the Kurds in the north of Iraq, as well as against \nthe Shi'a in the south. If he is willing to kill thousands of Iraqis, \nhow many Americans or Europeans do we think he considers expendable?\n  Third, though the relationship between al-Qaida and Saddam's regime \nis a subject of intense debate within the intelligence community, we do \nhave evidence of meetings between Iraqi officials and leaders of al-\nQaida, and some testimony that Iraqi agents helped train al-Qaida \noperatives to use chemical and biological weapons. We also know that \nsenior leaders of al-Qaida have been and are now harbored in Iraq.\n  It is not speculation to suggest that Iraq might pass chemical, \nbiological,\n\n[[Page S10340]]\n\nor nuclear weapons to terrorists. It is realism.\n  There are other state sponsors of terrorism, all of which pose \nserious dangers to the security of America and the world.\n  But Saddam's is the only regime that combines a record of supporting \nterrorists with a history of killing and torturing dissidents, \nambitions to dominate his region, growing stockpiles of chemical and \nbiological weapons and a willingness to use them. That is why the \ndanger he poses rises above the rest on the topography of terror.\n  In my view, if we remove his pernicious influence from the Middle \nEast and free the Iraqi people to determine their own destiny, we will \ntransform the politics of the region, and advance the war against \nterrorism, not set it back as some have suggested.\n  In April 1917, in requesting a congressional declaration to enter \nwhat was then known as the Great War, Woodrow Wilson said, ``We act \nwithout animus, not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to \nbring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed \nopposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all \nconsiderations of humanity and of right and is running amuck.''\n  The same can be said if and when we must confront Saddam's brutal \nregime. We will not be fighting the Iraqi people. Our goal, to the \ncontrary, will be to liberate the Iraqi people from tyranny even as we \nremove the threat from this rabid regime.\n  But we must prove that good and decent intent not only on the day we \ncommit arms, if we must, on the day we win. We must prove our \ncommitment to building a better nation for the Iraqi people on the day \nafter the day after, and the day after that, when we will face, and \nhelp the Iraqi people to face, the broad range of humanitarian, \neconomic, diplomatic, and political problems that will no doubt present \nthemselves.\n  The wars we wage are measured by the quality of the peace that \nfollows.\n  I know that some fear the future of Iraq post-Saddam. They fear the \nrisks, the responsibilities, and the costs, so much that those fears of \ntomorrow lead them to justify inaction today. To me, post-Saddam Iraq \nis not a burden to be shunned but an opportunity to be seized. It must \nbecome a signal to the world, particularly the Islamic world, of our \nNation's best intentions.\n\n  Indeed, post-Suddam Iraq will be a test of America and our values. We \nhave barely earned a passing grade on our first test, in post-Taliban \nAfghanistan. We cannot afford to scrape and slip by again, because this \ntime the stakes are higher, the stage larger, and the consequences of \nfailure even more dire.\n  How do we lay the foundation for a civil and open society after the \nfighting stops and the likely celebrations in the streets subside?\n  First, we must we invest in Iraq's security. Some will be tempted to \nshortchange our post-Saddam commitment by whittling down a security \npresence to the smallest possible size we think we can get away with, \nor by pulling our forces out the first open window.\n  But we must learn from Afghanistan, where, despite a brilliant \nmilitary victory and early movements toward a stable and civil society, \nsome big mistakes have been made.\n  Perhaps due to the Bush administration's stated aversion to nation \nbuilding, we failed to establish a peacekeeping presence strong enough \nor geographically wide enough to tame the factionalism and ethnic \nconflict that have plagued Afghanistan for years. We failed to get \nready to deal with the decrepit state of the nation's infrastructure \ncaused by the long civil war that preceded our involvement. And, though \nour nations assisted us in our military victory, we did not leverage \ntheir investment to give them sufficient stake in a responsibility in a \nlong-term peace.\n  As a result, the situation on the ground in Afghanistan is tenuous \ntoday. Warlords control the countryside. Hamid Karzai's rule in Kabul \nis uncertain. His ministers have been assassinated. Karzai himself came \nwithin a hair's breath of assassination. Have we lost the peace? No. \nBut the current instability can, if left to fester, give rise to \nterrorism. oppression, and civil war.\n  It is not too late to correct our course. That is why Senator Hagel \nand I have sponsored the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002, \ncurrently before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The bill would \ncommit to the country's stability, security, and democratic development \nby investing $2.5 billion over 4 years in economic, political, and \nhumanitarian assistance, including a half billion dollars toward an \nenterprise fund for business development and job creation and $300 \nmillion in military and security assistance for police training and \ncrime control. It would also urge President Bush to expand the \ninternational security force beyond Kabul, and, if that decision were \nmade, would authorize $1 billion over the next two years to make that \npossible. This is extremely important legislation that deserves broad \nlegislative and public support.\n  Now we must hear from the administration that they are ready with \nspecific plans for Iraq that will not repeat the mistakes of \nAfghanistan.\n  In fact, we have to face the fact that the best-case military \nscenario--the rapid collapse of the Iraqi military and the swift \ncapture or elimination of Saddam--would also present the most \nchallenging security scenario.\n  The three most immediate security objectives will be securing all \nchemical, biological and nuclear weapons sites and relevant personnel, \ntracking down Saddam's remaining secret police, and preventing \npotential Iranian military interference.\n  Simultaneously, among the Iraqi people at large, U.S. forces must be \nready immediately to shift gears to post-conflict operations, helping \nto restore order and handling humanitarian emergencies. Despite its \ntremendous training and talent, our military needs more specialized \nteams to take on this crucial job.\n  The administration should also work with non-governmental \norganizations to recruit Iraqi-American and other Arab-American \nvolunteers who can help peacekeepers and humanitarian organizations \ncommunicate with the Iraqi people, distribute supplies, assist in \nhealthcare delivery, and do other critical jobs. A similar volunteer \nprogram worked in the Balkans and can work again in Iraq.\n  Like the military campaign itself, stabilizing post-Saddam Iraq and \ntending to the Iraqi people will be aided dramatically if the United \nStates is part of a international coalition, especially one that \nincludes Muslim and Arab nations. That will make clear to Iraqis and \nthe world that our enemy is Saddam and not the Iraqi people, and just \nas Saddam is a threat to the world, securing and rebuilding Iraq is the \nduty of the world.\n  The bottom line is this: While Afghanistan's growing instability is \ndeeply troubling, allowing post-Saddam Iraq, which abuts Syria and \nIran, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, Kuwait and Turkey, to fall into civil \nwar or into the hands of another dictator would be disastrous. If post-\nSaddam Iraq unravels, as Afghanistan is at risk of doing, so will the \ncredibility and the effectiveness of our wider war against terrorism. \nAnd we will be that much closer to a global civilization war.\n  Once security and stability are established in post-Saddam Iraq, we \nmust begin to establish the foundation for democratic governance and \nthe rule of law. I am pleased that the Bush administration has begun \nbringing key opposition groups together to lay what a foundation for an \nhonest, effective, and representative government. Iraq is a divided \nnation, with at least three key regions and three key religious, \nethnic, and political factions. But let's be clear. Post-Saddam Iraqi \ngovernance will take more than a couple of conference calls to get \nright.\n  And we must be very careful here. Our goal is not replacing Baghdad \nwith New York on the Tigris. We do not want an American client state, \nand we can't expect a democracy that overnight looks exactly like ours. \nWe must be realistic. This process will require the sustained guidance, \npartnership, and investment of our nation and our allies, working with \nthe Iraqi people.\n  The war against terrorism, including this effort to disarm Iraq, is \nlike no other war we have waged.\n  If we are true to our principles, we can again make the world a safer \nand better place, not only for us Americans but for people in Iraq and \nthroughout the Arab and Muslim worlds, who deserve the freedom and \nopportunity that we declared at the birth of our Nation\n\n[[Page S10341]]\n\n226 years ago: the endowment each human being receives at birth from \nour Creator.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nLieberman-Warner resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq. \nThis resolution gives President Bush the flexibility he needs to \naddress the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, including the authority to \nuse military force as he deems appropriate, without ceding too much \nauthority to the executive to wage war outside Iraq. I applaud Senators \nLieberman, Warner, McCain, and so many others who have worked with \nPresident Bush to reach an agreement on this critical issue.\n  I support the President's policy of regime change in Iraq to \neliminate the threat Saddam poses to the U.S. and the world, and agree \nthat time is of the essence. I was concerned that the administration's \ninitial draft resolution was too broad, and called for tighter \nparameters on the Presidential mandate. The resolution now before us \naddresses my concerns by confining the scope of possible military \naction to Iraq, rather than the entire Middle East region.\n  Only last month we commemorated the one-year anniversary of the \ndeadliest terrorist attack in our history. Today, we face a threat from \na regime that would not hesitate to use weapons of mass destruction \nagainst our friends and allies, or against the United States itself, or \ntransfer these weapons to terrorist groups that target Americans.\n  Saddam Hussein's track record is well-known to all. He ordered the \nuse of chemical weapons--including sarin, VX, tabun, and mustard \nagents--against his own people, killing tens of thousands of innocent \ncivilians. His regime invaded two neighbors and threatened others. In \n1991, his troops were prepared to invade other countries, had they not \nbeen thwarted by the U.S.-led international coalition. His regime \nlaunched ballistic missiles at four of its neighbors--Israel, Saudi \nArabia, Iran, and Bahrain. He ordered the assassination of opponents in \nIraq and abroad, including a former president of the United States. His \nregime beat and tortured American POWs and used them as human shields \nduring the 1991 Persian gulf war. His military continues to fire at \nU.S. and coalition aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones in northern and \nsouthern Iraq.\n  Based on the information presented to me in classified briefings, I \nshare President Bush's assessment that Iraqi disarmament must be the \nobjective. Weapon inspections alone will not achieve this goal, and a \nlengthy inspections regime could inadvertently give Saddam more time to \nstockpile and conceal weapons of mass destruction. After eleven years \nof lies and deception, we cannot expect that Saddam will reverse course \nand willingly disarm. Clearly, regime change in Iraq is the only way to \nend the threat Saddam Hussein poses to the United States and the world.\n  What has brought us to this point?\n  On March 3, 1991, Iraq, having been forced to abandon the territory \nit overran in Kuwait, agreed to the terms of a cease-fire offered by \nthe allied forces. Since the cease-fire, Iraq has repeatedly violated a \nseries of Security Council resolutions designed to ensure that Iraq \nsubmits to U.N. inspections, abides by the cease-fire agreement, \ndismantles its extensive weapons of mass destruction programs, and \nreturns Kuwaiti and other nations' POWs, missing persons, and property \nseized during the gulf war. The United Nations has found Iraq in \n``material breach of cease-fire terms'' on seven occasions, and Iraq \nremains in violation of the cease-fire to this very day.\n  For seven and one-half years, Saddam Hussein played a cat-and-mouse \ngame with U.N. inspectors. The Iraqi regime misled, lied, intimidated, \nand physically obstructed the inspectors; and Iraqi scientists who \nprovided in formation to the inspectors disappeared, most likely into \nSaddam's dungeons and execution chambers. The inspectors uncovered an \nenormous amount of biological and chemical weapons materials and \nproduction facilities, but by their own account they could not find \neverything. And any success they may have had was in large measure \nbecause Saddam feared a renewed military offensive by the United \nStates. Finally, on November 11, 1998, following Iraq's announcement \nthat it was prohibiting all U.N. inspections, weapons inspections in \nIraq ceased. Under increasing international pressure, Iraq again agreed \nto allow inspectors full access, but then resumed obstructing their \noperations, and the United Nations withdrew the inspectors on December \n15, 1998. Over the next 4 years, Iraq refused to admit weapons \ninspectors under the terms set forth by the Security Council.\n  Iraq has had 4 years to refine its techniques of deception. It defies \ncommon sense to suggest that a hundred or even a thousand U.N. \ninspectors could, with any assurance, succeed in finding small WMD \nstockpiles and facilities in a country the size of the state of \nCalifornia. Many former U.N. inspectors who experienced first-hand \nIraq's lies and deceptions have come to the same conclusion.\n  We know that Saddam has chemical and biological weapons, and is \ndeveloping nuclear weapons. These weapons would immediately threaten \nU.S. troops and our friends and allies in the region. A Saddam Hussein \nwith nuclear weapons would radically alter the balance of power in the \nMiddle East, requiring a profound shift in the deployment of American \nforces and undermine our ability to respond to other potential threats \naround the globe.\n  Saddam has worked with terrorist networks for many years. He harbored \nAbu Nidal, and is reportedly providing safe have to Abdul Rahman Yasin, \na key participant in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Saddam has \nhimself ordered acts of terror. He shares many objectives with groups \nlike al-Qaida, and may decide to use terrorists to conceal his \nresponsibility for an attack on the United States.\n  For 11 years, Saddam Hussein has thumbed his nose at the \ninternational community. Would it be prudent to continue what has \nfailed for 11 long years? Would it be wise to give Saddam more time, \nwhich we know he will devote to realizing his greatest dream--to obtain \nthe nuclear weapons that would allow him to dominate the Middle East \nwith all of its oil and threaten to drive the United States out of a \nregion that is vital to our security?\n\n  Never in our history have we been in a position where we could be \nblackmailed, under the threat of nuclear war, into withdrawing support \nfor our closest allies or sacrificing our national security to prevent \nthe death of millions. And yet this is the danger we face in as little \nas one year if we do not act to remove this looming threat. Time is not \non our side; it is on the side of Saddam Hussein. We cannot wait for a \nsmoking gun, because a gun smokes only after it is fired, and the smoke \nof a nuclear blast would mean that we are too late.\n  I applaud the President's decision to seek international support for \nregime change in Iraq, but U.S. action should not hinge on the \nendorsement of the United Nations. The United States is leading a \ncoalition of international allies in the war on terror, not the other \nway around.\n  In the case of Iraq, U.S. national security interests should not be \nsacrificed if the U.N. cannot be persuaded of the urgency of this \nthreat. It would be preferable to have U.N. support, but we have to be \nprepared to go it alone if necessary. We cannot give the United Nations \nveto power over our decisions to protect our national interests.\n  I remain concerned about our planning for the future of Iraq if we \nsucceed in removing Saddam Hussein from power. Administration officials \nhave presented a vision of a post-Saddam Iraq that is peaceful, \ndemocratic, and unified. Defeating the Iraqi military on the \nbattlefield will not be easy, but ensuring a stable and friendly post-\nSaddam Iraq will pose even greater challenges, requiring careful \nplanning by the administration in concert with our allies in the \nregion. Iraq could rapidly slide into long-term political instability \nor even bloody war upon the collapse of the Baathist regime.\n  Iraq's population is made up of three main components: the Kurdish \nspeaking people in the north, the Arab Sunnis in the center, and the \nArab Shiites in the south who make up a majority--some 60 percent--of \nthe entire population of the country. Many Shiites desire a theocratic \ngovernment similar to that in neighboring Iran. The Kurdish leadership \nin the north may recognize that independence is an impossible dream, \nbut their experience of ten years of self-government will\n\n[[Page S10342]]\n\nmake their reintegration into a unified Iraq problematic at best. Arab \nSunnis, fearing retaliation from the long-oppressed Shiite majority, \nmay use the Sunni-dominated Iraqi military to keep the Shiites from \ngaining power. And while the overthrow of Saddam Hussein would involve \nthe likely end to the Iraqi Republican Guard, the regular Iraqi army \nmay remain to play a critical role in a post-Saddam Iraq. Yet the Iraqi \narmy may become a den of coup-plotters; after all, Iraq endured a \nsuccession of bloody coups from 1953 until Saddam Hussein's ascent to \npower in the late 1970s.\n  Our military planning should be guided by an awareness that how \nSaddam's regime falls will shape the Iraq that follows. At some point \nthe American people will need to know the nature and extent of \nAmerica's commitment to a post-Saddam Iraq. How long will our troops be \non the ground in Iraq? What material and financial resources will we be \nasked to provide to Iraq? What responsibility will the United States \nhave to maintain peace in the region? What help will we get from our \nallies in rebuilding Iraq?\n  President Bush has exercised great leadership at a critical time in \nour history. I am proud to be a part of the debate we are having today \nin this chamber, which is a powerful demonstration of our democratic \ninstitutions. Ours is a nation that is slow to anger. Americans abhor \nwar. I vote in support of this resolution, but hope and pray that the \nPresident, united with Congress, will succeed in averting war.\n  There is no question in my mind that we must disarm Saddam, and that \ntime is running out. Clearly, there are risks involved. But I believe \nthe risks of doing nothing are far greater.\n  I yield that floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is now just more than a year since our \nArmed Forces started Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. This is \na fitting time to look back at what we have accomplished, and ahead at \nthe challenges that remain.\n  I am reminded of a young Army private from Midland, SD, whom I met in \nUzbekistan last February. He had gone to Uzbekistan just after \ncompleting a tour of duty in Bosnia, foregoing leave, because, he told \nme, that is where our country needed him.\n  I am certain that each member of this body knows someone from his or \nher State who has made a contribution to our successful effort in \nAfghanistan. On behalf of every member of the Congress and the American \npeople, let me say how proud and grateful we are for those efforts.\n  Our military quickly and effectively accomplished its objective of \nremoving the repressive Taliban regime. The challenge before us now is \nwhether we can promote peace and economic and political stability as \neffectively as we waged and won the war. I am pleased to see the senior \nSenator from Vermont on the floor. I am wondering if he would engage in \na brief colloquy with me on the subject of our humanitarian and \nreconstruction efforts in Afghanistan.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, I would.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As our colleagues know, Senator Leahy is the Chairman of \nthe Foreign Operations Subcommittee. Two weeks ago, I listened with \ninterest to the Senator's speech on Iraq, part of which he rightly \ndedicated to the situation in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is our first, \nand most visible effort in the war on terrorism. The eyes of the region \nand the world are watching whether we are willing to do what is needed \nto follow through in Afghanistan. I would like Senator Leahy to, once \nagain, share his views on the developments in Afghanistan.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished majority leader for his \nquestion. Much has been accomplished in Afghanistan over the course of \nthe last year. The brutal Taliban regime has been vanquished to the ash \nheap of history. Thousands of Afghans have returned to their homes, and \nour humanitarian efforts have raised the standard of living of many \nAfghans.\n  We have spent billions to win the war. I fear, however, that unless \nwe dramatically increase our efforts there we could lose the peace. The \nhumanitarian situation in Afghanistan remains critical. Thousands of \npeople are still homeless and as winter comes, so too will the very \nreal threat of widespread hunger, even famine. Afghans whose homes were \nmistakenly bombed have not been helped. There are reports\n\n[[Page S10343]]\n\nthat some Afghans are starting to return to refugee camps in Pakistan. \nIt is a very dire situation.\n  We have a moral duty to help the people of Afghanistan. Beyond that, \nthere are critical U.S. interests at stake in ensuring that this \ncountry becomes peaceful and prosperous. That's why I was pleased when, \nearlier this year, President Bush called for a Marshall Plan for \nAfghanistan.\n  I commended him for that important announcement, but since that time \nwe have not seen the resources put behind these statements. No one is \nasking the Administration to spend 13 percent of the entire federal \nbudget, as we did with the original Marshall Plan. But the \nAdministration did not even ask Congress for a single cent for \nAfghanistan in its budget for fiscal year 2003. The Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee was advised informally that the Administration planned to \nspend $98 million for relief and reconstruction activities in \nAfghanistan. The Subcommittee felt that this amount was still \ninsufficient to adequately address the needs in Afghanistan, and \nprovided $157 million, an additional $59 million.\n  I would also add that the Senate is not alone in its concern for the \nsituation in Afghanistan. Just yesterday, I received a letter from the \nPresident of CARE, a non-partisan, relief organization with significant \noperations in Afghanistan, which stated:\n\n       President Bush has committed the United States Government \n     to work ``in the best traditions of George Marshall'' and \n     help the people of Afghanistan rebuild their country. For \n     this goal to be achieved, CARE believes that the \n     international community, led by the United States Government, \n     must do two things. We must provide at least $10 billion in \n     reconstruction funding over the next five years, and we must \n     respond positively to the requests of the Afghan Government \n     to expand the International Security Assistance Force beyond \n     Kabul as part of a comprehensive plan to improve security for \n     all Afghans\n\n  This letter goes on to say that a CARE report, ``finds that the U.S. \nGovernment has actually exceeded its one-year Tokyo pledge of $297 \nmillion, primarily in the form of humanitarian assistance. Our concern, \nhowever, is that the Administration, to date, has not made any long-\nterm commitment to Afghan reconstruction.''\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Vermont. There is clearly still \nmuch to be done in Afghanistan.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with the majority leader. As I have said over and \nover, it is one thing to topple a regime, but it is equally important, \nand sometimes far more difficult, to rebuild a country to prevent it \nfrom becoming engulfed by factional fighting. If such nations cannot \nsuccessfully rebuild, there is a real risk that they will once again \nbecome havens for terrorists.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would like to ask the Senator from Vermont if the \nCongress provided additional funding for Afghanistan in the \nSupplemental Appropriations bill that was passed earlier this year. \nIsn't it true that the Congress fully funded the Administration's \nrequest for a range of activities in Afghanistan during fiscal year \n2002? And weren't you subsequently told by officials in the State \nDepartment and USAID that this request was not nearly enough to address \nsome of the most acute problems in that country? And isn't it true that \nthe Congress added $94 million for humanitarian, refugee, and \nreconstruction assistance to Afghanistan, only to be told later by the \nPresident that he would not provide this additional assistance to \nAfghanistan?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is correct. Now, some relief organizations have \nalready been told that they may have to shut down programs for lack of \nfunds. This is happening in a country that desperately needs the most \nbasic staples such as water, education and medical care.\n  I agree with those who point out that many other nations have yet to \nfulfill pledges of assistance to Afghanistan. But, if the President is \nserious about a Marshall Plan, and I believe he is right, then we need \nto do much more to help rebuild that country.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I agree with the Senator. We need to find additional \nresources for humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan, but I know that the \nSenator, like me, is concerned about the deteriorating security \nsituation. For months, in the form of letters to the Administration and \namendments here on the Senate floor, we have been urging the President \nto expand the International Security Assistance Force beyond greater \nKabul. Coalition forces provide much needed security throughout the \ncountry, but significant concerns remain, highlighted by the \nassassination attempt on President Karzai just last month. I know that \nthe Senator agrees with me that expanding ISAF could play a central \nrole in improving this worsening security situation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I strongly agree with the Majority Leader and thank him \nfor this colloquy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10343-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        REVISED ALLOCATION TO SUBCOMMITTEES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on Thursday June 27, the Committee on \nAppropriations, by a unanimous roll call vote of 29 to 0, approved the \nallocation to subcommittees for fiscal year 2003.\n  On Wednesday July 26, after Congress adopted the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 4775, the fiscal year 2002 supplemental appropriations \nbill, I submitted a revised allocation which was modified primarily to \nconform outlays to the outcome on the supplemental.\n  Today I submit a revised allocation which has been modified, \nprimarily, to reduce outlays for each subcommittee to reflect the \nPresident's decision to release none of the contingent emergency \nappropriations in the supplemental. In addition, the allocation \nreflects final decisions on the conference report on defense and \nmilitary construction appropriations bills.\n  These revised allocations were prepared in consultation with my dear \ncolleague, Senator Stevens, the distinguished ranking member of the \nCommittee, who stands with me committed to presenting bills to the \nSenate consistent with the allocations.\n  Furthermore, we remain committed to oppose any amendments that would \nbreach the allocations.\n\n\n    SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS--REVISED FY 2003 SUBCOMMITTEE\n                   ALLOCATIONS, DISCRETIONARY SPENDING\n                              ($ millions)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Budget\n                 Subcommittee                    authority     Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAgriculture...................................       17,980       18,195\nCommerce......................................       43,475       42,937\nDefense.......................................      354,830      348,828\nDistrict of Columbia..........................          517          582\nEnergy & Water................................       26,300       25,835\nForeign Operations............................       16,350       16,443\nInterior......................................       18,926       18,547\nLabor-HHS-Education...........................      134,132      126,321\nLegislative Branch............................        3,413        3,467\nMilitary Construction.........................       10,499       10,071\nTransportation................................       21,600       61,984\nTreasury, General Gov't.......................       18,501       17,970\nVA, HUD.......................................       91,434       96,945\nDeficiencies..................................       10,132       13,366\n    Total.....................................      768,089      801,491\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRevised on October 10, 2002.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10343-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10343-S10344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF SENATOR JESSE HELMS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to Senator Jesse \nHelms, who as we know is retiring from the U.S. Senate at the end of \nthis Congress.\n  Simply put, the name ``Jesse Helms'' has become a household name \nbecause he has never been afraid to stand by his principles. Indeed, \nthroughout his five terms in the Senate, Senator Helms has been a \npassionate voice for those ideals by which he has lived his life.\n  And that is a critical distinction--Senator Helms has not only \npropounded certain values and philosophies, he has also lived them. He \nhas always enjoyed the kind of unique credibility that comes from \nintegrity--a personal quality that Senator Helms has carried with him \nfrom his very first days in Monroe, NC.\n  This is a man for whom service is a higher calling, a commitment not \nonly reflected by his years in elective office, but also--and at least \nas importantly--by his service in the Navy from 1942 to 1945. One \ncannot help but feel that Senator Helms later brought the reality of \nthat experience significantly to bear in his legendary work on matters \nof international import.\n  When I first came to Congress in 1979, I of course knew of Senator \nHelms. And as I worked in the House on State Department authorizations \nover the years as well as a variety of global issues as a member of the \nForeign Affairs Committee and Ranking Member of the International \nOperations Subcommittee, I became even more familiar with his profound \ninterest in, and impact on, international affairs.\n\n[[Page S10344]]\n\n  When I came to the Senate, I became a freshman member of the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations, and the Chair of the International \nOperations Subcommittee. Throughout that time--and ever since Senator \nHelms has been relentlessly gracious to me, as he had been whenever we \nhad worked together on various conference committees back when I was in \nthe House.\n  Here in the Senate, we worked hand-in-glove on the State Department \nre-authorization, and I appreciated the opportunity he gave me to chair \na full committee hearing with then-Secretary Albright on the issue of \nintelligence sharing with the U.N. in the wake of our involvement in \nSomalia.\n  That was a serious concern that he and I shared--how would we protect \nU.S. intelligence information, particularly in light of the \nintelligence breach that had taken place in Somalia, where the U.N. had \ndocuments they should not have had which were also not properly \nsecured. Issues brought to our attention during that hearing with \nSecretary Albright were eventually incorporated into the State \nDepartment bill.\n  During my tenure on the Foreign Relations Committee, I worked with \nSenator Helms on the reorganization of the State Department, which was \npassed in 1998. As Chair of the International Operations Subcommittee I \nalso introduced legislation in 1995 to create Terrorist Lookout \ncommittees in our embassies. With the help of Senator Helms, this bill \nwas incorporated in the State Department Authorization Act of 1996-\n1997, that was subsequently vetoed.\n  In the wake of 9/11, I re-introduced this legislation with Senator \nHelms as a cosponsor and worked with him to seek its inclusion in the \nUSA PATRIOT Act passed last year. With his support, this bill has \nfinally become law as part of the Enhanced Border Security and Visa \nEntry Reform Act.\n  Of course, it will come as no surprise that we didn't agree on all \nthe issues. But it can truly be said he has left his mark on the global \nlandscape. And that includes his introduction of legislation last year \nto prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection--a goal I \nshare by providing $700 million in international emergency AIDS \nspending.\n  It is also true that agreement is not the test of friendship or \nrespect in this body--nor should it be. Indeed, this body was founded \non the ideals of debate and deliberation among men and women of good \nconscience who feel strongly about the pressing matters of the day.\n  I appreciate his candor, his friendship, and his service to North \nCarolina, America and indeed the world. On the occasion of his \nretirement, I would like to extend my best wishes to him, as well as \nhis wife Dorothy with whom he has such a special and loving \nrelationship. Senator Helms will truly be missed, but most assuredly \nnever forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10344-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SEN. STROM THURMOND\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to South \nCarolina Senator Strom Thurmond, an institution unto himself who has \nserved with distinction in the U.S. Senate for almost a half-century. \nSenator Thurmond is the longest-serving member in the history of the \nSenate and the second Senator in history to cast 15,000 votes. During \nhis tenure, Senator Thurmond has been a enduring witness to history, \npresiding over the chamber during a tremendous transformation of the \nAmerican landscape. During this time, Senator Thurmond has steadfastly \nremained responsible to the voters of South Carolina, who have returned \nhim to the chamber time and time again. Senator Thurmond's enduring \nlegacy will continue on well beyond his retirement at the end of the \n107th Congress.\n  Senator Thurmond was born in 1902, in Edgefield, SC. His early years \nwere spent as an Army reservist, teacher, superintendent and lawyer. \nSenator Thurmond won election to the South Carolina State Senate in \n1933, representing his home district of Edgefield for the next five \nyears. Senator Thurmond then became a Circuit Judge of South Carolina, \njust as the clouds of war descended over Europe. Never one to shy away \nfrom his duty to his country, Senator Thurmond sought and received an \nexemption to return to military duty. On June 6, 1944, he landed in \nNormandy on D-Day with the 82nd Airborne Division at the age of 42. For \nhis service in World War II, Senator Thurmond earned eighteen \ndecorations, medals and awards, including the Purple Heart, Legion of \nMerit with Oak Leaf Cluster and Bronze Star for Valor. He returned to \nSouth Carolina a war hero, and was elected Governor of the Palmetto \nState in 1946. In 1954, Senator Thurmond was elected to the United \nStates Senate, becoming the first, and so far, the only politician \nelected to the Senate as a write-in candidate.\n  Senator Thurmond has dedicated his life to preserving, defending and \nparticipating in our democracy. He attended the Democratic National \nConvention in 1932 and voted for Franklin D. Roosevelt. Sixty four \nyears later, he attended the Republican Convention and voted for Bob \nDole. In fact, Senator Thurmond was a Democrat for thirty two years and \nhas been a Republican for the past thirty eight. Through it all, he has \nmanaged to remain relevant, active and a force on the national scene. \nJust two years ago, he played a critical role in helping to line up \nRepublican support for George Bush in the South Carolina primary, \nhelping to secure his nomination for President of the United States.\n  Senator Thurmond's countless achievements and awards are a testament \nto his distinguished career in public service.

Mr. President, today marks the 15-month anniversary of the \nreorganization of the Senate Judiciary Committee following the change \nin the Senate majority last summer. This week also became another \nmilestone as the Judiciary Committee voted on the 100th judicial \nnominee of President George W. Bush. This historic demonstration of \nbipartisanship toward this President's judicial nominees has been \novershadowed by partisan attacks in this very chamber and in the press.\n  I have worked diligently along with the other Democratic Senators on \nthe Judiciary Committee to hold a record number of hearings for this \nPresident's district and circuit court nominees during the past 15 \nmonths and to bring as many as we could to a vote this year. Given all \nof the competing responsibilities of the committee and the Senate in \nthese times of great challenges to our Nation, hearings for 103 \njudicial nominees, voting on 100, and favorably reporting 98 is a \nrecord of which the Judiciary Committee and the Senate can be proud. We \nhave transcended the relative inaction of the prior 6\\1/2\\ years of \nRepublican control by moving forward on judicial nominees twice as \nquickly as our predecessors did. Indeed, the Senate has already \nconfirmed more judicial nominees in 15 months than the Republican-\ncontrolled Senate did during its last 30 months. More achieved, and in \nhalf the time.\n  The raw numbers, not percentages, reveal the true workload of the \nSenate on nominations and everyone knows that. Anyone who pays \nattention to the federal judiciary and who does not have a partisan \nagenda must know that. In addition, Democrats have moved more quickly \nin voting on judicial nominees of a President of a different party than \nin any time in recent history. Led by Majority Leader Daschle, the \nDemocratic majority in the Senate has confirmed 80 judicial nominees, \nincluding 14 circuit court nominees, for a President of a different \nparty, in just 15 months since the reorganization of the Judiciary \nCommittee. In comparison,\n\n[[Page S10345]]\n\nin the first two full years of President George H.W. Bush's \nadministration, the Democratic-led Senate confirmed 71 judicial \nnominees. In fact, during the first 15 months of the first Bush \nAdministration, only 23 judges were confirmed, with eight to the \ncircuit courts. Our confirmation of 80 of President George W. Bush's \njudicial nominees in just 15 months is historic progress for a \nPresident and a Senate led by different parties.\n  Apparently, however, Republicans believe that there is partisan hay \nto be harvested in complaining that every single judicial nominee has \nnot yet been confirmed. The fact is that we have proceeded with \nhearings for 103 of the 110 judicial nominees eligible for hearings 94 \npercent, for those focused on percentages. The other 17 judicial \nnominees who have not participated in a hearing either lack home-state \nconsent or peer reviews or both. Thus, when partisans harp on the \nnominations of Terrence Boyle and Carolyn Kuhl and other nominees \nwithout home-State Senator support, they know they are being \nmisleading. Senator Hatch never proceeded on a nomination without home-\nState Senator support and acknowledges that this is the Senate's \ntradition. At least six of the President's circuit court nominees fall \ninto this category and, for many if not all of them, the White House \nknew about the lack of home-State Senator support before the \nnominations were made.\n  The committee has voted on 100 of the 103 judicial nominees eligible \nfor votes--97 percent. Of those voted upon, 98--98 percent have been \nreported favorably to the Senate. In addition to the 80 judges already \nconfirmed, another 18 approved by the Judiciary Committee await Senate \naction on the Senate Executive Calendar.\n  It is disappointing that the Republican leader and others are \nreported to have said that they will not be allowed Senate votes before \nwe adjourn. Earlier this year the majority leader had to work through a \nproblem caused by the administration's failure to work with Senators on \nexecutive branch appointments. The majority leader was required by \nRepublican objection to invoke cloture in order to vote on President \nBush's judicial nominations. Whether there is time left in this session \nto overcome Republican objections to action on the roster of President \nBush's judicial nominations currently on the calendar is problematic.\n  To date, and unlike the recent past, every judicial nominee who \nparticipated in a hearing has been considered and voted upon by the \nJudiciary Committee but for the three controversial circuit court \nnominees we continue to consider.\n  I know that Senator Thurmond is very disappointed that we could not \nbring his choice for the Fourth Circuit to a vote this week. I regret \nthat he is upset. The nomination of his former aide for a promotion to \nthe Court of Appeals has grown more controversial. On our committee, as \non all committees, controversy takes a toll in the time needed for \naction on a bill or on a nomination. Members of the committee need time \nto fully evaluate the merits of concerns about this nomination raised \nby hundreds if not thousands of citizens from throughout the Fourth \nCircuit and the Nation. In accordance with our responsibilities under \nthe Constitution to evaluate these nominations for lifetime \nappointments, the members of the committee continue to work diligently \non simultaneously evaluating three controversial circuit court \nnominations.\n  As much as I personally would have liked to resolve this nomination \nby now at the request of the distinguished Senior Senator from South \nCarolina, and as hard as I have worked to resolve the problems with it, \nwe were not able to vote on it this week. I worked hard to try to move \nthe nomination of his former aide forward to a vote up or down but, \nwith war resolutions pending before the Senate and limited time for \ndebate this Tuesday, I had to make a difficult decision. Seventeen \nrelatively noncontroversial judicial nominations were ready for \ncommittee votes this week. I decided to try to bring some relief to 17 \nvacant seats in district courts across our country rather than begin \nwhat promised to be a lengthy and inconclusive debate about Judge \nShedd's record as a Federal district court judge and whether he should \nbe elevated. That was a tough decision for me, personally, but the \nrising tide of citizen distress over the Shedd nomination made bringing \nthat vote to a conclusion an impossibility this week.\n  Republican efforts to gain some political advantage for this \ndifficult situation are especially unfounded given the stark contrast \nbetween what we have achieved in the past 15 months compared with the \nmost recent period of Republican control of the committee. In the 15 \nmonths before the reorganization of the Judiciary Committee after the \nshift in Senate majority, the Senate confirmed only 32 judicial \nnominees, including three to the circuits. Under Democratic leadership, \nwe have already confirmed 80, including 14 to the circuit courts, in \njust 15 months. Even if we compare our record with a period of \nRepublican control that is twice as long--the last 30 months of \nRepublican control--our predecessors confirmed only 72 judges, while in \nhalf the time, we have confirmed 80. Alternatively, if we go back and \ncompare the Republicans' first 15 months of Senate control in 1995 and \n1996, we have accomplished far more: more hearings, 26 versus 14, for \nmore judicial nominees, 103 versus 67, with more committee votes, 100 \nversus 61, for more confirmations, 80 versus 56. We have reached the \ncentury mark for committee votes in less than half the time, 15 months, \nwhile it took our predecessors 33 months to vote on 100 judicial \nnominees.\n  In another departure from the past, we have had hearings even for \nseveral controversial judicial nominees and brought them to votes this \nyear. Most were voted out of committee despite their controversy. Given \nthe number of vacancies that we inherited--110--concentrating on the \nmost controversial, time-consuming nominations would have been to the \ndetriment of the courts. The President has made a number of divisive \nchoices--divisive to the American people and divisive to the Senate--\nfor these lifetime seats on the courts, and they take more time to \nbring to hearings and votes. None of these nominees, however, have \nwaited as long for hearings or votes as did some of President Clinton's \njudicial nominees, such as Judge Richard Paez, who waited 1,500 days to \nbe confirmed and 1,237 days to get a final vote by the Republican-\ncontrolled Senate Judiciary Committee, or Judge Helene White, whose \nnomination languished for more than 1,500 days without ever getting a \nhearing or a committee vote.\n  As frustrated as Democrats were with the lengthy delays and \nobstruction of scores of judicial nominees in the prior 6\\1/2\\ years of \nRepublican control, we never attacked the Chairman of the Committee in \nthe manner Republicans chose this week. Similarly, as disappointed as \nDemocrats were with the refusal of Chairman Hatch to include Allen \nSnyder, Bonnie Campbell, Clarence Sundram, Fred Woocher and other \nnominees on an agenda for a vote by the committee for months following \ntheir hearings, we never resorted to the tactics and tone used by \nRepublicans in committee statements, in hallway discussions, in press \nconferences or in Senate floor debate. We never tried to override the \nchairman's prerogative to set the agenda for consideration of judicial \nnominees by trying to manipulate the committee's cloture rule. We did \nnot try to use the committee rule to hold off consideration of an \nagenda item for at least a week to force either legislation or \nnominations to be voted on in one week's time. During Republican rule, \neven some uncontroversial nominees like Judge Kim Wardlaw were held \nover more than once. We also never sought to invoke Senate Rule 26.3 to \nmake an end-run around Chairman Hatch--even when weeks and months \npassed without a single nominee on the agenda or when nominees who had \nhearings went for months without being placed on the agenda. As \nfrustrated and disappointed as we were that the Republican majority \nrefused to proceed with hearings or votes on scores of judicial \nnominees, we never sought to override Senator Hatch's judgments and \nauthority as chairman of the committee.\n  Some in the other party have spared no efforts in making judicial \nnominations into a partisan, political issue, all the while refusing to \nacknowledge the progress made in these past 15 months when 100 of \nPresident Bush's judicial choices have had committee\n\n[[Page S10346]]\n\nvotes. We have perhaps moved too quickly on some, relaxing past \nstandards, being more expeditious and generous than Republicans were to \na Democratic President's nominees, and trying to take some of them at \ntheir word that they will follow the law and the ethical rules for \njudges.\n  Just last week, on October 2, 2002, we confirmed Ron Clark to an \nemergency vacancy in the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Texas. Two other judicial nominees, Larry Block and Judge \nJames Gardner, were confirmed the very same day. The commissions for \nJudge Block and Judge Gardner were signed by the President on October \n3, but the judge for the emergency vacancy in the President's home \nstate was not. Just this week we learned that Mr. Clark was quoted as \nsaying that he asked the White House to delay signing his commission \nwhile he runs as a Republican candidate for re-election to a seat in \nthe Texas legislature. The White House apparently has been complicit in \nthese unseemly political actions by a person confirmed to the federal \nbench. Mr. Clark, who the Senate has confirmed to a seat on the Federal \ndistrict court in Texas, has been actively campaigning for election \ndespite his confirmation.\n  These actions call into question Mr. Clark's ability to put aside his \npartisan roots and be an impartial adjudicator of cases. In his answers \nunder oath to the committee, he swore that if he were ``confirmed'' he \nwould follow the ethical rules. Canon 1 of the Code of Conduct for \nUnited States Judges explicitly provides that the Code applies to \n``judges and nominees for judicial office,'' and Canon 7 provides quite \nclearly that partisan political activity is contrary to ethical rules. \nIn his answers to me, Mr. Clark promised: ``[s]hould I be confirmed as \na judge, my role will be different than that of a legislator.'' Yet now \nthat he is confirmed, he has been flaunting his written statements to \nme personally and to the Senate Judiciary Committee and, by proxy, to \nthe Senate as a whole. That the White House would go along with these \npartisan ploys reveals much about the political way this administration \napproaches judicial nominations.\n  Senators Kennedy and Schumer have written a letter of complaint to \nthe Fifth Circuit Judicial Council, which has jurisdiction over ethical \ncomplaints arising in that jurisdiction. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe letter and a newspaper report of the Clark scandal be included in \nthe Record. Tonight, only after this scandal came to the Nation's \nattention in today's news account in the New York Times, the President \nhas apparently signed Mr. Clark's commission.\n  With a White House that is politicizing the Federal courts and making \nso many nominations, especially to the circuit courts, to appease the \nfar-right wing of the Republican Party, it would be irresponsible for \nus to simply rubber-stamp these nominations for lifetime appointments \nto our independent Federal judiciary. Advice and consent does not mean \ngiving any President carte blanche to pack the courts with ideologues \nfrom the right or the left.\n  I have worked hard to bring to a vote an overwhelming majority of \nthis President's judicial nominees, but we cannot afford to make errors \nin these lifetime appointments out of haste or sentimental \nconsiderations, however well intentioned. To help smooth the \nconfirmation process, I have gone out of my way to encourage the White \nHouse to work in a bipartisan way with the Senate, as past Presidents \nhave, but, in all too many instances, the White House has chosen to \nbypass bipartisan cooperation in favor of partisanship.\n  The American people expect the federal courts to be fair forums and \nnot bastions of favoritism on the right or the left. These are the only \nlifetime appointments in our whole system of government, and they \nmatter a great deal to the future of each and every American. I will \ncontinue to work hard to ensure the independence of our Federal \njudiciary.\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 2002.\n     The Hon. Carolyn Dineen King,\n     Chief Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, New \n         Orleans, LA.\n       Dear Chief Judge King: We write to raise an ethics issue \n     regarding Ronald W. Clark, who was nominated by President \n     Bush on January 24 and confirmed by the Senate on October 2, \n     to be a judge on the U.S. District court for the Eastern \n     District of Texas, but whose commission has not yet been \n     signed by the President.\n       It has come to our attention Mr. Clark continues to hold \n     his seat in the Texas state legislature and continues to \n     campaign for re-election to that seat. Although Mr. Clark \n     does not officially become a federal judge until he takes the \n     oath of office, his continuing campaign activities appear to \n     be in clear violation of Code of Conduct for Untied States \n     Judges. The commentary to Code of Conduct makes clear that \n     the Canons of Ethics define judicial nominees as judges and \n     bind them to the same ethical rules. Canon 7 of the Code \n     states that ``a judge should refrain from political \n     activity'' and should not ``act as a leader or hold any \n     office in a political organization; make speeches for a \n     political organization, or candidate or publicly endorse or \n     oppose a candidate for public office; [or] solicit funds.'' \n     Canon 7 goes on to state that a judge ``should not engage in \n     any other political activity.''\n       Traditionally, this provision has been construed to have \n     limited application to nominees. Because of the contingent \n     nature of the Senate confirmation process, it would be unfair \n     to require nominees to resign from elective office merely \n     upon being nominated. But once the President's nominees are \n     confirmed by the Senate, the process loses its uncertainty. \n     The only step between nominee and judge is a ministerial act \n     that should be completed promptly, and not delayed for \n     partisan or political reasons.\n       Despite the clear applicability of the Code of Conduct, Mr. \n     Clark continues to be a candidate for re-election to the \n     Texas House of Representatives. This matter is of grave \n     concern to us. As Members of the United States Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, we take our Constitutional confirmation \n     responsibilities seriously. Mr. Clark's continued candidacy \n     appears to be a flagrant violation of the judicial code of \n     conduct, which is deeply troubling. Judges should be paragons \n     of ethics, and Mr. Clark's actions do not set a sterling \n     standard at the outset of his judicial career.\n       According to the Code of Conduct, complaints of ethical \n     misconduct may be lodged with the Circuit council, which we \n     understand you chair. We would appreciate your prompt \n     consideration of this inquiry, and we look forward to hearing \n     from you in the near future.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles E. Schumer,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Edward M. Kennedy,\n       U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 10, 2002]\n\n               Bush Acting To Forestall an Issue in Texas\n\n                           (By Neil A. Lewis)\n\n       Washington, Oct. 9.--The White House moved quickly tonight \n     to quash a politically embarrassing problem with one of \n     President Bush's nominees to a federal court seat.\n       Although the nominee, Ron Clark, was confirmed by the \n     Senate earlier this month to be a federal district judge \n     based in Texas, he was out campaigning today for re-election \n     as a state representative from his district north of Dallas. \n     Mr. Clark had said he might want to delay taking his seat on \n     the bench to serve one more term in the State Legislature, \n     where his vote might be crucial to Republicans winning the \n     speakership.\n       Two Democratic Senators, Charles E. Schumer of New York and \n     Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, complained about Mr. \n     Clark's actions today, saying they were a blatant violation \n     of judicial ethics, a view with which some legal scholars \n     agreed. The senators wrote to Carolyn D. King, the chief \n     judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth \n     Circuit based in New Orleans, asking her to evaluate whether \n     Mr. Clark had violated the judicial canons of ethics even \n     before he had put on his robe.\n       By evening, the White House intervened, saying President \n     Bush would soon sign the formal commission for Mr. Clark, the \n     last step in making him a federal judge.\n       In an interview earlier today, Mr. Clark said he was just \n     playing it safe.\n       ``If the president signs the certificate then, I'll move \n     forward,'' he said before going out to a campaign appearance \n     in which he presented a flag to some cub scouts. He said he \n     had no control over Mr. Bush's actions and ``right now, I'm \n     running for state representative.''\n       Mr. Clark said he had been trapped by circumstances because \n     he was confirmed on Oct. 2 and the last date for withdrawing \n     from the ballot under Texas law was Sept. 3. ``There is no \n     legal way to take it off, so I'm in the race, until Election \n     Day,'' he said. Asked if he intended to keep campaigning for \n     re-election, he said: ``Oh, yes, I go to functions, go block \n     walking, that sort of thing.''\n       Mr. Clark has asserted that he did not know why Mr. Bush \n     had not yet acted, yet he was quoted in this week in Texas \n     Weekly, a political journal, as saying he had asked the White \n     House to delay signing his commission so he could serve \n     another legislative term. Ross Ramsey, the journal's editor, \n     who wrote the article, said Mr. Clark had told him he would \n     be interested in serving through May, when the 20-week \n     session is expected to end.\n       In his article, Mr. Ramsey said Mr. Clark's presence in the \n     Legislature when it convenes\n\n[[Page S10347]]\n\n     in January might be crucial to Republican hopes to retain the \n     speakership in what is expected to be a close race.\n       Senators Schumer and Kennedy, both of whom serve on the \n     Judiciary committee, said in their letter that Mr. Clark's \n     legislative campaign ``appears to be in clear violation of \n     the Code of Conduct for United States Judges.'' The canons \n     mandate that ``a judge refrain from political activity.''\n       Steven Gillers, the vice dean of the New York University \n     Law School and an authority on ethics, said that provisions \n     in both the federal and state codes of conduct mandated that \n     Mr. Clark resign his political office. The Texas code, he \n     said, makes it clear that a candidate for a judicial office \n     has to behave as a judge in avoiding politics. The federal \n     rules require a judge to resign from office when he or she \n     becomes a candidate for political office.\n       ``While a person seeking a judgeship may have an argument \n     that he not give up a political office, this man is, for all \n     intents and purposes, a judge,'' Mr. Gillers said.\n       Erwin Chemerinsky, a visiting law professor at Duke \n     University, said Mr. Clark seemed to be using the formality \n     of Mr. Bush's signature to avoid his obligations.\n       ``But judicial ethics is all about removing judges from \n     politics,'' Mr. Chemerinsky said, and given that Mr. Bush is \n     the president who appointed him, Mr. Clark should not run for \n     office.\n       Senate Republicans and President Bush have said that there \n     is an urgent need to fill federal judgeships and that action \n     is being blocked by the Democrats who have opposed several of \n     the president's nominees.\n       In fact, today, at a White House celebration of Hispanic \n     Heritage Month, Mr. Bush criticized the Senate's handling of \n     his nomination of Miguel Estrada to a seat on the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n       ``There are senators who are playing politics with this \n     good man's nomination,'' the president said. ``There are \n     senators who would rather not give him the benefit of the \n     doubt, senators looking for a reason to defeat him as opposed \n     to looking for a reason to herald his intelligence, his \n     capabilities, his talent. I strongly object to the way this \n     man is going to be treated in the United States Senate.''\n       The Judiciary Committee recently held a hearing on Mr. \n     Estrada's nomination but has not scheduled a vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10347-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PALESTINIAN SUICIDE BOMBER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to commend our \noutstanding colleague, Senator Robert Byrd, for his thoughtful and \neloquent op-ed article in The New York Times this morning. In his \narticle, Senator Byrd rightfully condemns the failure of Congress to \ntake adequate time to exercise our all-important constitutional \nresponsibility in deciding whether or not America should go to war with \nIraq.\n  Instead of fairly assessing the full consequences of the \nadministration's proposal, Congress is allowing itself to be rushed \ninto a premature decision to go to war. Many of us agree with Senator \nByrd, and so do large numbers of Americans across the country.\n  We owe the Senate and the Nation a more thoughtful deliberation about \nwar. Senator Byrd's article is a powerful statement urging Congress not \ndelegate our constitutional power to the President, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 10, 2002]\n\n                  Congress Must Resist the Rush to War\n\n                          (By Robert C. Byrd)\n\n       Washington.--A sudden appetite for war with Iraq seems to \n     have consumed the Bush administration and Congress. The \n     debate that began in the Senate last week is centered not on \n     the fundamental and monumental questions of whether and why \n     the United States should go to war with Iraq, but rather on \n     the mechanics of how best to wordsmith the president's use-\n     of-force resolution in order give him virtually unchecked \n     authority to commit the nation's military to an unprovoked \n     attack on a sovereign nation.\n       How have we gotten to this low point in the history of \n     Congress? Are we too feeble to resist the demands of a \n     president who is determined to bend the collective will of \n     Congress to his will--a president who is changing the \n     conventional understanding of the term ``self-defense''? And \n     why are we allowing the executive to rush our decision-making \n     right before an election? Congress, under pressure from the \n     executive branch, should not hand away its Constitutional \n     powers. We should not hamstring future Congresses by casting \n     such a shortsighted vote. We owe our country a due \n     deliberation.\n       I have listened closely to the president, I have questioned \n     the members of his war cabinet. I have searched for that \n     single piece of evidence that would convince me that the \n     president must have in his hands, before the month is out, \n     open-ended Congressional authorization to deliver an \n     unprovoked attack on Iraq. I remain unconvinced. The \n     president's case for an unprovoked attack is circumstantial \n     at best. Saddam Hussein is a threat, but the threat is not so \n     great that we must be stampeded to provide such authority to \n     this president just weeks before an election.\n       Why are we being hounded into action on a resolution that \n     turns over to President Bush the Congress's Constitutional \n     power to declare war? This resolution would authorize the \n     president to use the military forces of this nation wherever, \n     whenever and however he determines, and for as long as he \n     determines, if he can somehow make a connection to Iraq. It \n     is a blank check for the president to take whatever action he \n     feels ``is necessary and appropriate in order to defend the \n     national security of the United States against the continuing \n     threat posted by Iraq.'' This broad resolution underwrites, \n     promotes and endorses the unprecedented Bush doctrine of \n     preventive war and pre-emptive strikes--detailed in a recent \n     publication, ``National Security Strategy of the United \n     Staets''--against any nation that the president, and the \n     president alone, determines to be a threat.\n       We are at the gravest of moments. Members of Congress must \n     not simply walk away from their Constitutional \n     responsibilities. We are the directly elected representatives \n     of the American people, and the American people expect us to \n     carry out our duty, not simply hand it off to this or any \n     other president. To do so would be to fail the people we \n     represent and to fall woefully short of our sworn oath to \n     support and defend the Constitution.\n       We may not always be able to avoid war, particularly if it \n     is thrust upon us, but Congress must not attempt to give away \n     the authority to determine when war is to be declared. We \n     must not allow any president to unleash the dogs of war at \n     his own discretion and for an unlimited period of time.\n       Yet that is what we are being asked to do. The judgment of \n     history will not be kind to us if we take this step.\n       Members of Congress should take time out and go home to \n     listen to their constituents. We must not yield to this \n     absurd pressure to act now, 27 days before an election that \n     will determine the entire membership of the House of \n     Representatives and that of a third of the Senate. Congress \n     should take the time to hear form the American people, to \n     answer their remaining questions and to put the frenzy of \n     ballot-box politics behind us before we vote. We should hear \n     them well, because while it is Congress that casts the vote, \n     it is the American people who will pay for a war with the \n     lives of their sons and daughters.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10347-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10347-S10348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, during the summer I cautioned that we \nhad problems: the terrorism war, the Middle East, Iraq, and we needed \nto put first things first. Success in the terrorism war depends in \nlarge measure on the cooperation and support of the Arab world. \nObviously, this support would sharply diminish with an invasion of \nIraq. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict had gotten out of hand with \ndaily suicide bombings and we needed to stablize the peace process \nbefore invading. More importantly, I was convinced that any imminent \nthreat from Saddam would be handled by Israel without debate. I ask \nunanimous consent a copy of these thoughts published in the Charleston, \nSC Post and Courier back in August be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Post and Courier, Aug. 30, 2002]\n\n     Israel-Palestine Crisis, Not Saddam, Should Be Bush's Priority\n\n                    (By Senator Ernest F. Hollings)\n\n       We have problems:\n       (1) The Muslim extremists' attack on 9/11 starting the \n     Terrorism War.\n       (2) The Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n       (3) The Saudi Arabian and other Muslim support of \n     terrorists.\n       (4) At the same time, the need for Muslim support in the \n     Terrorism War.\n       (5) Iraq.\n       For the moment, the Iraq problem is easily solved. Our \n     friend Israel, with its Mossad Intelligence, knows the Iraqi \n     threat--nuclear, chemical, or biological. In 1981, they \n     didn't wait for the nuclear plant to be completed in Baghdad. \n     They knocked it out and today stand ready to knock out such a \n     threat again. We can depend on Israel for this. But Israel \n     must depend on America to get it out of its present fix. \n     Prime Minister Sharon's approach to peace--bulldozing homes, \n     sending in gun ships, and reoccupying Palestinian \n     territories--is creating more terrorists than are being \n     eliminated. We must put first things first. Secure Israel and \n     deal later with Saddam. Mention the Middle East and the \n     extremes take over. There are those who want to eliminate \n     Israel; and those who want to prevent a Palestinian state. \n     It's important to remember a few historical ``non-extremes'':\n       (1) We supported the settlement of Holocaust survivors into \n     the Middle East, and the United States and the United Nations \n     recognized the State of Israel.\n       (2) Egypt, Syria, Jordan and the Palestinians went to war \n     with Israel over this and Israel won.\n       (3) As a result, the Palestinian losers have been holed up \n     in Gaza and the West Bank for 35 years. The Israelis use the \n     Palestinians in Israel as a workforce, but Palestinian living \n     conditions in Gaza and the West Bank have been semi-prisoner \n     and now prisoner.\n       (4) Israel and the world leadership recognized that the \n     condition of the Palestinians could not be sustained and all \n     have announced for a Palestinian state.\n       Trying to define a Palestinian state and guaranteeing the \n     security of Israel at the same time has always been tenuous. \n     Anwar Sadat tried and was assassinated. Yitzhak Rabin tried \n     and was assassinated. In forming the state of Israel, \n     Palestinians were scattered to Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, \n     Kuwait and the world around. Many still consider themselves \n     refugees and live for the day that they can return to Israel. \n     They feel the U.S. support for Israel prevents that return. \n     This enmity toward the U.S. in exacerbated by our support of \n     the corrupt government of Saudi Arabia.\n       The Saudis are two-faced. They maintain the kingdom by \n     financing the clerics and Madrassa schools against the \n     ``Great Satan'' United States while securing their national \n     defense from the United States with cheap oil. Not \n     surprisingly 15 of the terrorists on September 11th were from \n     Saudi Arabia. A feeling of hopelessness has developed in Gaza \n     and the West Bank. Youngsters with nothing to lose willingly \n     give their lives to terrorize Israel.\n       Frustration with the United States' support of Israel is \n     exemplified by attacks on the World Trade Towers in 1993, on \n     our barracks in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, our embassies in \n     Kenya and Tanzania, the consulate now in Pakistan and martyrs \n     willingly giving their lives to blow up the USS Cole, the \n     Pentagon and again the World Trade Center. A cause against \n     Israel and the United States has developed in the Muslim \n     world. A recent Gallup poll in Pakistan shows that 80 percent \n     of the people in Pakistan consider Osama bin Laden a war \n     hero.\n       When President Bush took office, he was determined not to \n     pursue President Clinton's full-court press for peace in the \n     Middle East. He applied ``benign neglect'' for 16 months. Now \n     that it has his attention, he dismisses the problem by \n     calling for the removal of the elected leader of the \n     Palestinians and the forming of a democratic government in \n     three years. In the Middle East forming a democracy would be \n     more like 30 years. And the best way to guarantee the \n     continuation of Yasser Arafat is for the U.S. president to \n     call for his removal.\n       Whining, ``they hate us,'' we refuse to discuss or \n     recognize the Palestinian cause. The cause must be \n     confronted. ``You can't kill an idea with a sword.'' The \n     Terrorism War won't be won militarily. Our foreign policy \n     must not be left to the extremes, Sharon and Arafat. Five \n     years from now, 10 years from now, 50 years from now there \n     will be an Israel and there will be a Palestine. The only \n     course is for the Israelis and the Palestinians to learn to \n     live together. For this to occur, President Bush must \n     personally meet with the Middle East leaders and work out a \n     realistic step-by-step institution for the security of Israel \n     and the State of Palestine. Only after that can America get \n     the support we need around the globe for the Terrorism War \n     and the overthrow of Saddam.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The President's policy is correct, but his \nimplementation miserable. One would hope that, with an imminent threat, \nthe Congressional leadership is corralled quietly, briefed, and allies \nconsulted for whatever action is taken. On the contrary, this President \nstarted off by threatening friends and foes alike blabbing, ``You are \neither with us or against us,'' ``We are the world superpower,'' ``I \ndon't need the U.N.,'' ``I don't need the Congress.'' He seemed totally \noblivious to the fact that he is going in two different directions at \nthe same time. Success in the war on terrorism is largely dependent on \nsupport of the Arab world, but with the President's abruptness and \nbraggadocio, that support could disappear with the invasion of an Arab \ncountry. The President thinks leadership is announcing without any \nmassaging. His policy of preventive war was made to appear that war was \nour first choice. At one time the President managed to have the \ninternational community united against us.\n  Now, it seems that President Bush has been housebroken on foreign \npolicy. He has asked for the approval of Congress; he has presented his \ncase to the United Nations; and, amazingly, last week said that for the \nUnited States, ``War is the last option.'' In turn, some of our \nEuropean allies have come on board so that we now have a coalition, the \nUnited Nations is strengthening its inspection resolution and finally--\nitself. The resolution of approval by the Congress for the President to \ntake action has now been changed to make sense. While the threat is not \nimminent, the goal is desirable and the failure of Congress and the \nPresident to move together at this point would seriously damage our \ncreditbility and cause us irreparable harm in foreign affairs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10348-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10348-S10349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LIGHTS ON AFTER SCHOOL! DAY\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to recognize today as Lights On After \nSchool! Day. Lights On After School! is a project of the Afterschool \nAlliance to open the doors of after-school programs around the country \nto neighbors, community leaders, and the media so that everyone \nunderstands the importance of after-school programs to providing \nchildren of working parents with a safe place to be until their parents \nare home and providing all children with cultural and academic \nopportunities. Last year, more than 400,000 people participated in \nLights On After School! events and I hope that even more will \nparticipate this year.\n  I have been a longtime supporter of the 21st Century Community \nLearning Centers program, which provides federal support for local \nafter-school centers. For years, I have worked hard, as have many \nothers, including Senator Jeffords and Senator Boxer, to increase \nsupport for these centers. And, with the appropriation having grown \nfrom $750,000 in fiscal year 1995 to $1 billion in fiscal year 2002, I \nthink we've been phenomenally successful. I'm very disappointed that \nthe President wants to freeze support for these programs, but I'm \npleased that the Senate Appropriations Committee's education \nappropriations bill increases funding for\n\n[[Page S10349]]\n\nfiscal year 2003 by $90 million. I hope that we can do even better in \nthe end.\n  I can think of few programs with as wide-ranging support as these \ncenters. Parents, teachers, youth groups, law enforcement, and others \nall recognize that providing extensive, effective after-school programs \nis one of the most important things we can do to support working \nparents and to help our children be safe and reach their potential in \nschool and in life.\n  As evidence, a survey taken in August by the Afterschool Alliance \nfound that nine in ten voters agree that there should be organized \nactivities for children and teens after school every day that provide \nopportunities for them to learn.\n  By more than two to one, voters disagree with the President's \nproposal to freeze federal funding for after-school programs, and \nsixty-three percent are concerned that existing programs may have to \nreduce their services or close their doors due to lack of increased \nfunding.\n  More than nine in ten voters who have children in after-school \nprograms believe that their children are safer and less likely to be \ninvolved in juvenile crime than children who aren't in after-school \nprograms.\n  Finally, 92 percent of these parents say their children do better in \nreading, writing and math because of after-school programs, and 87 \npercent say that their children are less likely to use alcohol and \ndrugs because of after-school programs.\n  I thank the Afterschool Alliance for all their work, and urge my \ncolleagues to join me in commemorating Lights On After School!\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ndiscuss an issue of great importance to our Nation's children: \nafterschool programs. Children are much more likely to be involved in \ncrime, substance abuse, and teenage pregnancy in the hours after \nschool. In fact, about 10 percent of violent juvenile crimes are \ncommitted between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. alone. The Urban Institute \nestimates that at least 7 million and as many as 15 million ``latchkey \nkids'' go to an empty house on any given afternoon. These children need \na place to go--an empty house should not be an option.\n  It is essential that we provide children with organized activities or \nprograms to go to during the critical afterschool hours. According to \nthe Departments of Education and Health and Human Services, \nextracurricular activities like those provided by afterschool programs \nhave proven to reduce the number of students likely to use drugs by 50 \npercent and the number of students likely to become teen parents by 33 \npercent. Furthermore, studies have shown that students who participate \nin extracurricular activities have better grades, feel greater \nattachment to school, have lower truancy rates and reach higher levels \nof achievement in college.\n  We have made great progress in the last 5 years toward making these \nkinds of programs more widely available. Through the 21st Century \nCommunity Learning Center Program, federal support for local \nafterschool programs increased from $1 million in fiscal year 1997 to \n$1 billion in fiscal year 2002. As a result, over 900 communities \nacross the Nation are now providing their children with a positive \nalternative to unsupervised care. In addition, Senator Ensign and I \noffered an amendment to the Leave No Child Behind Act to increase \nfunding for afterschool programs. As enacted, the bill will raise \nafterschool funding to $2.5 billion by the year 2007.\n  To highlight the growing need for afterschool programs, the \nAfterschool Alliance--a nonprofit organization dedicated to ensuring \nthat all children and youth have access to quality, affordable \nafterschool programs by the year 2010--has announced the third annual \nnationwide day of awareness for afterschool programs called ``Lights On \nAfter School!.'' Today, schools, community centers, museums, libraries, \nand parks across America will host activities to inform families about \nthe places currently open to children after school and the need to \nprovide additional centers where children can participate in engaging, \nstimulating activities until their parents return from work.\n  I applaud the Afterschool Alliance for recognizing the important role \nof afterschool programs in the lives of children, families, and \ncommunities, and I enthusiastically support the effort to build \nawareness through ``Lights On After School!.'' Promoting the safety and \nwell-being of our children is the best way to ensure that they have a \ngenuine opportunity to succeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10349-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10349-S10350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CATOCTIN MOUNTAIN NATIONAL RECREATION AREA\n\n  Mr. SARBANES.

From 1936 through 1941, hundreds of \nworkers under the Works Progress Administration and later the Civilian \nConservation Corps were employed in reforestation activities and in the \nconstruction of a number of camps, roads and other facilities, \nincluding the camp now known as Camp David, and one of the earliest, if \nnot the oldest, camps for disabled individuals. In November 1936, \nadministrative authority for the Catoctin RDA was transferred to the \nNational Park Service by Executive Order.\n  In 1942, concern about President Roosevelt's health and safety led to \nthe selection of Catoctin Mountain, and specifically Camp Hi-Catoctin \nas the location for the President's new retreat.

Mr. President, today the members of the Senate are \nfocused on Iraq. There's no task more serious than deciding whether to \nsend our young men and women into harm's way. My position is clear: The \ntime has come for decisive action to eliminate the threat of Iraq's \nweapons of mass destruction once and for all.\n  But as we act to defend America's interests abroad, we must also act \nto make America strong at home. With 8 million people out of work and \nmillions more struggling to make ends meet, our government is falling \ndown on the job of protecting economic security. To restore an economic \nenvironment where businesses are creating jobs and parents are earning \na better living for their children, I believe we need to act, and act \nnow. I want to explain very specifically why and how we should act. And \nI call on the President and my colleagues to join together immediately \nto take decisive action.\n  Nobody is a greater optimist about America's future than me. Our \nlong-term economic outlook remains strong because our free enterprise \nsystem remains strong--our spirit of innovation, our leadership in new \ntechnologies, and of course our people's hard work and productivity.\n  But sound economic fundamentals and strong economic growth are not \nthings we can take for granted. They are things we have to work for.\n  Like all Americans, I have hoped that our economy is on the way to a \nspeedy recovery. While I continue to hold out hope, I do not believe \nthat hope can stand in the way of action any longer. There is too much \nuncertainty and there are too many disturbing signs. Economic \nindicators that had started to turn up, including consumer confidence \nand manufacturing, have turned back down again. Many industries, \nparticularly telecommunications, have far too much capacity, and they \nwill continue to cut back in order to restore profitability. Job growth \nremains stagnant, and CEOs report that they are planning to cut jobs \nrather than hire. As more and more Americans worry about their \nprospects, the last bulwark of the economy, consumer spending, shows \nsigns of weakening.\n  We should not overreact. We need to keep our faith in the fundamental \nstrength of our economy. But we cannot turn away from the reality we \nface. This administration has spent months saying that recovery is just \naround the corner, but wishful thinking will not create jobs, pay the \nbills, or get the economy going again.\n  America is right to prepare for action against Iraq. But we ought to \napply that same logic to our economy. If you look at the recent \neconomic evidence, the risks of inaction on our economy now outweigh \nthe risks of action. We cannot wait until thousands more people lose \ntheir jobs before taking steps to defend our economic security. We can \nand should take preemptive action against this economic slump.\n  The President's plan is: Do nothing to promote economic growth in the \nshort-run, and pretend that deficit-exploding tax cuts for the \nwealthiest will promote economic growth in the long-run. That is wrong \nfor our economy and our security.\n  What our economy needs is the reverse prescription: a shot-in-the arm \nin the short-term, and a tighter grip on fiscal discipline in the long-\nterm.\n  Contracting the economy in this environment makes no economic sense. \nOn the other hand, stimulating the economy while exploding the long-\nterm deficit would be self-defeating. The loss of confidence in long-\nterm fiscal discipline can undermine both long-term confidence and \nshort-term progress.\n  With a shot-in-the-arm now and a tighter grip on fiscal discipline in \nthe long run, we can have the best of both worlds. Right now, we can \nincrease demand, prevent a negative or even deflationary cycle, create \njobs, and get incomes growing again. In the long run, we can get back \nto balanced budgets and maintain the investment climate we need for \nprosperity.\n  Let me be very specific about what we should do.\n  On the long-run side, we have to take two major steps. Number one, we \nhave to tackle excessive spending by restoring the budget enforcement \nrules that have lapsed. Congress should not go home without making sure \nthese rules are back in place. If Congress and the administration can't \nagree on spending bills before the election, let us at least show the \nvoters that we are serious about holding down spending.\n  Number two, we must ask our most fortunate citizens to forgo the full \nextent of future tax cuts. Since the President took office, a $5.6 \ntrillion surplus has almost entirely disappeared, and the biggest \nsingle reason was a tax cut whose full cost was over $2 trillion. As I \nhave said before, we need to ask Americans at the very top of the \neconomic ladder to live with smaller tax cuts than the tax bill passed \nlast year. If we stop cuts in the top two rates, eliminate new \ndeductions for very high-income earners, and triple the estate tax \nexemption without repealing it, we can save over $1.3 trillion in the \nnext two decades.\n  This kind of fiscal discipline will have at least five advantages for \nour country: Number one, it will help bring us back to the strong \neconomic fundamentals that led to growth during the 1990s. Number two, \nit will enable us to save for grave national security needs. Number \nthree, it will help us save Social Security and address the coming \nexplosion of baby boom retirements. Number four, it will reduce our \ndependence on foreign capital. Number five, it will allow us to \nconfront emergencies when we need to. The fiscal surplus inherited by \nPresident Bush has helped our country to meet its challenges since \nSeptember 11. Restoring long-term fiscal discipline will help us meet \nthe challenges of the future.\n  To meet the challenge of today, we need decisive action that \nsatisfies two basic principles. First, we should provide an efficient \nand effective spur to the economy. Second, the effect must be immediate \nand temporary--with incentives for business investment and consumer \ndemand that will jumpstart the economy now, and get out of the way when \nthey are no longer needed.\n  We all have to admit that the stimulus package of last spring did not \nmeet that test. In the fall, I advocated a stimulus package that would \nhave provided greater depreciation in the near-term, then tapered off \nquickly. That package would have been efficient and temporary. \nUnfortunately, the President and his party blocked proposals like that \nbecause they supported special-interest giveaways that the independent \nCongressional Budget Office found to be the most ineffective on the \nmarket. While we all hoped for the best, the business incentives that \neventually passed did not create the surge our country needed. In \naddition, the tax rebates bypassed in part or in full 50 million \nAmericans who would have been most likely to spend the money and \nincrease economic activity.\n  This time, we should do it right. Here is how.\n  First, and most important, we have to make sure the economic \nuncertainty and higher energy prices we're likely to face this winter \ndon't hurt the economic confidence and consumer spending that have been \nso critical over the last year. Today, I am proposing a one-time \nrefundable energy tax cut of $500 per family. This tax cut will put \nmoney into the pockets of Americans who will spend it where they need \nit most: to pay their heating bills; make their homes more energy-\nefficient, and prevent higher energy prices from squeezing out other \nvital needs. Unlike last year's rebate, this energy tax credit will \nleave no American behind.\n\n  Earlier this week, this administration's own experts said that \nfamilies in the Midwest will be paying 19 percent more for natural gas \nand 22 percent more for heating oil. Increases in the Northeast will be \neven higher. All the price hikes will fall particularly hard on the \nelderly, who have watched their life savings disappear in the stock \nmarket and have no way to make up the lost income.\n  Americans are prepared to sacrifice to win the war on terrorism and \nin Iraq. But America can win a war without leaving old people to cut \nback on their medicine to keep from shivering in the dark. We can \nprotect people against rising oil prices and, at the same time, reduce \nour country's dependence on Middle Eastern oil. This administration \napproaches energy the same way it approaches the economy: doing nothing \nin the short-term and ignoring the big problems in the long-term. That \nis wrong.\n\n[[Page S10351]]\n\n  I also continue to believe we should take the steps to stimulate the \neconomy that the administration failed to take earlier this year. To \nencourage businesses to invest, we should raise the bonus for investing \nin new equipment from 30 percent to 45 percent--a 50 percent increase--\nbut do it through June 30 of next year only. This will do what the \nadministration's stimulus has failed to do so far: persuade businesses \nto get off the fence and put their money to work in our economy.\n  We also should act to prevent painful property tax increases and \neducation cuts at the State level, giving States relief to deal with \nwhat the Wall Street Journal this week said is a $58 billion budget \ngap. The Senate has already acted to provide relief in the quickest \npossible way--through the Medicaid program--and there is no excuse for \nfurther delay.\n  Last but not least, we have to change a terrible reality: At a time \nwhen the index of Help Wanted listings is at historic lows, we are set \nto cut off unemployment benefits for nearly a million out-of-work \nAmericans just three days after Christmas. These are good people who \nwant nothing more than to get back to work. Last September, 800,000 \nAmericans had been out of work for 6 months or more. By December, that \ntotal will have climbed to over 2 million. We have to do what is right \nfor the workers who have done the worst in this economy and extend \ntheir benefits. They are sure to pump the money right back into our \neconomy.\n  I call on the President and my colleagues in both parties to put \npolitics aside and come together immediately to take these urgent steps \nto get our economy going again. Americans deserve nothing less from us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10351-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Special \nCommittee on Aging, and in honor of this year's Hispanic Heritage \nMonth, I rise today to give special recognition to 104-year-old Jose \nRodriguez, who recently has been determined to be the Oldest Hispanic \nAmerican now living in my State of Idaho. In honoring one man, Jose \nRodriguez, this Nation honors all Americans of Hispanic descent.\n  Hispanic Heritage Month began on September 15 a day which marks the \nanniversary of independence for five Latin American countries Costa \nRica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Mexico achieved \nits independence on September 16, and Chile on September 18.\n  This being a Nation of immigrants, it is only fitting that Jose \nRodriguez is himself an immigrant from Mexico. Some of us have been \nblessed by being born in Idaho. Others, like Jose, have been wise and \nbold enough to journey, sometimes great distances, to claim these \nblessings. He chose Idaho because Idaho was in his heart a place where \nfamily, faith, and freedom flourish.\n  Jose was born in Doctor Arrollo, in the State of Nuevo Leon, Mexico, \non March 19, 1898. In 1913, at the tender age of 15, he joined in the \nMexican revolution led by Pancho Villa. He arrived in the United States \nin 1922 and settled in Eagle Pass, TX. He married his wife Guadalupe, \nwho he knew from childhood, in 1929. They had seven children together: \nFive sons and two daughters. While his wife passed away a few years ago \nand he misses her, Mr. Rodriguez enjoys his more than 80 grandchildren \nand numerous great-grandchildren, who carry on his legacy.\n  In the 1950s, Mr. Rodriguez moved his family to Idaho where he worked \nas a farm worker and crew leader for most of his life. According to one \nof his sons, the hallmark of Jose's life has been his generosity. He is \na man known to help others, especially those in need.\n  Still living independently today, Mr. Rodriguez spends summers in \nIdaho with his son Meliton and winters in Arizona with his daughter \nMarina. Jose still cares for himself, takes daily walks, and credits \nhis long life to, in his words, ``God's good will and living a healthy \nlife.'' That is what aging should be.\n  That type of wonderfully positive outlook have no doubt contributed \nto his longevity.\n  When Jose Rodriguez was born, Idaho had only been a State for 7 years \nand 8 months. That year, the first photographs taken with a flashbulb \nwere produced and 1,000 automobiles were manufactured, up from a total \nof 100 the year before. Around that time, a child born in the United \nStates was expected to live less than fifty years. Jose, a child born \nin Mexico, has more than doubled that expectation.\n  Jose is part of a large and growing population of Hispanic Americans \nthroughout the nation and especially in Idaho. Within the past decade, \nthe Hispanic population in Idaho has doubled from approximately 50,000 \nin 1990 to more than 100,000 today. Nationwide, there are now some 26 \nmillion people of Hispanic origin in the United States approximately \nten percent of the American population. We honor their contributions \nduring Hispanic Heritage Month, which have maintained America's \ntradition as a rich, cultural melting pot and strengthened our shared \nnational values.\n  Jose is a trendsetter in another way. Following his example, the \nnumber of centenarians those 100 years old or older has grown to 50,000 \nAmericans today. In the next 50 years, according to Census Bureau \nestimates, there will be between 800,000 and one million people 100 \nyears or older living in the United States.\n  Jose Rodriguez is a man of honor. It is with great pride that I rise \ntoday to recognize him, and I thank him for allowing me this privilege.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10351-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LOW-FAT, LOW-CALORIE CUISINE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

He was one of 63 principals from \nacross the country who will be honored by the United States Department \nof Education and the National Association of Elementary School \nPrincipals.\n  Joseph is a product of the New Mexico higher education system, having \nreceived both his undergraduate degree and Master's degree from New \nMexico Highlands University. Since completing his master's degree, he \nhas dedicated his life to educating New Mexico's children. As a \nlanguage arts teacher at Taos High School, Thoreau High School and \nMemorial Middle School in Las Vegas, NM, he has touched the hearts and \nminds of his students, while generating interest and enthusiasm in \nlearning.\n  Three years ago Joseph agreed to move from the classroom to the \nprincipal's office. In this role he has shown leadership skills that \nhave earned him the respect of parents and teachers alike.\n\n[[Page S10352]]\n\n  One of his many accomplishments is the development of a program that \ntargets at-risk kids by providing them with after-school activities. \nThese include recreation, assistance with school work, and instruction \non ways to become involved as volunteers in the community.\n  This program is not limited simply to the children in these families, \nhowever. He has used money from a state grant to assist parents of his \nstudents obtain the skills needed to succeed in the workforce.\n  Joseph's contributions to the community are not limited simply to his \nwork in the Tucumcari schools. He has also encouraged his students to \naid the local homeless shelter, collect food, and visit senior \ncitizens.\n  I commend Joseph for his hard work and dedication to help students, \ntheir parents and the community of Tucumcari. Joseph has set the bar \nfor excellence through his exemplary efforts.

Mr. President, it was 60 years ago that 2,000 men \nfrom North Dakota's 164th Infantry Regiment performed heroically in a \nsavage battle in the South Pacific. It marked the first time the U.S. \nArmy launched an offensive operation in that war and stands today as a \ncritical juncture in World War II.\n  Coming from almost every city and village in North Dakota, the \nmembers of the 164th Infantry were North Dakota's National Guard and \ntraced their unit's heritage to the Indian wars on the American \nfrontier. Its history was one of distinction, most notably marked by a \nspectacular ten Medals of Honor its men won in the Philippines in 1899.\n  Called to active duty early in 1941, the North Dakotans were ordered \nto the West Coast the day after Pearl Harbor, and landed in the South \nPacific in the spring of 1942.\n  Meanwhile, on the island of Guadalcanal, U.S. Marines had begun \nAmerica's first offensive action against Japan. By autumn, it was a \nprecarious deadlock and the 164th Infantry was sent in October 13. By \nnoon it had its first casualty. Corporal Kenneth Foubert of Company M \nof Grand Forks, North Dakota, was killed in a bombing run by Japanese \nplanes. As Japanese ground patrols tested U.S. positions, the 164th \nInfantry advanced, the first unit of the Army to go on the offensive in \nWWII.\n  An intense Japanese attack, the largest battle fought on Guadalcanal, \noccurred October 24-25. In ``Citizens as Soldiers,'' a history of the \nNorth Dakota National Guard, authors Jerry Cooper and Glenn Smith tell \nhow a battalion of the 164th Infantry was sent to reinforce the \nMarines. Despite the blackness of night, made darker by a heavy \ntropical rain, the 164th Infantry, over narrow trails slippery with \nmud, followed its Marine escorts to the front line, holding on to the \nbackpacks of the man in front of them to avoid being lost.\n  Fighting side by side with the Marines, the 164th Infantry poured \nrelentless fire through the night into continuous waves of oncoming \nJapanese. At dusk of the next day, the Japanese attacked again. The \nsituation was precarious and cooks, messengers, and clerks manned \npositions and waited for the worst. Even the musicians of the North \nDakota band were pressed into service as litter bearers. Every member \nof the 164th had a role in that battle, the fiercest of the campaign.\n  At one outpost, 18 Marines, many seriously wounded, were surrounded. \nThe 164th Infantry's Sgt. Kevin McCarthy of Jamestown, ND, used a \nsmall, lightly armored, open topped vehicle to make repeated trips to \nthe desperate men and, under heavy fire, rescued them all. For his \nbravery, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.\n  By dawn, it was clear the enemy had suffered a disastrous defeat. In \nfront of the 164th Infantry were 1,700 dead Japanese. The North Dakota \nunit, meanwhile, suffered only 26 killed and 52 wounded.\n  Impressed, the Marines' commanding general sent the North Dakotans a \nmessage that said the Marines ``salute you for a most wonderful piece \nof work. We are honored to serve with such a unit. Our hat is off to \nyou.''\n  Lt. Col. Robert Hall of Jamestown, ND, received the Navy Cross for \nhis leadership of the battalion during this crucial action.\n  The fight for Guadalcanal continued into November when the 164th was \nassigned to drive Japanese defenders off a series of ridges. From \nNovember 20-27, the battle raged. It was the bloodiest week of the \nentire war for the unit. More than 100 men were killed and some 200 \nwounded. Not until February did the Japanese finally flee the island.\n  It was none too soon. Guadalcanal had taken its toll. The 164th was \nno longer combat effective. It was down to less than two-thirds its \nauthorized number. Most men had lost 20 pounds or more. They suffered \nfrom malaria, heat exhaustion, exotic tropical diseases. All told, the \nunit buried 147 men on the island, had 309 wounded, and another 133 \ncasualties from shock, trauma, and neurosis.\n  It was little wonder that the Americans called the island ``green \nhell'' and Japanese referred to it as the ``island of death.''\n  The regiment received a Presidential Unit Citation for its \noutstanding contributions and personal plaudits from General George \nMarshall, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Admiral William \nHalsey, commander of the South Pacific forces. For Guadalcanal, men of \nthe regiment won a Navy Cross, five Distinguished Service Crosses, 40 \nSilver Stars, more than 300 Purple Hearts, and many Soldier's Medals \nand Legions of Merit. One of its proud boasts was that it would leave \nno one behind and, indeed, it had no men missing in action.\n  The survivors are now old men. They have had America's hat tipped to \nthem before, but they deserve it again, one more time before they leave \nus to rejoin their comrades, brave young men who left North Dakota on \ntroop trains in the bitter February cold so long ago to answer their \nNation's call.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10352-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10352-S10353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMEMORATING THE BIRTH OF GEORGE ROGERS CLARK\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an \nimportant event in Indiana, the 250th birthday of George Rogers Clark. \nVincennes University, located in Vincennes, IN, is hosting a \ncelebration that will be held on November 19, 2002. I am pleased to add \nmy voice to those honoring a man who is one of the greatest figures in \nAmerican frontier history.\n  George Rogers Clark was born on November 19, 1752, to John and Ann \nRogers Clark. Although Clark was literate, he was not known as a \nscholar. Instead, like George Washington, he took an interest in \nsurveying, a high risk profession that presented the possibility of \ngreat reward. Surveying required intelligence, determination, physical \nstrength, resilience, and a thorough knowledge of wilderness survival \nskills.\n  When the Revolution began, the Virginia legislature appointed Clark \nto the position of Commander of the Frontier Militia. He set out, in \nMay 1778, with a small force to battle the British and their Native \nAmerican allies. During the summer, Clark and his troops ousted the \nBritish from Kaskaskia, Cohokia, and Vincennes.\n  On December 17, 1778, British Lt. Governor Henry Hamilton and his \ntroops retook Fort Sackville, the important stronghold in the City of \nVincennes. Clark led about 170 men on a grueling 18-day winter trek \nfrom Kaskaskia, through present day Illinois, up to Fort Sackville. \nClark and his men moved relentlessly, braving cold weather and crossing \nfreezing rivers, in an effort to stop further British incursions. Then, \nin a brilliant maneuver, he duped the British into believing that he \nhad gathered a considerably larger militia than he actually had. This \ntactic worked, and Lt. Governor Henry Hamilton surrendered Fort \nSackville to Clark on February 25, 1779. For the next several years, \nClark conducted successful campaigns against\n\n[[Page S10353]]\n\nthe Shawnee. He and his forces maintained control of most of the \nNorthwest. This success not only had military significance, but it also \nstrengthened America's post-war claims to the western territories. \nDuring this period, Clark spent his own money to help maintain his \nsmall army.\n  George Rogers Clark's courage and leadership have been recognized and \ncarefully remembered in the Hoosier State. President Franklin Roosevelt \ndedicated the memorial of George Rogers Clark in the City of Vincennes \non June 14, 1936. This memorial is the focal point of George Rogers \nClark National Historical Park that had 128,000 visitors last year.\n  I appreciate the efforts of Vincennes University and the George \nRogers Clark National Historical Park to honor this remarkable man and \nhis contributions to American history. This event will be a testament \nto the exceptional accomplishments and overall character of George \nRogers Clark and his men.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10353-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE AWARDING OF THE 2002 NOBEL PRIZE IN CHEMISTRY TO PROFESSOR JOHN B. \n                                  FENN\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nheartfelt congratulations to a former long-time Connecticut resident \nand member of the Yale University faculty, Professor John B. Fenn, for \nbeing jointly awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, the world's \nhighest honor for scientific achievement.\n  I cannot imagine another person for whom this prestigious award is \nmore richly deserved. Professor Fenn has conducted pioneering research \non powerful analytical methods for studying biological macromolecules \nsuch as proteins. His work has revolutionized the development of new \nmedicines and has broken new ground in the early diagnosis of certain \ncancers. The possibility of analyzing proteins in detail has led to an \nincreased understanding of the processes of life. Because of the \nadvances resulting from Professor Fenn's work, researchers can now \nrapidly and simply identify the constituent proteins contained within a \nsubstance. They can also create three-dimensional pictures showing what \nprotein molecules look like in solution in order to better understand \ntheir functions within a cell. In addition to assisting the diagnosis \nof breast and prostate cancer, applications of this groundbreaking area \nof research are also being reported in other areas; for example, \nfoodstuff control, pharmaceutical development, environmental analysis, \nand the diagnosis of malaria.\n  Mass spectrometry is a very important analytical method used in \npractically all chemistry laboratories the world over. This process \nlets scientists rapidly identify a substance and is used in areas such \nas testing for doping and illegal drugs. For much of the 20th century, \nthe technique had been used to identify only small-or medium-sized \nmolecules. In the latter half of the 1980s, Professor Fenn and his \ncolleague Koichi Tanaka, with whom he is sharing the prize, developed \nmethods that make it possible to analyze biological macromolecules as \nwell. Professor Fenn has been honored for finding ways to extend the \ntechnique to large molecules by making the individual molecules \nseparate and spread out as a cloud in a gas without losing their \noriginal structure. In the method that he published in 1988, \nelectrospray ionisation--ESI--charged droplets of protein solution are \nproduced which shrink as the water evaporates. Eventually, freely \nhovering protein ions remain, and their masses may then be determined \nby setting them in motion and measuring their time of flight over a \nknown distance.\n  Professor Fenn received a B.A. in chemistry from Berea College in \n1937 and a Ph.D. from Yale in 1940. After a dozen years in industry, he \nwas appointed director of Project SQUID, a Navy program of basic and \napplied research in jet propulsion administered by Princeton \nUniversity, where he later became professor of aerospace and mechanical \nsciences in 1959. He returned to Yale in 1967 as professor of applied \nscience and chemistry, a post he held for 13 years. From 1980 until his \nretirement in 1987, he was a professor of chemical engineering. He \nbecame a research scientist at Yale after being named Emeritus in 1987. \nIn 1994, he moved to Virginia Commonwealth University as a research \nprofessor. He has served as a visiting professor at Trento University \nin Italy, the University of Tokyo, the Indian Institute of Science at \nBangalore, and the Chinese Academy of Science in Beijing, and as a \ndistinguished lecturer at several other institutions. Author of one \nbook and over a hundred papers, he is sole or co-inventor on 19 \npatents. Much of his research has centered on the properties and uses \nof supersonic free jets expanding into vacuum. Such jets can produce \nmolecular beams with much higher intensities and energies than can the \nclassical effusion ovens they have replaced. Their ability to cool \nmolecules to ultra low temperatures, with or without condensation, has \nrevolutionized molecular spectroscopy and made them versatile sources \nof clusters and van der Waals molecules. In mass spectrometry, \nProfessor Fenn is best known for his work in the development and \napplications of electrospray ionization.\n  I speak with utmost sincerity in expressing my gratitude to Professor \nFenn for the lifetime of contributions or, more accurately, several \nlifetimes' worth of contributions that he has rendered in service to \nour Nation in his research on mass spectrometry. The work resulting \nfrom his drive and genius will no doubt improve our lives and our \nsociety, and it fills me with exceptional pride to see him recognized \nfor his efforts. Outstanding scientists such as he undertake research \nto fully realize human and societal potential, and by having had \nsomeone as accomplished as Professor Fenn on its faculty, both \nConnecticut and Yale University have greatly benefited from his \ngroundbreaking work. On behalf of your State and your country, \nProfessor Fenn, please accept my deepest congratulations and \nthanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10353-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10353-S10354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. LURA POWELL\n\n Mrs. MURRAY Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today \nto recognize the accomplishments of Dr. Lura Powell, the Laboratory \nDirector of the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National \nLaboratory in Richland, WA. Dr. Powell will be stepping down at the end \nof this year and, over the past 2 years as director, has provided many \ncontributions while leading this National Laboratory. I would also like \nto thank her for her leadership and her commitment to the Tri-Cities \nCommunity.\n  Lura Powell joined the Laboratory after a lengthy career at the \nDepartment of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology. During her tenure at NIST, she served as Director of the \nAdvanced Technology Program. She earned the Department of Commerce Gold \nMedal in 1998. In 2000, Dr. Powell joined Battelle and became the first \nwoman director of the Laboratory. There are several noteworthy \nsuccesses to mention, including two ``Outstanding'' ratings from the \nDepartment of Energy, the highest rating available, during her tenure. \nIn addition, DOE recently announced its intention to renew the 5-year \ncontract for the Laboratory.\n  During her tenure, the acquisition of two major pieces of equipment, \nincluding a leading-edge supercomputer and the world's first 900 \nMegahertz wide bore Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectrometer, will \nposition the laboratory to be a leader in molecular research. Dr. \nPowell can also be credited with enhancing university partnerships in \nthe Northwest with the University of Washington and Washington State \nUniversity, as well as the University of Idaho and Oregon State \nUniversity. Dr. Powell's legacy is the successful combination of \nacademic partnerships with this state-of-the-art laboratory, securing a \nstrong economic future for my state of Washington and the Pacific \nNorthwest region of the United States.\n  In the Tri-City Community, Dr. Powell has been active in promoting \neconomic growth and providing leadership in the role that science and \ntechnology can play in education, work, and our daily lives. In \nWashington State, Dr. Powell has been a member of the Washington \nRoundtable and the Washington Technology Alliance Board where she has \ncared deeply about bringing growth to the state economy.\n  On behalf of the people of the Tri-Cities and Washington State, I \nwould like to thank Lura Powell for her hard\n\n[[Page S10354]]\n\nwork and know that wherever she goes, those around her will benefit \nfrom her leadership, insight, and commitment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10354-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WEST VIRGINIA VET CENTER RECEIVES AWARD\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, once again I rise to \ncongratulate the Morgantown Vet Center in my State of West Virginia for \nreceiving both the ``Clinical Programs of Excellence'' award presented \nby the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Administration and the \n``Vet Center of Excellence'' award presented by VA's Readjustment \nCounseling Service.\n  For the second time in a row, the skilled, dedicated staff of the \nMorgantown Vet Center has been recognized by VA for providing the best \nof VA care in their field. To receive either of these two awards once \nwould be an outstanding accomplishment. But to receive both of them, \ntwice in a row, by continuing to meet such high standards of care is \nsomething to be enormously proud of.\n  The services provided by the staff at the Morgantown Vet Center \ninclude individual and group counseling, family/marital counseling, \nsexual trauma counseling, substance abuse counseling, vocational and \nemployment assistance, VA claims and benefits information, help for the \nhomeless, and social service and health care referrals. They provide \nreadjustment counseling to combat veterans and their families, \nincluding veterans who served during Vietnam, Korea, World War II, and \nthe Persian Gulf.\n  The staff at the Morgantown Vet Center is extremely dedicated, and \nliterally hundreds of veterans have benefitted from their expertise. In \nfiscal year 2001, 11,528 visits were made to the Morgantown Vet Center, \na 41 percent increase in the number of visits for fiscal year 1998. \nThis growth is just one of the many positive facets of Morgantown's \nprogram that allowed VA to select them once again as a ``Clinical \nProgram of Excellence.''\n  So to each and every one of the staff at the Morgantown Vet Center, \nthank you again for the exemplary work you do, for your \nprofessionalism, your dedication, and your compassion.\n  Congratulations for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10354-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE WEEK\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate \nNational Wildlife Refuge Week. This week of wildlife education and \nactivities marks the 99th birthday of the National Wildlife Refuge \nSystem. Following in the footsteps of one of our first conservationist \nPresidents, Theodore Roosevelt, who in 1903 instituted the National \nWildlife Refuge on Pelican Island in Florida, the National Wildlife \nRefuge System attentively monitors and preserves wildlife habitats on \n538 National Wildlife Refugees spanning 94 million acres. The National \nWildlife Refuge System plays a unique and critical role in ensuring \nAmericans a safe, clean, and natural ecosystem where both wildlife and \npeople benefit from a healthy environment.\n  The National Wildlife Refuge System protects a wide range of wildlife \nand landscapes throughout the country. In particular, the refuges in \nthe Southwest are necessary to secure the well-being and survival of an \nassortment of migratory birds, including the bald eagle, who make the \nSouthwest their home during the fall and spring months. The National \nWildlife Refuge System concentrates not only on the hands-on aspect of \nenvironmental protection but, focuses on the importance of science in \ndetermining the future and well-being of wildlife. Specifically, they \ndirect their scientific endeavors towards the accelerating rate of \nextinction of species and the associated loss of biological diversity \ncoupled with habitat alteration and destruction. Their efforts towards \nthe preservation of wildlife are in conjunction with and for the well-\nbeing of Americans and their ability to enjoy a peaceful, natural, and \nunspoiled national refuge.\n  The National Wildlife Refuge contributes greatly to ensuring many of \nNew Mexico's natural landmark treasures such as Bitter Lake, Bosque del \nApache, Grulla, Las Vegas, Maxwell, San Andres, and Sevilleta. The \nNational Wildlife Refuge has been devoted to the restoration of \nSevilleta, making native animals such as deer, elk, coyotes, mountain \nlions, and various birds and reptiles more abundant and visible. In \nparticular, and of great interest to me, is the Long-Term Ecological \nResearch Project the National Wildlife Refuge System they have \nlaunched. Such programs are key to the revitalization of not just \nSevilletta, but to all of New Mexico's varying ecosystems. Their \nproject is in line with the Sevilleta National Wild Refuge program and \nthe Rio Grande Bosque Initiative that was implemented in 1991.\n  As part of my concern for New Mexico's wildlife, I included a \nprovision in this year's Interior Appropriations bill providing $1.25 \nmillion for the Fish and Wildlife program to design a new research \ncomplex for Sevilleta NWR. This facility will support numerous \nuniversity and Federal agency research programs.\n  The National Wildlife Refuge System consistently helps prevent and \nregulate environmental disasters through their highly cultivated set of \nmanagement tools that includes farming, prescribed burning, exotic \nplant control, moist soil management, and water level manipulation. \nWithout the perseverance of such organizations as the National Wildlife \nRefuge System, we would not be able to successfully tackle the many \nenvironmental obstacles that stand in the way of a healthy and well \nmanaged ecosystem.\n  I wish the National Wildlife Refuge System a great week of learning, \nexploration, and fun and a continued success in their wildlife and \nenvironmental work. Although I cannot be in my beloved home of New \nMexico for this noble event, I congratulate this organization for their \nalmost one hundred years of conservation and public works.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10354-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10354-S10355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CIVICS AND GOVERNMENT\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues the work of the Center for Civic Education. \nThe center offers outstanding professional development institutes for \nteachers of civics and government throughout the United States.\n  While the center is based in my home State of California, their \nprograms are administered nationally by a network of State and \ncongressional district coordinators. Many of you are familiar with We \nthe People: The Citizen and the Constitution, a nationally acclaimed \ncivic education program for upper elementary, middle, and high school \nstudents. I know that a number of you have met with the high school \nstudents who participate in the We the People national finals, a three-\nday academic competition in which students respond to questions on the \nU.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.\n  The center-sponsored professional development institutes are offered \nat national, regional, and State levels. These institutes are designed \nto instruct teachers in the content and methodology required to deliver \nquality education in civics and government. Institutes are usually one \nweek long and provide rigorous content knowledge, innovative teaching \ntechniques, and authentic assessment practices. Regional institutes \nprovide an opportunity for teachers from neighboring states to share \nbest practices in civic education.\n  This past year, 27 regional and State institutes were held in \nArizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, \nMaryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New \nMexico, New York, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, \nWashington, and Wisconsin. A Juvenile Justice Institute was offered for \nteachers of incarcerated youth, and a civics and government institute \nwas held for university professors of education.\n  The center also sponsors a more intensive 3-week National Academy for \nteachers from across the country; the academy is held in California. \nParticipants in the academy study major works of political theory such \nas Aristotle's Politics, Hobbes' Leviathan, Locke's Second Treatise, \nThe Federalist, anti-federalist writings, and U.S. Supreme Court \nopinions. They also discuss relevant knowledge and creative ways to \napply this experience when they return to the classroom.\n  National institutes for elementary school teachers and teachers \ninterested\n\n[[Page S10355]]\n\nin advanced content knowledge were held for the first time this year. \nThese institutes were conducted in Virginia and Missouri, respectively. \nIn 2003, the center will increase the number of summer professional \ndevelopment institutes offered.\n  The poor performance of students on the 1998 National Assessment for \nEducational Progress, NAEP, Civics Report Card can be traced to \ninadequate teacher preparation and insufficient quantity of \ninstruction. We know that outstanding programs and student outcomes are \ndirectly attributed to adequately prepared teachers.\n  Investment in professional development opportunities, such as the \nsummer institutes and the National Academy sponsored by the Center for \nCivic Education, are helping to address this critical situation of \nteacher preparedness in the field of civics and government.\n  I commend the center for their efforts and applaud their investment \nin one of our most treasured resources, the American classroom teacher. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10355-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DANIEL A. BENAC\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues a great American. Mr. Daniel A. Benac of \nHillman, MI has made service to his country and community a cornerstone \nof his life. In 1942, Daniel answered the call to serve his country and \njoined the United States Army's 103rd Infantry Division. After being \nhonorably discharged from the Army, Dan went back to Michigan where he \nbecame a member of a variety of important organizations including the \nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the United Auto \nWorkers. As a skilled tradesman, Dan also ran a successful small \nbusiness. In the military, business and personal life, he has \ndemonstrated his commitment to his country, family, and friends.\n  Dan's leadership capabilities are highlighted by his commitment to a \nvariety of community-based organizations including the Masons, \nShriners, Disabled American Veterans, and the American Legion. He also \nserves as a Board member for the United Auto Worker's state-wide \ncoordinating committee for the Democratic Party and the National \nCouncil for Senior Citizens. Furthermore, Dan is the Chairman of the \nMichigan Veterans Trust Fund for Montmorency County and Past Chairman \nof the Montmorency County Democratic Party. Dan currently serves as the \nchairman of Region 1D, United Auto Worker Retirees, a region which \nencompasses 62 counties. Daniel was instrumental in the formation of \nthe Montmorency County Democratic Party and has served as the party \nchairman for many years.\n  Dan and his wife Geraldine will celebrate their 60th wedding \nanniversary on February 9, 2003. They have three children, eight \ngrandchildren, and fifteen great grandchildren. At 80 years of age, he \nhas been, and continues to be, an inspiration to all who know him. I \nknow my colleagues will join me in saluting Daniel Benac for his \nleadership in the community dedication to his country, and loyalty to \nhis family and friends.\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``Feed \nAmerica Thursday,'' a resolution which designates November 21, 2002, \nthe Thursday before Thanksgiving Day, as ``Feed America Thursday.''\n  This resolution encourages Americans to sacrifice two meals on \nNovember 21 and donate the money they would have used for food to a \ncharity or religious organization of their choice. The charities and \nchurches, in turn, are encouraged to feed the hungry with the funds \nreceived. ``Feed America Thursday'' will not only encourage Americans \nto help those in need, it will encourage a spirit of selflessness and \nsacrifice vital to our strength as a nation.\n  Each day people in our Nation suffer due to hunger. The United States \nDepartment of Agriculture recently reported that 33 million Americans, \n13 million of whom are children, live in homes that do not have an \nadequate supply of food. Hunger among children is especially \ndevastating because it has a serious impact on physical growth and \nbrain development. The contributions this resolution encourages will \nserve the needs of those who suffer from hunger in our Nation, \nespecially the children. This resolution will not only help alleviate \nhunger, it will both affirm and restore the spirit of giving in our \nsociety. Hunger affects people from every state and in all age groups.\n  I ask every American to join me in feeding the hungry and affirming \nthe values that make our Nation great. This resolution, if passed, will \nprovide food to the hungry and hope to our nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10355-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10355-S10356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE RETIREMENT OF SHERIFF BILL BREWER\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have often heard it said that \nWyoming is such a remarkable place to live because of the remarkable \npeople who live there. For my part, I can not only assure you that it \nis true, but I have the proof in the form of one of the stories of our \nremarkable citizenry that I would like to share with my colleagues \ntoday.\n  In just a few weeks, Bill Brewer will be retiring after serving for \n26 years as our Sheriff for Park Country. All told, he will be closing \nthe books on a career in law enforcement that totals almost 40 years.\n  As a former Mayor, I know full well the importance of a good Sheriff \nin city and county management and the important role law enforcement \nplays in the services we provide to the citizens of our communities. If \nnothing else, good city and county government demands that we ensure \nthe safety of our people to the fullest extent possible. That is why \nlaw enforcement officers like Bill Brewer are so important in the day \nto day life of our communities.\n  Sheriff Brewer has been an integral part of the daily life of the \ncommunity of Cody and Park County since 1972, when he became the \nSheriff of Park County. Over the years, he proved to be instrumental in \nbringing the Cody Police Department and the Park County Sheriff's \nDepartment together as he worked to bring both offices into the modern \nage. Through his efforts, he was able to improve the technology both \noffices have come to depend on as they became more effective and \nresponsive to the needs of the people of the area. Thanks to his \ndedication to improving the system he was a part of, numerable changes \nwere made in the way the offices communicated with each other. And \nthanks to his willingness to try new things, the kind of information \nthey exchanged and the speed with which it was shared increased \ndramatically.\n  Sheriff Brewer's vision and commitment to making a difference in his \ncorner of the world did not go unnoticed through the years, and he was \nnamed Wyoming Peace Officer of the Year in 1981. The award was \npresented to him to recognize his devotion to duty as well as his \ndedication and commitment to improving the tools his officers had \naccess to in the performance of their daily duties.\n  For example, in the 1980's, Sheriff Brewer's foresight and commitment \nto ensuring Cody and Park County had the most modern crime fighting \ntools possible led him to create a SWAT team for the County. Although \nthere was quite a bit of dissension about the formation of such a \nforce, it proved to be an important addition to the law enforcement \nteam of the area when there was a shooting at a bar in Cody. The \nperpetrators fled the scene and barricaded themselves in a cabin. It \nwas then up to the newly formed SWAT team to capture them and bring \nthem to justice. They were subsequently convicted and the story was \nbroadcast across the nation as part of a television series of law \nenforcement.\n  In addition to his duties as a Sheriff, Bill has also been very \ninvolved with the youth of the community. He was a boxing coach and \nreferee, as well as a baseball and basketball coach.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't also point out Bill's participation in \nthe music community of the area. He plays the banjo and the guitar and \nhe and his father played with the Wyoming Fiddlers Association. He also \nenjoys playing horseshoes and now that he's retired, I have no doubt \nthat he is going to get into a lot more activities in the years to \ncome.\n  Bill Brewer will long be remembered for all he has done to make his \ncommunity a better place to live. For his almost forty years of \nservice, he has made a huge difference in his neck of the woods of \nWyoming. There is no way\n\n[[Page S10356]]\n\nto measure all Bill has accomplished as Sheriff and the lives he has \ntouched in all his activities. A lot of the area bears his remarkable \nand gentle touch and is better for his having passed by.\n  Now, I have a hunch Bill and his remarkable wife Janet won't be \nslowing down so much as changing gears and direction in retirement. I \nwish them all the best in whatever they decide to do in the coming \nyears. After all, Bill has done all we could have asked him to do, and \nmore, for almost forty years. I hope he and Janet enjoy their \nretirement. They have been a great team for Park County and Wyoming and \nthey have earned it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10356-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10356-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10356-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:57 p.m., a message from the House or Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory \ntreatment (normal trade relations treatment) to the products of \nUkraine, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to grant normal \ntrade treatment to the products of Ukraine. My brother, Congressman \nSander Levin, has introduced an identical bill, H.R. 4723, in the \nHouse. It is our hope that enactment of this legislation will help to \nbuild stronger economic ties between the United States and Ukraine.\n  The cold war era Jackson-Vanik immigration restrictions that deny \nmost favored nation trade status to imports from former Soviet-Block \ncountries are outdated and when applied to Ukraine, inappropriate. \nThose restrictions were established as a tool to pressure Communist \nnations to allow their people to freely emigrate in exchange for \nfavorable trade treatment by the United States.\n  Ukraine does allow it citizens the right and opportunity to emigrate. \nIt has met the Jackson-Vanik test. In fact, Ukraine has been found to \nbe in full compliance with the freedom of emigration requirements under \nthe Jackson-Vanik law. Ukraine has been certified as meeting the \nJackson-Vanik requirements on an annual basis since 1992 when a \nbilateral trade agreement went into effect. It is time the United \nStates recognize this reality by eliminating the Jackson-Vanik \nrestrictions and granting Ukraine normal trading status on a permanent \nbasis. Our bill does this as well as addressing traditional Jackson-\nVanik issues such as emigration, religious freedom, restoration of \nproperty, and human rights. It also deals with the important trade \nissues that must be considered when granting a country permanent normal \ntrade relations, PNTR, such as making progress toward World Trade \nOrganization, WTO, accession and tariff and excise tax reductions.\n  Since reestablishing independence in 1991, Ukraine has taken \nimportant steps toward the creation of democratic institutions and a \nfree-market economy. As a member state of the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, Ukraine is committed to developing a \nsystem of governance in accordance with the principles regarding human \nrights and humanitarian affairs that are set forth in the Final Act of \nthe Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Helsinki \nFinal Act. I believe that more needs to be done to reform Ukraine's \neconomy and legal structures, but I believe that the hope for PNTR and \nthus PNTR itself, can encourage these reforms.\n  Drawing Ukraine into normal trade relations should lead Ukraine to \nachieve greater market reform and continue its commitment to \nsafeguarding religious liberty and enforcing laws to combat \ndiscrimination as well as expand on the restitution of religious and \ncommunal properties. Also, PNTR status will hopefully do more than \nincrease bilateral trade between the United States and Ukraine and \nencourage increased international investment in Ukraine. Hopefully it \nwill also stimulate the reform we all want and Ukraine deserves on \ntheir way to achieving a mature nation statehood.\n  Ukraine is important to U.S. strategic interests and objectives in \nCentral and Eastern Europe and has participated with the United States \nin its peacekeeping operations in Europe and has provided important \ncooperation in the global struggle against international terrorism. \nIt's time we recognize Ukraine's accomplishments and status as an \nemerging democracy and market economy and graduate it from the Jackson-\nVanik restrictions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 3090. A bill to provide for the testing of chronic wasting disease \nand other infectious disease in deer and elk herds, to establish the \nInteragency Task Force on Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce legislation to \naddress two emergent wildlife diseases in my state, chronic wasting \ndisease, or CWD, and epizootic hemorrhagic disease, or EHD, both of \nwhich have been found in Wisconsin's deer. I am pleased to be joined in \nintroducing this legislation today by the Senior Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Kohl. CWD was detected in wild deer in my state earlier \nthis year, and, unfortunately, has now spread to captive herds. EHD was \ndetected in wild deer in the last week of September. These diseases \nhave become serious and substantial management problems in my home \nState of Wisconsin.\n  To address CWD, the State of Wisconsin has decided to eradicate free-\nranging white tailed deer within eastern Iowa, western Dane, and \nsouthern Sauk counties in an effort to try to eradicate the disease. \nWisconsin will sample and test another 50,000 deer statewide. This \nrepresents an unprecedented eradication and sampling effort in \nWisconsin. Most likely, it is the largest ever undertaken in the United \nStates.\n  For months, the Wisconsin delegation has been unified, on a \nbipartisan basis, in seeking Federal assistance from the Administration \nto combat this problem. We have sought assistance from the United \nStates Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior. We \nhave pursued any and every other Federal agency that might be able to \nprovide us with assistance. Some help has been forthcoming, and we are \ngrateful for the help that we have received.\n  But the help our State has gotten so far to combat CWD isn't near \nenough. We need to be ready for the deer hunt that begins next month. \nWe need to expand the availability of CWD testing in our State, and we \nneed to expand it now. Wisconsin is undertaking an unprecedented \ntesting program, but USDA has refused to allow Wisconsin to certify \nprivate labs to run CWD tests. That is why I have authored this new \nbill to require USDA to make CWD\n\n[[Page S10362]]\n\nscreening tests available to the public, that's the only way \nWisconsinites can make informed decisions when hunting season arrives.\n  USDA is concerned that the public may interpret the results of the \ncurrently available CWD tests to be more than a determination of \nwhether the deer does or does not have CWD. USDA is concerned because \nthe current tests have certain limitations and are only accurate in \ndetermining whether a deer is infected with CWD. No test has yet been \napproved by the Food and Drug Administration as a way of proving that \ndeer meat is safe to eat.\n  While I understand USDA's concern that an animal screening test for \nCWD should not be viewed by the public as a food safety test, at \npresent there is no food safety test for venison. The CWD screening \ntests are the only tests that are available today. We should make the \npublic aware of the limitations of today's tests, but we should also \nmake those tests available and let the public use their own judgment. \nThe World Health Organization has advised that meat from CWD-infected \ndeer should not be consumed. The only way Wisconsinites can follow the \nWHO's advice and make an informed decision is to have their deer \ntested.\n  This bill addresses Wisconsin's urgent short term need for enhanced \ntesting capacity in two ways. First, the bill requires USDA to release, \nwithin 30 days, protocols both for labs to use in performing tests for \nchronic wasting disease and for the proper collection of animal tissue \nto be tested. Second, the bill requires USDA to develop a certification \nprogram for Federal and non-federal labs, including private labs, \nallowing them to conduct chronic wasting disease tests within 30 days \nof enactment. I hope these measures will enhance Wisconsin's capacity \nto expand deer testing this year. To address longer-term needs the bill \ndirects USDA to accelerate research into the development of live animal \ntests for chronic wasting disease, including field diagnostic tests, \nand to develop testing protocols that reduce laboratory test processing \ntime.\n  I believe that the alternative to not expanding testing in Wisconsin \nis much worse, and much more challenging than undertaking an effort to \neducate our hunters about the limitations of current tests. The \nalternative, frankly, is the spread of this disease. We should be very \nclear that the Federal Government will be allowing this disease to \nspread if it does not act to make more testing available.\n  Concerned hunters, faced with limited information, will simply choose \nnot to hunt Already, the lack of testing is affecting the number of \nhunters who will take to the woods in Wisconsin this fall. Registration \nfor hunting licenses in my State is already down 30 percent from this \ntime last year. If we do not expand testing in Wisconsin, we will \nlikely guarantee the spread of the disease.\n  Failure to aggressively work to eradicate CWD before it spreads could \nallow the very resilient prions that spread the disease to survive in \nthe environment for years, further complicating eradication efforts. \nAnd although CWD has never spread to other species, scientists have not \nruled out that possibility, and more deer with the disease may well \nincrease the risk.\n  The bill also addresses another issue, the emergence of another \nanimal disease, this time a viral disease, EHD. This disease has \napparently killed eighteen deer in Iowa County, and could have spread \nbeyond the deer population in Iowa County.\n  This disease affects not only our deer population, but could also \nharm our world famous dairy industry. While I am told that cows don't \nfrequently die from EHD, they can carry the disease, and some are \nworried that this disease could subject our dairy herds to quarantine \nif they were found to have EHD.\n  Our hunters and dairy industry do seem to have caught a break when it \ncomes to EHD. I understand that colder weather will kill off the biting \ninsects that spread the EHD virus. This should provide some protection \nfor deer and dairy cattle for the next few months. In the meantime, \nhowever, we must take steps to prevent the spread of this disease now \nbefore it becomes a problem in the spring and to prevent its possibly \nspreading to our dairy industry.\n  The Administration has simply not taken sufficient steps on CWD, and \nI am concerned that it will again fail to do enough if EHD becomes a \nproblem. That's why my legislation today also includes a provision to \ncreate an action plan to address concerns about EHD. It would require \nthat the Secretary of Agriculture create a federal working group to \noutline what actions the federal government is taking now, and to \ndetermine the future actions that are important to take in addressing \nEHD.\n  My legislation is also budget neutral. It won't cost taxpayers a \ndime. It asks USDA to undertake these activities using current funds. I \nrefuse to accept that USDA cannot find the resources within its budget \nof over seventy three billion dollars to take these actions. The \nDepartment must find the means to develop an efficient and accurate way \nto certify private labs to conduct CWD tests following the standards \nthat the USDA labs use.\n  Legislative action on this problem is urgently needed. We cannot \nafford to wait, or we will allow these wildlife diseases to spread. \nThis legislation is a necessary step in ensuring that we can bring \nthese diseases under control and I urge its swift consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3090\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

A bill to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to prevent abuse of recipients of long-term care services under the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Patient \nAbuse Prevention Act, which will help protect patients in long-term \ncare from abuse and neglect by those who are supposed to care for them. \nThis legislation will establish a National Registry of abusive long-\nterm care workers and require criminal background checks for potential \nemployees. The changes we are making today are technical in nature and \nare designed to ensure that the background check system runs as \nsmoothly and efficiently as possible.\n  There is absolutely no excuse for abuse or neglect of the elderly and \ndisabled at the hands of those who are supposed to care for them. Our \nparents and grandparents made our country what it is today, and they \ndeserve to live with dignity and the highest quality care.\n  Unfortunately, this is not always the case. We know that the majority \nof caregivers are dedicated, professional, and do their best under \ndifficult circumstances. But it only takes a few abusive staff to case \na dark shadow over what should be a healing environment.\n  Current State and national safeguards are inadequate to screen out \nabusive workers. All States are required to maintain registries of \nabusive nurse aides. But nurse aides are not the only workers involved \nin abuse, and other workers are not tracked at all. Even worse, there \nis no system to coordinate information about abusive nurse aides \nbetween States. A known abuser in Iowa would have little trouble moving \nto Wisconsin and continuing to work with patients there.\n  In addition, there is no Federal requirement that long-term care \nfacilities conduct criminal background checks on prospective employees. \nPeople with violent criminal backgrounds, people who have already been \nconvicted of murder, rape, and assault, could easily get a job in a \nnursing home or other health care setting without their past ever being \ndiscovered.\n  Our legislation will go a long way toward solving this problem. \nFirst, it will create a National Registry of abusive long-term care \nemployees. States will be required to submit information from their \ncurrent State registries to the National Registry. Facilities will be \nrequired to check the National Registry before hiring a prospective \nworker. Any worker with a substantiated finding of patient abuse will \nbe prohibited from working in long-term care.\n  Second, the bill provides a second line of defense to protect \npatients from violent criminals. If the National Registry does not \ncontain information about a prospective worker, the facility is then \nrequired to initiate a FBI background check. Any conviction for patient \nabuse or a relevant violent crime would bar that applicant from working \nwith patients.\n  A disturbing number of cases have been reported where workers with \ncriminal backgrounds have been cleared to work in direct patient care, \nand have subsequently abused patients in their care. In 1997, the \nMilwaukee Journal-Sentinel ran a series of articles describing this \nproblem. In 1998, at my request, the Senate Special Committee on Aging \nheld a hearing that focused on how easy it is for known abusers to find \nwork in long-term care and continue to prey on patients. At that \nhearing, the HHS Inspector General presented a report which found that, \nin the two States they studied, between 5-10 percent of employees \ncurrently working in nursing homes had serious criminal convictions in \ntheir past. They also found that among aides who had abused patients, \n15-20 percent of them had at least one conviction in their past.\n  In 1998, I offered an amendment which became law that allowed long-\nterm care providers to voluntarily use the FBI system for background \nchecks. So far, 7 percent of those checks have come back with criminal \nconvictions, including rape and kidnapping.\n  And on July 30, 2001, the House Government Reform Committee's Special \nInvestigations Division of the Minority staff issued a report which \nfound that in the past two years, over 30 percent of nursing homes in \nthe U.S. were cited for a physical, sexual, or verbal abuse violation \nthat had the potential to harm residents. Even more striking, the \nreport found that nearly 10 percent of nursing homes had violations \nthat caused actual harm to residents.\n  Clearly, this is a critical tool that long-term care providers should \nhave, they don't want abusive caregivers working for them any more than \nfamilies do. I am pleased that the nursing home industry has worked \nwith me over the years to refine this legislation, and I greatly \nappreciate their support of the bill with the changes we are \nincorporating today. This bill reflects their input and will help \nensure a smooth transition to an efficient, accurate background check \nsystem. This is a common-sense, cost-effective step we can and should \ntake to protect patients by helping long-term care providers thoroughly \nscreen potential caregivers.\n  I realize that this legislation will not solve all instances of \nabuse. We still need to do more to stop abuse from occurring in the \nfirst place. But this bill will ensure that those who have already \nabused an elderly or disabled patient, and those who have committed \nviolent crimes against people in the past, are kept away from \nvulnerable patients.\n  I want to repeat that I strongly believe that most long-term care \nproviders and their staff work hard to deliver the highest quality \ncare. However, it is imperative that Congress act immediately to get \nrid of those that don't.\n  This bill is the product of collaboration and input from the health \ncare industry, patient and employee advocates, who all have the same \ngoal I do: protecting patients in long-term care. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with my colleagues, the Administration, and the \nhealth care industry in this effort. Our Nation's seniors and disabled \ndeserve nothing less than our full attention.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3091\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S10364]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \nextend the availability of allotments to States for fiscal years 1998 \nthrough 2000, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Children's \nHealth Protection and Eligibility Act. I am delighted to be joined on \nthis bill with my good friend, Senator Patty Murray. Senator Murray has \nbeen a champion for children's health issues throughout her career in \nthe Senate. This important legislation addresses the allocation of \nbudgeted but unspent SCHIP funds that are currently out of reach of \nstates and, under current law, are scheduled to be returned to the \nfederal treasury. This legislation also helps those States with the \nhighest unemployment rates use more of their SCHIP dollars to provide \nhealth insurance coverage for low-income children.\n  Washington State is in the middle of an economic crisis resulting \nfrom a downturn in both our aviation and high-tech sectors. With the \njobless rate at 7.2 percent, we have one of the highest unemployment \nrates in the country, 202,000 Washingtonians are unable to find work. \nAnd over the last 12 months, our State has lost 50,000 jobs, and 60 \npercent of those are in the high-paying manufacturing sector.\n  In 2000, before the recession began, there were 780,000 uninsured \npeople in Washington state, including 155,000 children. That number has \nsurely grown as the economy has worsened and our population has risen. \nIn fact, just last week the Census Bureau reported that the number of \nuninsured increased for the first time in two years. Sadly, there are \n41.2 million people nationwide without health insurance, 8.5 million of \nwhom are children.\n  The increasing number of uninsured isn't the only problem facing the \nhealth care system. In September, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported \nthe largest increase in health insurance premium costs since 1990, \nwhile the Center for Studying Health System Change found that health \ncare spending has returned to double-digit growth for the first time \nsince that year.\n  The lack of health insurance has very real consequences. We know that \nthe uninsured are four times as likely as the insured to delay or \nforego needed care, and uninsured children are six times as likely as \ninsured children to go without needed medical care. Health insurance \nmatters for kids, and coverage today defrays costs tomorrow.\n  Five years ago, Congress created a new $40 billion state grant \nprogram to provide health insurance to low-income, uninsured children \nwho live in families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not \nenough to afford private insurance. In most states, the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, has been extremely \nsuccessful. Nearly one million children\n\n[[Page S10368]]\n\ngained coverage each year through SCHIP and, by December 2001, 3.5 \nmillion children were enrolled in the program.\n  Unfortunately, however, not all States have been able to participate \nin this success, and perversely, these are the states that had taken \nbold initiatives by expanding their Medicaid programs to cover low-\nincome children at higher levels of poverty. Sadly, the recession and \nhigh unemployment means that the health insurance coverage we do have \nfor children, pregnant women, and low-income individuals is in jeopardy \ndue to State budget crises.\n  Washington State has been a leader in providing health insurance to \nour constituents. We have long provided optional coverage to Medicaid \npopulations and began covering children up to 200 percent of poverty in \n1994, three years before Congress passed SCHIP\n  When SCHIP was enacted in 1997, most States were prohibited from \nusing the new funding for already covered populations. This flaw made \nit difficult for Washington to access the money and essentially \npenalized the few States that had led the nation on expanding coverage \nfor kids. This means that my State only receives the enhanced SCHIP \nmatching dollars for covering kids between 200 and 250 percent of the \nFederal poverty level. Washington has been able to use less than four \npercent of the funding the Federal Government gave us for SCHIP.\n  Today, Washington has the highest unemployment in the country, an \nenormous budget deficit, and may need to cut as many as 150,000 kids \nfrom the Medicaid roles. Because it is penalized by SCHIP rules and \ncannot use funds like other States, Washington State is sending $95 \nmillion back to the Federal treasury or to other States. This defies \ncommon sense, and I do not believe that innovative States should be \npenalized for having expanded coverage to children before the enactment \nof SCHIP.\n  This is why we are introducing the Children's Health Protection and \nEligibility Act. This bill will give States the ability to use SCHIP \nfunds more efficiently to prevent the loss of health care coverage for \nchildren. This bill targets expiring funds to States that otherwise may \nhave to cut health care coverage for kids. States that have made a \ncommitment to insuring children could use expiring SCHIP funds and a \nportion of current SCHIP funds on a short-term basis to maintain access \nto health care coverage for all low-income children in the State. The \nbill also ensures that all states that have demonstrated a commitment \nto providing health care coverage to children can access SCHIP funds in \nthe same manner to support children's health care coverage.\n  First, as my colleagues know, 1998 and 1999 State allotments \n``expired'' at the end of fiscal year 2002 and are scheduled to be \nreturned to the federal treasury. Our bill allows states to keep their \nremaining 1998 and 1999 funds, and use these funds for the for the \npurposes of this legislation.\n  Second, unused SCHIP dollars from the fiscal year 2000 allotment are \ndue to be redistributed at the end of fiscal year 2002 among those \nStates that have spent all of their SCHIP funds. Our bill would allow \nthe retention and redistribution these funds as was done two years ago \nthrough the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and \nProtection Act, P.L. 106-554. However, under our bill, States that had \nan unemployment rate higher than six percent for two consecutive months \nin 2002 would be eligible to keep all of their unspent 2000 SCHIP \nallotment.\n  Third, at State option, for certain Medicaid expenditures, qualifying \nStates would receive the difference between their Medicaid federal \nmatching assistance percentage, or FMAP, and their enhanced SCHIP \nmatching rate. This temporary measure would be paid out of a State's \ncurrent SCHIP allotment to ensure children's health care coverage does \nnot erode as states face enormous budget deficits. States would be able \nto use any remaining funds from fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000 SCHIP \nallotments, plus ten percent of fiscal 2001, 2002, and 2003 allotments.\n  Finally, our bill allows States that have expanded coverage to the \nhighest eligibility levels allowed under SCHIP, and meet certain \nrequirements, to receive the enhanced SCHIP match rate for any kids \nthat had previously been covered above the mandatory level.\n  Children are the leaders of tomorrow; they are the very future of our \ngreat nation. We owe them nothing less than the sum of our energies, \nour talents, and our efforts in providing them a foundation on which to \nbuild happy, healthy and productive lives. During this tough economic \ntime, it is more important than ever to maintain existing health care \ncoverage for children in order to hold down health care costs and to \nkeep children healthy. I urge my colleagues to join us in support of \nthis bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 3093. A bill to develop and deploy technologies to defeat Internet \njamming and censorship; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, over the past seven years, Congressman \nChris Cox and I have teamed up several times on legislation affecting \nthe Internet. The Global Internet Freedom Act that I will introduce \ntoday could be called ``Cox-Wyden V,'' because this is our fifth \ncollaboration. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Kyl in introducing \nthis bill in the Senate.\n  This legislation aims to foster the development and deployment of \ntechnologies to defeat state-sponsored Internet jamming and censorship, \nand in turn, to help unleash the potential of the Internet to promote \nthe causes of freedom and democracy worldwide.\n  This is a time when Americans are acutely focused on security threats \nemanating from sources beyond U.S. borders. The terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11 made plain that ignorance, extremism, and hate abroad can \nhave terrible consequences not just in other countries, but right here \nat home. And the daily drumbeat of debate over Iraq emphasizes that \noppressive foreign regimes can pose serious hazards. The world is truly \ngetting smaller.\n  In the field of information technology, Americans have rightly \nresponded with a renewed emphasis on cybersecurity. The interlinked \ncomputer networks that make up the Internet, and on which American's \ncritical infrastructure increasingly relies, must be secured against \nwould-be cyberterrorists. This is a matter of top importance, and I \nhave sponsored legislation, as Chairman of the Science and Technology \nSubcommittee, to promote research and innovation in this area. It is my \nhope that the Cybersecurity Research and Development Act will be signed \nby the President in the coming weeks.\n  But it is important to remember that the international nature of the \nInternet does not just create new threats. It also presents tremendous \nnew opportunities.\n  Openness, transparency, and the unfettered flow of information have \nalways been the allies of freedom and democracy. Over time, nothing \nerodes oppression and intolerance like the widespread dissemination of \nknowledge and ideas. And technology has often played a key role in this \nprocess. From the printing press to radio, technological advances have \nrevolutionized the spread information and ideas and opened up new \nhorizons for people everywhere. Not surprisingly, the foes of freedom, \nunderstanding the threat these technologies pose, have often responded \nwith such steps as censoring the press, jamming radio broadcasts, and \nputting media outlets under state control.\n  The Internet promises to revolutionize the spread of information yet \nagain. Unlike its predecessor technologies, it offers a truly worldwide \nnetwork that makes geographic distance irrelevant. It enables any \nperson connected to it to exchange ideas quickly and easily with people \nand organizations on the other side of the globe. The quantity and \nvariety of information it permits access to are virtually unlimited.\n  So once again, governments that fear freedom are trying to rein in \nthe technology's potential. They block access to websites. They censor \nwebsites and email. They interrupt Internet search engines when users \ntry explore the ``wrong'' topics. They closely monitor citizens' \nInternet usage and make it known that those who visit the ``wrong'' \nwebsites will be punished. Or\n\n[[Page S10369]]\n\nthey prevent Internet access altogether, by prohibiting ownership of \npersonal computers.\n  For a confirmed example of this, I would simply call attention to the \ninaugural report of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, \nissued just last week, October 2. This report, the product of a \nbipartisan commission with members from the Senate, the House of \nRepresentatives, and the Administration, finds that ``over the last 18 \nmonths, the Chinese government has issued an extensive and still \ngrowing series of regulations restricting Internet content and placing \nmonitoring requirements on industry.'' It goes on to cite accounts of \nthe Chinese government using high-tech software and hardware to \n``block, filter, and hack websites and e-mail.'' Offshore dissident \nwebsites, foreign news websites, search engines, and Voice of America's \nweekly e-mail to China are all subject to being blocked. Internet users\nattempting to access foreign web-\nsites often find themselves redirected\nto Chinese government-approved websites.\n  Other countries, from Cuba to Burma to Tunisia to Vietnam, engage in \nsimilar activity.\n  There are technologies that can help defeat the firewalls and filters \nthat these governments choose to erect. Proxy servers, intermediaries, \n``mirrors,'' and encryption may all have useful applications in this \nregard. But the U.S. Government has done little to promote \ntechnological approaches. This country devotes considerable resources \nto combat the jamming of Voice of America broadcasting abroad. But to \ndate, it has budgeted only about $1 million for technologies to counter \nInternet jamming and censorship.\n  This country can and should do better. The Internet is too important \na communications medium, and its potential as a force for freedom and \ndemocracy is too great, to make a second-rate effort in this area.\n  That is why Senator Kyl and I are introducing the Global Internet \nFreedom Act today. It is time for the U.S. Government to make a serious \ncommitment to support technology that can help keep the Internet open, \navailable, and free of political censorship for people all over the \nworld.\n  This legislation would establish an Office of Global Internet \nFreedom, with the express mission of promoting technology to combat \nstate-sponsored Internet jamming. The office would be based in the \nDepartment of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration, NTIA, to take advantage of NTIA's extensive expertise \nin international telecommunications and Internet issues. Location \nwithin the Department of Commerce will also help ensure close ties with \nAmerican technology companies, whose active involvement will be \nessential for any technology-based effort to succeed. Cooperation with \nthe International Broadcasting Bureau will be indispensable as well, \nand is required in the legislation.\n  Funding for the new office would be authorized at $30 million for \neach of the next two fiscal years. The office would make an annual \nreport to Congress on its activities, and on the extent of state-\nsponsored Internet blocking in different countries around the world.\n  Finally, the bill would express the sense of Congress that the United \nStates should denounce the practice of state-sponsored blocking of \naccess to the Internet, should submit a resolution on the topic to the \nUnited Nations Human Rights Convention, and should deploy technologies \nto address the problem as soon as practicable.\n  As I mentioned at the outset, Representatives Chris Cox and Tom \nLantos have already introduced companion legislation in the House, and \nI strongly applaud them for taking the lead on this issue. Here in the \nSenate, I urge my colleagues to join Senator Kyl and myself in this \nimportant, bipartisan effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3093\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Internet Freedom \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2 FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of \n     association are fundamental characteristics of a free \n     society. The first amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States guarantees that ``Congress shall make no law . \n     . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the \n     right of the people peaceably to assemble.'' These \n     constitutional provisions guarantee the rights of Americans \n     to communicate and associate with one another without \n     restriction, including unfettered communication and \n     association via the Internet. Article 19 of the United \n     Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights explicitly \n     guarantees the freedom to ``receive and impart information \n     and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers''.\n       (2) All people have the right to communicate freely with \n     others, and to have unrestricted access to news and \n     information, on the Internet.\n       (3) With nearly 10 percent of the world's population now \n     online, and more gaining access each day, the Internet stands \n     to become the most powerful engine for democratization and \n     the free exchange of ideas ever invented.\n       (4) Unrestricted access to news and information on the \n     Internet is a check on repressive rule by authoritarian \n     regimes around the world.\n       (5) The governments of Burma, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, the \n     People's Republic of China, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Vietnam, \n     among others, are taking active measures to keep their \n     citizens from freely accessing the Internet and obtaining \n     international political, religious, and economic news and \n     information.\n       (6) Intergovernmental, nongovernmental, and media \n     organizations have reported the widespread and increasing \n     pattern by authoritarian governments to block, jam, and \n     monitor Internet access and content, using technologies such \n     as firewalls, filters, and ``black boxes''. Such jamming and \n     monitoring of individual activity on the Internet includes \n     surveillance of e-mail messages, message boards, and the use \n     of particular words; ``stealth blocking'' individuals from \n     visiting websites; the development of ``black lists'' of \n     users that seek to visit these websites; and the denial of \n     access to the Internet.\n       (7) The Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, as well as \n     hundreds of news sources with an Internet presence, are \n     routinely being jammed by repressive governments.\n       (8) Since the 1940s, the United States has deployed anti-\n     jamming technologies to make Voice of America and other \n     United States Government sponsored broadcasting available to \n     people in nations with governments that seek to block news \n     and information.\n       (9) The United States Government has thus far commenced \n     only modest steps to fund and deploy technologies to defeat \n     Internet censorship. To date, the Voice of America and Radio \n     Free Asia have committed a total of $1,000,000 for technology \n     to counter Internet jamming by the People's Republic of \n     China. This technology, which has been successful in \n     attracting 100,000 electronic hits per day from the People's \n     Republic of China, has been relied upon by Voice of America \n     and Radio Free Asia to ensure access to their programming by \n     citizens of the People's Republic of China, but United States \n     Government financial support for the technology has lapsed. \n     In most other countries there is no meaningful United States \n     support for Internet freedom.\n       (10) The success of United States policy in support of \n     freedom of speech, press, and association requires new \n     initiatives and technologies to defeat totalitarian and \n     authoritarian controls on news and information over the \n     Internet.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to adopt an effective and robust global Internet \n     freedom policy;\n       (2) to establish an office within the National \n     Telecommunications and Information Administration with the \n     sole mission of promoting technological means of countering \n     Internet jamming and blocking by repressive regimes;\n       (3) to expedite the development and deployment of \n     technology to protect Internet freedom around the world;\n       (4) to authorize the commitment of a substantial portion of \n     United States Government resources to the continued \n     development and implementation of technologies to counter the \n     jamming of the Internet;\n       (5) to utilize the expertise of the private sector in the \n     development and implementation of such technologies, so that \n     the many current technologies used commercially for securing \n     business transactions and providing virtual meeting space can \n     be used to promote democracy and freedom; and\n       (6 to bring to bear the pressure of the free world on \n     repressive governments guilty of Internet censorship and the \n     intimidation and persecution of their citizens who use the \n     Internet.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES TO DEFEAT \n                   INTERNET JAMMING AND CENSORSHIP.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Office of Global Internet Freedom.--\n     There is established in the National Telecommunications and \n     Information Administration the Office of Global Internet \n     Freedom (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the \n     ``Office''). The Office shall be\n\n[[Page S10370]]\n\n     headed by a Director who shall develop and implement, in \n     consultation with the International Broadcasting Bureau, a \n     comprehensive global strategy for promoting technology to \n     combat state-sponsored and state-directed Internet jamming \n     and persecution of those who use the Internet.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Office $30,000,000 for each of the \n     fiscal years 2003 and 2004.\n       (c) Corporation of Other Federal Departments and \n     Agencies.--Each department and agency of the United States \n     Government shall cooperate fully with, and assist in the \n     implementation of, the strategy developed by the Office and \n     shall make such resources and information available to the \n     Office as is necessary to the achievement of the purposes of \n     this Act.\n       (d) Report to Congress.--On March 1 following the date of \n     the enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the \n     Director of the Office shall submit to the Congress a report \n     on the status of state interference with Internet use and of \n     efforts by the United States to counter such interference. \n     Each report shall list the countries that pursue policies of \n     Internet censorship, blocking, and other abuses; provide \n     information concerning the government agencies or quasi-\n     governmental organizations that implement Internet \n     censorship; and describe with the greatest particularity \n     practicable the technological means by which such blocking \n     and other abuses are accomplished. In the discretion of the \n     Director, such report may be submitted in both a classified \n     and nonclassified version.\n       (e) Limitation on Authority.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     interpreted to authorize any action by the United States to \n     interfere with foreign national censorship for the purpose of \n     protecting minors from harm, preserving public morality, or \n     assisting with legitimate law enforcement aims.\n\n     SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the United States \n     should--\n       (1) publicly, prominently, and consistently denounce \n     governments that restrict, censor, ban, and block access to \n     information on the Internet;\n       (2) direct the United States Representative to the United \n     Nations to submit a resolution at the next annual meeting of \n     the United Nations Human Rights Commission condemning all \n     governments that practice Internet censorship and deny \n     freedom to access and share information; and\n       (3) deploy, at the earliest practicable date, technologies \n     aimed at defeating state-directed Internet censorship and the \n     persecution of those who use the Internet.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with Senator \nWyden, the Global Internet Freedom Act.\n  The Internet is one of the most powerful tools to promote the \nexchange of ideas and to disseminate information. In that regard, it is \na key component in our efforts to reach populations living under \nundemocratic governments that continue to restrict freedom of speech, \nthe press, and association. Unfortunately, however, many authoritarian \ngovernments including the regimes in the People's Republic of China, \nSaudi Arabia, Syria, Vietnam, Cuba, and North Korea aggressively block \nand censor the Internet, often subjecting to torture and imprisonment \nthose individuals who dare to resist the controls.\n  In Vietnam, for example, the Prime Minister issued a decree in August \n2000 that prohibits individuals from using the Internet ``for the \npurpose of hostile actions against the country or to destabilize \nsecurity, violate morality, or violate other laws and regulations.'' \nThe Communist government owns and controls the sole Internet access \nprovider, which is authorized to monitor the sites that subscribers \nuse. It erects firewalls to block sites it deems politically or \nculturally inappropriate. And it is seeking additional authority to \nmonitor some 4,000 Internet cafes in Vietnam, and hold responsible the \nowners of these cafes for customer use of the Internet.\n  The situation in Syria is no better. Like Vietnam, that country has \nonly one government-run Internet service provider. The Government \nblocks access to Internet sites that contain information deemed \npolitically sensitive including pro-Israel sites and also periodically \nblocks access to servers that provide free e-mail services. In 2000, \nthe Syrian Government which monitors e-mail detained one individual for \nsimply forwarding via e-mail a political cartoon.\n  The Chinese Government is one of the worst offenders. Beijing has \npassed sweeping regulations in the past 2 years prohibiting news and \ncommentary on Internet sites in China that are not state-sanctioned. \nThe Ministry of Information Industry regulates Internet access, and the \nMinistries of Public and State Security monitor its use. According to \nthe State Department's most recent Country Reports on Human Rights \nPractices.\n\n       Despite the continued expansion of the Internet in the \n     country, the Chinese government maintained its efforts to \n     monitor and control content on the Internet. . . . The \n     authorities block access to Web sites they find offensive. \n     Authorities have at times blocked politically sensitive Web \n     sites, including those of dissident groups and some major \n     foreign news organizations, such as the VOA, the Washington \n     Post, the New York Times, and the BBC.\n\n  The U.S.-China Security Review Commission noted in its recent report \nthat China has even convinced American companies like Yahoo! to assist \nin its censorship efforts, and others, like America Online, to leave \nopen the possibility of turning over names, e-mail addresses, or \nrecords of political dissidents if the Chinese Government demands them.\n  Those who attempt to circumvent Internet restrictions in China are \noften subject to harsh punishment. For example, Huang Qi, the operator \nof an Internet site that posted information about missing persons, \nincluding students who disappeared in the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, was \ntried secretly and found guilty of ``subverting state power.'' \nAccording to the State Department, Huang was bound hand and foot and \nbeaten by police while they tried to force him to confess.\n  These are but a few examples of the incredible lengths that \nauthoritarian governments will go to in order to preserve control over \ntheir populations and prevent change. Voice of America, Radio Free \nAsia, Amnesty International, and the National Endowment for Democracy--\njust to name a few--all utilize the Internet to try to provide news, \nspread democratic values, and promote human rights in these countries. \nBut the obstacles they face are great.\n  The U.S. private sector is developing a number of techniques and \ntechnologies to combat Internet blocking. Unfortunately, however, the \nU.S. Government has contributed few resources to assist these efforts \nand to put the new techniques to use. For example, Voice of America and \nRadio Free Asia have budgeted only $1 million for technology to counter \nChinese Government Internet jamming, and that funding has now expired.\n  This is why I am pleased to introduce the Global Internet Freedom \nAct. This bill will take an important step toward promoting Internet \nfreedom throughout the world. Specifically, it establishes, within the \nCommerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration, the Office of Global Internet Freedom. It authorizes \n$30 million per year in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 for this office, \nwhich would be responsible for developing and implementing a \ncomprehensive global strategy to combat state-sponsored Internet \njamming and persecution of Internet users. Additionally, the director \nof the office would be required to submit to Congress an annual report \non U.S. efforts to counter state interference with Internet use.\n  Similar legislation has already been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressmen Cox and Lantos.\n  I cannot stress enough the importance of the Internet in promoting \nthe flow of democratic ideas. If the benefits of the Internet are able \nto reach more and more people around the globe, repressive governments \nwill begin to be challenged by individuals who are freely exchanging \nviews and getting uncensored news and information.\n  The United States should take full advantage of the opportunities \ninherent in worldwide access to the Internet, and should make clear to \nthe international community that fostering Internet freedom is a top \npriority. Creation of an Office of Global Internet Freedom will enable \nus to do just that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Crapo, \n        Mr. Craig, Mr. Burns, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Allard, Mr. Brownback, \n        and Mr. Campbell):\n  S. 3094. A bill to amend the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act \nof 2002 to clarify the rates applicable to marketing assistance loans \nand loan deficiency payments for other oilseeds, dry peas, lentils, and \nsmall chickpeas; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n[[Page S10371]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today along with Senators Roberts, Conrad, \nCrapo, Craig, Burns, Johnson, Allard, Brownback, and Campbell I am \nintroducing legislation to clarify Congressional intent regarding minor \noilseed and pulse crop loan rates in the Farm Security and Rural \nInvestment Act, FSRIA, of 2002. This is a redraft of legislation \nintroduced last July.\n  In June, the United States Department of Agriculture incorrectly \ninterpreted the intent of the new farm bill when the Farm Service \nAgency arbitrarily announced a wide range of minor oilseed loan rates. \nFor some minor oilseed crops, the loan rate increased substantially, \nwhile for others, the rates plunged. A few months later, in early \nSeptember, the Farm Service Agency continued to err when it announced \nthe loan rates for dry peas, lentils and small chickpeas that \ncompletely ignored the instructions laid down by the Statement of \nManagers that accompanied the conference report of the new farm bill.\n  Not once during the farm bill debate was there ever discussion of \nsplitting apart minor oilseed loan rates. In fact, the minor oilseed \nindustry and farmers alike anticipated a county-level increase in loan \nrates from $9.30 to 9.60/cwt. The announcement by the Farm Service \nAgency caught virtually everyone in the agriculture community by \nsurprise.\n  This legislation is intended to correct this misinterpretation of the \nnew farm bill, and to prevent what will certainly be extreme acreage \nshifts among these crops in the coming years should these rates be \nallowed to stand. These acreage shifts will destroy segments of the \nminor oilseed and pulse crop industry that have been painstakingly \ndeveloped over a number of years.\n  For instance, already, users of the oil derived from oil sunflowers \nanticipate supply shortages next year and have indicated they may \nremove sunflower oil from their product mix. Conversely, incentives \ncaused by the much higher confectionery sunflower loan rate could \ndeluge USDA with massive loan forfeitures of low quality confectionery \nsunflowers if farmers simply grow for the loan rate rather than a \nquality crop that has a market.\n  The legislation amends the new farm bill by simply and redundantly \nlisting each minor oilseed crop after the stated loan rate. The \nlegislation reinstates the cramby and sesame seed loan rates that were \neliminated by USDA. The legislation also puts into bill language the \ninstructions that were spelled out in the Statement of Managers \nregarding a single loan rate for all sunflowers and the quality grades \nfor the loan rates for dry peas, lentils and small chickpeas.\n  This legislation should not be needed.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nrequire premarket consultation and approval with respect to genetically \nengineered foods, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould strengthen consumer confidence in the safety of genetically \nengineered foods and genetically engineered animals that may enter the \nfood supply. This bill, known as the Genetically Engineered Foods Act, \nrequires an FDA review of all genetically engineered foods, and \nrequires an environmental review to be conducted as part of the safety \nreview for genetically engineered animals. In addition, the Genetically \nEngineered Foods Act creates a transparent process that will better \ninform and involve the public as decisions are made regarding the \nsafety of all genetically engineered foods and animals.\n  Make no mistake, our country has been blessed with one of the safest \nand most abundant food supplies in the world, but we can always do \nbetter. Genetically engineered foods have become a major part of the \nAmerican food supply in recent years. Many of the foods we consume now \ncontain genetically engineered ingredients such as corn and soy. These \nfoods have been enhanced with important qualities that help farmers \ngrow crops more efficiently. However, their development has raised \nimportant questions about the safety of these foods and the adequacy of \ngovernment oversight.\n  Currently, genetically engineered foods are screened by the Federal \nFood and Drug Administration under a voluntary consultation program. \nThe Genetically Engineered Foods Act will make this review program \nmandatory, and will strengthen government oversight in several \nimportant ways.\n  Mandatory Review: Producers of genetically engineered foods must \nreceive approval from the FDA before introducing their products into \ninterstate\n\n[[Page S10372]]\n\ncommerce. The FDA will scientifically ensure that genetically \nengineered foods are just as safe as comparable food products before \nallowing them on the market.\n  Public Involvement: Scientific studies and other materials submitted \nto the FDA as part of the mandatory review of genetically engineered \nfoods will be made available for public review and comment. Members of \nthe public can submit any new information on genetically engineered \nfoods not previously available to the FDA and request a new review of a \nparticular genetically engineered food product even if that food is \nalready on the market.\n  Testing: The FDA, in conjunction with other Federal agencies, will be \ngiven the authority to conduct scientifically-sound testing to \ndetermine whether genetically engineered foods are inappropriately \nentering the food supply.\n  Communication: The FDA and other Federal agencies will establish a \nregistry of genetically engineered foods for easy access to information \nabout those foods that have been cleared for market. The genetically \nengineered food review process will be fully transparent so that the \npublic has access to all non-confidential information.\n  Environmental Review with respect to Animals: While genetically \nengineered foods such as corn and soy are already part of our food \nsupply, genetically engineered animals will also soon be ready for \nmarket approval. These animals hold much promise for serving as an \nadditional source of food for our nation. However, in the case of \nanimals, we must ensure not only the safety of these products as they \nenter the food supply, but also the safety of these products as they \ncome in contact with the environment.\n  The FDA has a mandatory review process in place that will be used to \nreview the safety of genetically engineered animals before they enter \nthe food supply. However, this bill will provide the FDA will \nadditional oversight authorities to be used during the safety approval \nof genetically engineered animals.\n  Environmental issues have been identified as a major science-based \nconcern associated with genetically engineered animals. Therefore, to \nobtain approval to market a genetically engineered animal, an \nenvironmental assessment must be conducted that analyzes the potential \neffects of the genetically engineered animal on the environment. A plan \nmust also be in place to reduce or eliminate any negative effects. If \nthe environmental assessment is not adequate, approval will not be \ngranted.\n  Transparency: In order to gain the benefits that genetically \nengineered animals can offer as an additional source of food, public \nconfidence must be maintained in the safety of the product. This bill \nwill provide for public involvement in the approval process by \nproviding information to consumers, as well as the opportunity to \nprovide comments. Adding transparency will increase the public's \nunderstanding and confidence in the safety of these animals as they \nenter the food supply.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to strengthen consumer \nconfidence in the safety of genetically engineered foods and \ngenetically engineered animals that may enter the food supply. The \nGenetically Engineered Foods Act can help provide the public with the \nadded assurance that genetically engineered foods and animals are safe \nto produce and consume. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3095\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Genetically Engineered Foods \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) genetically engineered food is rapidly becoming an \n     integral part of domestic and international food supplies;\n       (2) the potential positive effects of genetically \n     engineered foods are enormous;\n       (3) the potential for both anticipated and unanticipated \n     effects exists with genetic engineering of foods;\n       (4) genetically engineered food not approved for human \n     consumption has, in the past, entered the human food supply;\n       (5) environmental issues have been identified as a major \n     science-based concern associated with animal biotechnology;\n       (6) it is essential to maintain--\n       (A) public confidence in--\n       (i) the safety of the food supply; and\n       (ii) the ability of the Federal Government to exercise \n     adequate oversight of genetically engineered foods; and\n       (B) the ability of agricultural producers and other food \n     producers of the United States to market, domestically and \n     internationally, foods that have been genetically engineered;\n       (7) public confidence can best be maintained through \n     careful review and formal determination of the safety of \n     genetically engineered foods, and monitoring of the positive \n     and negative effects of genetically engineered foods as the \n     foods become integrated into the food supply, through a \n     review and monitoring process that--\n       (A) is scientifically sound, open, and transparent;\n       (B) fully involves the general public; and\n       (C) does not subject most genetically engineered foods to \n     the lengthy food additive approval process; and\n       (8) because genetically engineered foods are developed \n     worldwide and imported into the United States, it is \n     imperative that imported genetically engineered food be \n     subject to the same level of oversight as domestic \n     genetically engineered food.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, \nto require ballistics testing of all firearms manufactured and all \nfirearms in custody of Federal agencies; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Schumer, and Senator Reed to introduce ``BLAST'', \nthe Ballistics, Law Assistance, and Safety Technology Act.\n  Never before have the tremendous law enforcement benefits of \nballistics testing been so apparent. We have the technology to \n``fingerprint'' every new gun, and if we were using it today, we would \nbe well on our way toward stopping the serial killer who even now is \npreying on the residents of suburban Washington.\n  Every gun has a unique ``fingerprint'', the distinct patterns left on \nspent casings and bullets after it is fired. What we need to do is \ncreate a comprehensive library of the ballistic images of all new guns \nsold in the U.S. as they come off the assembly line and a library of \nthe images of all guns used in crimes. With those libraries in place, \nnew technology would allow us to compare those ``gun prints'' with \nbullets found at crime scenes, bullets like those found from the \nWashington area sniper's gun.\n  By keeping a computerized image of each new gun's fingerprint, police \ncan compare the microscopic differences in markings left by each gun \nuntil they find a match. Once a match is found, law enforcement can \nbegin tracing that weapon from its original sale to the person who used \nit to commit the crime.\n  Police tell of solving multiple crimes simply by comparing bullets \nand shell casings found at the scene of a crime to a gun seized in a \nseemingly unrelated incident. Let me explain how ballistics testing \nworks and how our measure is crucial to the fight against crime.\n  The only evidence at the scene of a recent brutal homicide in \nMilwaukee was 9 millimeter cartridge casings, there were no other \nclues. But four months later, when a teenage male was arrested on an \nunrelated charge, he was found to be in possession of the firearm that \nhad discharged those casings. Ballistics linked the two cases. \nProsecutors successfully prosecuted three adult suspects for the \nhomicide and convicted the teen in juvenile court.\n\n[[Page S10376]]\n\n  On September 9, 2000, several suspects were arrested in Boston for \nthe illegal possession of three handguns. Each of the guns was test \nfired, and the ballistics information was compared to evidence found at \nother crime scenes. The police quickly found that the three guns were \nused in the commission of 15 felonies in Massachusetts and Rhode \nIsland. This routine arrest for illegal possession of firearms provided \npolice with new leads in the investigation of 15 unsolved crimes. \nWithout the ballistics testing, these crimes would not have been linked \nand might have never been solved.\n  Since the early 1990's, more than 250 crime labs and law enforcement \nagencies in more than 40 states have been operating independent \nballistics systems maintained by either the ATF or the FBI. Together, \nATF's Integrated Ballistics Identification System, ``IBIS'', and the \nFBI's DRUGFIRE system have been responsible for linking 5,700 guns to \ntwo or more crimes where corroborating evidence was otherwise lacking.\n  While success stories are increasingly frequent, the potential of \nballistics testing is still untapped. One way that the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is making ballistics testing more \naccessible to State and local law enforcement is through the \ninstallation of a new network of ballistics imaging machines. The final \nintroduction of the machines across the country is almost complete and, \nonce it is, the computers will be able to access each other and search \nfor a greater number of images. The National Integrated Ballistics \nInformation network, better know as ``NIBIN,'' will permit law \nenforcement in one locality access to information stored in other gun \ncrime databases around the entire country. This will help law \nenforcement exponentially in their efforts to solve gun crimes.\n  But ballistics testing is only as useful as the number of images in \nthe database. Today, almost all jurisdictions are limited to images of \nbullets and cartridge casings that come from guns used in crimes. Our \nbill would dramatically expand the scope of that database by mandating \nthat all guns manufactured or imported would be test fired before being \nplaced into the stream of commerce. The images collected from the test \nfiring would then be collected and accessible to law enforcement, and \nlaw enforcement only, for the purpose of investigating and prosecuting \ngun crimes.\n  As local, State and Federal law enforcement authorities search for \nthe deranged murderer who has been terrorizing the Washington D.C. \nmetropolitan area, they are using ballistics testing to determine \nwhether the bullets and shell casings found at the scene of each crime \nare from the same gun. They can then identify the gun, giving them a \nbetter idea of what, and who, they are looking for in their manhunt. \nHad the gun used in these crimes been subject to a test fire before \nbeing placed in the stream of commerce, authorities would be able to \nidentify the gun based on the bullets and casings. With that \ninformation, law enforcement could then trace the sale and transfer of \nthe firearm in an effort to identify the owner of the gun and solve the \ncrime.\n  Today, police can find out more about a human being than they can \nabout a gun used in a crime. Law enforcement can use DNA testing, take \nfingerprints and blood samples, search a person's health records, \nperuse bank records and credit card statements, obtain phone records \nand get a list of book purchases to link a suspect to a crime. Yet, the \nbullets found at the scene of a crime often cannot be traced back to \nthe gun used because our ballistics images database is not \ncomprehensive. We are unnecessarily limiting law enforcement's ability \nto track the criminals who have used guns in the commission of a crime. \nThe BLAST bill will change all that. by making gun crimes easier to \nsolve, all of us will be safer.\n  The burden on manufacturers is minimal, we authorize funds to \nunderwrite the cost of testing, and the assistance to law enforcement \nis considerable. And don't take my word for it, ask the gun \nmanufacturers and the police. Listen to what Paul Januzzo, the vice-\npresident of the gun manufacturer Glock, said in reference to \nballistics testing, ``our mantra has been that the issue is crime \ncontrol, not gun control . . . it would be two-faced of us not to want \nthis.'' In their agreement with the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, Smith & Wesson agreed to perform ballistics testing on all \nnew handguns. And Ben Wilson, the chief of the firearms section at ATF, \nemphasized the importance of ballistics testing as a investigative \ndevice, ``This [ballistics] allows you literally to find a needle in a \nhaystack.''\n  To be sure, we are sensitive to the notion that law abiding hunters \nand sportsmen need to be protected from any misuse of the ballistics \ndatabase by government. The BLAST bill explicitly prohibits ballistics \ninformation from being used for any purpose unless it is necessary for \nthe investigation of a gun crime.\n  The BLAST bill will enhance a revolutionary new technology that helps \nsolve crime. BLAST is a worthwhile piece of crime control legislation. \nI hope that the Senate will quickly move to pass it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3096\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ballistics, Law Assistance, \n     and Safety Technology Act'' or the ``BLAST Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to increase public safety by assisting law enforcement \n     in solving more gun-related crimes and offering prosecutors \n     evidence to link felons to gun crimes through ballistics \n     technology;\n       (2) to provide for ballistics testing of all new firearms \n     for sale to assist in the identification of firearms used in \n     crimes;\n       (3) to require ballistics testing of all firearms in \n     custody of Federal agencies to assist in the identification \n     of firearms used in crimes; and\n       (4) to add ballistics testing to existing firearms \n     enforcement programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF BALLISTICS.\n\n       Section 921(a) of title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(35) Ballistics.--The term `ballistics' means a \n     comparative analysis of fired bullets and cartridge casings \n     to identify the firearm from which bullets and cartridge \n     casings were discharged, through identification of the unique \n     characteristics that each firearm imprints on bullets and \n     cartridge casings.''.\n\n      SEC. 4.

PRIVACY RIGHTS OF LAW ABIDING CITIZENS.\n\n       Ballistics information of individual guns in any form or \n     database established by this Act may not be used for \n     prosecutorial purposes unless law enforcement officials have \n     a reasonable belief that a crime has been committed and that \n     ballistics information would assist in the investigation of \n     that crime.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague Senator \nKohl in introducing the Ballistics, Law Assistance, and Safety \nTechnology Act. This legislation would build on the success of the \nexisting National Integrated Ballistic Information Network by \nrequiring, for the first time, ballistics testing of all new firearms \nso that law enforcement can more effectively trace bullets or cartridge \ncasings recovered from shootings.\n  As we have learned from the horrific series of sniper shootings in \nthe Washington, D.C. metropolitan area over the past week, law \nenforcement already has the technology to link bullets or casings found \nat separate crime scenes back to a single gun. Every firearm has \nindividual characteristics that are as unique to it as fingerprints are \nto human beings. When a gun is fired, it transfers these \ncharacteristics, in the form of small, sometimes microscopic scratches \nand dents, to the projectiles and cartridge casings fired in it.\n  These unique fingerprints offer a great crime-solving tool for law \nenforcement. When bullets or cartridge casings are found at a crime \nscene, firearms examiners can use the marks for comparison, to \ndetermine whether or not the bullets or casings were expelled from a \nsuspect's firearm. If a firearm is recovered at the scene, a test fire \nof the weapon creates example bullets and cartridge casings for \ncomparison to those found in or near a victim. Bullets and casings \nfound at one crime scene can also be compared with those found at \nanother in order to link the crimes.\n  On the national level, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms recently combined their \nballistics identification programs into the National Integrated \nBallistic Information Network, or NIBIN, which provides for the \ninstallation and networking of automated ballistic imaging equipment in \nstate and local law enforcement agencies across the country. Because \nthousands more pieces of recovered ballistic evidence can be compared \nusing digital automation than would be possible using only manual \ncomparisons, links between otherwise seemingly unrelated crimes are \ndiscovered, and investigative leads are generated for police followup.\n  Ballistics imaging technology is already demonstrating its potential \nto revolutionize criminal investigation. But a major tool for law \nenforcement is missing here, and that is a national ballistics \nfingerprint system that would enable law enforcement to trace crime \nscene evidence back to a suspect. The current NIBIN system provides \nvaluable information on guns that have been used in crime, but unless \nsuch a gun was used in a previous crime for which ballistics evidence \nwas collected and entered, the bullets or casings from the crime scene \nwill find no match in the NIBIN system. No ballistics data are \navailable for most of the estimated 200 million guns in this country, \nand no ballistics fingerprint information is being collected on the \nthree to five million new guns coming into commerce in the United \nStates each year. As a result, law enforcement usually has no way to \ntrace the evidence back to a specific firearm and, ultimately, a \nsuspect.\n  The bill we are introducing today would give law enforcement the \ntools it needs to fight violent crime by requiring gun manufacturers \nand importers to test fire all new firearms, prepare ballistics images \nof the fired bullet and cartridge casings, and make these records \navailable to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for entry in a \ncomputerized database which would be shared with state and local law \nenforcement agencies across the country. The bill also provides $20 \nmillion per year for ATF to help gun manufacturers and importers comply \nwith these requirements by installing or upgrading ballistics equipment \nat or near the places of business of manufacturers and importers.\n  I have no doubt that the National Rifle Association and some in the \ngun industry are going to say that what we are proposing is tantamount \nto establishing a national registry of gun owners. I want to point out \nthat this bill does not require the submission to law enforcement of \nany information beyond the ballistic images produced by test firing the \ngun. The names of any people or businesses that buy guns from federally \nlicensed manufacturers or importers will continue to be kept in the \nfiles of those manufacturers and importers just as the law requires \ntoday. Law enforcement would only have access to this information in \nthe context of a criminal investigation, for example when the evidence \nfrom a crime scene matches a ballistics fingerprint record for a gun \nproduced and sold by a certain manufacturer or importer.\n  We should have taken these steps years ago. If we had, maybe the \nballistic evidence from this week's sniper shootings would match an \nimage in the law enforcement database, and we could save lives by \nidentifying and arresting this cold-blooded killer before he strikes \nagain. But the gun lobby has prevented the creation of an effective \nballistics database by portraying this as a national gun registry. In \nfact, they have been so successful that even though two States, \nMaryland and New York, have created a ballistics fingerprint system for \nall guns sold in those States, the ATF's NIBIN system is not even \nallowed to access those records, nor can law enforcement agencies in \nother States look at the records through the NIBIN network. We will \nnever know how many violent crimes may go unsolved because of this \ninsane restriction on law enforcement's ability to do its job.\n  We have a responsibility to give law enforcement authorities the \ntools they need to quickly track down and bring to justice those who \nwould use firearms to prey on our communities. The bill we are \nintroducing today will do that by taking full advantage of the crime-\nfighting benefits that ballistic imaging and analysis can provide. I \nurge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 3097. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na nonrefundable credit for holders of qualified highway bonds; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the MEGA \nINNOVATE ACT. Maximum Economic Growth for America through Innovative \nFinancing.\n  MEGA Innovate is part of a series of bi-partisan bills that Senator \nCrapo\n\n[[Page S10378]]\n\nand I have introduced that serve as our proposals for TEA 21 \nReauthorization.\n  I was privileged to have been an author of TEA 21, and I look forward \nto working with my fellow Finance Committee members, EPW Committee \nmembers, as well as members on other Committees, as we craft the next \nhighway bill under the leadership of Senator Jeffords.\n  The Finance Committee has held hearings that examined how to provide \nfunding for our highway system. We heard about projections for Trust \nFund income over the next 10 years.\n  As successful as standard financing has been, our transportation \nneeds far outweigh our resources.\n  The MEAGA INNOVATE ACT is about increasing financing to the Highway \nTrust Fund without raising taxes. I am looking at additional means of \nfinancing to supplement the Highway Trust Fund in order to meet our \nNation's transportation needs.\n  In recent years there has been increased recognition, throughout the \ncountry, of the important contribution that a strong highway program \nmakes to our nation's economic prosperity and quality of life.\n  In Montana it is our economy's ``golden egg'' so to speak.\n  As we prepare to reauthorize the highway program next year, a \nfundamental question for the Congress is how to increase the level of \ninvestment, for the benefit of all citizens and all States.\n  Earlier this year Senator Crapo and I introduced bi-partisan \nlegislation with 12 co-sponsors, S. 2678--the MEGA TRUST Act, Maximum \nEconomic Growth for America through the Highway Trust Fund. This bill \nlaid out some ways to increase investment in the highway program \nwithout raising taxes.\n  That legislation would allow the Highway Trust Fund to be properly \ncredited with taxes either paid or foregone with respect to gasohol \nconsumption.\n  It would also reinstate the principle that the highway and mass \ntransit accounts of the Highway Trust Fund should be credited with \ninterest on their respective balances.\n  Those are important reforms that I believe we must enact as soon as \npossible. But we must continue to work to find additional ways to \nenable a stronger level of highway investment, because that investment \nis so important and beneficial to the country.\n  Today I am introducing the MEGA INNOVATE Act--Maximum Economic Growth \nfor America Through Innovative Financing.\n  Under this legislation the Secretary of the Treasury would sell Tax \nCredit Bonds with the proceeds being placed in the Highway Account of \nthe Highway Trust Fund. The Treasury would be responsible for the \nprincipal and interest.\n  The bond proceeds will enable the basic highway program to grow and \nwould help the citizens of every state.\n  Administration of this initiative will be simple. No new structures \nare required. This is a new idea that does not raise taxes, but would \nadvance our national interest in a strong highway program.\n  As this is a new idea for highways, the bill introduces this concept \nat a very modest level, in the range of $3 billion annually in bond \nsales.\n  However, when combined with the provisions of the MEGA TRUST Act, and \nthe continuation of current sources of revenue, this legislation should \nenable the highway program to achieve an obligation level of \napproximately $41 to 42 billion by fiscal year 2009.\n  Many other officials and organizations have shown interest in both \nMEGA TRUST and MEGA INNOVATE, such as the State DOTs of Montana, Idaho, \nNorth and South Dakota and Wyoming. Highway Advocate groups, such as \nthe Highway Users Alliance have also shown support for both bills.\n  I very much appreciate the support of these groups, as well as the \nsupport of others for these two important initiatives.\n  A well-funded highway program is certainly essential to the economic \nfuture of my State of Montana and to other States.\n  So, I look forward to working with my colleagues on the MEGA INNOVATE \nACT, on the MEGA TRUST ACT, and all my other MEGA bills. I also look \nforward to looking at other ways to help our citizens benefit from \nincreased levels of highway investment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Gramm):\n  S. 3098. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nestablish a program for the competitive acquisition of items and \nservices under the medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague \nfrom Texas, Mr. Gramm, to introduce the Medicare Competition \nAcquisition Act of 2002.\n  Today, we are faced with the reality that the Medicare program must \nbe reformed for the 21st Century. In the 37 years since Medicare was \ncreated, several medical advances have been achieved. It is time to \nreap the full benefits of those advances and shift the focus of the \nMedicare program to one that promotes wellness. For that, a \nprescription drug benefit is mandatory. It is the single most important \nreform we can make to Medicare.\n  However, the absence of a prescription drug benefit for America's \nseniors is not the only archaic aspect of the Medicare program. \nCongress has required Medicare to use an arbitrary method of payment \nfor certain items and services, which costs the program and its \nbeneficiaries much more than it should.\n  We think America's seniors deserve better. They deserve to pay fair \nmarket price for high-quality medical products instead of being subject \nto an outdated fee schedule that often reflects unreasonably high \nmarkups above actual cost.\n  The Medicare Competitive Acquisition Act applies high-quality \nstandards and fiscal discipline to the Medicare program. Under this \nbill, Medicare will be able to use the same competitive tools the \nprivate sector has in place to control costs, while maintaining \nbeneficiary access to quality medical supplies and services. This \nproposal was included in President Bush's fiscal year 2003 budget, and \nthe Clinton Administration long advocated this fiscally responsible, \nhigh quality approach to improve Medicare.\n  Several studies by the United States General Accounting Office (GAO) \nand the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, Inspector General \nindicate that the Medicare program and Medicare beneficiaries have been \npaying far too much for some medical equipment and supplies. Take pre-\nfabricated orthotics, for example. The most recent GAO data available \nindicates that the Medicare allowance for a pre-fabricated, self-\nadjusting hand/wrist brace is more than 140% higher than its average \nretail price. For an intermittent urinary catheter, the difference \nbetween the Medicare allowance and the average retail price is 93 \npercent.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that our bill will save \nMedicare $1.8 billion over 5 years and $6.9 billion over 10 years. This \nmeans savings for beneficiaries of $450 million over 5 years and $1.72 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  I was pleased that the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included a \nmodified version of my competitive bidding proposal. It gave HHS the \nauthority to conduct competitive bidding demonstrations for Medicare \nPart B items and services other than physician services. The Medicare \nCompetitive Acquisition Act builds upon successful demonstration \nprojects in Polk County, Florida and San Antonio, Texas by allowing the \nHHS Secretary to establish a competitive bidding system for durable \nmedical equipment and supplies in appropriate parts of the country.\n  I want to thank my colleague from the great State of Georgia, Mr. \nCleland, for his leadership on this issue. The Senator not only helped \nus develop significant beneficiary protections, he worked to ensure \nflexibility for rural areas. Senator Cleland was also instrumental in \nour request for a GAO study on the introduction of new and innovative \nmedical equipment and supplies to the Medicare market.\n  The Medicare Competitive Acquisition Act allows the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, to award contracts to multiple \nsuppliers in each region in order to enhance beneficiary freedom of \nchoice and promote quality among competitors. The number of suppliers \nselected will be based on product demand, the number of suppliers \nselected will be based on product\n\n[[Page S10379]]\n\ndemand, the number of suppliers who bid and the service capacity of \nbidding suppliers. This ensures that the number of suppliers selected \nwill be more than sufficient to supply a given area and that \nbeneficiaries will have access to the products and services they need. \nCMS will have the authority to replace any winning supplier whose \nproduct or service quality deteriorates after the contract is awarded.\n  Small businesses are vital to the success of competitive bidding. In \nboth rounds of the Polk County demonstration, small businesses received \n12 of the 16 willing contracts. In the San Antonio demonstration, they \nreceived 40 of the 51 winning contracts.\n  To ensure a level playing field in the future, we continue small \nbusiness protections implemented under the demonstration by CMS. For \nexample, we give suppliers the option to bid for a portion of an \nexpansion area as opposed to having to bid for an entire expansion \narea. We also allow suppliers to bid for only one or a few product \ncategories in a competitive acquisition area as opposed to having to \nbid for all of the product categories in a particular area.\n  The introduction of competitive bidding into the Medicare program \nwill not only ensure beneficiary access to high-quality medical \nequipment and supplies, it will also reduce fraud and abuse. Suppliers \nwho are under sanctions for fraud and abuse will be ineligible to \nparticipate in the bidding process. On-site reviews will be conducted \nprior to awarding contracts, ensuring that the suppliers are valid and \noperating businesses.\n  Contrary to what the nay-sayers will tell you, competitive bidding \nfor durable medical equipment and suppliers has nothing to do with \ncutting services to beneficiaries or lowering quality standards. It has \neverything to do with improving access to high-quality medical \nequipment for America's seniors in a cost-effective manner.\n  As we search for ways to secure Medicare for the long term, we must \ntake prudent steps to improve the efficiency of the program. \nImplementation of competitive bidding for certain Part B items and \nservices is one way in which Congress can show that we are serious \nabout preserving the integrity of Medicare.\n  I urge the Senate to support this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 3100. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to limit the \nmisuse of social security numbers, to establish criminal penalties for \nsuch misuse, and for other purposes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to strongly speak in favor of the \nlegislation introduced today by Senators Feinstein and Gregg titled \n``The Social Security Number Misuse Prevention Act of 2002,'' indeed, I \nam an original cosponsor of this legislation. If enacted, this bill \nwill reduce the misuse of individuals' Social Security numbers, SSNs, \nby others.\n  As you well know, the Social Security number is increasingly being \nused for purposes not related to the administration of the Social \nSecurity program, because it is, in many cases, our national \nidentification number. As a result, many people can gain access to the \nnumber, and this facilitates its use as a tool for illegal activity, \nmost significantly for the crime of identity theft. In a report issued \nby the Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector \nGeneral, OIG, in May 1999, investigators concluded that most identity-\nrelated crimes involved the fraudulent use of a Social Security number. \nAdditionally, the introduction of the SSN into the arena of electronic \ncommerce has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in SSN misuse.\n  Given the upward trend in SSN misuse, I feel that the Congress must \ntake a fresh look at options for safeguarding Social Security numbers. \nI believe that the bill introduced by Senators Feinstein, Gregg and \nmyself today is an important development in that effort. However, I \nwant to make it clear that this bill will not eliminate all misuse of \nSocial Security numbers. There are many legitimate and necessary uses \nof Social Security numbers and this bill does not prohibit such uses. \nUnfortunately, the absence of such prohibitions makes it easier for \nthose who seek to misuse Social Security numbers.\n  The legislation being introduced today is very similar to a bill, S. \n848, that was introduced by Senators Feinstein and Gregg during the \nfirst session of the 107th Congress. Although S. 848 was referred to \nthe Judiciary Committee, the bill deals extensively with sections of \nthe US Code concerning Social Security numbers, legislative changes to \nthese sections are in the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. \nTherefore, Senator Grassley and I expressed our concern that S. 848 \nshould have been referred to the Finance Committee and we initiated a \nsuccessful unanimous consent request, with the support of Senators \nLeahy, Hatch, Feinstein, and Gregg, to sequentially refer the bill to \nthe Finance Committee. The Judiciary Committee favorably reported the \nbill on May 16th of this year and it was immediately referred to the \nFinance Committee.\n  We at the Finance Committee examined the problems which this \nlegislation tries to address and found potential solutions to these \nproblems to be very complex. In addition, as the legislation could \npotentially affect all of the uses and availabilities of SSNs many \ninterested parties contacted the Finance Committee to express their \nviews.\n  Given the complexity of the issues and the large number of \nstakeholders involved, the Finance Committee decided to schedule a \nsubcommittee hearing in advance of a mark-up in order to better inform \nCommittee members and their staffs about these issues. Special \nattention was focused on the core set of solutions embodied in the bill \nreported by the Judiciary Committee. After a long series of \ndiscussions, we reached agreement with Senator Feinstein on legislation \nwhich makes a number of changes to the reported version of S. 848. We \nthen scheduled a mark-up of this substitute for S. 848, but were unable \nto proceed with the mark-up because some members of the Committee \nplanned to offer amendments that were extraneous and controversial. As \na result, in order to move this legislation forward expeditiously, I \nasked Senators Feinstein and Gregg to introduce the substitute for S. \n848 as new legislation with me as an original cosponsor. Moreover, I \nintend to use procedures in Rule XIV of the Senate to have it placed on \nthe calendar, rather than have it referred to Committee. Once on the \ncalendar, the bill is eligible to be brought up for debate on the \nSenate floor.\n\n       As reported by the Judiciary Committee, S. 848 would: \n     Prohibit the sale, purchase, or display of a Social Security \n     number to the general public without the individual's \n     consent, with exceptions for legitimate business and \n     government activity; prohibit the release of certain key \n     public records to the general public unless Social Security \n     numbers are first redacted, this provision applies only to \n     records created after the bill is enacted; require Social \n     Security numbers to be removed from government checks, \n     drivers' licenses, and motor vehicle registrations; prohibit \n     the employment of prisoners in any capacity that would give \n     them access to Social Security numbers; make it a crime to \n     obtain an SSN for the purpose of locating or identifying a \n     person with the intent to physically harm that person; give \n     consumers the right to refuse to give out their Social \n     Security numbers when purchasing a good or service from a \n     commercial entity, unless the entity has a legitimate need as \n     specified in the law; and create new civil monetary \n     penalties, criminal penalties, and civil actions to help \n     prevent misuse of Social Security numbers; requires all new \n     credit card payment processing machines to truncate the \n     credit card account numbers to the last five digits on the \n     printed receipt.\n       The substitute for S. 848 that is being introduced today \n     retains the basic structure and objectives of the Judiciary \n     Committee-reported bill, but makes several substantive \n     changes that improve the bill. The substitute bill: makes \n     clear that it is permissible to sell, purchase or display \n     Social Security numbers for any legitimate use required, \n     authorized or excepted by any Federal law. Stops new public \n     records containing Social Security numbers from being posted \n     on the Internet and calls for a study by the General \n     Accounting Office of issues pertaining to the display of \n     Social Security numbers on any public records. Permits State \n     Attorneys General to enforce the new ``right to refuse'' to \n     provide a Social Security number, but prohibits class action \n     lawsuits to enforce this new ``right.'' Sunsets the ``right \n     to refuse'' after six years, and calls for a report by the \n     Attorney General, six months after the sunset regarding the \n     effectiveness of this ``right to refuse'' and whether it \n     should be reauthorized.\n\n  To conclude, I think that the introduction of this revised version of \nS. 848 and the placement of it on the calendar are two very important \nsteps in our fight to reduce the misuse of Social Security numbers and \nreduce the theft of\n\n[[Page S10380]]\n\nidentities. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Hatch and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 3101. A bill to amend title IV of the Missing Children's \nAssistance Act to provide for increased funding for the National Center \nfor Missing and Exploited Children, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Missing \nChildren's Assistance Act of 2002, which doubles the funding for the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children and reauthorizes the \nCenter through fiscal year 2006. I am pleased to have Senators Hatch \nand Biden as cosponsors.\n  Due to tragic circumstances, the importance of the National Center \nfor Missing and Exploited Children, ``NCMEC'', has become even more \npronounced over the past year. We have seen repeated media coverage of \nmissing children from every corner of our nation, and parents and \nchildren alike have slept less easily. As a father and grandfather, I \nknow that an abducted child is every parent's or grandparent's worst \nnightmare.\n  The Justice Department estimates that between 3,000 and 4,000 \nchildren are taken by strangers every year. This legislation will \nstrengthen our efforts to return those children to their homes, and \nrelieve their parents of unimaginable grief.\n  The Center for Missing and Exploited Children assists parents, \nchildren, law enforcement, schools, and the community in their efforts \nto recover missing children. The professionals at NCMEC have \ndisturbingly busy jobs, they have worked on more than 73,000 cases of \nmissing and exploited children since NCMEC's founding in 1984, helping \nto recover more than 48,000 of them. They also raise awareness about \npreventing child abduction, molestation, and sexual exploitation.\n  As part of its mission, NCMEC runs: 1. a 24-hour telephone hotline to \ntake reports about missing children and clues that might lead to their \nrecovery, 2. a national child pornography tipline, and 3. a program \nthat assists families in the reunification process. NCMEC also helps \nrunaway children, including through attempts to reduce child \nprostitution.\n  NCMEC manages to do all of this good work with only a $10 million \nauthorization, which expires after fiscal year 2003. We should act now \nboth to extend its authorization and provide additional funds so that \nit can continue to help keep children safe and families intact around \nthe nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 3102. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to clarify \nand reaffirm State and local authority to regulate the placement, \nconstruction, and modification of broadcast transmission facilities, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 3103. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to clarify \nand reaffirm State and local authority to regulate the placement, \nconstruction, and modification of wireless services facilities, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer two pieces of \nlegislation that would close a loophole that allows Federal regulators \nto overrule local officials on the building of cellular and broadcast \ntowers. I am proud to be joined by Senator Jeffords, and Senator Murray \nin introducing legislation that will return decision-making power on \nthe siting of towers to local communities.\n  The 1996 Telecommunications Act, which I opposed, contained a \nprovision that allowed the Federal Communications Commission to preempt \nthe decisions of local authorities. Over the last five years, a small \nloophole in the 1996 Act has spurred David versus Goliath battles \nacross the country. Small communities that pride themselves in deciding \nwhat their towns will look like, now have few options when they try to \nstop or even negotiate a different site for broadcast or cellular \ntowers. In Vermont, we have had several communities, Shelburne, Bethel, \nand Charlotte, run directly into this problem. What used to be their \nright to decide these decisions under zoning laws was up-ended.\n  These communities understand that there will be new towers. Demand \nfor wireless services has skyrocketed over the last few years. The \nmountains and hills of Vermont make many Vermonters joke that cell \nphones are more useful as paper weights than as a way to talk with \nfriends and family. However, Vermonters and people across the country \ndo not believe that we have to sacrifice our scenic views and \nresidential areas to ensure wireless coverage.\n  As a Vermonter, I do not want to wake up ten years from now and see \nmy State turned into a pincushion of antennas and towers. That is why I \nam introducing these bills today. In a way, these bills are the \nculmination of a long battle with the Federal Communications Commission \nand in the courts to protect local authority.\n  In 1997, the Federal Communications Commission seized on the \nlegislative loophole and proposed an expansive new rule to prevent \nState and local zoning laws from regulating the placement of cell and \nbroadcast towers on the basis of environmental considerations, aviation \nsafety, or other locally-determined matters. I fought this proposed \nrule and was joined by many Vermonters, Governor Dean, the Vermont \nEnvironmental Board, mayors, zoning officials and others. I also joined \nwith many Vermonters and the rest of the Vermont Congressional \nDelegation to file an amicus brief in the Supreme Court, arguing that \nthe preemption of local power to issue building permits was a clear \nviolation of the 10th Amendment.\n  Unfortunately, that petition failed and now I am introducing \nlegislation to fix a problem Congress created. The preemption of local \nauthority should never have happened. Health, safety, and local land \nuse issues should be left in the hands of those who know these issues \nbest and can find a way to balance the needs of their community--the \nlocal zoning authorities.\n  In Vermont, we actually have a very well-tested and successful way of \nfinding a balance between protecting the environment, the health and \nsafety of Vermonters, and meeting economic demands. It's called Act \n250. It was adopted over three decades ago when Vermonters realized \nthat our cherished hillsides and New England towns could be overrun \nwith homes. Now, the same realization has occurred with cell and \nbroadcast towers.\n  My bill will not prohibit new towers. It will simply let local \nofficials use their state and local protections, like Act 250, find the \nbest solution for their community.\n  I think that many of my colleagues would agree that it is not too \nmuch to ask that telecommunication companies follow the zoning laws \nthat apply to everyone else.\n  In fact, we already have ways to meet the needs of telecommunication \ncompanies and communities. There are other viable alterative \ncommunication technologies to massive towers. I have in the past \ndiscussed how PCS-Over-Cable and PCS-Over-Fiber technologies can \nprovide digital cellular service using small antennas, eliminating the \nneed for large towers. These small antennas can be attached to an \nexisting telephone pole or lamp post. Not only is this technology more \naesthetically pleasing, but because the companies do not need to buy \nland for these antennas, these delivery mechanisms are cheaper as well. \nWe should allow local government to require the usage of these less \nintrusive technologies,\n  This is ultimately a very simple issue. It's an issue of local \ncontrol. I believe that it is local authorities, not Federal \nregulators, who should determine when and where these structures are \nbuilt. I urge my fellow Senators to join me in supporting this \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of these bills and \ntwo section-by-section analyses be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3102\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S10381]]\n\n     SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Local Control of Broadcast \n     Towers Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The placement, construction, and modification of \n     broadcast transmission facilities near residential \n     communities and facilities such as schools can greatly reduce \n     the value of residential properties, destroy the views from \n     properties, produce radio frequency interference, raise \n     concerns about potential long-term health effects of such \n     facilities, and reduce substantially the desire to live in \n     the areas of such facilities.\n       (2) States and local governments have traditionally \n     regulated development and should be able to exercise control \n     over the placement, construction, and modification of \n     broadcast transmission facilities through the use of zoning \n     and other land use regulations relating to the protection of \n     the environment, public health and safety, and the general \n     welfare of the community and the public.\n       (3) The Federal Communications Commission establishes \n     policies to govern interstate and international \n     communications by television, radio, wire, satellite and \n     cable. The Commission ensures compliance of such activities \n     with applicable Federal laws, including the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the National Historic \n     Preservation Act, in its decision-making on such activities.\n       (4) The Commission defers to State and local authorities \n     which regulate the placement, construction, and modification \n     of broadcast transmission facilities through the use of \n     zoning, construction and building, and environmental and \n     safety regulations in order to protect the environment and \n     the health, safety, and general welfare of communities and \n     the public.\n       (5) On August 19, 1997, the Commission issued a proposed \n     rule, MM Docket No. 97-182, which would preempt the \n     application of most State and local zoning, environmental, \n     construction and building, and other regulations affecting \n     the placement, construction, and modification of broadcast \n     transmission facilities.\n       (6) The telecommunications industry and its experts should \n     be expected to have access to the best and most recent \n     technical information and should therefore be held to the \n     highest standards in terms of their representations, \n     assertions, and promises to governmental authorities.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to confirm that \n     State and local governments are the appropriate entities--\n       (1) to regulate the placement, construction, and \n     modification of broadcast transmission facilities consistent \n     with State and local zoning, construction and building, \n     environmental, and land use regulations;\n       (2) to regulate the placement, construction, and \n     modification of broadcast transmission facilities so that \n     their placement, construction, or modification will not \n     interfere with the safe and efficient use of public airspace \n     or otherwise compromise or endanger the health, safety, and \n     general welfare of the public; and\n       (3) to hold accountable applicants for permits for the \n     placement, construction, or modification of broadcast \n     transmission facilities, and providers of services using such \n     facilities, for the truthfulness and accuracy of \n     representations and statements placed in the record of \n     hearings for such permits, licenses, or approvals.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON ADOPTION OF RULE REGARDING PREEMPTION \n                   OF STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER BROADCAST \n                   TRANSMISSION FACILITIES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Federal \n     Communications Commission shall not adopt as a final rule or \n     otherwise directly or indirectly implement any portion of the \n     proposed rule set forth in ``Preemption of State and Local \n     Zoning and Land Use Restrictions on Siting, Placement and \n     Construction of Broadcast Station Transmission Facilities'', \n     MM Docket No. 97-182, released August 19, 1997.\n\n     SEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       The subtitle may be cited as the ``Local Control of \n     Broadcast Towers Act.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       The bill finds that as the placement of broadcast towers or \n     other broadcast structures (heretofore referred to as \n     ``broadcast transmission facilities'') can reduce property \n     values, create radio frequency interference, and raise \n     potential long-term health concerns. It also finds that state \n     and local authorities should have the same control to \n     regulate the placement of broadcast transmission facilities \n     as they would with any other type of construction. The \n     purpose of the bill is to reinstate the right of state and \n     local governments to regulate the placement, construction, \n     and modification of these facilities.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON ADOPTION OF RULE REGARDING PREEMPTION \n                   OF STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER BROADCAST \n                   TRANSMISSION FACILITIES.\n\n       Section 3 prohibits the Federal Communications Commission \n     (FCC) from implementing ``Preemption of State and Local \n     Zoning and Land Use Restrictions on Siting, Placement and \n     Construction of Broadcast Station Transmission Facilities.'' \n     This rule prevents state and local governments from \n     regulating the construction or modification of broadcast \n     transmission facilities.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND \n                   MODIFICATION OF BROADCAST TRANSMISSION \n                   FACILITIES.\n\n       Section 4 adds a new section to Part I of title III. It \n     gives state and local governments the power to deny \n     applications to place, construct, or modify broadcast \n     transmission facilities on the basis that less intrusive \n     technologies are available to provide comparable service. \n     Denials can be issued for reasons of aesthetics, \n     environmental impact, radio frequency interference, or \n     radiation emissions. Burden of proof lies with the applicant.\n       Section 4(b) also stipulates that state and local \n     governments are empowered to regulate the location, height, \n     or modification of broadcast transmission facilities to \n     reduce the effects of radio interference. State and local \n     governments may also require environmental, biological, and \n     health studies, engineering studies, or other comparable \n     documentation from any person seeking to build or modify a \n     broadcast transmission facility. In addition, state and local \n     governments may require documentation of compliance with any \n     applicable Federal, State, or local regulation regarding \n     aviation safety standards. Failure to provide such \n     documentation or studies is grounds for a denial to construct \n     or modify a facility.\n       Section 4(e) defines broadcast transmission facilities.\n\n[[Page S10382]]\n\n                                S. 3103\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Local Control of Cellular \n     Towers Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The placement, construction, and modification of \n     personal wireless services facilities (also known as wireless \n     facilities) near residential communities and facilities such \n     as schools can greatly reduce the value of residential \n     properties, destroy the views from properties, produce radio \n     frequency interference, raise concerns about potential long-\n     term health effects of such facilities, and reduce \n     substantially the desire to live in the areas of such \n     facilities.\n       (2) States and local governments have traditionally \n     regulated development and should be able to exercise control \n     over the placement, construction, and modification of \n     wireless facilities through the use of zoning and other land \n     use regulations relating to the protection of the \n     environment, public health and safety, and the general \n     welfare of the community and the public.\n       (3) The Federal Communications Commission establishes \n     policies to govern interstate and international \n     communications by television, radio, wire, satellite and \n     cable. The Commission ensures the compliance of such \n     activities with a variety of Federal laws, including the \n     National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the National \n     Historic Preservation Act, in its decision-making on such \n     activities.\n       (4) Under section 332(c)(7)(A) of the Communications Act of \n     1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)(A)), the Commission defers to State \n     and local authorities that regulate the placement, \n     construction, and modification of wireless facilities through \n     the use of zoning and other land use regulations.\n       (5) Alternative technologies for the placement, \n     construction, and modification of wireless facilities may \n     meet the needs of a wireless services provider in a less \n     intrusive manner than the technologies proposed by the \n     wireless services provider, including the use of small towers \n     that do not require blinking aircraft safety lights, break \n     skylines, or protrude above tree canopies.\n       (6) It is in the interest of the Nation that the \n     requirements of the Commission with respect to the \n     application of State and local ordinances to the placement, \n     construction and modification of wireless facilities (for \n     example WT Docket No. 97-192, ET Docket No. 93-62, RM-8577, \n     and FCC 97-303, 62 F.R. 47960) be modified so as--\n       (A) to permit State and local governments to exercise their \n     zoning and other land use authorities to regulate the \n     placement, construction, and modification of such facilities; \n     and\n       (B) to place the burden of proof in civil actions, and in \n     actions before the Commission and State and local authorities \n     relating to the placement, construction, and modification of \n     such facilities, on the person that seeks to place, \n     construct, or modify such facilities.\n       (7) PCS-Over-Cable, PCS-Over-Fiber Optic, and satellite \n     telecommunications systems, including Low-Earth Orbit \n     satellites, offer a significant opportunity to provide so-\n     called ``911'' emergency telephone service throughout much of \n     the United States without unduly intruding into or effecting \n     the environment, public health and safety, and the general \n     welfare of the community and the public.\n       (8) The Federal Aviation Administration must rely upon \n     State and local governments to regulate the placement, \n     construction, and modification of telecommunications \n     facilities near airports or high-volume air traffic areas \n     such as corridors of airspace or commonly used flyways. The \n     proposed rules of the Commission to preempt State and local \n     zoning and other land-use regulations for the siting of such \n     facilities will have a serious negative impact on aviation \n     safety, airport capacity and investment, the efficient use of \n     navigable airspace, public health and safety, and the general \n     welfare of the community and the public.\n       (9) The telecommunications industry and its experts should \n     be expected to have access to the best and most recent \n     technical information and should therefore be held to the \n     highest standards in terms of their representations, \n     assertions, and promises to governmental authorities.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To repeal certain limitations on State and local \n     authority regarding the placement, construction, and \n     modification of personal wireless services facilities under \n     section 332(c)(7) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 332(c)(7)).\n       (2) To permit State and local governments--\n       (A) to regulate the placement, construction, or \n     modification of personal wireless services facilities with \n     respect to their impacts on land use, including radio \n     frequency interference and radio frequency radiation, in \n     order to protect the environment, public health and safety, \n     and the general welfare of the community and the public;\n       (B) to regulate the placement, construction, and \n     modification of personal wireless services facilities so that \n     they will not interfere with the safe and efficient use of \n     public airspace or otherwise compromise or endanger the \n     public health and safety and the general welfare of the \n     community and the public; and\n       (C) to hold accountable applicants for permits for the \n     placement, construction, or modification of personal wireless \n     services facilities, and providers of services using such \n     facilities, for the truthfulness and accuracy of \n     representations and statements placed in the record of \n     hearings for permits, licenses, or approvals for such \n     facilities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       The subtitle may be cited as the ``Local Control of \n     Cellular Towers Act.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       The bill finds that as the placement of cellular towers can \n     reduce property values, create radio frequency interference, \n     and raise potential long-term health concerns. It also finds \n     that state and local authorities should have the same control \n     to regulate the placement of cellular facilities as they \n     would with any other type of construction. The purpose of the \n     bill is to reinstate the right of state and local governments \n     to regulate the placement, construction, and modification of \n     these facilities.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT, \n                   CONSTRUCTION, AND MODIFICATION OF PERSONAL \n                   WIRELESS SERVICES FACILITIES.\n\n       This section of the bill amends title 47 of the U.S. Code.\n       Section 3(a) strikes 47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7), clause iv, which \n     prevented state and local governments from regulating the \n     placement, construction, or modification of personal wireless \n     service facilities on the basis of environmental effects of \n     radio frequency emissions. Clause v of the same section of \n     the Code is amended to allow States to determine the timeline \n     for any appeal of a State or local decision that adversely \n     affects a personal wireless service provider. A personal \n     wireless service provider is no longer allowed to make a \n     further appeal to the Federal Communications Commission \n     (FCC). Furthermore, the bill clarifies that the party that \n     wishes to build a personal wireless service facility bears \n     the burden of proof in any appeal of state or local law.\n       Section 3(b) prohibits the FCC from implementing \n     ``Procedures for Reviewing Requests for Relief from State and \n     Local Regulation Pursuant to Section 332(c)(7)(B)(v).'' This \n     rule stipulated the procedures for appealing state and local \n     regulations to the FCC.\n       Section 3(c) adds a new subparagraph (C) to Section \n     332(c)(7) to give State and local governments the power to \n     deny applications to place, construct, or modify personal \n     wireless service facilities on the basis that less intrusive \n     technologies are available that provide comparable service. \n     Denials can be issued for reasons of aesthetics, \n     environmental impact, radio frequency interference, or \n     radiation emissions.\n       Section 3(c) also stipulates that state and local \n     governments are empowered to regulate the location, height, \n     or modification of personal wireless service facilities to \n     reduce the effects of radio interference. State and local \n     governments may also require environmental, biological, and \n     health studies, engineering studies, or other comparable \n     documentation from any person seeking to build or modify a \n     personal wireless service facility. In addition, state and \n     local governments may require documentation of compliance \n     with any applicable Federal, State, or local regulation \n     regarding aviation safety standards. Failure to provide such \n     documentation or studies is grounds for a denial to construct \n     or modify a facility.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to rise today to express my \nsupport for the Local Control of Cellular Towers Bill, as well as the \nLocal Control of Broadcast Towers Bill. I am pleased to be a cosponsor \nof these two pieces of legislation and commend my colleague from \nVermont, Senator Leahy, for his continued work on this issue.\n  The 1996 Telecommunications Act preempts State and local zoning laws, \ntransferring jurisdiction away from State and local authorities to the \nFederal government. The legislation that we are introducing today would \nreturn that jurisdiction to the State and local authorities that are \nbest equipped to make decisions regarding the placement and \nconstruction of cellular and broadcast towers.\n  In Vermont, new development and construction is governed by Act 250, \nan environmental land use law specifically written to control and \nmanage development, while maintaining a balance between environmental \nprotection and economic growth. Act 250 maintains this equilibrium by \nplacing the permitting rights in the hands of local environmental \nreview boards with appeal rights to the Vermont Environmental Board. \nAct 250 is therefore administered by men and women who are directly \ninvolved in their communities and thoroughly familiar with local \nconcerns.\n  The state of Vermont established Act 250 in response to a period of \nunchecked development that began in the 1960's. As the Attorney General \nfor the state at the time, I was one of the primary drafters of the \nenvironmental land use law. Since 1969, Act 250 has protected our \nenvironment, managed development, and provided a forum for neighbors, \nmunicipalities and other interest groups to voice their concerns about \nnew development. I see no reason why the construction of cellular and \nbroadcast towers should not be governed by Act 250 as well, and I \nremain hopeful that these two bills will reverse what the 1996 Act set \nforth.\n  Although I recognize the importance of building a sound and \nfunctional wireless network, I urge Congress to allow states and local \ncommunities to build that network so the negative impacts of tower \nconstruction are kept to a minimum. Among Vermont's greatest assets are \nits mountain ranges and beautiful views. Giving local communities \nauthority over tower construction and placement is a step towards \npreserving and protecting those assets.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 3104.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \ngrants for the operation of enhanced mosquito control programs to \nprevent and control mosquito-borne diseases; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n[[Page S10384]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``West Nile \nVirus and Arboviral Disease Act''--a bill to help strengthen our public \nhealth system and improved research so that we can better respond to \nWest Nile virus and other arboviruses. I want to thank Senators Dodd, \nSantorum, Bayh, Cochran, and DeWine for their work in helping craft \nthis important legislation.\n  This year, nearly 3000 Americans have been diagnosed with West Nile \nVirus, WNV. At least 146 have died. While this virus is transmitted to \nhumans primarily through migratory birds and mosquitoes, recent \nevidence strongly suggests that WNV can be transmitted through blood \ntransfusions, organ donations, and possibly even breast milk. Further, \nthe latest studies indicate that some patients may experience polio-\nlike symptoms as a result of WNV infection.\n  WNV first appeared in North America in 1999 with reports of \nencephalitis in birds, humans and horses. Prior to this summer, there \nhad been only 149 cases and 18 deaths from this virus. Now, WNV has \nspread as far south as Florida and as far west as California, \nencompassing areas with warmer climates that will allow a year-round \ntransmission cycle. In three years, we have lost the opportunity to \ncontain the disease to the northeastern region of the United States, \nwhere mosquitos do not breed year-round. As a result, many more people \nwill die and become ill.\n  Clearly, the increasing spread of the disease and these new findings \nrequire an enhanced response at the Federal level. We must do more to \nsupport State and local public health efforts to combat the spread of \nWest Nile. And we must also intensify research at the federal level to \nbetter understand the etiology of the virus, develop improved abatement \ntools, and prevent the spread of the illness.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, has published \nnational guidelines for surveillance, prevention and control of WNV. \nCDC also developed a national electronic surveillance system, ArboNET, \nto track West Nile in humans, birds, mosquitoes, horses, and other \nanimals. However, the data available to the ArboNET system likely \nunderestimates actual geographic distribution of WNV transmission in \nthe United States because the data are provided by up to 54 ArboNet by \nlocal health unit surveillance efforts which vary according to capacity \nand ability. We need to do more to strengthen the capacity of those \nsurveillance efforts. One only needs to examine the map of the spread \nof WNV to determine that there may be gaps in our surveillance when \nsome States, like Kansas and West Virginia, are surrounded by other \nstates with similar arbovirus patterns but still not indicating the \npresence of human disease. One of the peculiarities of great \nsurveillance systems is the increased incidence of disease, simply \nbecause better information is being collected.\n\n  Although strengthening our surveillance and response capabilities \nwill help, we must also do more to increase the number of appropriately \ntrained entomologists. There is clearly a need for more individuals who \ncan understand the disease vectors, identify their breeding areas, and \ntake action to eliminate the mosquito population before WNV season.\n  In response to these obvious deficiencies, this legislation \nestablishes a temporary program for the containment of WNV and related \narboviral diseases. Through this grant program, which is authorized for \ntwo years, but can be extended by the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices for an additional year, the CDC is authorized to make grants \nto states. States can use the funds to develop, implement, and evaluate \ncomprehensive, community-based mosquito control plans. Additionally, \nstates can work with local communities to develop and implement \nprograms to support longer term prevention and control efforts, \nincluding training to develop a competent public health workforce. \nFinally, States are encouraged to work with local health entities to \ndevelop prevention and control programs.\n  As part of the requirement under the grant program, the CDC is \ncharged with developing, in consultation with public and private health \nand mosquito control organizations, guidelines for State and local \ncommunities for a sustainable, locally managed, integrated mosquito \ncontrol programs, as well as otherwise increasing CDC's capacity to \nprovide technical assistance.\n  We also need to learn more about this virus and how it is spread. To \ncombat WNV, we must develop: 1. improved insecticides; 2. rapid tests \nfor the presence of WNV in human blood products; 3. pathogen \ninactivation technologies; and 4. additional methodologies to contain \nthe spread of WNV or other related arboviruses, including the \ndevelopment of an appropriate WNV vaccine for humans and other mammals \nand better antiviral treatments.\n  In 1972, the FDA banned the general use of the pesticide DDT, ending \nnearly three decades of application. During which time, the once-\npopular chemical was used to control insect pests on crop and forest \nlands, around homes and gardens, and for industrial and commercial \npurposes. DDT was developed as the first of the modern insecticides \nearly in World War II. It was initially used with great effect to \ncombat malaria, typhus, and the other insect-borne human diseases among \nboth military and civilian populations. A persistent, broad-spectrum \ncompound often termed the ``miracle'' pesticide, DDT came into wide \nagricultural and commercial usage in this country in the late 1940s, \nbut was banned by the FDA when the Director at that time determined \nthat the continued massive use of DDT posed unacceptable risks of the \nenvironment and potential harm to human health. Since that time, we \nhave not developed a replacement for DDT. We have become complacent, \nassuming that there would be no need to continue to reducing the insect \npopulation. We can no longer be complacent.\n  We have not yet developed a rapid diagnostic WNV test for blood \nproducts. There are two types of tests available, a serologic test or a \npolymerase chain reaction, PCR, test, but only the PCR test would be \nfeasible for screening purposes. Experts have suggested that a new PCR \ntest could be available within 18 months if the appropriate market \nincentives were in place. We need to determine the best way to expedite \nthe development of this test.\n  Pathogen inactivation techniques could be used to purify blood \nsamples by removing all DNA and RNA particles from the blood. However, \nwe have not yet performed a larger assessment to determine the overall \nhealth benefit of this technique. Because the process relies on adding \nadditional chemicals to the blood product, those chemicals, or \nderivatives thereof, may have a particular health effect. Therefore, \ngiven that there will be other emerging infectious diseases in our \nfuture, we need to develop a proactive, not reactive, mode to dealing \nwith those infections.\n  Currently, scientists have developed an equine vaccine for WNV, but \nthere is no human vaccine. Given the limited vaccine options, many \nveterinarians are even using the equine vaccine for avians and other \nmammals. Therefore, we need to focus efforts on developing vaccines for \na host of susceptible mammals.\n  In conducting that research, given the nature of all arboviruses and \nthe fact that WNV also infects a host of mammals, we need to build more \nbridges between veterinary health and public health. Already, avian \nexperts are asked to assist our public health experts to help identify \nhow bird migration would affect the spread of WNV. Additionally, any \nnew vaccine or diagnostic test for WNV may have broader applicability \nto the host of other mammals affected by the virus.\n  Given the multitude of federal agencies that should be involved with \nrelevant research, the legislation charges the President with \nexpanding, intensifying, and enhancing research related to the \nidentification or the development of insecticides, the development of a \nscreening tools for WNV in both blood and organs, the development of \npathogen inactivation technologies, technologies that safety and cost-\neffectively remove RNA and DNA from blood, and the development of \nadditional methodologies for containing the spread of West Nile Virus \nand other related arboviruses. This research program is authorized for \nfive years.\n  More should be done to continuously support the development of a \ncapable public health infrastructure and increased response \ncoordination at all levels. At the Federal level, we have\n\n[[Page S10385]]\n\nsignificantly increased our resources for these purpose by providing \nnearly $1 billion for bioterrorism-related activities, activities which \nshould focus on ``dual use'' capabilities to strengthen our ability to \nrespond to all infectious diseases. However, we need to ensure a \ncontinued investment if we are to stabilize our public health \ninfrastructure and continue to focus on means by which to increase \ncoordination.\n  Again, I want to commend Senators Dodd, Santorum, Bayh, Cochran, and \nDeWine for their contributions to the development of this legislation. \nIt has been an honor and a pleasure to work with my distinguished \ncolleagues on this bill, and I look forward to continuing to working \nwith them and others to find better solutions to combating WNV.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 3106. A bill to amend the Denali Commission Act of 1998 to \nestablish the Denali transportation system in the State of Alaska; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to establish \nthe Denali Transportation System for my State of Alaska. I am pleased \nto be joined by the senior Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, on \nthis important legislation. I understand that a companion measure is to \nbe introduced in the House.\n  This bill authorizes the Secrtary of Transportation to establish a \nprogram to fund the costs of construction of the Denali Transportation \nSystem, at a level of $440 million per year for the next 5 years. It is \npatterned after similar statutory language establishing the Appalachian \nCommission, which provides for transportation construction in that area \nof the nation.\n  As my colleagues are aware, Alaska lags far behind the rest of the \ncountry in its transportation infrastructure. Our road system is still \nin its infancy and our highway system reaches only the major cities of \nthe State.\n  As we all know, the key to a thriving and self-sufficient economy for \nany State or Nation is commerce. But commerce itself cannot thrive \nwithout transportation. We must be able to travel from one place to \nanother, to move goods from one place to another, to harvest our \nresources and craft our merchandise and get them both to market.\n  The Denali transportation system will provide benefits far \noutweighing its costs, not only to Alaska but to the Nation. It will \nmake it possible to provide Alaska's valuable resources to those who \nneed them. It will allow significant savings for residents of Alaska's \nremote areas, who today must pay the nation's highest prices for even \nbasic things that you and I take for granted, for food, for energy to \nheat our houses, for access to a doctor's care when we need it, and \naccess to reasonable educational opportunities for our children.\n  None of these things are universally available in Alaska as they are \nin other States. We have children who must board an aircraft every day, \nat least when the weather permits, just to be flown across a river that \nseparates them from their only area school. We have villages where fuel \narrives barrel by barrel, because there is no other way to get it \nthere. We have communities where butter, and eggs, and milk, and fresh \nvegetables are still luxury items. We have towns where injured workers \nand pregnant women in need of care have access to a doctor only when \nthe weather permits them to undertake an arduous journey by boat and \nsmall aircraft.\n  Alaska has much to offer the rest of the Nation. We have incomparable \nresources and energetic, innovative citizens. It is time we have a \ntransportation system that will allow us to fully enter the world of \nthe 21st Century, and this bill will help us accomplish that goal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3106\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the security of State-issued driver's \nlicenses, enhance highway safety, verify personal identity, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Driver's License \nFraud Prevention Act. This is a timely bill that would provide much \nneeded Federal assistance to the States to help make their driver's \nlicenses more reliable and secure than they are today. I am pleased \nthat my colleagues, Senator McCain, has joined me in this effort.\n  Since September 11, 2001, we have learned much about our society. We \nlearned in the most painful way that those aspects of our open society \nthat we, as Americans, value the most, are the very same \ncharacteristics exploited by people who hate freedom.\n  Our open borders welcome millions of visitors and immigrants each \nyear. Our civil society is based on the integrity of our citizens to \nself regulate their behaviors and to abide by the rule of law. And our \nvery informal system of personal identification relies on the honesty \nof people to represent themselves as who they are, and to not hide \ntheir true identities.\n  Yet, after September 11, we learned that it was the very openness of \nour society that the nineteen terrorists took advantage of by slipping \ninto our country and mingling among us for months before embarking on \ntheir evil tasks.\n  Since that tragic day, as a price for enhancing national security, we \nhave imposed numerous measures across the country, including erecting \nbarricades in front of buildings and requiring tougher screenings at \nairports. But there is one area that we need further improvements on, \nwhich is what our bill would address.\n  It seems that everywhere we turn today, we are asked to present photo \nidentification. And what is the most common identification that we \nshow? It's the State-issued driver's license.\n\n[[Page S10386]]\n\n  The purpose of the driver's license has changed dramatically over the \nyears. The driver's license was originally created by States for a \npublic safety purpose, to permit a qualified person to operate a motor \nvehicle. Today, however, the license has become the most widely-used \nform of identification that is accepted by a wide variety of private \nand public entities. In an April 2002 poll conducted by Public Opinion \nStrategies, 83 percent of the American public noted that they used \ntheir driver's license for purposes other than driving.\n  A driver's license has undoubtedly become a key that can open many \ndoors, yet the current framework that States rely on in issued licenses \nwas not designed for the cards to be used for identification purposes. \nToday, the 50 States follow 50 different methods for verifying a \nperson's identification when they process driver's license \napplications. They apply different standards for defining what the \nacceptable documentation are that they require from applicants.\n  Additionally, the level of security in the driver's licenses and \nidentification cards varies widely, from those states that incorporate \nhigh tech biometric identifiers to ones that are simply laminated. In \nfact, law enforcement officials estimate that there are more than 240 \ndifferent formats of valid driver's licenses in circulation today.\n  Because of the disparity in the State issuance processes and the \nvarying degrees of security of the cards themselves, it is extremely \neasy for individuals today to abuse the system by shopping around for \nlicenses in those States with the weakest practices.\n  Earlier this year, I chaired a hearing in the Governmental Affairs \nSubcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, where we learned \nthat eighteen of the nineteen hijackers involved in the September 11th \nattacks probably used State-issued driver's licenses or identification \ncards to board those doomed airplanes.\n  We also learned that these terrorists specifically went to motor \nvehicle agencies in States that, at that time, employed some of the \nmost lenient processes and requirements in issuing licenses and \nidentification cards.\n  For example, on August 1, 2001, two of the terrorists, Hani Hanjour \nand Khalid Al-Mihdhar, drove a van from New Jersey to the Virginia \nDepartment of Motor Vehicles, DMV, office in Arlington. In the parking \nlot, they asked around until they found someone willing to lie and \nvouch for their Virginia residency. They met Luis Martinez-Flores and \nHerbert Villalobos who, for a price, were willing to help.\n  Hanjour and Al-Mihdhar paid these strangers $50 each and received \nnotarized forms which claimed that the two transients were in fact \nVirginia residents. Using these fake documents, Hanjour and Al-Mihdhar \nwalked into the DMV, stood in line, had their photos taken, and walked \nout with authentic State-issued Virginia photo identification cards.\n  The next day, on August 2, 2001, Hanjour and Al-Mihdhar returned to \nthe same Arlington DMV with two other September 11 terrorists, Salem \nAl-Hazmi and Majed Moqed. Hanjour and Al-Mihdhar helped Al-Hazmi and \nMoqed obtain Virginia identification cards of their own by vouching \nthat they lived together in Virginia.\n  On the same day, two more terrorists, Abdul Al-Omari and Ahmed Al-\nGhamdi, who were renting a room at a Maryland motel, contacted Kenys \nGalicia, a Virginia legal secretary and notary public, through a \nreferral from Luis Martinez-Flores, the same person who was loitering \nnear the Arlington DMV the day before.\n  Al-Omari and Al-Ghamdi paid Galicia to have her prepare false \nnotarized affidavits stating that the two men lived in Virginia. Using \nthese fake documents, these two also went to a Virginia motor vehicles \noffice and received State-issued identification cards.\n  In addition to exploiting the lax Virginia system, at least thirteen \nof the nineteen terrorists held driver licenses or identification cards \nfrom Florida, a State that, at that time, did not require proof of \nresidency from applicants.\n  A few of the September 11 terrorists held licenses or identification \ncards from more than one State, including from California, Arizona, and \nMaryland, while only one did not appear to hold any form of American-\nissued identification. Some received duplicate cards from the same \nState within months of September.\n  Some of them used these licenses to rent automobiles and check into \nmotels, which provided them with constant mobility. Others used \nlicenses as identification to receive wire transferred funds and to \nregister for flight schools.\n  Yet had they not held these valuable commodities, would they have \nbeen successful in carrying out their evil final acts?\n  At the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee hearing, we heard testimony \nfrom a Maryland police chief that, just two days before September 11th, \nZiad Jarrah, one of the terrorists, was stopped for speeding on \nInterstate 95, north of Baltimore. During this traffic stop, Jarrah \nproduced an apparently valid driver's license from the State of \nVirginia, and as a result, the stop proceeded in a typical fashion.\n  However, while Jarrah's license indicated a resident address in \nVirginia, Jarrah was in fact resting overnights at motels along the way \nto Newark, New Jersey, from where he boarded Flight 93, which \nultimately crashed in Pennsylvania. Had he been unable to produce a \nlicense when he was pulled over, or if he had produced a license that \nthe trooper could have identified as having been issued fraudulently, \nwho knows how that stop may have concluded.\n  What we do know is that these terrorists bought their way into our \nshaky, unreliable, and dangerous system of government-issued \nidentification. With the identification cards that they obtained under \nphony pretenses, doors opened across America, including the doors of \nthe four doomed aircrafts on the morning of September 11, 2001.\n  More troubling is that it appears what the terrorists did in \nobtaining the multiple identification cards was a part of an official \nstrategic plan that terrorists employ as they seek to infiltrate our \nsociety.\n  Last year, Attorney General Ashcroft presented to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, on which I serve, a copy of an Al Qaeda Terrorists \nManual that was found by Manchester, England, police officials during \nthe search of an Al Qaeda member's home.\n  Contained in it is a page that reads as follows:\n\n       Forged Documents (Identity Cards, Record Books, Passports)\n\n       The following security precautions should be taken:\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       2. All documents of the undercover brother, such as \n     identity cards and passport, should be falsified.\n       3. When the undercover brother is traveling with a certain \n     identity card or passport, he should know all pertinent \n     [information] such as the name, profession, and place of \n     residence.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       5. The photograph of the brother in these documents should \n     be without a beard. It is preferable that the brother's \n     public photograph [on these documents] be also without a \n     beard. If he already has one [document] showing a photograph \n     with a beard, he should replace it.\n       6. When using an identity document in different names, no \n     more than one such document should be carried at one time.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  It is obvious to me that the September 11 terrorists were trained \nvery well by Al Qaeda. They followed these instructions flawlessly as \nthey sought, and successfully obtained, multiple State-issued driver's \nlicenses and identification cards in America.\n  The use of fake IDs is one of the oldest tricks in the book for \ncriminals, and now we know that this is a page in the book for \nterrorists as well.\n  It is also one of the oldest traditions of adolescence, and a rite of \npassage for many teenagers who casually use a borrowed or tampered ID \nto buy alcohol or tobacco products, or to get into a nightclub. But \nunderage drinking not only endangers the lives of those consuming the \nalcohol, it threatens the lives of others as well.\n  According to a 2001 survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration, SAMHSA, more than 10 million individuals aged \nbetween 12 to 20 years old reported consuming alcohol in the year prior \nto the survey. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \nNHTSA, reports that in the United States, drivers between the ages of \n16 and 21 account\n\n[[Page S10387]]\n\nfor just seven percent of all drivers in the Nation, yet are involved \nin fifteen percent of all alcohol-related fatalities.\n  Drunk drivers are perhaps the most dangerous drivers on the road. But \nthere are others who should not be allowed on the road.\n  We learned that thousands of drivers each year operate motor vehicles \nusing multiple licenses issued under different identities from multiple \nstates, which enable them to evade enforcement of driving restrictions \nimposed on them.\n  They know that under the current license issuance process, no State \nchecks the background of license applicants with its sister States to \nsee if that person may have already been issued a license by another \nState. So it is quite easy for individuals who have had their license \nsuspended or revoked in one State to travel to a neighboring State and \nacquire a new license.\n  A reprentative of the American Association of Motor Vehicle \nAdministrators, AAMVA, who testified at our hearing stated it this way: \n``Although the current system allows for reciprocity among the States, \nit lacks uniformity. Individuals looking to undermine the system, \nwhether it is a terrorist, a drunk driver or an identity thief, shop \naround for licenses in those States that have become the weakest \nlink.''\n  AAMVA is a nonprofit voluntary association representing all motor \nvehicle agency administrators and chief law enforcement officials \nthroughout the United States and Canada.\n  At the hearing, we also heard from a representative of the National \nGovernors Association, NGA, who testified that the NGA has not yet \ndeveloped an official position on the subject of identity security or \nenhancing the driver's license systems.\n  However, he acknowledged that the current system employed by States \nis broken, and is more likely to actually enable identity theft and \nfraud rather than prevent it.\n  He and others on the panel referenced several initiatives that some \nstates were currently undertaking to improve their driver's license \nsystems. For example, Virginia and Florida adopted revised procedures \nsince last year to prevent the types of abuses we all recognized since \nSeptember 11. And many other State legislatures have adopted, and are \nstill in the process of debating, various reform measures, which, I \nbelieve, are all steps in the right direction.\n  I was especially encouraged to hear that the states were willing and \nready to work with the Federal Government to address their problem \ntogether.\n  At our hearing, the AAMVA representative also testified that:\n\n       Seventy-seven percent of the American public support \n     Congress passing legislation to modify the driver's licensing \n     process and identification security. And, we need Congress to \n     help in five areas: (1) support minimum compliance standards \n     and requirements that each state must adopt when issuing a \n     license; (2) help us identify fraudulent documents; (3) \n     support an interstate network for confirming a person's \n     driving history; (4) impose stiffer penalties on those \n     committing fraudulent acts; (5) and, provide funding to \n     make this happen. Funding so states can help ensure a \n     safer America.\n\n  Thus, following this hearing, I reached out to, and worked with a \nnumber of groups and individuals representing States, motor vehicle \nagencies, privacy advocates, immigrant communities, and the technology \nindustry, to consider an appropriate federal legislation on this issue.\n  We also reached out to various agencies in the Bush Administration, \nincluding the Office of Homeland Security, to seek their input on \nlegislation.\n  Then, in July of this year, President Bush unveiled his ``National \nStrategy for Homeland Security.'' In that report the President wrote:\n\n                       Major Initiatives (State)\n\n       Given the states' major role in homeland security, and \n     consistent with the principles of federalism inherent to \n     American government, the following initiatives constitute \n     suggestions, not mandates, for state initiatives.\n       Coordinate suggested minimum standards for state driver's \n     licenses. The licensing of drivers by the 50 states, the \n     District of Columbia, and the United States terrorities \n     varies widely. There is no national or agreed upon state \n     standards for content, format, or license acquisition \n     procedures. Terrorist organizations, including Al-Qaeda \n     operatives involved in the September 11 attacks, have \n     exploited these differences. While the issuance of drivers' \n     licenses fall squarely within the powers of the states, the \n     federal government can assist the states in crafting \n     solutions to curtail the future abuse of drivers' licenses by \n     terrorist organizations. Therefore, the federal government, \n     in consultation with state government agencies and non-\n     governmental organizations, should support state-led efforts \n     to develop suggested minimum standards for driver's licenses, \n     recognizing that many states should and will exceed these \n     standards.\n\n  I fully agree with the President that the issuance of driver's \nlicenses is within the province of the States. In fact, our bill \nexplicitly recognizes and preserves the right of states to determine \nthe qualification or eligibility for obtaining driver's licenses, the \nterms of its validity, and how the license should look.\n  But I also agree with the President that there is an important role \nfor the Federal Government to play in assisting the states to address \nthe national problem of fraud and abuse. I therefore believe this bill \nthat we are introducing today strikes an appropriate balance between \nthe states' authority and federal interests.\n  Our bill is narrowly drafted to improve the process by which licenses \nare issued. First, I note that there are two already existing federal \nprograms that address driver's licenses.\n  The National Driver Register, NDR, which was first created by \nCongress in 1960 and revised in 1982, serves as a central file of state \nreports on drivers whose licenses have been suspended, revoked, \ncanceled, or denied, or who have been convicted of serious traffic-\nrelated offenses. The NDR's primary purpose is to enable State motor \nvehicle agencies to share driver record information with each other so \nthat they can make informed decisions about issuing driver's licenses \nto individuals, particularly those who move into their states from \nother jurisdictions.\n  The Commercial Driver License Information System is the second \nFederal program, which was established by Congress in 1986, to keep \nproblem commercial drivers off the roads, and to prevent traffic \nviolations from being hidden behind multiple licenses.\n  Every State today participates in both federal programs, and all \nStates currently share certain information with each other in order to \nmake informed decisions before issuing driver's licenses. However, the \ncurrent limited scope of these programs leave a gaping loophole: One \ndeals only with records of problem drivers, while the other deals only \nwith records of commercial drivers. What about the records of non-\nproblem drivers who are not commercial drivers?\n  Our bill closes this loophole by consolidating the appropriate \nfunctionalities of these two programs and by adding new security \nmeasures that would allow every State to check all other States' \nrecords of all drivers before issuing commercial or regular driver's \nlicenses. This new process will help prevent States from issuing more \nthan one license to any one individual, which will end forum shopping, \nabuse, and fraud.\n  In recognizing the federal responsibilities of this program, our bill \nwould provide Federal funding for the upgrades as well as direct \nFederal funding to states to assist their continued participating in \nthe new integrated system.\n  While the goals of the bill are specific and firm, we are also \nmindful of the jurisdiction of the states to regulate who is eligible \nto receive driver's licenses, and what the licenses should look like. \nWe thus provide authority to the Secretary of Transportation to engage \nin a negotiated rulemaking which would include all the appropriate \naffected entities and individuals, in order to collectively develop the \nrequired minimum standards on the issuance process.\n  This program can be successful only if every state participates \nenthusiastically. Therefore, to provide maximum input from the states, \nthe bill specifically requires that the Secretary consult with the \nstates and entities representing the interest of the states, and, as \nnecessary, with interested groups and individuals in developing \nconsensus implementing regulations.\n  I should note, as the White House has, that many States should and \nwill exceed these minimum standards set forth in this bill. So for \nstates that are already above the curve, our bill provides federal \ngrants to highlight innovative pilot programs designed to verify \ndriver's identity, prevent fraud,\n\n[[Page S10388]]\n\nor demonstrate the use of technology to create tamper resistant \nlicenses.\n  Our bill also requires States to make their driver's licenses and \nidentification cards more resistant to tampering, altering, or \ncounterfeiting then they are today. But, again, the bill does not \nspecify what those security features ought to be. Instead, it requires \nthe Secretary of Transportation to engage in rulemaking with the States \nand with experts to collectively develop the required minimum standards \nfor all states to adopt.\n  The bill also cracks down on internal fraud and bribery that, \nunfortunately, occur behind the DMV counters. We impose tough penalties \nfor unauthorized access to or use of DMV equipment used to manufacture \nlicenses, and also creates penalties for persons who fraudulently \nissue, obtain, renew, or transfer a driver's license. The bill also \nrequires States to conduct internal audits of license issuance \nprocesses to identify and address these fraudulent activities.\n  Finally, our bill enhances privacy protection for license holders by \nsignificantly strengthening the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, which \nCongress last amended in 1994. The bill protects the privacy of \ndriver's information by expanding the definitions of sensitive \n``personal information'' and by tightening up the current set of \npermissible disclosures.\n  Additionally, under this bill, State motor vehicle agencies would be \nprohibited from disclosing or displaying social security numbers on any \ndriver's license, motor vehicle registration, or any other document \nissued for the purpose of identification.\n  With Federal financial and technical assistance and a narrowly \ntailored common-sense approach, I believe this bill can close the \nloopholes that continue to leave all of us vulnerable. By working \ntogether, we can assist states to adopt a new system that will ensure \nintegrity in the issuance process, integrity in the cards themselves, \nand protection of privacy of drivers across the country. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 3110. A bill to require further study before amendment 13 to the \nNortheast Multispecies (Groundfish) Management Plan is implemented; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fisheries \nManagement Fairness Act in order to provide New England fishermen with \na guarantee that the fisheries management decisions that affect their \nlives will not be made without the benefit of sound, reliable data.\n  Fishing is more than just a profession in New England. Fishing is a \nway of life. This way of life is being threatened, however, by \nexcessive regulations and unnecessary litigation. Despite scientific \nevidence of a rebound in fish stocks, fishermen are suffering under \never more burdensome restrictions. As a result of recent litigation, \nfishermen have seen their days at sea slashed, struggle to implement \nnew gear changes, and are squeezed into ever smaller fishing areas.\n  Everyday, I hear from fishermen who struggle to support their \nfamilies because they have been deprived of their right to make an \nhonest living on the seas. The ``working waterfronts'' of our \ncommunities are in danger of disappearing, likely to be replaced by \ntourism and development. Once the culture of fishing is lost, it will \nbe all but impossible ti replace.\n  On September 11, 2002, the National Marine Fisheries Service \nannounced that the trawler gear used on the NOAA research vessel \nAlbatross IV had been calibrated incorrectly, casting suspicion over \nthe data it had collected since February of 2000. The miscalibrated \ngear had been used to conduct the last eight stock abundance surveys, \nwhich measure long-term increases and decreases in stock populations.\n  Data gathered by these surveys are the basis for regulations in \nfisheries management plans governing the rebuilding of overfished \nstocks. These regulations take the form of ``amendments'' to the New \nEngland's overall groundfish management plan, covering a complex of \nthirteen groundfish species. Amendment 13, the next set of regulations, \nis supposed to be ready for implementation by August 22, 2003.\n  Although the National Marine Fisheries Service has conducted an \nobservation cruise and a performance review workshop with industry to \nexamine the extent of the damage in the survey, the agency has \nconcluded that additional research is required to determine the full \nextent of the damage caused by the flawed gear. The Service has pledged \nto conduct a ``short-term experiment'' to determine the extent of the \ndamage to the survey. This short-term experiment will rely on video and \nsensor equipment to gather data, and a subsequent workshop to examine \nthe data and produce a report that can be used in updating groundfish \nassessments.\n  It is unlikely that this experiment will provide the quality of data \nnecessary to develop Amendment 13 by its court-ordered deadline. The \ntype of data necessary to develop fisheries management plans can be \nproduced only after years of research that demonstrate long-term stock \ntrends. Theoretical modeling of past data of questionable quality is \nsimply not good enough to develop the regulations of a plan that will \naffect the survival of our fishermen.\n  When fishermen's livelihoods depend on the quality of survey data, we \nowe it to them to get the data collection right. There is no room for \nsecond-rate science and faulty data.\n  My bill addresses these problems by preventing Amendment 13 from \nbeing implemented for two years, enough time to allow the Northeast \nFishery Science Center and the National Marine Fishery Center to \ndetermine the reliability of the data collected by the Albatross IV and \nto collect accurate data on which to base future amendments.\n  I will not stand idly by and let New England's fishing community die \nwithout a fight. I pledge to work with my colleagues in the Senate to \nwork to pass this legislation. If we cannot pass it as a rider to \nanother bill during this session, then I plan to reintroduce it and \nfight for its passage when we reconvene next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10388-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10388-S10390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 338--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF OCTOBER, 2002, AS \n                  ``CHILDREN'S INTERNET SAFETY MONTH''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Breaux, Mrs. Hutchison, \nMr. Allen, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Craig, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. \nCantwell, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bunning, \nMr. Hatch, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Hutchinson, and Ms. Snowe) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 338\n\n       Whereas the Internet is one of the most effective tools \n     available for purposes of education and research and gives \n     children the means to make friends and freely communicate \n     with peers and family anywhere in the world;\n       Whereas the new era of instant communication holds great \n     promise for achieving better understanding of the world and \n     providing the opportunity for creative inquiry;\n       Whereas it is vital to the well-being of children that the \n     Internet offer an open and responsible environment to \n     explore;\n       Whereas access to objectionable material, such as violent, \n     obscene, or sexually explicit adult material may be received \n     by a minor in unsolicited form;\n       Whereas there is a growing concern in all levels of society \n     to protect children from objectionable material; and\n       Whereas the Internet is a positive educational tool and \n     should be seen in such a manner rather than as a vehicle for \n     entities to make objectionable materials available to \n     children: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate\n       (1) designates October, 2002, as ``Children's Internet \n     Safety Month'' and supports its official status on the \n     Nation's promotional calendar; and\n       (2) supports parents and guardians in promoting the \n     creative development of children by encouraging the use of \n     the Internet in a safe, positive manner.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 339--DESIGNATING NOVEMBER 2002, AS ``NATIONAL RUNAWAY \n                           PREVENTION MONTH''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Ms. Collins) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n[[Page S10389]]\n\n                              S. Res. 339\n\n       Whereas the prevalence of runaway and homeless youth in our \n     Nation is staggering, with studies suggesting that between \n     1,300,000 and 2,800,000 young people live on the streets of \n     the United States each year;\n       Whereas running away from home is widespread, with 1 out of \n     every 7 children in the United States running away before the \n     age of 18;\n       Whereas youth that end up on the streets are often those \n     who have been ``thrown out'' of their homes by their \n     families, who have been physically, sexually, and emotionally \n     abused at home, who have been discharged by State custodial \n     systems without adequate transition plans, who have lost \n     their parents through death or divorce, and who are too poor \n     to secure their own basic needs;\n       Whereas effective programs supporting runaway youth and \n     assisting young people in remaining at home with their \n     families succeed because of partnerships created among \n     families, community-based human service agencies, law \n     enforcement agencies, schools, faith-based organizations, and \n     businesses;\n       Whereas preventing young people from running away and \n     supporting youth in high-risk situations is a family, \n     community, and national responsibility;\n       Whereas the future well-being of the Nation is dependent on \n     the value placed on young people and the opportunities \n     provided for youth to acquire the knowledge, skills, and \n     abilities necessary to develop into safe, healthy, and \n     productive adults;\n       Whereas the National Network for Youth and its members \n     advocate on behalf of runaway and homeless youth and provide \n     an array of community-based support services that address the \n     critical needs of such youth;\n       Whereas the National Runaway Switchboard provides crisis \n     intervention and referrals to reconnect runaway youth to \n     their families and to link young people to local resources \n     that provide positive alternatives to running away; and\n       Whereas the National Network for Youth and National Runaway \n     Switchboard are co-sponsoring National Runaway Prevention \n     Month to increase public awareness of the life circumstances \n     of youth in high-risk situations and the need for safe, \n     healthy, and productive alternatives, resources, and supports \n     for youth, families, and communities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates November 2002, as \n     ``National Runaway Prevention Month''.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague \nfrom Maine, Senator Collins, in submitting this Senate resolution \ndesignating November as ``National Runaway Prevention Month.''\n  A recent study by the Federal Office of Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention estimates that nearly 1.7 million American youth \nrun away or are turned out of their homes in a single year. Many of \nthese children end up living on the streets where they become victims \nof illness, hunger, drug use, and crime. Any parent knows how important \ntheir support is to helping children get a good start in life.\n  Unfortunately, too many young people find themselves in desperate \nstraits. Imagine a young girl, perhaps 15 or 16 years old, finding \nherself with no place to sleep. Or realizing that she is hungry but has \nno money left for food or for bus fare to get to a soup kitchen. \nImagine her fear when the nights turn very cold and the clothes on her \nback are not enough to keep her warm. As a country, we would not, could \nnot and must not ignore this young girl. I bring this resolution to the \nfloor today to raise awareness of the tragedy of runaway youth, to \nexpress my appreciation for those who work to prevent runaways and help \nstreet children, and to remind my colleagues of the difference our \nfunding decisions make in people's lives.\n  Many street youth are running from families beleaguered by physical \nabuse, neglect, parental substance abuse, poverty or serious family \nconflict. Unlike many homeless adults, who often suffer from mental \nillness or substance abuse problems, most of these young people are \nleaving their homes as a reaction to intolerable circumstances. But \nwhile the conditions that drive these young people out of their homes \nmay be intolerable, they are almost always preventable or treatable.\n  As with many problems our society faces, the best way for us to \nprevent runaway and ``thrownaway'' children from taking to the streets \nis for our communities to work together. Communities can and must \nintervene to strengthen families and help youth in high-risk \nsituations. The needs of these families are as diverse as our nation, \nbut the solutions are often as simple as high-quality intervention \nservices from a government, community or faith-based organization. \nLocal organizations offering services to victims of domestic violence, \ncounseling and anger management courses, substance abuse treatment and \nother social services could make the difference in whether or not a \nchild runs away.\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize and thank the social \nworkers, counselors, caseworkers, teachers, and volunteers who devote \ntheir lives to preventing runaways. The services they offer vary \nwidely, but their intervention may keep a family together and a young \nperson in a healthy home. I would also like to thank the thousands of \nworkers and volunteers who work with runaway youth. It is not always \neasy to work with young people who may be angry, alienated or addicted \nto drugs, but the people who go into the streets to find and help these \nchildren are capable, committed and caring. They are often the only \nthing standing between a young person and self-destruction. They help \nstreet children find shelter and food, get an education and recover \nfrom substance abuse where necessary. They also help them reunite with \ntheir families when appropriate, or find a safe alternative. They are \ntruly guardian angels.\n  Finally, I want to remind my colleagues that many of the local \nservices that can help a struggling family become a healthy home are \nfederally funded. We often see these services as abstract line-items in \nan appropriations bill: Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Child \nAbuse Prevention and Treatment State Grants, and Social Services Block \nGrants. We must remember that these are not just line-items, they are \nlifelines to youth who need our help. Given the enormous deficits most \nStates are facing, many of these services are losing critical state \nresources. As we ensure resources are available for the war against \nterrorism, we must not abandon our vulnerable young people in their own \nfight for survival.\n  The recent White House Conference on Missing, Exploited, and Runaway \nChildren helped to remind us of the fate of thousands of these \nchildren. Declaring November to be ``National Runaway Prevention \nMonth'' would build on that reminder. Across our country, communities \nwill undertake activities during November to increase public awareness \nof the circumstances facing many youth and the need for safe, healthy, \nand productive alternatives and resources for these children and their \nfamilies. This resolution puts the United States Senate on record in \nsupport of National Runaway Prevention Month and its effort to promote \nfamily-based and community-based interventions that prevent young \npeople from running away from home. I urge my colleagues to support our \nNation's vulnerable youth by co-sponsoring this resolution and making \nan effort through their actions or their words to raise awareness of \nthe tragedy of runaway youth.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 152--DESIGNATING AUGUST 7, 2003, AS \n               ``NATIONAL PURPLE HEART RECOGNITION DAY''\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON (for herself and Mr. Hagel) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee on the \nconference on the bill (H.R. 5011), and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     5011), making appropriations for military construction, \n     family housing, and base realignment and closure for the \n     Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September \n     30, 2003, and for other purposes, having met, have agreed \n     that the House recede from its disagreement to the amendment \n     of the Senate, and agree to the same with an amendment, \n     signed by all of the conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The report is printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nOctober 9, 2002.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the \nSenate the conference agreement on the fiscal year 2003 military \nconstruction appropriations bill.\n  While the United States is engaged in a war on terrorism, and \nCongress is debating whether to give the President the authority to \nattack Iraq, it is timely that we are also acting to provide the \nmilitary with the resources it needs to carry out its missions. The \nmilitary construction appropriations bill funds scores of mission \ncritical and quality of life infrastructure projects that are essential \nto support the efforts of the military.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has moved quickly to take up this \nconference agreement. This bill provides nearly $10.5 billion in new \nbudget authority, an amount only slightly below last year's funding. \nGiven the many additional requirements being imposed on the military, \nparticularly to meet new antiterrorism and force protections standards, \nadditional funding would have been helpful. Still, within the funding \nconstraints imposed on the bill, this measure does an excellent job of \nmeeting the most critical infrastructure needs of the services.\n  Mr. President, the projects in this bill address military readiness, \nquality of life, and anti-terrorism/force protection requirements. The \nconference attempted to address as many of the services' priorities as \npossible, and I believe we have done a good job in that respect, \nparticularly in light of the fact that the House and Senate bills had \nvery significant differences between them.\n  The conference agreement provides nearly $4.9 billion for the active \ncomponents of the military. It provides $688 million for the guard and \nreserve, more than double the President's budget request. Within these \namounts is included $799 million for anti-terrorism/force protection \nenhancements for military facilities worldwide. This commitment to \nprotect American military bases will help to ensure the security of \nmilitary personnel and the families, as well as to protect the \ntaxpayers' substantial investment in defense infrastructure.\n\n  The Conference Agreement also provides $1.2 billion for barracks, and \n$4.2 billion for military family housing, both of which are top quality \nof life priorities for military personnel and their families.\n  There are two other very important items that merit mention. The \nfirst is a $25 million initiative to accelerate the construction \nassociated with the Army's Stryker Brigade combat teams.\n  The Stryker Brigades will offer the military fast, light-weight, air-\nmobile combat power--a far advanced system when compared to the \nrestrictions with heavy armor.\n  An additional $25 million initiative will accelerate the Air Force's \nC-17 Air Mobility Program.\n  The C-17 initiative will provide the infrastructure needed to support \nand enhance the ability of one of the air force's most dependable \naircraft, capable of transporting both troops and equipment. The C-17 \nprogram will help address the significant shortfall in Military airlift \nrequirements.\n  The conference report also includes $20 million dollars for a BRAC \nEnvironmental cleanup initiative.\n  This initiative assists Military installations that have been closed \nas part of the base realignment and closure effort. This additional \nfunding, in addition to the budget requested amount, is necessary to \nenable the military to honor its commitments to the people and the \ncommunities that have been affected by these last four rounds of base \nclosure.\n\n  This is a start, but much more will be needed to complete the \nenvironmental clean up of BRAC sites across the nation in a reasonable \nperiod of time. This is certainly something that should be considered \nbefore the nation embarks on any future rounds of base closings.\n  Mr. President, I thank chairman Byrd, Senator Stevens, and my ranking \nmember on the subcommittee, Senator Hutchison, for their support and \nassistance in bringing this conference agreement to the Senate. I also \nthank the subcommittee staff, including Christina Evans and BG Wright \nof the majority staff; Sid Ashworth and Alycia Farrell of the minority \nstaff; and Matt Miller of my staff, for their hard work on this \nmeasure.\n  Given the difficulties that have faced the appropriations process \nthis year, I am pleased and grateful that the military construction \nbill will be sent to the President prior to the Senate's adjournment. I \nurge the President to sign this bill without delay.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the \nSenate the conference agreement on the fiscal year 2003 military \nconstruction appropriations bill and endorse those comments made by the \nChairman, Senator Feinstein.\n  I am gratified that the Congress was able to move forward on a \nmilitary construction bill for fiscal year 2003. This is especially \ncritical when the nation is considering military action to prevent the \nspread of terrorism and the potential use of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Given the circumstances, this is a particularly timely, \nand time sensitive, Conference Report, and it is\n\n[[Page S10397]]\n\nimportant that the Senate is moving quickly to pass it so that we can \nprovide our military personnel the housing and facilities they need to \nperform their duties.\n  This is a good package that meets the most pressing needs of the \nmilitary, both in terms of readiness and quality of life issues. It is \nnot, of course, a perfect package. The Conference Report does not \ninclude everything that the Senate wanted; nor does it includes \neverything that the House wanted. It does, however, address the \npriorities of the Department of Defense as well as both Houses of \nCongress. It is a carefully crafted compromise that is both balanced \nand bipartisan.\n\n  The Chairman highlighted several of the critical items contained in \nthis bill, such as $1.2 billion for new barracks, $151 million for \nmilitary hospitals and medical facilities, $688 million for new Guard \nand Reserve facilities, and $1.34 billion for new family housing for \nmilitary personnel and their families.\n  These are important increases that signal a renewed commitment to \nupgrading and rebuilding the infrastructure that is truly the backbone \nof our Nation's military. I am proud to support funding for these \nimportant programs.\n  In recent years, we have made real progress in improving family \nhousing for single service members and for families, as well as \nimproving the workplaces for the men and women who serve America both \nat home and abroad. However, much remains to be done.\n  It is my hope that in future budgets, we will see sufficient \nresources to continue the Department of Defense's efforts to modernize, \nrenovate and improve aging defense facilities and infrastructure. the \neffects of sustained and structural inattention by the Pentagon and the \nmilitary services to basic infrastructure are apparent on nearly every \nmilitary installation. This will continue to have long-term \nimplications as facilities continue to age disproportionately without a \nsustained level of investment in maintenance and repair.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Byrd, Senator Stevens, and \nthe Chairman of this subcommittee, Senator Feinstein, for their \nunflagging support and assistance in bringing this conference agreement \nto the Senate. I also thank the subcommittee staff for their hard work \non this measure.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the conference report be \nagreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements be printed in the Record with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/10/senate-section/article/S10397-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING THE EXPLOITS OF THE OFFICERS AND CREW OF THE S.S.
