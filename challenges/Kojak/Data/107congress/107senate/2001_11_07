So often we \ncome to You with our shopping list of requests. Prayer becomes a \n``gimmie'' game rather than a grace gift. Help us to realize that \nwhatever You give or withhold from us in prayer is to draw us into \ndeeper intimacy with You. When we put the primary emphasis on a \nrelationship with You, experiencing Your presence and receiving Your \npower, life becomes a privilege. It loses its strain and stress. Added \nto that, You provide the spiritual gifts we need--wisdom and \ndiscernment, emotional strength and stability, and physical stamina and \nendurance. Grant the Senators a special measure of Your inspiration \ntoday as they listen to You. Speak to them before they speak to the \nSenate and to the Nation. May debate not divide but develop deeper \nunderstanding. Now, when the world looks to America for leadership, may \npatriotism unite this Senate. Grant the Senators and to all of us a \nrenewed dependence on You that makes possible greatness in leadership. \nYou are our Lord and Saviour.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring to our attention \ntwo distinct problems facing our States and particularly our \ncommunities in New York as a result of the attacks on September 11. I \nhave just come from a meeting with a number of mayors from cities all \nover the country, including mayors who joined us by conference phone, \nDemocrats, Republicans, large cities, medium- and small-sized cities. \nThey all have said with a single voice that the impact on our public \nsafety infrastructure of the attacks is such that they are bleeding \ndollars. They are paying overtime constantly to our police officers, \nour firefighters, our first responders. They do not have the funds to \nprovide the protection and the quick response our citizens deserve and \nexpect.\n  I can speak specifically about New York. We have an economic \nsituation where we face a $10 billion shortfall in State revenues over \nthe next 18 months. In addition, our New York State comptroller, Carl \nMcCall, has identified $940 million in potential State and local \ngovernment costs due to the current congruence of events.\n  This means that city governments, county governments, far away from \nGround Zero, are faced with hundreds of calls about potential \nbiological or chemical materials, particularly anthrax, to which they \nare responding as we expect them to. They are faced with threats coming \nin--both credible and, frankly, not, but we have to follow each one \nup--potential threats to our infrastructure, our powerplants, our \nbridges, our ports, our airports.\n  As a result, we have a tremendous pressure buildup on our local \ngovernments. As I heard today, it is something that is being faced by \ngovernments across our country. That is why I strongly support the plan \nwith which Senators Byrd and Reid are coming forward, to provide \nadditional funding for public safety needs. I am calling on our \ncolleagues and the Federal Government to create a public safety block \ngrant program to help communities plan, strictly for our emergencies, \nand to be ready no matter what happens in their communities.\n  Why is a public safety block grant so necessary?\n  First, September 11 changed everything. Anybody who wants to pretend \nit didn't is sending a false message to the people we represent. Our \ncities and our counties are on the front lines in the war against \nterrorism. When a threat is called in to our local fire department or \nour local mayor's office, they cannot wait for some kind of Federal \nresponse. They have to send out those first responders. They are on a \nheightened state of alert as they have been told by our President, by \nGovernor Ridge, and by Attorney General Ashcroft. A public safety block \ngrant would help our communities provide these additional resources for \npolice, fire, ambulance, emergency, airports, waterways, public transit \ninfrastructure, chemical, and nuclear plants.\n  I think we should reinvigorate the concept of civil defense, using \nmore volunteers to supplement our first line responders. Some of our \ncolleagues, including Senators McCain, Bayh, and Lieberman, have \nrecently spoken out about the importance of encouraging Americans to \nbecome involved in civil defense. I believe a public safety block grant \ncould use funds to further that idea and help us prepare better and \ninvolve so many of the citizens who want to participate in protecting \nour homeland front. If we are at war, which we are told we are, which \nwe believe we are--we are fighting two wars. We are fighting a war \nabroad in Afghanistan against the terrorist networks, and we are \nfighting a war right here at home, and we need to be prepared on both \nfronts.\n  The eligibility criteria would be based on several factors. \nCertainly, communities would have to be ready to use those funds for \npost-September 11 needs, not because they didn't budget well before the \ndate of the attacks but because of the additional burdens they now \nface.\n  I believe medium- and larger-sized cities and counties should receive \ndirect assistance. Smaller communities could go through the State, \nbased on the CDBG program. I hope communities would have to submit a \nplan explaining how they would use the funds, but that they would be \ngiven broad discretion because they are best able to defend their own \ncommunities. They should be given that opportunity.\n  I think we need this legislation now because our homeland defense \nwill only be as strong as the weakest link at the State and local \nlevel. We need our citizens more involved in civil defense to \nsupplement those of our people on the front line in the uniformed \nservices. I think we recognize this now is an absolute necessity. I \ncertainly support the efforts of Senator Byrd and Senator Reid, \ncombined with Senator Baucus, to have a homeland recovery and security \npackage, but I do not think it will work unless we provide funds \ndirectly to our cities and counties, unless we recognize that they have \nto be the front line defense in the war against terrorism here at home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/07/senate-section/article/S11506-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11506-S11510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order,the \nSenator from Virginia is recognized to offer an amendment on which \nthere shall be 60 minutes of debate.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for just 1 minute for opening \nremarks from the manager of the bill?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Certainly.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for \nyielding.\n  Let me quickly support my colleague from New York in her remarks \nabout how important it is for us, as we fashion homeland defense, to be \ncognizant, as Mayor Giuliani beautifully showed us, so that the mayors \nand local officials are really on the front line. Our Federal \nGovernment needs to recognize the great role they have played and can \nplay. Our budget should reflect the principle of getting those \nresources down to the lower level. I thank the Senator from New York \nfor her very instructive remarks to us this morning.\n  Let me, as I begin again this morning on the DC bill, very briefly--\nwithin 1 minute--just hit the highlights of the bill before we turn to \nthe three or four amendments we may be considering today, with that of \nSenator Allen being the first one up for us to consider.\n  First, there is great consensus in this underlying bill. Again, I \nthank my colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, for his excellent work. \nWe thank Mr. Byrd, the Senator from West Virginia, and the Senator from \nAlaska, Mr. Stevens, for helping us get this bill to the floor, working \nacross party lines and in a very dedicated way to bring a good bill to \nthis floor.\n  The five points in this bill are:\n  No. 1, this is the first bill over $7 billion that comes to the floor \nin 5 years without the Control Board being in effect. So there is great \nresponsibility that we have to make sure this and future budgets \nreflect the fiscal discipline that is now a part--and hopefully will be \neven a stronger part--of the District's future. The budget is not only \nin balance but the District is in a surplus, having swung $1 billion \nfrom a deficit now to a surplus. We would like to keep it that way.\n  There are going to be great challenges ahead, but Senator DeWine and \nI are committed to fiscal discipline, transparency, accountability, and \nexcellence in management for the District.\n  No. 2, there is an underlying principle--we will debate some of that \nthis morning--about local decisionmaking. We believe generally local \ngovernments should be allowed to spend their money and local funds in \nthe ways they are directed. There is some debate about that issue. That \ndebate will take place this morning.\n  No. 3, there is a significant investment in child welfare. I want to \nsay on behalf of Senator DeWine and myself and many of the Members who \nhelped, we are investing $40 million in new moneys to set up a better \nchild welfare system in the District. Too many children have died. \nThere are too many families torn asunder. There are too many children \nwithout parents, too many parents without children who\n\n[[Page S11507]]\n\ncannot be found. This investment will help the courts work better and \nhelp us to put our money where our mouth is and invest in kids.\n  No. 4, there is a $16 million increase for security in the District. \nAfter September 11, it is obvious the District itself is a target, \nhosting the Capitol of these great United States. So we have recognized \nthat.\n  Finally, there is an investment in the environment and in education.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2109\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I send a managers' amendment to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent it be approved. This is strictly a technical \namendment. Any controversial issues have been removed; they are not \nincluded. It has been cleared on both sides.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu], for herself and \n     Mr. DeWine, proposes an amendment numbered 2109.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2107\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President I call up amendment No. 2107.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Allen] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2107.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: to prohibit the use of local funds to carry out needle \n             exchange programs in the District of Columbia)\n\n       On page 57, strike beginning with line 24 through page 58, \n     line 7, and insert the following:\n       Sec. 127. (a) None of the funds contained in this Act may \n     be used for any program of distributing sterile needles or \n     syringes for the hypodermic injection of any illegal drug.\n       (b) Any individual or entity who received any funds \n     contained in this Act and who carries out any program \n     described in subsection (a) shall account for all funds used \n     for such program separately from any funds contained in this \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues in the \nSenate to take a stand, a strong stand, against illegal drug use by \nrejecting a provision in the District of Columbia appropriations bill \nthat would allow the use of taxpayer funds for a needle exchange \nprogram.\n  My amendment mirrors the section of the House bill that addresses the \nneedle exchange programs and would prohibit both the use of Federal and \nlocally generated funds for these needle exchange programs. I think it \nis wrong and it is a misguided priority for the District of Columbia, \nwith all their priorities and pressing concerns in the District--\nwhether they be in improving their public schools or improving public \nsafety--to be wasting money. In fact, I don't think they ought to waste \na penny in providing drug users with sterile needles or syringes.\n  As you know, Mr. President, the Constitution provides the Congress \nthe authority to exercise exclusive jurisdiction in all cases dealing \nwith the District of Columbia. We have oversight responsibilities. The \nFederal District of Columbia is properly and constitutionally subject \nto more oversight from the Congress than would be any of the 50 States. \nThis is evidenced by the fact that both the House and Senate have \nauthorizing subcommittees specifically addressing the District of \nColumbia. Thus, we, as Members of the Senate, have not only a right but \nalso a constitutional oversight responsibility to stop this legislation \nwhich would obviously be detrimental to the public good.\n  That is the bottom line here. When there is something that is clearly \ndetrimental to the public good in the District of Columbia, we have an \noversight responsibility. While the vast majority of matters have to do \nwith local jurisdiction--schools and traffic signals--various other \nissues, management is best at that local level--although we would like \nto empower them in some cases to do more--but insofar as the needle \nexchange network is concerned, these needle exchange networks are bad \nfor the communities in which they are located.\n  In November of 1995, the Manhattan Lower East Side Community Board \npassed a resolution to terminate their needle exchange program. You may \nwonder why they stopped it. They said:\n\n       The community has been inundated with drug dealers. Lawful \n     businesses are being abandoned, and much needed law \n     enforcement is being withheld by the police.\n\n  Why would we want that to happen in our Nation's Capital? The U.S. \nSenate could through this appropriations bill,\n\n[[Page S11508]]\n\nif this amendment is not adopted and the conference committee leaves it \nin, allow the District of Columbia, our Nation's beloved capital, to \nuse taxpayer funds to buy clean needles for drug addicts. However, \nprior experience with these needle exchange programs not only fails to \ndemonstrate positive results among drug addicts, but it may actually \nresult in negative results. That is right, negative results.\n  Deaths resulting from drug overdoses have increased five times since \n1988. According to a White House report, in 1997 15,973 people died \nfrom drug-induced causes. That is 1,130 more people than in 1996. The \nhighest death rate from illegal use was among African Americans at 8.3 \ndeaths per 100,000 people.\n  Additionally, according to Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Weekly, the \nnumber of American teenagers using heroin has doubled in most recent \nyears. Indeed, when one thinks of heroin, you think of heroin being \nused by folks in their late 20s and 30s. The biggest increase in the \nuse of heroin is among teenagers. In fact, the average age of heroin \nusers nationally is now lower among teenagers.\n  That is very frightening.\n  An AIDS Journal study indicated that Vancouver, the site of one of \nthese needle exchange programs, now has the highest rate of heroin \ndeaths in North America.\n  It seems to me that giving a drug addict a clean needle is like \ngiving an alcoholic a clean flask. It just doesn't make any sense.\n  Some would claim that needle exchange programs prevent the spread of \nAIDS amongst intravenous drug users and are, therefore, important in \naddressing the AIDS problem.\n  The Clinton administration attempted to lift the ongoing ban on \nFederal funds for needle exchange programs as a solution to reducing \nthe rate of HIV infection among intravenous or IV drug users without \nincreasing the use of drugs such as heroin. While clean needles do not \ncontribute to the spread of HIV, there is scant evidence, scientific or \nanecdotal, that needle exchanges protect users.\n  A Montreal study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology in \n1997 showed that addicts who used needle exchange programs were twice \nas likely to become infected with HIV than those who did not.\n  The New York Times magazine reported that one New York City program \ngave a single individual 60 syringes, a pamphlet with instructions on \nusing them, and a identification card that allows them to legally \npossess drug paraphernalia. Indeed, drug addicts use these programs not \nonly for fresh paraphernalia but also to network among other drug \naddicts for fresh supplies of the drug itself.\n  It may be more accurate to call the drug needle exchange programs \nwhat they are: drug exchange networks.\n  We are at a time in history when more Americans are ruining or losing \ntheir lives to illegal drug use. When the highest death rate from \nillegal drug use occurs in African American communities, and when \nheroin and cocaine are at some of their lowest prices in history, I \nmaintain that we should not vote to encourage the government to give \naway the tools that enable people to promote drug use and, therefore, \nharm themselves. Indeed, it is not just harming themselves. Drug use is \nthe key component in crime.\n\n  Ask any prosecutor, law enforcement officer, or, in fact, any judge \nwho deals with criminal cases, and you will find that the vast majority \nof criminal cases are related to drug use. Someone may be under the \ninfluence of drugs when they assault or rape someone, and when they are \nbreaking and entering, armed robberies, or other thefts and stealing of \nproperty to pay for that addiction. You will find, I maintain, that the \nvast majority of crimes are drug-related one way or the other.\n  I believe that in a time when all of these negative trends seem to be \non the rise that the endorsement or condoning of a needle exchange \nnetwork by the U.S. Senate sends the wrong message about our \nGovernment's commitment to fighting drugs and, thus, undermines our \nefforts to prevent drug use and eliminate the illegal drug trade.\n  According to former President Clinton's drug czar, General Barry \nMcCaffery:\n\n       The problem is not dirty needles. The problem is heroin \n     addiction. The focus should be on bringing help to the \n     suffering population, not giving them more effective means to \n     continue their addiction. One doesn't want to facilitate this \n     dreadful scourge on mankind.\n\n  We have a legal responsibility to keep these harmful networks from \nbecoming a reality in the District of Columbia. Allowing it in the \nDistrict of Columbia would send a very poor message to those ravaged by \ndrug addiction--that AIDS is a terrible disease that can be maintained, \nyet it is OK to die from the effects of drug addiction.\n  Additionally, the Government would be sending a weak message to those \nwho would want to make a profit from illegal drug trade: Drugs are \nillegal, yet the United States Government condones needle exchange \nnetworks which issue identification cards that entitle users to carry \ndrug paraphernalia without interference from the law.\n  Finally, it would send a dangerous message to our youth. It seems to \nme that we all know that drugs are harmful. We don't want to send a \nmessage to our youngsters that the Federal Government supports \nproviding needles and syringes for drug delivery and brochures \nexplaining the most efficient means of injection.\n  It is imperative that the Senate stand strong against illegal drug \nuse. We must not allow Federal funds to go toward programs supplying \nindividuals already struggling with addiction with drug paraphernalia. \nWe must not directly or indirectly endorse needle exchange networks.\n  I ask my fellow Senators to join me in this effort and not give up on \nthis war on drugs as we take on another war--the war on terrorism. We \nowe it to our brave law enforcement officers who have been fighting \nthis war on drugs, with many of them risking their lives by \ninfiltrating some of these drug networks, chasing drug dealers, paying \ninformants, doing undercover work, and surveillance. Our law \nenforcement officers have been fighting this war on drugs, and now they \nare fighting daily battles on many other fronts in the war on \nterrorism.\n  We also owe it to those struggling with drugs not to turn our \nGovernment into an enabler.\n  Finally, we owe it to our children to fight to ensure that they grow \nup and live in a world as free from illegal drugs as is possible.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues to support my amendment, which sends \nall the right messages, all the proper messages, not just for our \nDistrict of Columbia, which is in a time of crisis; but it sends the \nright message for all of America, and actually the right message for \nall of the world which is now watching our Nation's Capital.\n  Once again, I ask my colleagues to stand up for what is right in our \nNation's Capital, for all the people of America, and those who are \nwatching us.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank you for the recognition.\n  At this time I am prepared to yield a few moments, 5 minutes, to the \nSenator from Maryland for morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Mikulski are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for \nbeing so gracious.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield, under the unanimous consent agreement, to \nSenator Durbin for a response to the Allen amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that under the \nunanimous consent agreement there were 30 minutes allocated to each \nside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes, and there are approximately 18 \nminutes remaining on each side.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S11509]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. How much time does the Senator need? Because there are \ntwo other Senators who would like to speak.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could ask for 15 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. How about 12 minutes?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will take 12.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Unfortunately, because my time has been reduced, I am going to have \nto reduce the time I was going to use to praise the chair of the \nsubcommittee for her work on this bill. But I do want to make a point \nof saying this: I have served on this subcommittee. This is not an easy \nassignment. I congratulate Senators Landrieu and DeWine for bringing \nforth an excellent bill. It is a bill which is a challenge every single \nyear.\n  Why is this bill a challenge? Because every Member of the Congress \nwho ever wanted to be mayor of a town gets the chance to be ``mayor for \na day'' on the DC appropriations bill. Senators from some of the \nlargest States in the Nation can't wait to make decisions that are \nordinarily made by mayors and members of city councils. They get to be \n``aldermen for a day.'' They get to rule a city for a day. It is such a \ntempting opportunity. And the fact that we put only 10 percent of the \nmoney, through Congress, into the District of Columbia does not hold \nthem back. They don't want to merely control the money that Congress \nputs in the District of Columbia, they want to control all the money in \nthe District of Columbia. You would think they were having a major \nelection here and they were elected mayor of the District of Columbia \nbecause they want to make all the decision.\n  Frankly, that is wrong. It is wrong and irresponsible. If you believe \nin home rule, if you believe in the appropriate delegation of authority \nto the level closest to the voters, why in the world would a Senator \nfrom any State in the United States want to impose his or her judgment \non this city, our Nation's Capital? And they do, year in and year out.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana for really fighting back the \ntemptation to put in all these riders and all these ideas, all these \nordinances that Members of Congress want to put on the District of \nColumbia. I say thank you to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  But the proposal we have before us today is one of the worst. It is a \nproposal where we say to the District of Columbia: You cannot use your \nmoney, your taxpayers' dollars, on a public health program that you \nendorsed to deal with a major public health crisis in the District of \nColumbia.\n  With his amendment, the Senator from Virginia has suggested that the \nDistrict of Columbia--it is more than a suggestion--would be unable to \nspend its own money on a needle exchange program. What does the \nWashington Post think of that suggestion? They have asked this \nquestion, an important one: Has Congress nothing better to do at this \npoint than to play mayor and city council to the District of Columbia? \nThey go through the proposals which we are going to consider here, \nproposals relative to needle exchange and domestic partnership. Time \nand again what you find is they are proposals which don't stand up.\n  The current DC appropriations bill would allow the District to \nfinance the needle exchange program only through its own funds. There \nwould be no Federal funds involved. That has been the rule for years. \nWhat Senator Allen says in his amendment is, no, you can't even use \nyour own funds for that purpose.\n  Why should we keep our hands off this decision? Let me tell the \nSenate about this beautiful Nation's Capital in which I have had the \nprivilege of being a student and a Congressman and a Senator for so \nmany years of my life. This beautiful city has massive problems. One of \nthe biggest problems is a public health problem we cannot overstate. \nThe AIDS rate, the rate of infection of AIDS in Washington, DC, is the \nhighest in the Nation. It is nine times the national average. For us to \nsay we are going to impose our political opinion on how to deal with \nthe AIDS crisis in the worst suffering city in America is just wrong.\n  Individuals become infected in the District of Columbia with AIDS and \nHIV primarily through the sharing of contaminated needles for \nintravenous drug usage. More than a third of the AIDS cases nationwide \nare related to injection drug use. These statistics are most dramatic \namong women, where three out of four women diagnosed with AIDS injected \ndrugs themselves or became infected through a partner who was an \ninjection drug user.\n  I refer to this statistic about the District of Columbia: Over half \nof the children born with HIV have a parent engaged in substance abuse. \nOur vote this morning will decide whether or not we take away the \nauthority of the District of Columbia to deal with a public health \ncrisis that is the worst in the Nation. We are imposing our political \nview on the best medical judgment in America of how to deal with an \nepidemic. We wouldn't accept that if the epidemic related to \nbioterrorism. We wouldn't let the Governors and mayors make medical \ndecisions. We would stand up for what is right scientifically and \nmedically.\n  Both the District of Columbia mayor, Anthony Williams, and the police \nchief support the use of local funds to finance needle exchange \nprograms in Washington, DC. The arguments that these programs are \ncreating and fomenting crime, encouraging drug use, fall flat on their \nface. Last year in this appropriations bill we said we want the D.C. \ngovernment to report to us if there is a higher incidence of crime \naround areas with needle exchange programs. It came back consistently \nand said no.\n  I say to the Senator from Virginia, they said no. The people, the \ncops on the beat, those who were asked to report to Congress said no, \nthere was not an increase in crime or drug usage around these programs.\n  Let's talk about the scientific community for a moment. In addition \nto strong support from political officials, the potential for needle \nexchange programs to halt the spread of HIV/AIDS and encourage \nsubstance abusers to enter treatment is scientifically proven. The \nSurgeon General of the United States, David Satcher, stated:\n\n       There is conclusive scientific evidence that syringe \n     exchange programs as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention \n     strategy are an effective public health intervention that \n     reduces the transmission of HIV and does not encourage the \n     illegal use of drugs.\n\n  This is the Surgeon General of the United States. He is not an \nelected official. He has never put his name on a ballot that I know of, \nbut he has spent his lifetime in public health and medicine. He says \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Virginia is just plain wrong.\n  If that amendment prevails, we will increase the likelihood of HIV \nand AIDS in the District of Columbia; we will increase the likelihood \nof more drug usage. How can we in good conscience consider such a \nmeasure? How can we turn our back on the overwhelming scientific and \nmedical evidence against the Allen amendment? To ignore that is to \nignore any warning we receive.\n  Do my colleagues recall during the Reagan administration President \nReagan faced the onset of the AIDS epidemic and thank goodness Dr. \nKoop, his Surgeon General, had the courage to stand up and say: Don't \npoliticize an epidemic. We will deal with it in honest medical terms. \nThank goodness Dr. Koop said that and sent notices out to every home in \nAmerica so they understood the seriousness of this public health \nchallenge. It would have been so easy for this to be politicized. It \nwould have been so easy for someone to take advantage of it. President \nReagan and Dr. Koop wouldn't allow that.\n  Dr. Koop supports needle exchange programs--Dr. Koop, the former \nSurgeon General under a Republican President.\n  The Institute of Medicine in Washington, DC, said access to sterile \nsyringes is one of the four unrealized opportunities in HIV prevention. \nThe National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine indicated \nthat needle exchange programs have the potential to reduce risk \nbehaviors associated with HIV by 80 percent and HIV transmission by 30 \npercent.\n  When I start to list the organizations that oppose the Allen \namendment, that\n\n[[Page S11510]]\n\nsay it is just plain wrong scientifically and medically, we will have \nsome understanding of why this is the wrong thing to vote for.\n  First, those opposing the Allen amendment: The American Medical \nAssociation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American \nFoundation for AIDS Research, the American Nurses Association, the \nAmerican Pharmaceutical Association, the American Public Health \nAssociation. The list goes on and on and on. Every major credible \npublic health organization that has been asked to comment on needle \nexchange programs has concluded they are an effective way to fight drug \nusage and the spread of HIV and AIDS.\n  Let me draw the attention of the Senate to this chart. This is a map \nof the United States showing the States that are currently involved \nwith needle exchange programs. Keep in mind, all of these 31 States \nhave decided this is a good way to fight drug usage and HIV/AIDS. Are \nwe passing a law banning States around the country such as Maryland \nfrom having a needle exchange program, or Illinois? No. Only the \nDistrict of Columbia, where Senators and Congressmen get to play mayor \nfor a day. That is unfair. Look at these States all across America: \nFlorida, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Louisiana, Texas, the \nPresident's home State, all with needle exchange programs.\n\n  If this is such a scourge on America, as the Senator from Virginia \nsuggests, why hasn't he offered an amendment to ban these programs \nnationwide? Because, frankly, it is not Congress's business to do so. \nSecondly, it is just plain wrong from a public health point of view.\n  We know in these States that these programs bring people who are \ncurrently addicted into the presence of those who will give them the \nclean and safe needles, but also much more. They will connect up with \nthem to try to help them end their drug usage. People living and \nlurking in the shadows and alleys of America as IV drug users using \ncontaminated needles are not going to end their addiction, they are \ngoing to unfortunately continue it. They are going to give birth to \nchildren who will also suffer from HIV and AIDS as a result of it.\n  Ninety-five percent of the programs refer clients to substance abuse \ntreatment and counseling programs--95 percent of those needle exchange \nprograms do make the referrals. You are going to cut off this \nopportunity to reach out to a drug addict and say, please, we know that \nyou are addicted, but here is your chance to shake this addiction, to \nchange your life. Why would we walk away from that? Why in the Nation's \nCapital would we walk away from it, where the HIV and AIDS infection is \nthe worst in America?\n  Over half of the people who come to these needle exchange programs \nrealize they have an opportunity for voluntary HIV testing on the site, \nand more than a quarter are screened for hepatitis B and C. All seven \nof the needle exchange programs in my home State of Illinois offer \nreferrals to treatment information about HIV prevention.\n  I have voted for some of the toughest penalties in the law when it \ncomes to drug usage. I have joined with those who say we have to make \nit clear that this is wrong; it not only kills you, but it threatens \nAmerica in so many ways. I think these harsh punishments have worked in \nsome cases; they have not worked in others. There are some people for \nwhom even the harshest punishment in the world is not enough. They need \na helping hand, someone who will reach out to them and say, please, \ntest yourself for HIV, consider this program for rehab.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Virginia will stop the \nNation's Capital, a city that is rocked with the HIV/AIDS epidemic, \nfrom fighting it. This amendment turns its back on the scientific and \nmedical evidence which we gather across America in terms of how these \nprograms help us to fight drugs, how they help us to fight crime, fight \ndependency, and fight addiction, why 31 different States, including the \nState of Utah and the State of Louisiana, have similar programs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's 12 minutes have \nexpired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield 2 additional minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Virginia said at one point that this is \na program that harms its participants. I say to the Senator that the \nAmerican Medical Association disagrees with him. The American Public \nHealth Association disagrees with him. Law enforcement in the District \nof Columbia disagrees with him, and the Surgeon General of the United \nStates disagrees with him as well.\n  When we consider what we are up against, the Senator says we have to \nmake sure we send the right message. The fact that we can come to the \nfloor and make a political judgment to take away one of the tools and \nweapons to fight for good public health and to fight HIV/AIDS is the \nwrong message. What are we going to do next? Are we going to decide \nthat Congress is going to make decisions about the threat of anthrax \nand not the public health community, that it is a political decision \nnot a medical decision? I hope not.\n  Whether we are fighting AIDS or anthrax, whether we are fighting drug \naddiction or other problems facing us in America on the medical scene, \nfor goodness sakes, let us have the humility as Members of the Senate \nand the House to defer to the experts in the field. Let us not be swept \naway with the thought that by passing this amendment we are stating \nsomething that is politically strong.\n  Let me close with this statement from the Surgeon General because \nthis says it all:\n\n       In summary, the new studies contribute substantially to the \n     strength of the data showing the following effects of \n     effective syringe exchange programs: A decrease in new HIV \n     sero conversions; an increase in the numbers of injection \n     drug users referred to and retained in substance abuse \n     treatment and well-documented opportunities for multiple \n     prevention services and referral and entry into medical care. \n     The data indicate that the presence of a syringe exchange \n     program does not increase the use of illegal drugs among \n     participants in the syringe exchange programs.\n\n  That is the Surgeon General speaking on the basis of facts and real \nstatistics. I beg the Senate not to play mayor and council for a day at \nthe expense of an HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Nation's Capital. Stand with \nthe AMA and the Surgeon General for the sound and prudent medical \njudgment to let those programs continue in the District of Columbia \nusing their own funds.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that the time I consume not be charged against either \nof the managers.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I ask unanimous consent that she be given 4 extra \nminutes and that Senator DeWine be given 4 extra minutes in relation to \nthis amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Jersey.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to voice my very strong support \nfor the District of Columbia's efforts to cut HIV/AIDS transmission \nthrough its needle exchange program and strongly oppose the Allen \namendment. First, I compliment the leadership of the chairwoman, the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana, for her efforts in making sure \nthat democracy works in the District of Columbia, that we leave to the \nlocal folks home rule regarding those matters we leave to home rule all \nacross this country. I can only argue that the District of Columbia \nshould be able to use its own funds as it sees fit, the same as do \nother localities in the country.\n  Let me start with the bottom line on the fundamental issue. Needle \nexchange programs work and they save lives. Facts speak for themselves. \nThe Senator from Illinois was very articulate in bringing out a lot of \nthem. I will go over a little more of that. There are over 130 needle \nexchange programs operating in the Nation, in 80 cities and 31 States. \nThey work. These programs, like the District of Columbia's programs, \nare supported at the local level by people who want to attack this \nscourge of drug addiction and HIV/AIDS in our communities. They are \nsupported by States and a huge amount of private funds in the country. \nAgain, the simple reason is that they work.\n\n  Countless government and private scientific studies have proved the \neffectiveness of the needle exchange programs. They limit the spread of \nHIV/AIDS. Fact. They do that without any sense or any kind of objective \nevidence that they do anything to spread drug use. The Centers for \nDisease Control, the University of California, and the U.S. General \nAccounting Office, among a whole host of others, have shown that these \nprograms substantially reduce the transmission of HIV/AIDS without \nencouraging drug use.\n  I want to give an example. Beth Israel Medical Center in New York \nstudied needle exchange programs in the city and found that the program \nreduced infections by two-thirds--a very substantial program. The study \nfound that injection drug use did not increase at all in the city at \nthe same time. Similarly, a 1997 study by the National Institutes of \nHealth concluded that needle exchange programs reduced HIV by at least \n30 percent and reduced risk behaviors among drug injecting drug users.\n  In fact, needle exchange programs serve as an effective link to drug \ntreatment programs. So you get a double-edged benefit; not only do you \nlimit the spread of HIV/AIDS, but you introduce people to drug \ntreatment programs.\n  According to the recent CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 95 \npercent of needle exchange programs refer clients to substance abuse \ntreatment. Last year, the Surgeon General found that needle exchange \nnot only reduces HIV transmission but many may also reduce injection \ndrug use for these people who are in the programs. Reference to drug \ntreatment programs is a good thing. That is how we reduce this scourge \nin our country.\n  Mr. President, the District of Columbia and communities nationwide \nare facing a two-pronged public health crisis of injection drug use and \na persistent and growing HIV/AIDS epidemic. As many as half of all HIV \ninfections are caused by the sharing of HIV-contaminated injection \ntools.\n  I conclude by saying this is an important program that needs the \nSenate support. We can do a lot to make a big difference in our \ncommunities.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, more than 40,000 people a year become \ninfected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Half of all new HIV \ninfections in the United States occur among drug users.\n  In addition, approximately 4 million Americans have been infected \nwith the hepatitis C virus. Injection drug use is responsible for at \nleast 60 percent of those infections.\n  Numerous authorities, including the National Academy of Sciences, the \nSurgeon General, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the \nAmerican Medical Association, the Academy of Pediatrics, and the \nAmerican Public Health Association have concluded that needle-exchange \nprograms reduce the transmission of HIV and hepatitis C without \nencouraging the illegal use of drugs.\n  It is indefensible for Congress to tell the citizens of the District \nof Columbia that they cannot spend their own money on programs that \nstop the spread of fatal, infectious diseases. It is irresponsible for \nmembers of Congress to oppose a locally funded program on the ground \nthat it encourages illegal drug use, when every major health \norganization in the United States says that the opposite is true.\n  People's lives are at stake. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Allen \namendment.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, the Senate is currently considering the \nfiscal year 2002 District of Columbia Appropriations bill. I would like \nto recognize Senators Landrieu and DeWine for their strong leadership \nin moving this important bill through committee.\n  The District of Columbia shares a unique relationship with the \nFederal Government. It is the only locality in the country whose budget \nintersects so directly with Congress. Congress is charged with \napproving both the Federal and local budget for the District. \nConsequently, the city cannot move forward with its own new budget \nuntil the Congress finishes its work and approves the bill. I encourage \nthe Senate to approve this bill as quickly as possible.\n  Several amendments may be offered to this bill that impose Federal \nrestrictions on how the District of Columbia spends the money that it \ncollects in local taxes. The District of Columbia is fortunate to have \nsuch an able leader in Mayor Anthony Williams. This past year, the \nmayor, along with the city council, have put together a budget for the \ncity that reflects its own priorities that meet local needs. I do not \nintend to support amendments to this bill that impose restrictions on \nhow the District spends it money.\n  I would not want Congress telling St. Louis or Kansas City how to \nspend their local tax dollars. The same standard should be applied to \nthe District of Columbia. The District of Columbia is our Nation's \nCapital and an international symbol of democracy. The Congress should \nhonor the unique status of this city by allowing the District to make \nits own decisions on how taxes raised from its own citizens should be \nspent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield time to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I strongly support Chairman Landrieu's \nintention in the District of Columbia fiscal year 2002 appropriations \nbill to allow the city to use its own funds to support a needle \nexchange program in the city, and I oppose Senator Allen's amendment to \nrestrict the use of those funds. The current ban on the use of Federal \nfunds for this program remains intact in the legislation before us.\n  This issue truly is about the ability of an independent jurisdiction \nto use its locally raised revenue to support a program that its elected \nofficials have deemed appropriate.\n  In my own State of Rhode Island, for example, a needle exchange \nprogram\n\n[[Page S11512]]\n\ncalled ENCORE has existed in the city of Providence since 1995, \nsupported by local funds. This has been, and continues to be, a very \nsuccessful program. Many of the other programs in the 34 States that \ncurrently have either state-funded or city-funded needle exchange \nprograms also have been successful in decreasing the spread of HIV/\nAIDS.\n  There are currently well over 100 different needle exchange programs \naround the country working to effect this positive change.\n  The ENCORE program in Rhode Island has enrolled over 1,500 clients \nand provides education, counseling, access to sterile syringes, and \nreferrals to substance abuse treatment programs. Followup studies and \ndate continue to show that participants in this program have \nsubstantially reduced their risk behaviors.\n  However, the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to be very serious in my \nState, particularly as individuals with the disease are able to live \nlonger and therefore constitute a greater percentage of the State \npopulation. That is why the State of Rhode Island continues to look for \nnew methods to deal with the spread of this disease, and why programs \nlike ENCORE are so important.\n  The Surgeon General echoed this report in one of his own studies in \nMarch 2000, stating that ``there is conclusive scientific evidence that \nsyringe exchange programs, as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention \nstrategy, are an effective public health intervention that reduces \ntransmission of HIV and does not encourage the illegal use of drugs.'' \nThat has been the case in my own State, and that will be the case if we \nallow the District of Columbia to take a similar approach with its own \nfunds.\n  The District of Columbia has the highest rate of HIV and AIDS in the \ncountry, and therefore desperately needs the ability to tackle this \nproblem in its own way. Unfortunately, the city has been prevented from \nusing its own locally raised revenue to deal with this issue since 1999 \nin this appropriations bill.\n  In addition, in last year's D.C. appropriations bill, even private \nfunds were prevented from being used to support a program.\n  Today we have an opportunity in the bill before us to change this \nattitude and allow the city to enact a targeted and aggressive program \nto attempt to eradicate this deadly disease from a vulnerable \npopulation.\n  Several important public health organizations support this move, \nincluding the American Medical Association, the American Nurses \nAssociation, the American Public Health Association, the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors, as well D.C. \nMayor Anthony Williams and D.C. Police Chief Charles Ramsey. It is \nimperative that we add our support to this effort as well.\n  To reiterate, I commend the leadership of Senator Landrieu from \nLouisiana. Her position and the position of the committee is that the \nDistrict of Columbia should be allowed to spend its own money on a \nneedle exchange program. This is a program that has been embraced in 34 \nStates and over 100 cities. One of those cities is Providence, RI. \nProvidence has Operation ENCORE in which they provide a needle exchange \ntogether with education, counseling, and drug rehabilitation referrals. \nThe program works.\n  I come today with facts, with success, to argue that the District of \nColumbia should be allowed to use its own money to replicate successful \nprograms in other urban areas. They have a huge problem with AIDS in \ntheir community. This is a sensible, proven way to help people avoid \nthe scourge of infection with AIDS, and we should support it, not try \nto deny them this opportunity.\n  It is no surprise, based on the experience of Providence, which is, \nat this point, enrolling over 1,500 individuals successfully, that this \nprogram has been heralded by the Surgeon General as a great success. In \nhis words, in March of 2000:\n\n       There is conclusive scientific evidence that syringe \n     exchange programs, as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention \n     strategy, are an effective public health intervention that \n     reduces transmission of HIV and does not encourage the \n     illegal use of drugs.\n\n  ``Conclusive scientific evidence,'' and today we are here to try to \nrefute conclusive scientific evidence, which is at the heart of the \nproposal to strike this provision, and also to override the judgment of \nlocal authorities which is commonplace throughout this country in the \nover 100 municipalities that are running a program such as this.\n  If we want to rely upon science and also on the authority of \nlocalities to use their local funds as they wish, we have to reject \nthis Allen amendment and we have to support the position of the \ncommittee.\n  This position that drug programs featuring needle exchanges are \neffective is supported by a host of organizations: The American Medical \nAssociation, the American Nurses Association, the American Public \nHealth Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the U.S. \nConference of Mayors. It is clearly supported by the mayor of the \nDistrict of Columbia, Mayor Williams, and the police chief.\n  Those with the most interest in this program, with the most at risk, \nthe most at stake, are asking us to give them the chance to use their \nresources to provide for a needle exchange program to reduce the \ntransmission of AIDS and, as the Surgeon General pointed out, in no way \nwill this encourage the illegal use of drugs. I cannot think of a more \nsensible position to support.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Allen amendment and support \nChairman Landrieu's position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, our side rests its case. I believe our \nspeakers have concluded. Senator Durbin and I have some closing \nremarks, and I have some things to submit for the Record. I understand \nthe Senator from Virginia may have some time remaining on his side. I \nunderstand from the leader he would like to get to this vote as soon as \npossible. I inquire of the Senator from Virginia what his intentions \nare and how much time he intends to use.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Louisiana, I have \na few minutes, no more than 3 or 4, maybe 5 at most, of concluding \nremarks. The others on our side who wanted to speak are elsewhere, and \nthe vote will get them back here.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Virginia have 5 minutes and that we have 2 minutes for closing \nremarks, and then we will be ready to vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I certainly have no objection to the \nrequest. We have a number of Senators who have inquired as to when the \nvote will occur. I wonder if the two Senators can agree we can have the \nvote at 11:15 a.m.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Agreed.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Agreed.\n  Mr. REID. I pose that, Mr. President, as a unanimous consent request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana had requested in her unanimous consent \nrequest that the Senator from Virginia have 5 minutes and that she have \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. There will be time left over. That sounds great to me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, as Senators are getting ready to vote \non this amendment, my amendment actually keeps the policies the way \nthey have been in prior administrations. I cited General McCaffrey who \nwas the drug czar under President Clinton. General McCaffrey stated the \nproblem is not clean needles, the problem is drug addiction.\n  One thing that has arisen a great deal in this debate is not the \nmessage we are sending, although I think it is the wrong message if we \nactually say we are going to use taxpayer funds in the District of \nColumbia to give drug users, drug addicts, clean needles and syringes. \nThe evidence is clearly mixed on it. We can get evidence, I suppose, \nfrom those who are drug addicts. I would not consider them the most\n\n[[Page S11513]]\n\ncredible witnesses under any cross-examination. Indeed both sides cite \nstudies. Whether it is a study in New York or Vancouver or various \nother studies, these needle exchange networks only create networks for \ndrug users to exchange information and drugs and have no positive \nimpact whatsoever on drug use nor do they have an impact on stopping \nHIV transmission.\n  Of course, I do think AIDS and HIV ought to be addressed, but, as \nGeneral McCaffrey states, the way of doing it is not to encourage and \nfacilitate drug delivery devices that are cleaner than one would \nordinarily use.\n  The main argument, though, is a jurisdictional one. I have the same \ngeneral sentiments as the Senator from Illinois when we are talking \nabout local control. I really do not like it. Notice Virginia, of \ncourse, is not one of the States that allows needle exchange. I am one \nwho generally, as a matter of philosophy, trust the people in the \nStates. I believe the 10th amendment is very important as a part of our \nBill of Rights granting to the people in the States those rights that \nare not specifically granted to the Federal Government. But this is an \nissue that has to do with the District of Columbia.\n  The District of Columbia is under the purview and oversight of the \nCongress because it is the seat of Government. The part of the District \nof Columbia that remains is that which was ceded for the seat of \nGovernment by the State of Maryland. Virginia also granted some land, \nwhich is now Arlington County. It was not necessary, and it was retro-\nceded to Virginia.\n  Just to show how Congress recognizes its special role in oversight as \nfar as the District is concerned, both the House and the Senate have \nauthorizing subcommittees specifically to address the needs of the \nDistrict. There is no Chicago committee or Kansas City committee or \nOklahoma City committee or Los Angeles committee in the House nor a \nsubcommittee on them.\n  To argue this is a States rights issue or 10th amendment issue \nnegates and clouds the reality that we have a responsibility in the \nSenate to have oversight over the laws and the activities, the safety \nand the conduct in the District of Columbia.\n  It is my view that it would be the wise and prudent course of conduct \nto not have the Senate in any way condone granting free needles, or \nfree syringes to those who are engaged in and, in fact, are illegal \ndrug addicts. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will stand for that \nprinciple for the District of Columbia, which is looked upon as not \nonly our Nation's Capital but also the home of our legislative body, \nand of freedom of our representative democracy by people all over the \nworld.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for \nhis usual force and clarity in outlining many good arguments supporting \nthe tabling of the Allen amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from \nthe American Public Health Association, the District of Columbia \nHousing Authority, the nonprofit organization called Prevention Works, \nas well as the Whitman-Walker Clinic, Inc.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              District of Columbia\n\n\n                                            Housing Authority,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 2001.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Senate Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. C.W. Bill Young,\n     Chairman, House Appropriations Committee, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairmen Young and Stevens: As required by Section \n     150(b) of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106-522), the District of \n     Columbia Housing Authority Police Department (DCHAPD) submits \n     to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations its \n     report on illegal drug activity at or near any public housing \n     site where a needle exchange program is conducted.\n       During the reporting period from January 1, 2001, to May \n     31, 2001, Prevention Works was the only organization \n     administering a needle exchange program near a public housing \n     development. Distribution locations were at 15th and Ives \n     Streets, SE, which is near Hopkins Apartments located at 1430 \n     L Street, SE; Central and Southern Avenues SE, which is near \n     East Capitol Dwellings located at 5725 East Capitol Street, \n     SE; and 21st and H Streets NE, which is near Langston Terrace \n     located at 21st and Benning Road, NE. During this period, \n     there were no needle exchange distribution sites in operation \n     directly on public housing properties.\n       During the reporting period, we monitored each of the areas \n     where the needle exchange van operated near a public housing \n     site so as not to impact the behavior of needle exchange \n     clients. Based on our observations, the maximum amount of \n     time that the van remained at any one site was approximately \n     90 minutes. The activity in and around the van did not cause \n     any disturbances. People visiting the van were there long \n     enough to receive their supplies and usually left the area \n     immediately. There was also no evidence that the presence of \n     the needle exchange van led to increased crime. It should be \n     understood that the needle exchange ``sites'' are not \n     permanent sites, but rather stops on a weekly schedule of van \n     routes. It should also be noted that in addition to the \n     exchange of needles, the Prevention Works van provides free \n     food and coffee to anyone approaching the van. During the \n     reporting period, we received no resident complaints or \n     concerns regarding the operation of the needle exchange \n     program near the three public housing developments.\n       The DCHAPD will continue to monitor all disbursement sites \n     located near our public housing developments and report \n     accordingly. If you have need for further information, please \n     feel free to call DCHAPD, Chief Madison Jenkins, Jr., at \n     (202) 535-2588.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Michael Kelly,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           American Public Health Association,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2001.\n     Hon. Robert Byrd,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Byrd: The American Public Health Association \n     (APHA), consisting of more than 50,000 public health \n     professionals dedicated to advancing the nation's health, \n     strongly urges you to oppose any amendment to the FY 02 \n     District of Columbia Appropriations bill that would place \n     further restrictions on the District's needle exchange \n     programs. While APHA opposes any provision to ban the use of \n     federal, local or private money to fund needle exchange \n     programs, we are encouraged that the House Appropriations \n     Committee did not include last year's extraordinarily \n     burdensome restrictions on the operation of needle exchange \n     programs in the District. We urge your Committee to follow \n     the House Committee's lead and at a minimum, oppose last \n     year's operational restrictions.\n       Since 1994, APHA has advocated for the development, \n     implementation, evaluation, and funding of needle exchange \n     programs to help prevent HIV infection. All APHA public \n     policy is passed by the Association Governing Council and is \n     required to meet strict scientific criteria. APHA policy on \n     needle exchange is no different--an enormous body of \n     published research, including more than seven federally \n     sponsored reports, demonstrates that needle exchange programs \n     reduce the spread of HIV while not increasing drug use by \n     program participants or others in the community where the \n     program is conducted. These findings are also reflected in a \n     March 2000 report released by Surgeon General David Satcher \n     reviewing all of the scientific research on needle exchange \n     programs completed since 1998.\n       The current epidemiology of HIV/AIDS is clear--women and \n     children are affected disproportionately by heterosexual HIV \n     infection associated either directly or indirectly with \n     transmission from injectable drug users. These new cases of \n     HIV/AIDS that are linked to injectable drug use largely can \n     be prevented through the provision of sterile needles to drug \n     users coupled with other public health tools including health \n     education and condom distribution.\n       Needle exchange programs increase the contact that health \n     professionals have with injectable drug users, thereby \n     increasing opportunities to conduct health education and \n     disease prevention activities, including drug treatment and \n     counseling. The efficacy of these programs is proven--placing \n     further restrictions on funding and operations threaten the \n     District's efforts to reach those individuals most at risk of \n     HIV infection. Public health and saving lives must take \n     precedence over politics. Your opposition to any further \n     restrictions on these important public health programs is \n     critical.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views and your \n     attention to this critical public health matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      Mohammad N. Akhter, MD, MPH,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Whitman-Walker Clinic Inc,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 3, 2001.\n     Hon. Mary L. Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on the \n         District of Columbia, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: As Executive Director of the \n     Whitman-Walker Clinic, the largest HIV/AIDS service provider \n     in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, I again urge you \n     not to include language in this year's DC Appropriations bill \n     that would restrict the District's ability to prevent the \n     spread of HIV/AIDS.\n\n[[Page S11514]]\n\n       In previous years, the Congress has added a series of \n     overly restrictive prohibitions on the District's AIDS \n     prevention needle exchange program. This year, under your \n     leadership, we hope that you will respect the decisions and \n     policies of the District's elected officials and not include \n     such provisions in the bill. Further, we ask that you oppose \n     any efforts to add such restrictions by others during \n     consideration of the D.C. appropriations bill.\n       Sadly, the District of Columbia has one of the highest \n     rates of HIV/AIDS in the nation. As of December 31, 2000, \n     more than 13,000 people had been diagnosed with AIDS, and \n     more than 6,600 people were living with AIDS in the District. \n     Approximately, one-third of all AIDS cases in the District \n     are attributed to intravenous drug use. It is estimated that \n     1 in 20 adults is HIV positive.\n       The spread of HIV can be prevented, and one scientifically \n     proven way to do so is through needle exchange programs. \n     According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n     the number of these programs is increasing, with 131 needle \n     exchange programs across the country in at least 81 cities \n     and 31 states, plus the District of Columbia. Four of these \n     programs are conducted in the State of Michigan, with two in \n     Detroit, one in Grand Rapids, and one in Kalamazoo. Almost 40 \n     percent of all needle exchange programs receive public \n     funding. The good news is that recent data presented at the \n     2001 National HIV Prevention Conference shows that programs \n     are having an affect in decreasing new transmissions. \n     Moreover, exhaustive scientific studies have all concluded \n     that needle exchange programs reduce HIV infection and do not \n     increase drug use.\n       Needle exchange programs are supported by the American \n     Medical Association, the National Academy of Sciences, the \n     American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Bar Association, \n     and the U.S. Conference of Mayors, among others. Even the \n     recent United Nations Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, \n     signed by the United States, supports ``access to sterile \n     injecting equipment'' as one way of preventing the spread of \n     AIDS.\n       We have been heartened by your comments that you do not \n     support riders to the D.C. Appropriations Bill. We are also \n     pleased that, in transmitting the District's budget to the \n     Congress, the Bush Administration deleted section 150, which \n     placed unduly restrictive limitations on the operation of the \n     needle exchange program. We hope you will follow the lead of \n     the Bush Administration, and also delete these provisions \n     from last year's bill, and further, enable the District \n     government to fund the program as other cities are allowed to \n     do.\n       While the news of late has focused on the international \n     AIDS crisis, we have a crisis of our own in the District, \n     which particularly affects African Americans. District \n     leaders and health officials are doing their best to deal \n     with the HIV crisis at home. I know you care about the health \n     of the District's people, and trust that you will demonstrate \n     it when you consider the District's appropriations bill, and \n     the District life-saving needle exchange program.\n       Thank you for your continued support for the District of \n     Columbia. As you consider this issue, if you have any \n     questions or comments, please feel free to call me at 202/\n     797-3511.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               A. Cornelius Baker,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             Prevention Works,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 2001.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on the \n         District of Columbia, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: I am writing as the Executive \n     Director of Prevention Works, the needle exchange program in \n     the District of Columbia. Our mission is to curb the spread \n     of HIV, hepatitis, and other blood-borne diseases among drug \n     users, their sexual partners, and newborn children. The \n     District has an AIDS rate over 10 times the national average. \n     According to Health Department statistics, 36% of people \n     living with AIDS here have been injection drug users. In \n     addition, almost a third (31%) of the cases attributed to \n     heterosexual contact involved sex with a drug injector. Our \n     outreach and education are crucial to the health of our \n     entire community.\n       Elected officials in the District are aware of the AIDS \n     pandemic here and its connection to drug use. That is why \n     they funded the needle exchange program from 1996 to 1998. \n     Since October 1998 Congress has prohibited the District from \n     using logically raised public funds to support needle \n     exchange. This lack of public funding has had dramatic \n     effects on our program and on our community, as has this \n     year's Congressionally-mandated relocation of all exchange \n     sites to a limited area of the city.\n       Program Instability: Prevention Works cannot guarantee the \n     same level of services each month because of insecure private \n     funding.\n       Service Reliability Impaired: Having to move our exchange \n     sites has resulted in a diminished client base because \n     clients can not find the program. The change appears \n     arbitrary to clients, and because sites no longer conform to \n     patterns of high drug activity, many clients have been lost \n     and may never reaccess services.\n       Program Services and Refferals Compromised: Having to \n     monitor Congressional activity and pursue smaller and more \n     numerous private funding streams means that valuable program \n     resources are directed to these administrative activities. \n     Resources for monitoring and improving services are lost and \n     the quality of linkages with drug treatment and other \n     services are compromised. Organizations that are allowed to \n     get larger and more predictable public funding do not face \n     this challenge.\n       Obstacle to Collaboration: Prevention Works may be a \n     client's first or only contact with the comprehensive network \n     of service providers in the District. However, our clients' \n     access to substance abuse treatment and the rest of the \n     public health infrastructure is hindered because community-\n     based organizations and government agencies are hesitant to \n     work with Prevention Works because of understandable fears of \n     repercussions on their own public funding.\n       Participants Concerns: Increased restrictions affect \n     program consumers and increase the general stigma associated \n     with needle exchange. This increased stigma drives clients \n     further underground rendering this population even more \n     difficult to reach. Increased restrictions do not result in \n     less drug use, but they do lessen trust among a predominantly \n     African American population that has been historically \n     alienated from the public health establishment.\n       Community Health Needs Ignored: Reducing HIV and other \n     health risks among people who inject drugs is a national \n     priority as defined in Healthy People 2010. Currently \n     prohibited by Congress from funding Prevention Works--the \n     only program with an established presence among this \n     marginalized and hidden population--the District has no \n     chance of effectively achieving these federally defined \n     objectives. In addition, because of new performance-based \n     funding guidelines, the ban on local funding for needle \n     exchange places future District funding in even more \n     jeopardy.\n       The federally imposed restrictions on needle exchange do \n     not improve the health of any District resident. They merely \n     limit effective outreach and prevention of deadly disease \n     among the city's most vulnerable residents.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Paola Barahona, MPH,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Again, I ask the Senator from Illinois for any closing \nremarks he might add.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute and 10 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank all those who have joined me on this side, \nincluding the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The District of Columbia is facing the worst HIV/AIDS epidemic in \nAmerica, nine times worse than the national average. The medical \ncommunity and the law enforcement community of this city have asked us \nto give them the tools and weapons to fight this epidemic.\n  The needle exchange program has proven successful in fighting this \nepidemic. That is why we have to defeat the Allen amendment. To do \notherwise is to ignore the American Medical Association and every major \npublic health group that has told us that needle exchange programs \nwork. To reject the medical and scientific evidence and to take away \nthis weapon against the war on drugs and the war on HIV and AIDS is \nwrong.\n  We appropriate less than 10 percent of the funds the district will \nspend out of Congress. The rest is their own money, and they are only \nasking to spend their own money as 34 other States do for programs that \nthey think are important to protect their citizens.\n  The Senator from Virginia may not be surprised to find some Virginia \nlicense plates at the needle exchange program in DC. We need to keep \nthis program in place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I move the Allen amendment be tabled, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nNickles also be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S11515]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is recognized to offer an amendment on which there shall be 60 \nminutes equally divided, 30 minutes of which are to be used at this \ntime.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, if the Senator from Texas will yield for \njust a moment as she prepares to speak on her amendment, as you know, \nwe have had a lot of consensus in this underlying bill. We have worked \nvery hard through many stages of our committee to bring consensus on \nsome of these issues. There is one issue that is going to require some \ndebate and discussion. I hope between what Senator Hutchison can bring \nto this debate and Senator Durbin, we might be able to come to some \njoint resolution. It is unclear at this point if that will happen. This \ndebate is going to move forward.\n  I have to say with all due respect to both Senators, with whom I have \nvisited at length about this issue--so has Senator DeWine--both have \ngenuine concerns for the schoolchildren of the District and the well-\nbeing of the school districts. They are both very passionate about \nthese particular views. We were unable to come to a resolution. So this \ndebate will ensue.\n  I would like to speak about a couple of things which are of concern \nto me as manager of this bill and as the appropriations chair for the \ncommittee.\n  It is very disconcerting that we cannot get the kind of information \nfrom the District, or the CFO, or the school board, or any other \nfinancial entity to give us the details of outstanding judgments--how \nmuch they are, how many there are, and that kind of information. We are \nnot able to verify some of the information that was sent to us, which \nitself is a problem to me not only as manager of the bill but as chair \nof this committee.\n\n  I hope we will be respectful of that issue as we debate whether it is \nappropriate to have caps for attorneys representing children and \nfamilies with special needs--whether or not it is appropriate to have \ncaps based on the data. But if people are looking to us or to the staff \nfor some specifics, we have tried our best. It is a real problem, when \nwe don't have this information, to be able to explain to people for the \nbenefit of debate how much the judgments are that are outstanding, how \nmany there are, what moneys we may be saving, what moneys we may be \nspending, and what the interest rates are. It would be very pertinent \nin trying to resolve this issue.\n  I say to the Senator from Texas and to the Senator from Illinois that \nwe cannot really trust the documents we have. We will just do the best \nwe can.\n  I appreciate the Senators feeling so strongly about their respective \npositions and hope the outcome will be something that will serve the \nchildren of the District, their parents, the school system, and the \ntaxpayers in the fairest manner possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2110\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison), for herself and \n     Mr. Sessions, proposes an amendment numbered 2110.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Under ``General Provisions'' insert the following new \n     section:\n       Sec.  . (a) None of the funds contained in this Act may be \n     made available to pay the fees of an attorney who represents \n     a party who prevails in an action or any attorney who defends \n     any action, including an administrative proceeding, brought \n     against the District of Columbia Public Schools under the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 \n     et seq.) If--\n       (1) the hourly rate of compensation of the attorney exceeds \n     300 percent of the maximum amount of compensation under \n     section 11-2604(b)(1), District of Columbia Code; or\n       (2) the maximum amount of compensation of the attorney \n     exceeds 300 percent of the maximum amount of compensation \n     under section 11-2604(b)(1), District of Columbia Code, \n     except that compensation and reimbursement in excess of such \n     maximum may be approved for extended or complex \n     representation in accordance with section 11-2604(c), \n     District of Columbia Code; and\n       (3) in no case may the compensation limits in paragraphs \n     (1) and (2) exceed $3,000.\n       (b) Notwithstanding the preceding subsection, if the Mayor \n     and the Superintendent of the District of Columbia Public \n     Schools concur in a Memorandum of Understanding setting forth \n     a new rate and amount of compensation, or a new limit \n     referred to in subsection (a)(3), then such new rates or \n     limits shall apply in lieu of the rates and limits set forth \n     in the preceding subsection to both the attorney who \n     represents the prevailing party and the attorney who defends \n     the action.\n       (c) Notwithstanding 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1415, 42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1988, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 794a, or any other law, none of the \n     funds appropriated under this Act, or in appropriations acts \n     for subsequent fiscal years, may be made available to pay \n     attorneys' fees accrued prior to the effective date of this \n     Act that exceeds a cap imposed on attorney's fees by prior \n     appropriations acts that were in effect during the fiscal \n     year when the work was performed, or when payment was \n     requested for work previously performed, in an action brought \n     against the District of Columbia Public Schools under the \n     Individuals With Disabilities Act (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1400 et \n     seq.).\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, Senator Sessions and I are offering \nthis amendment for one simple reason: We want to improve the quality of \neducation for the District of Columbia. Our amendment will preserve an \nestimated $44 million for special education funding in the District.\n  The amendment will continue a provision contained in the last three \nDC appropriations bills that cap the allowable fees an attorney may \ncharge for a child's special education placement in the District of \nColumbia. We raise the cap in the present law from $125 an hour to $150 \nper hour, and a per-case limit from $2,500 to $3,000.\n  Our amendment also continues a provision contained in last year's \nbill that allows the District of Columbia, acting through the mayor and \nschool superintendent, to waive those caps if they believe it is in the \nbest interest of the D.C. students to do so.\n  I also point out that our amendment will prevent an estimated $32 \nmillion in retroactive attorney's fees from being awarded, as has been \nthreatened by the D.C. Circuit Court. That court has ruled that should \nthis fee cap be lifted, they will go back and actually undo the will of \nCongress by awarding all the billed attorney fees in excess of the caps \nduring the last 3 years.\n  Our amendment is supported by the school board and the superintendent \nof\n\n[[Page S11516]]\n\nschools in the District. And the mayor has told me he also has \nsupported this. They support it because it allows them to put the \ndollars in education for the children. They are trying to use the money \nfor the education programs. In fact, they have put the money they have \nsaved since the caps were put in place, that would have gone to \nattorney's fees, into the special needs programs, and they have \nincreased the number of children who now can be taken into the \nprograms.\n  Why is our amendment necessary? In fiscal year 1998, the District of \nColumbia spent $14 million solely to pay attorneys who challenged the \nDistrict's placement of special education children. The next year, in \nfiscal year 1999, the District spent $3.5 million in attorney's fees. \nThis meant that the District had approximately $10 million in \nadditional funds for the education of these children. The District \nallocated all this money saved to improving the quality of their \nspecial education programs.\n  And those programs have continued. Over the next 3 years, D.C. \nallocated $32 million in funds that would otherwise have gone to pay \nattorneys to improving special education programs for disabled and \nspecial needs children.\n  This effort has significantly improved the availability and quality \nof special education. They have also been able to reduce the backlog of \ninitial assessments of special education children from 1,805, before \nthe imposition of the cap, to 143 as of March of this year.\n  Now they are hiring new special education teachers, purchasing new \nassistive medical devices, and providing new training and education for \nexisting special education teachers.\n  So what we are trying to do with this amendment is make sure the \neducation dollars, which are so crucial for the District to improve the \nquality of education and the quality of special education, stay in the \neducation budget rather than going to pay lawyer's fees.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter the president of the school \nboard and the superintendent of D.C. schools have written in support of \nour amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              District of Columbia\n\n\n                                           Board of Education,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 2001.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: On behalf of the District of \n     Columbia Board of Education and the DC Public Schools, we are \n     writing to strongly urge you to include language in the FY \n     2002 appropriations bill for the District of Columbia that \n     provides a cap on the amount of funds expended for special \n     education attorney fees. Specifically, we are requesting \n     language comparable to that contained in the District of \n     Columbia Appropriations Act of 2001, P.L. 106-522.\n       It is our determination that the exclusion of such language \n     could result in an additional cost of at least $44 million to \n     the District of Columbia Public Schools in FY 2002 (including \n     approximately $32 million in fees subject to the cap in FY \n     1999 through FY 2001 that could now be billed, plus at least \n     $12 million in new fees no longer subject to the cap). It is \n     our collective opinion that the result of such an expenditure \n     will seriously and adversely affect our ability to provide \n     educational materials, textbooks, and operational support to \n     the students, teachers, and staff of the DC schools. This \n     will, as a consequence, further jeopardize the opportunity of \n     our children to receive a quality education.\n       We are grateful for your past support of our efforts to \n     improve the quality of education provided to the children of \n     our City and we look forward to working with you to continue \n     to build upon our growing accomplishments. Your support of \n     this request will be a significant step toward further \n     realization of our mutual goals for education.\n       Thank you in advance for your consideration of this matter. \n     Should you have any questions or require additional \n     information, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n           Respectfully,\n     Ms. Peggy Cooper Cafritz,\n       President.\n     Dr. Paul L. Vance,\n       Superintendent.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would like to read briefly from that letter:\n\n       It is our determination that the exclusion of [the cap] \n     could result in an additional cost of at least $44 million to \n     the District of Columbia Public Schools in FY 2002. . . . It \n     is our collective opinion that the result of such an \n     expenditure will seriously and adversely affect our ability \n     to provide education materials, textbooks, and operational \n     support to the students, teachers, and staff of the DC \n     schools. This will, as a consequence, further jeopardize the \n     opportunity of our children to receive a quality education.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It is a reasonable \ncap. We are not trying to starve lawyers. We want legitimate lawyers to \nbe able to earn a living. But $150 an hour is quite a legitimate amount \nto spend. I think if anyone has the legitimate interests of the school \ndistrict at heart, they will listen to the superintendent of schools \nand the president of the school board to let them do what they believe \nthey need to do to improve the education in the schools. And they do \nnot want to spend this money on lawyer's fees.\n  They are doing the best they can. There are no complaints--or maybe \nthere are complaints; I guess there are complaints against every school \ndistrict, but there are no complaints that they are not making every \neffort to increase the quality of and the number of children they can \nserve in these special needs classes.\n  Madam President, I now would like to reserve the remainder of my \ntime. I ask that either Senator Durbin or Senator Sessions be allowed \nto speak. Senator Sessions is my cosponsor. I do not know if Senator \nDurbin wishes to speak first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Who yields time?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I yield time, as stated in the \nunanimous consent agreement, to the Senator from Illinois for a \nresponse to this amendment. Then probably, after the Senator from \nIllinois speaks, the Senator from Alabama would like to speak. And then \nSenator Murray could be recognized in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the chair of the subcommittee for yielding to me.\n  Madam President, several years ago Congress decided to pass a law \nwhich was revolutionary. It said that in the United States of America, \nif you had a child who needed special educational assistance, we were \ngoing to try to help that child. It really was a commitment that had \nnever been made before.\n  I can recall, as a child growing up in my small hometown, that it was \nrare to see kids with learning disabilities and physical disabilities \nin my classroom. I do not know where those kids were. They were \ncertainly here on Earth, but they were not in the classroom.\n  So Congress said: We are going to change that. We are going to open \nthe doors of education in the schools across America to children with \nspecial needs--kids who are disabled, mentally and physically, kids who \nhave learning disabilities. We are going to give them a chance.\n  That bill passed with an overwhelming, bipartisan vote because it \nsounded so right and so American for us to stand up and say: That is \nwhy America will be different.\n  We knew, when we passed that bill, it would not be easy because many \nof these children really need special attention. I have seen it in \nclassrooms across Illinois and people have seen it across the Nation. \nBut the success stories are so gratifying, that children, who would \nhave been tossed in the trash heap just a few years ago, are given a \nchance. With special education and special assistance, they can become \nproductive citizens in America and have a good, wholesome, and happy \nlife.\n  Democrats and Republicans said: This is a good thing for us to do. \nBut what are we going to do about school districts that turn these kids \ndown, that will not give them the chance to go into the schools, where \nthe parents are distraught, where they have no place to turn? What are \nwe going to do in that situation?\n  The law said, if it comes to that, if the school district will not \naccept the child who needs special education, there may have to be a \nhearing. Of course, hearings involve attorneys. An attorney would have \nto stand up for that child and that child's family and try to give that \nchild the chance the parents want.\n  Who will pay for that attorney, because some of these kids are from \nthe poorest families in America. They are not all rich families and \nrich kids. The law said, when it comes to that issue, the court will \ndecide. If the attorney representing that disabled child--a child with \na learning problem--prevails\n\n[[Page S11517]]\n\nin the lawsuit, the court can award attorney fees to the attorney who \nrepresented the child, and the school district that resisted bringing \nthe child in for special education will have to pay the attorney fees.\n  I have just stated the law in America. Through her amendment, the \nSenator from Texas wants to change what I have just described in one \ncity--the District of Columbia--to say that in this, the Nation's \nCapital, we will not play by the same rules that Texas, Louisiana, \nOhio, and every other State, including Alabama, plays by. No. In the \nDistrict of Columbia we are going to do it differently. We are going to \nsay, in the District of Columbia, no matter how complicated the case, \nno matter how many problems that child might have, no matter how many \nhearings might be necessary, no matter how much effort is put up by the \nschool board to stop this child from coming into special education, no \nmatter how much is involved in it, no attorney is paid more than \n$3,000, period--none, not a penny.\n  That $3,000 limit does not apply in Texas, does not apply in \nIllinois, Washington State, Alabama, or any other State. The Senator \nfrom Texas would have us apply that here in the District of Columbia.\n  So when you put a limit on the attorney's fees in complicated and \ndifficult cases, how easy is it for a person, a family, a mother and a \nfather, to find an attorney to represent their son or daughter? It \nbecomes increasingly difficult.\n\n  What the Hutchison amendment does is to close the courthouse door, \nclose the opportunity for administrative hearings for children who are \nseeking special education in the District of Columbia.\n  Need I remind my colleagues, the District of Columbia is one of the \npoorest cities in America. There are children in this city who, through \nno fault of their own, came to the Earth in the usual way--as Harry \nChapin used to sing in a song--who came to the Earth in the usual way \nwith a lot of problems, disabilities. These kids, through no fault of \ntheir own, will find the schoolhouse door is closed to them because of \nthe Hutchison amendment.\n  She has said these kids cannot have the same legal representation as \nchildren all across America who are asking for an opportunity for \nspecial education. Her war is against trial lawyers. I used to be one. \nI plead guilty as charged, Your Honor. But I can tell you, to say that \nno lawyer will spend more than 20 hours on any case involving special \neducation is just terrible. It is terrible when you consider the \noutcome. The losers here won't be the trial lawyers. They will find \nother work. The losers be will be the children and their families who \ndo not want to give up hope for these kids.\n  Senator Hutchison says it is a matter of dollars and cents: Either \ngive it to the trial lawyers or give it to the school district. \nCertainly, the schools of D.C. and schools across America need more \nmoney. But does this meet the test of fairness and justice? Does it \nmeet the test of those who proudly voted for the IDEA legislation and \nsaid they really cared about special education? It does not meet that \ntest.\n  Let me tell you something else that is unintended perhaps but has to \nbe said: When Senator Hutchison limits the amount the District of \nColumbia can pay to any lawyer representing any child, no matter how \ncomplicated the case, to $3,000, do you know what the D.C. courts have \nsaid? They have said: We reject that. We are going to award to these \nattorneys the fees to which they are reasonably entitled. We understand \nthe D.C. appropriations bill passed by Congress may limit how much \nCongress can pay out to those lawyers, but that is not going to limit \nour right under the IDEA bill to award these attorney's fees.\n  So what has happened?\n  Let's assume in a case that an attorney works long and hard for many \nyears on a special education case and the court says, you are entitled \nto $10,000 in attorney's fees. The Hutchison amendment says, no, D.C. \ncan only pay $3,000. What happens to the difference; what happens to \nthe $7,000? The $7,000 is still an obligation of the District of \nColumbia. Senator Hutchison is not doing the District any favor.\n  What is happening is all of these awards in court above the Hutchison \npayment level continue to build up in the District of Columbia, and \ninterest is running on them. This mountain of debt for the District of \nColumbia is going to be there whether Senator Hutchison or Senator \nDurbin like it or not. It is a reality. In every city and school \ndistrict across America, they face their legal obligation--in Texas, \nLouisiana, Alabama, and in Illinois. But Senator Hutchison would say we \nwon't face that legal obligation when it comes to the District of \nColumbia.\n  The root problem is the weakness and poor performance of the D.C. \npublic school system. They come racing to us now and say, we don't want \nthe attorneys who want children to come in as special education \nchildren to be paid what they are entitled to be paid by the court.\n\n  Litigation is merely a symptom of a larger problem. Fifteen percent \nof the kids in the D.C. public school system are special needs \nchildren, 10,500 children. The appropriate way to reduce the burden of \nlitigation on the D.C. public school system is for the system to comply \nwith the law and provide the services and education that children with \nspecial needs deserve in every State in the Union, and every school \ndistrict in America plays by those rules. But not under the Hutchison \namendment. She has said there will be one exception: the District of \nColumbia, one of the poorest cities in America with children suffering \nfrom learning disabilities. That system, those children, those families \nwill not have the same legal representation as kids across America.\n  Singling out the District of Columbia is just plain wrong. This isn't \na war against trial lawyers. This is a war against poor children who \nneed a helping hand. That is just not fair.\n  I asked before in the earlier debate, why is it when this \nappropriations bill comes to the floor, every Member of the Senate and \nHouse wants to turn into a mayor or a member of the city council? Time \nand again we defer these judgments to the city council and mayor. In \nSpringfield, IL, and Chicago, IL, we say: It is your call. When it \ncomes to the District of Columbia, no, we want to superimpose our \ndecision, our judgment. It is not fair for the District of Columbia \npublic school system to be standing here begging to be treated as a \nhome rule unit and then say to Congress: Make sure you carve out a \nlittle exception for D.C. when it comes to special education students. \nThey want to have it both ways.\n  The mayor, whom I respect very much, has talked out of both sides of \nhis mouth on this issue. I don't know where he stands on this issue. I \ncan't follow it. I really respect this man. But eight members of the \nD.C. city council have written a letter, a compelling letter. I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter from the D.C. council of September 24 \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    Council of the\n\n\n                                         District of Columbia,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 24, 2001.\n     Re: special education attorney fees.\n\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Chairwoman, Subcommittee on the District of Columbia, Senate \n         Committee on Appropriations, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: As the Congress considers the \n     District's appropriation for fiscal year 2002 we understand \n     that the House has dropped any provision limiting attorney \n     fees in special education cases. We hope and urge that the \n     Senate agree.\n       As you know, the federal Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) mandates special \n     education for children with learning disabilities, and \n     provides that where a child must go to court to effect his or \n     her right that child (if he wins) is entitled to have his \n     attorney's fees paid by the government. That the District has \n     been singled out for the last three years with a limit on the \n     fees has been a matter of great controversy.\n       The position of the Council and Mayor is quite clear: we \n     adopted a proposed budget that contains no cap on attorneys \n     fees. Our objections to a fee cap include:\n       A cap makes it more difficult for children to obtain \n     special education to which they are entitled. It is a simple \n     fact: a cap on fees reduces the number of attorneys willing \n     to take such cases and, therefore, reduces access to counsel.\n       A cap discriminates against low income children. Affluent \n     families can afford legal representation; the cap affects \n     them but they still have an economic ability to help their \n     children.\n\n[[Page S11518]]\n\n       The effect of the cap is to treat the children of the \n     District of Columbia differently--and less favorably--than \n     any other child in any other state in the nation. District \n     children have fewer rights with the cap.\n       The way to improve special education in the District of \n     Columbia must be programmatic--improve the programs rather \n     than limit the advocacy for special needs children.\n       We want public school children to obtain the best possible \n     education. Reforms must be done in a way that does not \n     disadvantage children. It is our strongly held view that the \n     cap on attorney fees places already vulnerable children at an \n     even greater disadvantage. For all of these reasons we ask \n     that the Senate follow the House and eschew any provision \n     limiting attorneys fees for prevailing parties under the \n     federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sharon Ambrose,\n       Ward 6.\n     David Catania,\n       At-Large.\n     Kevin Chavous,\n       Chairman Comm. on Education & Libraries.\n     Adrian Fenty,\n       Ward 4.\n     Jim Graham,\n       Ward 1.\n     Phil Mendelson,\n       At-Large.\n     Kathy Patterson,\n       Ward 3.\n     Carol Schwartz,\n       At-Large.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. These include Republican as well as Democratic and \nIndependent members of the council. They write in part:\n\n       The position of the Council and Mayor is quite clear: we \n     adopted a proposed budget that contains no cap on attorneys \n     fees. Our objections to a fee cap include:\n       A cap makes it more difficult for children to obtain \n     special education to which they are entitled. It is a simple \n     fact: a cap on fees reduces the number of attorneys willing \n     to take such cases and, therefore, reduces access to counsel.\n       A cap discriminates against low income children.\n       The effect of the cap is to treat the children of the \n     District of Columbia differently--and less favorably--than \n     any other child in any other state in the nation.\n\n  I was a practicing attorney before I came to Congress, and there are \nsome wonderful people who are involved in pro bono--free--legal work. \nThey do great work. There are also some attorneys who can't find any \nother kind of work; they are not up to it. I don't think we should put \nthe future and fate of these special ed kids in the hands of an \nattorney who may or may not be qualified to handle the case. That is \nexactly what we are doing.\n  This is discrimination against the special ed kids in the District of \nColumbia. The District of Columbia school system should be ashamed that \nthey have called on this Congress to perpetuate this injustice. I hope \nthis Congress will think twice. If you voted proudly for IDEA, if you \nreally stand for children with disabilities, then for goodness' sake \ngive them the legal rights to pursue the right they have under law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. May I inquire how much time the Senator from Alabama \nmight need to speak on this amendment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will finish the time of Senator Hutchison. How much \ntime does the Senator have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That would be fine, of course, under the consent \nagreement, because the Senator from Washington State is on the floor \nand wants to speak not on this amendment but as in morning business. I \nwas just inquiring. The Senator from Alabama is entitled to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act has done a lot of great things. It has had a consistently \nstrong goal to mainstream disabled children into regular classrooms.\n  I have in the last year or so visited 20 schools in my State. I try \nto take the opportunity each time to meet with the principals and \nteachers in a conference and ask them about their problems, what are \ntheir frustrations, what is working, what is not working, what can we \ndo in the Federal Government to help them.\n  The thing I hear over and over again--and I ask Senators if they hear \nthe same thing; I suspect they do--is that the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act has become a legal nightmare. It has created \nlaws that are not helpful and are costing the schools tremendous sums \nof money in litigation. It is not helping children in ways we would \nlike to help them. Yes, we want to mainstream every child who can be \nmainstreamed.\n  I will share this story. I attended a wonderful, award-winning \nelementary school in a mid-size town in Alabama. It was so well \ndecorated. It was the first week of the school year. The classrooms \nwere well appointed, well organized, with bulletin boards of first \nquality. My wife taught elementary school a number of years, and I know \nabout those things and what you are supposed to do. The principal told \nme this story.\n  He said: The first day of school, when we were working as hard as we \ncould to do all the things necessary to make that first day a great day \nfor the kids, I spent that afternoon and until 7:30 that night with 13 \nindividuals, including a group of lawyers, over how long an individual \nchild should be kept in the mainstream classroom.\n  This child had a serious emotional disability and was not going to be \nremoved from school but would be put in an alternative setting where \nthe disability could be dealt with. But the parents and lawyers wanted \nthe child to be mainstreamed. In the previous year, I believe that \nchild had been in the classroom 1 hour a day. The principal had \nconcluded the child didn't need to do that. He was disrupting the \nclassroom and the child would not benefit from being in the classroom \nan hour a day, and he decided to change that policy. So they did that \nunder the individual plan for the child. As a result, an objection was \nraised. The compromise--he told me this, and I find this unbelievable--\nwas that the child was allowed to be in the classroom for 15 minutes a \nday. After all of that.\n  As part of that settlement, the school was obligated to pay the \nlawyer who brought the allegation because the child had prevailed--at \nleast in some part. So they had to pay the lawyer's fee for their \nlawyers and the lawyer's fee of the people on the other side. The \nteachers and all who had relevant information about this had to disrupt \ntheir first day of school to meet and meet and meet. They had to \nprepare and they had to talk to experts and have expert testimony about \nthis child and what they could do--all because of the Federal education \ndisabilities act.\n  We want to help children who can be in the classroom--children who \nhave sight disability, who can't hear, or children who have other \ndisabilities and are in wheelchairs; they need to be mainstreamed. We \nwant to achieve that. Nothing here would say otherwise. There are a lot \nof problem areas, though, and there is a cottage industry of lawyers \nwho are filing lawsuits regularly.\n  The District of Columbia tells us they had nearly 2,000 cases last \nyear, and they are over the kinds of issues about which I am talking. \nThese children are not being thrown on the ash heap. The question often \nis, What kind of program or benefit do they get? Do they stay in the \nmain classroom or go to a special education classroom.\n  We had a case in Alabama--and this is true all over America--where a \nchild was so unable to control himself--apparently unable, or at least \ndid not control himself--an aide was hired by the State to meet him at \nthe school bus stop in the morning, go to school with that child, sit \nwith him all day in the classroom, and come home with him in the \nafternoon. This is happening all over America.\n  The lawyers and the regulations are impacting principals and teachers \nwho love children. They want to see children do well, and they want to \nsee every child reach their highest and fullest potential; but they are \nbeing handicapped by complex regulations and litigation. I say that in \ngeneral. Then I will say this: $150 an hour is not unusual. There are a \nlot of regulations that we have where the hourly fees are lower than \nthat. Criminal defense attorneys are paid less than that in most States \nin America. $150 an hour is a 20-percent increase over the current law.\n  This Hutchison amendment is a 20-percent increase over current law in \nthe District of Columbia. This was requested by the District of \nColumbia. They say, well, you don't cap other lawyer's fees. Other \nlawyers don't have their fees capped.\n\n[[Page S11519]]\n\n  Let me say this: If someone cheats you on a contract and you sue them \nand you win the lawsuit, they don't pay you anything for legal fees, \nunless it is in the contract, which it normally is not. Most people in \nAmerica file a lawsuit, they pay their lawyer out of what they recover. \nSo we have given a special advantage to lawyers in disability cases and \nin several other instances in lawsuits against Government agencies. We \nhave agreed to pay their legal fees, but they are not guaranteed \nunlimited legal fees, guaranteed to be paid forever, however much they \nwant or whatever some judge may agree to award them.\n\n  So I think this is a reasonable amendment. It is a serious request of \nthe school board of this city, which is facing an avalanche of \nlawsuits. There were nearly 2,000 last year. None of this money that is \nexpended--the $10.5 million that was saved last year is not being \nthrown away. The $10.5 million that is saved can be used to help \ndisabled children and provide them better programs. If we pay out more \nmoney in legal fees, from where do people think it is coming? It is \ncoming from the children. That is where it is coming from--the people \nwe want to help. We need to address nationally some of the litigation \nthat is arising with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. \nThere is not a superintendent of schools in America who has been on the \njob very long, I suggest--or certainly very few who would suggest this \nsystem is working effectively.\n  Principals tell me all the time it is a nightmare for them. It is \ndisrupting their ability to educate our children. They tell me the \nchild who is getting hurt is the average child. There are special \nprograms for the bright children and for those with disabilities, but \nthe average child is getting shortchanged. Oftentimes, teachers are so \nfrustrated they are leaving the profession. They are being sued for how \nthey handle difficult circumstances.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Alabama has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and reiterate my support for the \nHutchison amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I want to speak for a moment. The \nSenator from Washington wants to be recognized. I want to say this: I \nvoted with Senator Sessions on the last amendment he offered on this \nsubject. I actually agreed very strongly with what he said. Many of us \non both sides of the aisle voted with him, as he has outlined so \nbeautifully some of the real problems with special education as far as \nFederal rules and regulations go. We are all well intended. We all want \nto help these children, but there is a major disagreement and debate \nabout whether the rules are actually helping or hurting.\n  The Senator is absolutely correct that many of our resources are not \nbeing devoted to sort of mainstream children because of the complicated \nrules about special needs and also gifted children. It is a problem and \nit has to be worked out. I agree with the Senator. My disagreement is \nthat this amendment doesn't actually fix that problem, and it makes it \nworse, not better, which is why I probably cannot support this exact \namendment and why we have tried to work out some compromise between the \nSenators.\n  I wanted to say that for the record, and I want to also say that in \nlimiting the attorney's fees to $150 an hour, which doesn't seem to \nmany people to be much of a limit--that is quite a lot of money to \nmake, particularly in these times. But the problem the Senator, as an \nattorney and prosecutor, should know is the real problem is the overall \nlimit of $3,000 per case.\n\n  So what happens is an attorney basically can only spend 2\\1/2\\ days. \nThat would allow them to process one or two motions and may not cover \nthem until the end of the case.\n  These are long and complicated and, as he has described, very \ndifficult cases. That is the problem Senator Durbin is trying to raise. \nSo I hope we can resolve it. Maybe the good prosecutor, my colleague \nfrom Alabama, would have a suggestion about that to us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/07/senate-section/article/S11519-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Her dad is a disabled Vietnam vet. I ask \nunanimous consent that the committee-reported substitute amendment be \nagreed to, that the bill, as amended, be read three times, passed, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. There is objection on this side, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I have to say, not so much to my \ncolleague from Alabama because he is really objecting on behalf of \nsomeone else, that I find this process to be absolutely outrageous.\n  I believe the veterans community finds this process to be absolutely \noutrageous. This is the fourth or the fifth time I have come to the \nSenate to ask unanimous consent to pass this legislation. We have a \nsimilar version in the House of Representatives that has passed. We can \nreally get this done.\n  This is an anonymous hold that has been put on this bill. I have to \nsay I am more than surprised. I have now become indignant that we have \na Senator on the other side who will not come to the Senate Chamber and \ndebate me on this legislation and express his or her opposition and \nreasons why.\n  This legislation passed out of the Veterans Committee I think on a \n21-0 vote. It was unanimous. It was Democrats and Republicans alike.\n  It is a familiar principle among veterans in our Armed Forces that we \ndo not leave our wounded behind. Homeless veterans are our wounded, and \nwe are leaving them behind. The VA has reported there were about \n345,000 homeless vets in our country in 1999, and there are yet even \nmore homeless veterans as we see this economic downturn.\n  What does the bill do? It sets a national goal to end homelessness \namong veterans within 10 years. Who is opposed to that? The bill \nprovides funding, authorizes $50 million for some programs that really \nhave a good track record--I will not even go over all of them today--\nfor job training, for treatment for addiction, for other transitional \nservices that are so critical to veterans: job counseling, social \nservices, medical services, assistance in getting into affordable \nhousing, calls for VA comprehensive homeless centers in our major \nmetropolitan areas in America today to have kind of a one-stop \ncontinuum of services for veterans.\n  I would like to know what is going on in the Senate. I would like to \nknow why this legislation is being blocked. I will say with great \nregret--I said it\n\n[[Page S11520]]\n\nlast week, and I said it the week before--I will put a hold on all the \nlegislation, not the major appropriations bills and judicial \nappointments, that individual Senators on the other side have \nsponsored. This legislation should go through on unanimous consent. It \nis not controversial. It has the support of all of us. But I have no \nother choice but to do so. I have no other choice but to fight like the \ndickens and use my leverage. I have been around the Senate for 11 years \nnow, and I know the way things work.\n  It is very rare that today we continue to have these anonymous holds \non legislation such as this to help homeless veterans. The only way I \ncan fight and the only way I can continue to make this a priority--it \nis a priority to me, it should be a priority for every Senator, and it \nshould be a priority for our country--is to ask my colleagues to go and \nspend some time--and maybe many of my colleagues have--in homeless \nshelters, meeting with street people. My colleagues would be amazed at \nhow many of them are veterans, how many of them are Vietnam vets. \nSurely we can do better.\n  Anonymous hold? I do not know why. I guess I have my own suspicion, \nbut I will say this: I have a hold on all the bills from individual \nSenators on the other side, and they are going nowhere until whoever \nthe Senator is steps forward and either debates me and we have a vote \nor that Senator takes this hold off.\n  I will say this: I do not blame the Senator for wanting to remain \nanonymous. I would want to remain anonymous if I were blocking this \nlegislation. We can do better for veterans in our country. We can do \nbetter for veterans in a lot of different ways, but this is legislation \nwhere a lot of us came together on both sides of the aisle. We have \ndone some good work. It is not the cure-all or end-all. I do not want \nto make this out to be perfect, but I say to my colleague from Georgia \nit makes life a little better for some people. In this particular case \nit happens to be veterans. It is the kind of thing we should be doing \nin public service, and I cannot understand where this anonymous hold \ncomes from or why.\n\n  Every day I am coming to the Chamber and I am going to do the same \nthing. I am going to continue to have a hold on all this other \nindividual legislation sponsored by individual Senators on the other \nside until this bill goes through.\n  Other than that, I do not feel strongly about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we are all aware of the shocking \nevents that occurred on September 11. We are certainly aware of the \nvulnerabilities that were shown to our Nation by this action. As we \nreflect on the risk today, I think we would acknowledge that never in \nour history have we, as a nation, been forced suddenly, shockingly, to \nreevaluate almost every aspect of our life.\n  Americans must make a choice now about risks; we must make choices we \nnever thought we would have to make. From our mail to our shopping \nmalls to ball games, life in America is now a reflection, looking back \nthrough the lens of terror. Surveying that risk, perhaps no single area \ncauses greater concern than that of energy as a consequence of our \nincreasing dependence.\n  We rely on safe, stable, affordable, and plentiful supplies of energy \nto power our progress, but the choices made on energy have left us \nvulnerable and exposed on two different fronts, two fronts that add up \nto our Nation's energy security, and I will discuss those today.\n  A report detailing these risks was received yesterday by Gov. Tom \nRidge, head of Homeland Security. What he did was itemize some of the \nrisks we have at home. We have seen a great deal of publicity given to \nthe realization that about 20 percent of our energy is produced by \nnuclear powerplants. We have about 103 reactors around the country \nproducing clean, affordable energy. The fact the energy is affordable, \nreliable, and free of emissions such as greenhouse gases, is very \nappealing. However, there is no free lunch. Nuclear power does create a \nby-product that must be dealt with, but when managed responsibly and \nstored safely this waste poses no threat and no risk to public health.\n  I might add, in the several decades of generating nuclear power in \nthis country, we have never had a casualty associated with the \noperation of nuclear reactors for power generation.\n  So the industry, as well as government, has done an extraordinary job \nof proving nuclear energy has a significant place in our energy mix.\n  In 1982, the Government made a promise to the American people to take \ncare of that waste and provide a permanent repository. The contractual \nagreement was that the Government would take the waste in 1998.\n  Madam President, 1998 has come and gone. Today, after years of delay, \nbureaucratic wrangling and $12 billion in taxes collected from the \nratepayers who depend on nuclear power, that promise made by the \nFederal Government to take the waste remains unkept.\n  I don't know the opinion of the agencies regarding the sanctity of a \ncontract, but this was a contract. There are lawsuits pending for the \nlack of fulfillment of the terms of the contract, somewhere in the area \nof $40 to $70 billion. Instead of storing the waste in a central, \nsingle, secure facility where we can concentrate all of our resources \non keeping it safe, nuclear waste is being scattered across the \ncountry. We have it in our powerplants, we have outside some of the \nplants storage in containers, casks designed for that storage, but \nthese are not permanent. We have shut down plants where the waste is \nbeing stored. These plants were not designed for the permanent storage \nof this waste or the shutdown of plants. We have 16 different plants \nwith a total of 230 containers now holding high-level nuclear waste on \nan interim basis.\n  In South Haven, MI, dry-cask storage pads are 200 yards from Lake \nMichigan. Twenty percent of the world's fresh water is in the Great \nLakes chain. On the shores of the Chesapeake Bay, dry-cask storage sits \nless than 90 miles from Baltimore, near Washington, DC, with the U.S. \nCapitol and three major airports. These containers are approved, but \nthere is no substitute for a permanent repository deep in the group, \nout of harm's way where it was designed, and that is Yucca Mountain in \nNevada.\n  We have had several debates through the years on this issue. I \nunderstand the reluctance of my friends from Nevada to accept the \nreality that Congress made a designation, subject to licensing, that \nthe repository would be at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. We are still \nwaiting after years and years. We have had a Presidential veto. We are \nseeing a situation of delay, delay, delay.\n  Back to the containers. They are approved by the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, but there is no substitute for permanent repository. We \nhave waste at home, and 14 other plants are in the process of being \ndecommissioned, one in Massachusetts, two in Connecticut, and three in \nCalifornia. We are getting more and more plants that are closed.\n  President Clinton vetoed a bill to accelerate the waste transfer and \nmove us ahead of our current opening date of 2012. That is the current \ndate. I recognize nobody wants the worst, but the reality is we have to \nput it somewhere. The $6 billion expended on Yucca Mountain clearly \nindicates Yucca Mountain was the favorite site. Unfortunately, our \nprevious President vetoed the bill, and the waste sits, no closer to a \npermanent home. The waste is there, exposed and vulnerable, presenting \nanother target for potential terrorists, nestled in our communities, \nbeside our schools, homes and families. It is irresponsible to not \naddress this situation.\n  I don't want to prolong the argument relative to the issue of the \ndanger of this waste. It is being monitored by the best oversight \navailable, the best protection, the best security. Still, it is\n\n[[Page S11521]]\n\nnot designed to stay where it is. We should put this waste in a central \nrepository, designed to take the waste and pool it until we meet the \ndetermination of whether we will put it underground permanently or \nreprocess it.\n\n  I will discuss the other risk relative to our energy, and that is the \nrisk overseas. Our risks grow greater as we leave the confines of the \nUnited States, where at least we have some control over the choices we \nhave made. We rely on parts of the world where the leaders chose to \nundermine peace, democracy, and liberty, and will work to undermine our \nNation, as well.\n  We are more than 56 percent dependent on foreign oil. We simply do \nnot have the flexibility to be independent, should the need arise. I am \nnot suggesting we can independently remove all of our dependence on \nforeign oil, but we certainly have options, and the Senate must act on \nthe options. Unless we make the right choices now, the drivers relative \nto our energy security are OPEC.\n  What has OPEC done lately? We know they just planned to cut 1.4 \nbillion barrels of production. Why? Clearly, to increase the price. \nThey want to have a price between $22 and $24. The way to do that is to \ncontrol the supply. That is just what they have announced they are \ndoing. They are cutting production.\n  We have resources at home, but our hands are tied. We do not seem to \nbe able to reach an accord on how to use places such as ANWR, in my \nState, which hold the key to energy independence by reducing \nsubstantially our dependence on Mideast oil. The Senate has approved \nsafe and limited exploration for ANWR, but President Clinton vetoed \nthat legislation in 1995. Had President Clinton not vetoed that bill in \n1995, we would very possibly have as much as a million barrels a day \nflowing from the ANWR area. That would offset the million barrels a day \nwe are importing from Iraq.\n  I have asked many times, how can we compromise our energy security \nwhen on the one hand we import oil from Iraq and Saddam Hussein and at \nthe same time we are enforcing the no-fly zone over that country, \nputting our young American people's lives at risk with a blockade in \nthe sky. With the oil money, he is paying his Republican guards to keep \nhim alive. He is also developing capability for a missile, with perhaps \na biological warhead. Where does he aim? Most of those items of terror \nare at our ally, Israel. That may be an over simplification of foreign \npolicy, but one could reach that conclusion.\n  We could be far less dependent today if we considered the merits of \nopening this area. Using conservative estimates, in the 6 years that \nhave elapsed since the President last vetoed the ANWR bill, that would \nhave been more than enough time to have researched that tiny sliver of \nland, built the infrastructure on 2,000 acres, and gotten the oil \nflowing.\n  I have a chart that puts it in perspective. It is important, as we \naddress this issue--and this Congress will address this issue either by \nan agreement with the Democratic leader to allow time for an energy \nbill to come up or it will be on the stimulus package because it \nbelongs there. I ask my colleagues to reflect what other stimulus can \nthey identify that generates somewhere in the area of $2.5 billion in \nFederal lease sales, money to the U.S. Treasury, provides about 200,000 \njobs throughout this Nation, and does not cost the taxpayers one red \ncent? That is why this issue belongs on the stimulus package.\n  Think of the tankers that would be built in U.S. shipyards with U.S. \ncrews to expand the oil from Alaska, which is currently about 17 \npercent of all the crude oil produced in this country. We could be far \nless dependent than we are today. We are only one supertanker terrorist \nactivity in the Straits of Hormuz away from serious disruption of our \noil supply.\n  Let me point out the reality associated with the ANWR issue. It is so \nmisunderstood. There is a threat that ANWR is at risk. What is ANWR? \nThis is ANWR in relationship to the State of South Carolina. They bear \na striking resemblance: about the same acreage, 19 million acres. That \nis a big chunk of real estate. Of what does ANWR consist? It already \nconsists of three specific designations by Congress: 8.5 million acres \nin wilderness classifications in perpetuity, another 9 million put into \na refuge, and Congress left out the 1.5 million acres, the coastal \nplain, for determination of whether or not to open it for oil and gas \nexploration. Why? Clearly, the extensive exploration in Prudhoe Bay \nsuggested the largest single deposit may be found in this coastal area.\n  We take that and move along a little further and recognize that the \nHouse bill, H.R. 4, said: OK, we will open this area for exploration, \nbut the footprint can be only 2,000 acres.\n  That is 2,000 acres out of 19 million acres. If you reflect on that, \nwhat are the prospects? They say somewhere between 5.6 and 16 billion \nbarrels. Prudhoe Bay has produced 13 billion barrels, and it was only \nsupposed to produce 10. This could equal, easily, what we would import \nfrom Saudi Arabia for 30 years.\n  Some say it will take 10 years and some say it will take 7 years to \nget this oil. It is estimated if the oil is there--here is the pipeline \nthat is already in, an 800-mile pipeline--we can open up this area \nsomewhere in the area of 18 months if we expedite the permitting \nprocess because we already have some fields of discovery and a pipeline \napproximately halfway over here. Put this in perspective. What is a \n2,000-acre footprint worth?\n  This is an item from Petroleum News, Alaska, ``Gwich'in, Ensign Link \nUp New Mackenzie Delta Drilling Company.''\n\n       A new native-controlled oil and gas drilling company has \n     been formed to provide oilfield services in a land claims \n     area of the Mackenzie Delta that is seen as a likely route \n     for any Mackenzie Valley pipeline.\n       Gwich'in Oilfield Services, 51 percent owned by the \n     Gwich'in Development Corp of Inuvik Northwest Territories and \n     45 percent by Calgary-based Ensign Drilling, is expecting to \n     start operation this winter.\n       The Gwich'in Development settlement area covers 22,422 \n     square miles and is governed by the Gwich'in Tribal Council.\n       Gwich'in Development Corp., wholly owned by the tribal \n     council, has a mission to build an investment portfolio that \n     offers business opportunities, employment and training to \n     Gwich'in residents.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From Petroleum News, Alaska; Sept. 30, 2001]\n\n    Gwich'in, Ensign Link Up in New Mackenzie Delta Drilling Company\n\n                             (By Gary Park)\n\n       A new Native-controlled oil and gas drilling company has \n     been formed to provide oilfield services in a land claims \n     area of the Mackenzie Delta that is seen as a likely route \n     for any Mackenzie Valley pipeline.\n       Gwich'in Oilfield Services, 51 percent owned by Gwich'in \n     Development Corp. of Inuvik, Northwest Territories, and 49 \n     percent by Calgary-based Ensign Drilling, is expecting to \n     start operations this winter.\n       The Gwich'in settlement area covers 22,422 square miles and \n     is governed by the Gwich'in Tribal Council.\n       Gwich'in Development Corp., wholly owned by the tribal \n     council, has a mission to build an investment portfolio that \n     offers business opportunities, employment and training to \n     Gwich'in residents.\n       Tom Connors, chief executive officer of the corporation, \n     said Sept. 10 that the deal with Ensign gives the community a \n     chance to participate in the development of oil and gas \n     resources.\n       Ensign president Selby Porter said his company's experience \n     and equipment make it the right choice to work with the \n     Gwich'in people.\n       ``The development of a local work force and infrastructure \n     is key to the continued development of oil and gas resources \n     of the Arctic region of Canada,'' he said.\n       Formation of the new company was announced Sept. 6.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I also ask unanimous consent that two other articles \nbe printed in the Record, ``The Slick Politics of ANWR Oil'' by Paul K. \nDriessen, and ``The Sacred Slope'' by Jack Stauder, Ph.D of the \nUniversity of Massachusetts at Dartmouth, relative to this issue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     The Slick Politics of ANWR Oil\n\n                         (By Paul K. Driessen)\n\n       A new Native-controlled oil and gas drilling company was \n     recently formed to provide oilfield services in the Mackenzie \n     River delta area of northwestern Canada, adjacent to Alaska. \n     According to Petroleum News Alaska, the company was created \n     to provide investment and business opportunities, employment \n     and training for tribal members. It expects to start \n     operations this winter, to expand oil and gas development \n     activities in the Arctic region.\n\n[[Page S11522]]\n\n       This new enterprise, Gwich'in Oilfield Services, offers \n     some fascinating insights into the slick politics of militant \n     environmentalism.\n       The majority owner is none other than the Gwich'in Indians \n     Tribal Council. Those are the same Gwich'in Indians that for \n     years have been poster children for the cause of opposing oil \n     exploration in the flat, featureless coastal plain of \n     Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).\n       But nearly 90% of the Gwich'ins live in Canada. Only 800 \n     live in Alaska. The Alaskan Gwich'ins live some 250 miles \n     from the coastal plain, if one travels along the route \n     caribou follow in migrating to and from ANWR.\n       As the crow flies, the Indians' Arctic Village is 140 miles \n     across the all-but-impassable Brooks Range. Those majestic \n     mountains--the ones seen in all the misleading ads and news \n     stories opposing ANWR oil exploration--are 30 to 50 miles \n     from the coastal plain. (It's amazing how a telephoto camera \n     lens can make them look so close.)\n       The Gwich'in Tribal Council plans to drill in a 1.4-\n     million-acre land claims area governed by the Indians. This \n     is the same amount of land that's been proposed for \n     exploration in ANWR. The proposed drill sites (and a \n     potential pipeline route) are just east of a major \n     migratory path, where the caribou often birth their \n     calves, rather than awaiting their arrival in the refuge.\n       Back in the 1980s, the Alaska Gwich'ins leased 1.8 million \n     acres of their tribal lands for oil development. (No oil was \n     found.) Any reservations they may have had to the latest \n     leasing plans were apparently very muted.\n       It is hard to grasp how drilling for oil in their own back \n     yards is perfectly OK, but exploration on public and Inuit \n     Eskimo lands 140 miles away somehow ``threatens their \n     traditional lifestyle.'' It's equally hard to condone their \n     willingness to collect countless thousands of dollars from \n     environmental groups, to place full-page ads in major \n     newspapers, appear in television spots and testify on Capitol \n     Hill in opposition to ANWR exploration--and then lease more \n     of their tribal lands for drilling. But none dare call it \n     hypocrisy.\n       Government geologists say ANWR could contain as much as 16 \n     billion barrels of recoverable oil. That's enough to replace \n     all our Persian gulf imports for 10 years or more. At peak \n     production levels, it could provide \\1/10\\ of total U.S. oil \n     needs. Developing this critically needed energy could also \n     create 735,000 jobs, save us from having to send hundreds of \n     billions of dollars to OPEC, and generate tens of billions in \n     royalty and tax revenues to defend and rebuild our nation.\n       All these benefits would result in the disturbance of about \n     2,000 acres--less land than the terrorists destroyed or \n     damaged in New York City--in a refuge the size of South \n     Carolina. And any drilling would be done in the dead of \n     winter, using ice airstrips, roads and platforms that will \n     melt when spring arrives.\n       Eskimos who actually live in ANWR want the same benefits \n     the Gwich'ins seek. As Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation president \n     Fenton Rexford notes, the Eskimos are tired of using 5-gallon \n     buckets for sanitation, because they don't have toilers, \n     running water or a sewer system. They also understand the \n     national security issues at stake here. No wonder they \n     support exploration by an 8:1 margin.\n       Bin Laden & Company just sent us a wake-up call from Hell. \n     In mere hours, they plunged us into an economic crisis and a \n     long, difficult war that must be waged both overseas and in \n     our own neighborhoods. Is there anyone who seriously believes \n     we can afford to continue letting a small band of politically \n     correct Alaska Indians and environmental militants hold the \n     United States hostage on ANWR oil?\n       It's time to face reality, toss bogus anti-oil arguments on \n     the ash heap of history, and support exploration in the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            The Sacred Slope\n\n                        (By Jack Stauder, Ph.D.)\n\n       This story bears telling first, for the silliness it \n     exposes about the conventional wisdom of liberal opinion on \n     campus today regarding environmental issues; and second, as \n     an example of how to challenge such silliness.\n       Last spring I arranged for myself to be appointed to a new \n     ``Sustainability Committee'' being set up by the powers on \n     high at the University of Massachusetts, where I teach. I was \n     suspicious of what was intended on campus under that slippery \n     rubric.\n       Luckily, the Committee has done little so far except \n     receive rather pompous memos tinged with utopian musings \n     coming from a couple of professors at the Boston campus of \n     our state system, including a Professor B. (Names of \n     colleagues in this piece have been hidden to protect tender \n     egos; but otherwise all the quoted e-mail here has been \n     unchanged.) Professor B. regards himself as a great expert on \n     ``sustainability.''\n       Anyway, the little controversy I will describe began with \n     an e-mail forwarded through a couple of leftist professors on \n     my campus. Its origins appear to be from one the endless \n     number of lobbying groups on the left. One of the burdens of \n     having left-wing friends, as I do, is that they often pass on \n     these lobbying efforts. This e-mail, however, was circulated \n     to all twenty or so members of our Sustainability Committee \n     as well as the professors in Boston by one of the sillier \n     members of our Committee. Bear with my account as you read \n     it; the fun begins after it.\n\n     Sunday, October 7: ``Is Nothing Sacred?''\n     From: Professor G.\n\n       Dear Friend of MoveOn, In this time of tragic urgency, our \n     leaders in Washington have pulled together and put all things \n     controversial and partisan aside for the sake of national \n     unity. Our friends on Capitol Hill are making sacrifices, \n     holding off on key issues that can be won only through \n     struggle, such as energy and campaign finance reform. Our \n     opponents have respected the national need for unity too, \n     until now.\n       But today we learned that Sen. Frank Murkowski (R-AK) is \n     breaking with this patriotic spirit by trying to tack one of \n     the most controversial issues in America onto the Defense \n     Authorization bill:\n       He wants to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge, the heart of the last great wilderness ecosystem in \n     North America. This is a mistake, because:\n       Any oil found there wouldn't come on line for 10 years;\n       The refuge contains just 6 months supply of oil;\n       Existing fuel-efficient technologies could save more than \n     that;\n       Once it's gone, it's gone forever.\n       The Defense bill will be debated this Wednesday through \n     Friday.\n       Please call your senators now:\n       Senator John Kerry\n       Phone: 202-224-2742\n       Fax: 202-224-8525\n       Senator Edward M. Kennedy\n       Phone: 202-224-4543\n       Fax: 202-224-2417\n       Be sure they know you're a constituent, and urge them to:\n       ``Please--block--the vote on the Murkowski drilling \n     amendment to the Defense Authorization bill.''\n       Please call even if you think your Senators are solid \n     supporters of protecting the refuge. Many Senators simply \n     don't yet believe that Murkowski will do it, but our sources \n     are reliable.\n       America's entire environmental movement must rally now.\n       Please let us know you're making this call, at our website. \n     We'd like to keep a count. Thank you. Your call will matter.\n       Sincerely,\n\n     --Wes Boyd\n     MoveOn.org\n     September 19, 2001\n\n       [I was riled enough by this message to reply to all on the \n     Committee who had received it:]\n\n     Sunday, October 7: ``Re: Is Nothing Sacred?''\n     From: Professor Jack Stauder\n\n       Is it appropriate to circulate such partisan lobbying \n     action information throughout a university committee? I don't \n     think so. We shouldn't tire others out through incessant \n     propaganda, no matter how close to our hearts our causes are.\n       But if we are going to be wasting our collective time this \n     way, let me get in on the fun.\n       There are two sides to each controversy. I've actually been \n     to the North Slope of Alaska. I've never seen an uglier \n     landscape.\n       The proposed drilling area is a small speck in a vast \n     tundra: it would compare to the size of the township of North \n     Dartmouth within the entire area of Massachusetts, \n     Connecticut and Rhode Island put together. The ``great \n     wilderness eco-system'' would be virtually unchanged by the \n     proposed drilling. Nothing would be ``gone'' forever.\n       People can say any area is ``sacred'' if they want. \n     However, the Inupiat (Eskimo) of the North Slope, the only \n     people who have ever lived there or would want to live there, \n     are by a large majority in favor of drilling for the oil. Why \n     would people here in Massachusetts want to deny them their \n     wish? Few of us if any will ever go to visit this ``sacred'' \n     place, if only because it is so inhospitable to all but the \n     Eskimo--cold and dark throughout the winter, a huge flat \n     marshland swarming with mosquitoes in the summer. Yet out of \n     spiritual arrogance some presume to tell the Alaskans what to \n     do with their land.\n       The oil deposit is estimated to be a quite substantial one, \n     otherwise there would be no interest in drilling there. One \n     should automatically distrust the misleading statistics and \n     factoids thrown out by environmental groups who make their \n     living propagandizing issues like this. The oil from Alaska \n     wouldn't meet all our needs, but it would make us that much \n     less dependent on the Middle East--a welcome goal.\n       And even if ``existing fuel-efficient technologies could \n     save more'' than drilling in Alaska could provide, this \n     statement is a non-sequitur, for doing either does not \n     preclude the other.\n       Should I go on and on? Should I tell you who to call in \n     Congress and what to tell them? No, I won't, because it's not \n     the business of the Sustainability Committee, in my eyes, to \n     serve as a propaganda vessel for anyone's ``cause'' or \n     ``special interest.''\n\n     --Jack Stauder, Soc/Anth Dept\n\n       [As I rather expected, my questioning of a liberal \n     environmental icon--the sacredness of wilderness--brought a \n     prompt reaction, from none other than Professor B., to all \n     members of our committee. Note his condescending familiarity \n     towards me, although I have never met the man.]\n\n     Monday, October 8\n     From: Professor B.: ``Re: Is Nothing Sacred?''\n\n       To All, Jack's contention that the Sustainability Committee \n     shouldn't be used to lobby\n\n[[Page S11523]]\n\n     issues is probably correct. On the other hand, if someone \n     wants to send an e-mail to everyone on her/his address book, \n     this a free country. I respect Jack for exercising his right \n     of free speech and expressing his views. Now I will exercise \n     mine.\n       I disagree with two points that Jack made: one, the North \n     Slope is not ``their'' land, it is ``our land,'' and \n     furthermore, our children's land. Second, I am convinced that \n     focusing on the front end, i.e., the production end, of the \n     pipeline, especially the oil pipeline, does preclude \n     achieving anything near the easily achieved efficiencies at \n     the use end of the pipeline. I think I read from a reliable \n     source that increasing the fleet mileage of American \n     automobiles will save more oil in a short time than the most \n     optimistic estimates of oil to be obtained from the North \n     Slope. I also understand that the average fleet miles per \n     gallon of American made automobiles is the lowest in 25 \n     years, largely due to SUV's not being held to the standards \n     of automobiles.\n       Now Jack, those of us who argue for a philosophy and policy \n     of increasing the efficiency of our economy over the Texas \n     mentality of ``we'll shoot, drill, and fight our way out of \n     this mess,'' and ``be damned with those pencil-necked liberal \n     flakes who want us to change our superior American lifestyles \n     of ostentatious, conspicuous consumption, and profligate \n     waste. Be damned I say. So what if we are only 5% of the \n     world's population and contribute 25% of the CO2 in the \n     world.''\n       Jack, you sound like the Montana Cattlemen's and the \n     Northwest Lumberman's Association's attitude that our land is \n     their land to do what they damned well please.\n       Now, by God, I have changed my mind. I think any \n     sustainability committee that is serious ought to go on \n     record as strongly opposed to increased exploitation of \n     finite resources and dangerous pollution when there are \n     scientifically and technically double ways to increase \n     efficiency of our economy, to say nothing of some of us who \n     strongly believe we are morally wrong in our consumption \n     habits. Yes, we do feel that the environment is a ``sacred'' \n     trust.\n       Some of us even believe that there is a definite nexus \n     between American consumerism and the feeling of being \n     oppressed in some third world countries. A feeling so strong \n     as to even, at least partially, foster terrorism. Hope all is \n     well.\n\n     W. B.\n\n       [These predictable opinions of Professor B. offered some \n     targets too tempting to resist, although I restrained myself \n     from addressing his every point. Below is the e-mail I \n     returned, again to the whole committee, although it was \n     addressed to him.]\n\n     Wednesday, October 10: ``The Sacred Slope etc.''\n     From: Professor Jack Stauder\n\n       Dear Prof. B.: You make some interesting points in your \n     recent memo, but I think some clarification is in order.\n       You are certainly right that most of the North Slope, being \n     federal government land, in some sort of legal sense belongs \n     collectively to all American citizens. However, perhaps \n     because I am an anthropologist I believe it would be a bit \n     culturally arrogant to inform the Native Americans whose \n     ancestors have lived in that region for a couple thousand \n     years that (in your words) ``the North Slope is not `their' \n     land, it is `our land'.'' Native Americans (the Inupiat in \n     this case) tend not to appreciate this attitude from white \n     men.\n       The point I tried to make in my previous memo is that in \n     issues like this, of environmental protection and economic \n     development, I believe that the first consideration, out of \n     respect, should be paid to the views of the local people \n     actually inhabiting the place in question. After all, they \n     know their environment best, and have the most to lose or \n     gain depending on what happens to it. I trust their wisdom \n     more than that of lobbying groups based in Washington, D.C. \n     Perhaps you disagree.\n       Also, maybe because I grew up in the West (Colorado and New \n     Mexico) I was put off by your glib caricature of ``the Texas \n     mentality.'' We are encouraged in our university to celebrate \n     diversity, but it seemed to me your remarks smacked of \n     regional prejudice and mean-minded stereotyping of a great \n     state of our union--a state, by the way, that has for long \n     provided the rest of us with many valuable goods, including \n     the oil and natural gas that have moved our vehicles and \n     warmed our houses. We should be thanking Texans, not making \n     fun of them.\n       On other Western topics, you accuse me of thinking like \n     Montana cattlemen and Northwest lumbermen. I'm not quite sure \n     what you mean, although you seem to be down on these groups. \n     Do you want them put out of business? Do you want them to \n     stop producing goods for our use? Can we in Massachusetts \n     produce the beef and wood products we need and use? Again, as \n     with the Texans, I say let's thank these rural producers for \n     their efforts--not affect to despise them.\n       Would you not at least admit the possibility that these \n     hard-working Americans contribute much more of real value to \n     their countrymen, than do university professors firing off \n     vaporous memos by e-mail?\n       Finally, what am I to make of the sly statement you append \n     to the end of your last message: ``Some of us even believe \n     that there is a definite nexus between American consumerism \n     and the feeling of being oppressed in some third world \n     countries. A feeling so strong as to even, at least \n     partially, foster terrorism.''\n       I hope there is no insinuation in these words that somehow \n     Americans are responsible for what those squalid foreign \n     fanatics did on Sept. 11. I trust you are not one of the \n     ``Blame America First'' fringe that hangs around American \n     campuses. But what are you getting at?\n       I can see how the terrorists might resent and hate the \n     United States for being such a prosperous, dynamic, creative \n     society--one that is open, democratic, tolerant of all \n     religions, and respectful of human rights and individual \n     liberties. After all, none of the Middle Eastern terrorists \n     come from societies with these characteristics. But why \n     should we feel guilty for the evil acts their perverted \n     ideology leads them to?\n       Where exactly does ``consumerism'' fit in? If we \n     voluntarily impoverished ourselves down to the level of, say, \n     Afghanistan, would other people feel less ``oppressed''? If \n     we ``increased the fleet mileage of American automobiles'' to \n     consume less oil, as you propose, do you believe that Osama \n     bin Laden will praise us to Allah and call of his \n     terrorists? Seems unlikely to me. Perhaps the Taliban \n     prohibits girls from learning to read so they don't grow \n     up to be seduced by the white sale ads of the Kabul \n     Macy's? Or what about the destruction of those large \n     status of Buddha? Perhaps that was in response to \n     information that monks of that faith were driving too many \n     SUV's around their lamaseries?\n       Seens to stretch. The only important product we consume \n     from the Middle East is oil, extracted by our technology, for \n     which the Middle East states are paid royally. It's oil. That \n     is why I suggested that, to free us as much as possible from \n     dependence on that oil, we develop our own resources--like \n     Alaskan oil. We can do this as well as ``increase efficiency \n     of our economy,'' as you desire. Again, there is no \n     contradiction between the two goals, and its seems self-\n     defeating and silly to pit them against each other.\n       No, I do not consider the 2000 acres of frozen tundra on \n     the North Slope, where the drilling would take place, as \n     ``sacred''--except that it oil would help us meet our sacred \n     duly to protecting our families and keeping our nation \n     strong.\n\n     Your, Jack Stauder\n     Soc/Anth Dept., UMass Dartmouth\n\n       [My riposte was apparently too much for Professor B. He \n     threw in the towel, left the field, hung up his cleats--\n     whatever methaphor you might choose. He replied, not to the \n     whole Sustainability Committee, but only to me, that he could \n     not sustain more discourse on the issue.]\n\n     Thursday, October 11: ``Re: The Sacred Slope, etc.'' From: \n         Professor B.\n       Jack, I only partially read your e-mail retort. I think you \n     are missing the purpose of the Sustainability Committee. \n     Bantering words is a waste of time. Let's perform.\n\n     W.\n\n       I think he did read all my retort, and was wise enough to \n     see any further attempt to cross swords with my ``banter'' \n     might lead to more humiliation of his half-baked ideas.\n       For our own edification, I think a couple of lessons might \n     he drawn from this otherwise trivial story, about how best to \n     combat environmentalism and its nonsense.\n       First, as I have learned from Rush Limbaugh: humor helps, \n     Irony, sarcasm, ridicule are useful tools in dealing with \n     opponents, especially those who cloak themselves in \n     pretentiousness airs of moral and intellectual superiority, \n     as environmentalists tend to do.\n       Second, don't give environmentalists a chance to claim the \n     moral high ground in any argument. Aggressively assert your \n     own principles--in this case, the valuable contributions of \n     resource providers, and the positive aspects of American \n     civilization.\n       Third, know your opponents and exploit the contradictions \n     in their beliefs. For example, a pious tenet of Prof.B.'s \n     liberal creed is that Native Americans are victims {time}  \n     and ecological saints, to boot--with whom good left/liberals \n     must sympathize. Yet in this case the environmentalists want \n     to tell them what they can or can't do with their traditional \n     lands! No wonder he is too embarrassed to pursue an argument \n     on this score.\n       My gibes about ``celebrating diversity'' (regarding \n     Texans!) were certainly tongue-in-cheek, but highlighted \n     another contradiction in Prof. B.'s attitudes by pointing out \n     his use of prejudicial stereotypes, when good left/liberals \n     always condemn these {time}  in the abstract. I was accusing \n     him in effect of being a bigot, of violating one of the \n     taboos of his sort in showing ``intolerance.'' Obviously he \n     didn't like being called out on these grounds.\n       Finally, questioning him about his opinions regarding the \n     United States put him in an impossible position. if he is \n     like most liftists--and the types of environmentalists that \n     foams at the mouth against ``consumerism'' and wants to use \n     ``sustainability'' as a tool to shoehorn us into some type of \n     socialist utopia--then he must have hated the good, but true, \n     things I had to say about American civilization. Difficult as \n     it may be for most Americans to comprehend, the underlying \n     belief of U.S. leftists, including left-wing \n     environmentalists, is that America stinks--that our country \n     is malign, unjust, oppressive, imperialist, and altogether \n     hateful. This view explains why they give themselves the \n     license to tear down our civilization and to impose on us \n     their own utopian ideas.\n       However, Professor B. and the wiser radicals know, \n     especially in the wake of September 11, that they cannot be \n     so up front\n\n[[Page S11524]]\n\n     with their anti-Americanism. So he had to grit his teeth and \n     refrain from replying as I more or less waved the stars and \n     stripes in front of him. It must have infuriated and \n     frustrated him.\n       Good, Let's hope he stays wordless, and that the \n     sustainability project molders in inactivity. But I wouldn't \n     be so sure. These advocates for environmental causes always \n     have a lot of time on their hands.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. These articles highlight the reality of the issue of \nthe Gwich'ins, which is a legitimate concern they have over the \nPorcupine caribou herd, and the realization that now this issue has \ntaken on a new dimension because most of the Gwich'ins live in Canada. \nThere is a small portion who live in Alaska in this general area.\n  I might add, this line shows the division between the United States \nand Canada. Here is the Canadian activity going on on the Canadian \nside. This is primarily, of course, the home of the Gwich'ins. Nearly \n90 percent of the Gwich'ins live in Canada. Only 800 live in Alaska. \nThe Alaska Gwich'ins live only 250 miles from the coastline. Our \nGwich'ins are down here in the Gwich'in area of the Arctic village.\n  What we have here is a massive public relations effort, funded by \nextreme environmental groups, to suggest that somehow the Gwich'in \npeople's lifestyle is at risk in opening this area. They never \nacknowledge what is going on with the same Gwich'ins on the Canadian \nside, where they see an opportunity for better employment, health care, \na better way of life for their young people. It is important to \nunderstand this issue is more than a public relations issue by the \nSierra Club and others, suggesting that somehow the Porcupine caribou \nherd is going to be decimated by a mild amount of activity here, when \nclearly this is the indication of the path of the migratory caribou \nherds, and the Canadians run a highway right across the pass.\n  This is an open season when the caribou come through and as a \nconsequence we have the pot calling the kettle black, if you will.\n  It is important that Members take the time to understand this issue \nand reflect on it. I am going to go through a couple of other points \nrelative to items that need evaluation. Some suggest there is no \nfootprint up here in ANWR, and as a consequence it is a pristine area. \nThat is totally false. This is the village of Kaktovik. There are real \npeople who live here. You can see their homes here, and so forth. This \nis the spring breakup. It might not be a very pretty picture in the \nsense of the color, but it shows you the Arctic Ocean, and so forth. \nThe winters are a little tough up there.\n  This is another picture of a village and this is in the 1002 area, \nphysically there. There are schools, a health clinic, there is an \nairport. The village people and their lifestyle is as they have chosen \nit to be there.\n  I will show you a little picture of the children going to school. It \nis kind of tough up there in the morning. Nevertheless, these are \nEskimo children. You can see telephone polls, snow. Nobody shovels the \nsidewalks off, I grant you, but they are there by choice. They are real \npeople living in an area where some people say there is no footprint. \nIt is totally inaccurate.\n  What we are looking at is the merits of trying to bring a fair \nevaluation of the issue. Some have said: I am going to filibuster this \nbill.\n  Think about it. What they are talking about filibustering addresses \nthe national energy security of this country.\n  Where is our President on the issue? On October 31, October 26, \nOctober 17, October 4--he has made statements begging, if you will, and \nI wish he would direct that this body pass an energy bill. The House \nhas passed H.R. 4.\n  Here is a statement the President made:\n\n       But there are two aspects to a good strong economic \n     stimulus package, one of which is an energy bill.\n\n  He asked for an energy bill each time that he has had an occasion to \nspeak on energy. Again in October:\n\n       I ask Congress to act now on an energy bill that the House \n     of Representatives passed back in August.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent these statements of the President on those \ndates be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               President George Bush's Comments on Energy\n\n       October 31, 2001:\n       And I want the Congress to know that there is more to \n     helping our economy grow than just tax relief or just \n     spending. And there's two items I want to briefly touch on. \n     One is an energy plan.\n       Our nation needs an energy plan, an energy plan that \n     encourages conservation and encourages exploration. And I \n     believe we can do both in a responsible way. And we need to \n     modernize the infrastructure that develops energy from point \n     A to point B, from plant to consumer. We need to get after \n     it. It is our national interest that we have an energy plan, \n     one designed to make us less reliant upon foreign sources of \n     energy.\n       October 26, 2001:\n       Tax relief is an essential step, but it's not the only step \n     we should take. We need an energy plan for America. Under the \n     leadership of the vice president, we drafted a comprehensive, \n     commonsense plan for the future of this country.\n       It passed the House of Representatives. It needs a vote in \n     the United States Senate. Oh, I understand energy prices are \n     low right now. Thank goodness. But that shouldn't lead our \n     nation to complacency. We need to be more self-reliant and \n     self-sufficient. It is in our nation's national interest that \n     we develop more energy supplies at home. It is in our \n     national interest that we look at safe nuclear power. It is \n     in our national interest that we conserve more. It is in our \n     national interest that we modernize the energy infrastructure \n     of America. It's in our national interest to get a bill to by \n     desk, and I urge the Senate to do so.\n       October 17, 2001:\n       And I ask congress to now act on an energy bill that the \n     House of Representative passed back in August.\n       This is an issue of special importance to California. Too \n     much of our energy comes from the Middle East. The Plan I \n     sent up to Congress promotes conservation, expands energy \n     supplies and improves the efficiency of our energy network. \n     Our country needs greater energy independence.\n       October 4, 2001:\n       But there are two other aspects to a good, strong economic \n     stimulus package, one of which is trade promotion authority. \n     And the other is an energy bill.\n       And I urge the Senate to listen to the will of the senators \n     and move a bill--move a bill that will help Americans find \n     work and also make it easier for all of us around this table \n     to protect the security of the country. The less dependent \n     were on foreign sources of crude oil, the more secure we are \n     at home.\n       We've spend a lot of time talking about homeland security. \n     An integral piece of homeland security is energy \n     independence. And I ask the Senate to respond to the call to \n     get an energy bill moving.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is not just the Senator from Alaska crying in the \ndark. We have heard from Gale Norton, Secretary of Interior, saying it \nis in the national energy security interests of this country to reduce \nour dependence, and the best way to do it is basically to open up this \narea because we have the technology to do it. We can create American \njobs.\n  Also, we have heard from the Secretary of Energy, indicating the \nsignificance of what this can mean to reducing our dependence.\n  We have had the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Anthony Principi, \nindicate that America's veterans who fought the wars--and I will \nreflect on one comment made by a former Member, Mark Hatfield, who was \na pacifist and a good friend of ours. He said: I would vote for opening \nANWR anyday rather than send another American man or woman overseas to \nfight a war in a foreign country over oil.\n  That is what we are doing. We did that in the Persian Gulf conflict. \nWe fought a war over oil to keep Saddam Hussein from going into Kuwait \nand moving on into Saudi Arabia.\n  If we look at affairs in the Mideast now and consider the \nvulnerability associated with that area and our dependence on Saudi \nArabia and the weakness of the royal family and Bin Laden's terrorist \nactivities that would disrupt those oilfields--we are sitting on a \nsituation very similar to what we saw maybe 30 years ago with the fall \nof the Shah in Iran. That situation could happen, dramatically, \novernight.\n  We could face a terrorist attack on the Straits of Hormuz. Why are we \nwaiting?\n  Let me tell you something. I mean this in all candor. This issue has \nbeen a godsend to the extreme environmental community. It is an issue \nthat they have been milking for revenue and dollars and will continue \nto do so until the very end. When it finally passes, they will move on \nto another issue. It has been a cash cow because they refuse to argue \nthe merits of if it can be opened safely. It can. We have 30 years of \nexperience in the Arctic.\n\n[[Page S11525]]\n\n Where would we be today if we didn't have Prudhoe Bay?\n  The same arguments today being used against opening this area were \nused 27 years ago against opening Prudhoe Bay: You are going to build a \nfence across Alaska, 850 miles. The caribou are not going to be able to \ncross it. It is going to break up the permafrost. All these arguments \nfailed because it is one of the engineering wonders of the world.\n  Let's be realistic. America's veterans have spoken. We have had press \nconferences: The American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, AMVETS, \nCatholic War Veterans of America, Vietnam Veterans Institute. The \nVeterans of Foreign Wars are for it. The seniors organizations support \nit. The 60-Plus have come out in support of it, as have the Seniors \nCoalition and the United Seniors Association; in Agriculture, American \nFarm Bureau, and National Grange. Organized labor is totally aboard.\n  I know many Members have been contacted by organized labor--by the \nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters, by union laborers, by the \nSeafarers Union, Operating Engineers, Brotherhood of Plumbers and \nSteamfitters, carpenters--and America's business. There are over 1,000 \nbusinesses that support opening up this area as part of our national \nenergy security bill.\n  I encourage Members to recognize the reality that we are going to get \na vote on an energy bill under one of two provisions. Either the \nDemocratic leadership is going to respond to the President's request to \nbring up an energy bill before this body or work out some time \nagreement that is reasonable. We can take it up, have amendments, and \nhave an up-or-down vote on it. It shouldn't be a filibuster issue. \nImagine filibustering on our national security. It has never been done \nin this body before. We should have an up-or-down vote.\n  Let us recognize it for what it is. If we don't get the assurance \nfrom the Democratic leader to take up an energy bill, then our other \nopportunity is a stimulus bill. And it will be on the stimulus bill. \nThe House has done its job. It passed an energy bill, H.R. 4. It will \nbe on the stimulus bill.\n  When you think about stimulus, you think about what other stimulus \nprovisions we have talked about which will provide nearly $1.5 billion \nworth of revenue from lease sales to the Federal Treasury. It will \nemploy a couple hundred thousand Americans in shipbuilding, and so \nforth. It will not cost the taxpayer one dime. I challenge my \ncolleagues to come up with a better answer.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to speak this morning. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes as if in morning business for the purpose of introducing \na bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, before I do so, I would like to make a \ncouple of comments based on Senator Murkowski's observations.\n  I think he is absolutely right on point. About a third of Senate \nMembers are veterans. Several are veterans of World War II. One of my \ncomments will certainly not surprise them.\n  I ask the Senator if he remembers the story about how we won the \nNorth Africa Campaign in World War II when some of the world's great \ngenerals were pitted against each other: General Patton from America \nand Field Marshal Montgomery from Great Britain on the Allied side, and \nField Marshal Rommel on the German side. History shows that Rommel was \nnot a Nazi. In fact, he was later forced to commit suicide for his \ncomplicity in the events designed to kill Hitler.\n  But at that time, the state-of-art tanks were called Tiger 88s, with \n88-millimeter guns in the Panzer Divisions, which outclassed anything \nthat America and Great Britain had in the North Africa Campaign. \nEverybody knew it. Field Marshal Rommel, of course, was one of the \ngreat minds of World War II. Unfortunately, he was on the wrong side.\n  History tells us that one of the reasons we won that campaign was \nthat we bombed the oil fields. When we cut off their oil, the tanks \nstopped running.\n  I remind my colleagues that they still run on oil. They do not run on \nwind power or solar power.\n\n  I am absolutely supportive of Senator Murkowski's belief that there \nis a national security connection with being less dependent on foreign \noil. He mentioned the statistics and how dependent we are. It really \nshould not come as a big surprise to most Americans if we tell them we \nare more dependent on Iraqi oil than we were before the war. In fact, \n25 percent of the oil we import, as I understand, comes from the \nSaudis, who every year divide much of the billions of America dollars \namong the 300 members of the extended royal family, one of whom is Bin \nLaden. It just defies common sense that because we cannot cut this \numbilical cord, we are actually paying people for oil so they can buy \nweapons with the intent of killing.\n  I want to tell the former chairman that I am absolutely in support of \nhis efforts. When I was chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, I had \nmany opportunities to visit with Native Alaskans and native peoples of \nthe North. I found that almost to the person, when they would come down \nto lobby about ANWR, the Native Alaskans who are American citizens \nsupported opening of ANWR. The only ones opposed to it were the people \nwho were natives of Canada, Canadian citizens. There was no question in \nmy mind when I asked them how they got here and who paid their bills, \nthey were being spoon fed to us basically to get us to oppose something \nthat most American natives supported.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my great friend from Colorado. We have enjoyed \nmany meetings together in conjunction with his responsibilities as \nchairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. He has been an outstanding \nproponent of American Indian opportunities.\n  His reference to history and what happened in North Africa is \ncertainly appropriate to our energy dependence on the Mideast. We just \nneed to look at the terrorist activities associated with September 11. \nWe have found that most of the individuals responsible for taking down \nthe buildings in New York were Saudi Arabian.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. That is right. I hope history doesn't repeat itself. \nThe only way we can prevent that is to become less dependent on foreign \noil.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Campbell pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1644 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an activity \nthat is going on in my home State of Kansas that I think is quite \ncommendable. Thirteen veterans from Fort Scott, KS, have expanded the \nlifespan of the Fort Scott National Cemetery by about 35 years through \ntheir hard work and dedication.\n  I point this out because I think this is what America is all about. \nIt is about a can-do atmosphere and about people taking it upon \nthemselves to do something that they believe is not getting done; and \nmaking it happen.\n  With about 1,100 World War II veterans dying every day, many veterans \ncemeteries are struggling to accommodate veterans' burials. That is \ntrue in my State as well. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans \nAffairs, by 2008, the annual number of deaths of veterans from all U.S. \nconflicts will reach 620,000, or about 1,700 a day.\n  Fort Scott National Cemetery is one of 12 Civil War national \ncemeteries. It was dedicated in 1862 by President Abraham Lincoln. I \ngrew up just north\n\n[[Page S11526]]\n\nof Fort Scott, about 40 miles away. It was an old Indian fort early on. \nThen it was used, obviously, as well, during the Civil War.\n  In a concession to make space for veterans wanting to be buried at \nthe Fort Scott National Cemetery, burial spots are currently being made \nsmaller, and sloping land that originally was deemed unusable is now \nbeing used.\n  Thanks to the extraordinary efforts of these veterans I have \nmentioned, these 13 veterans, working as the Fort Scott National \nCemetery Expansion Committee, 10 acres of land will be added to the \ncemetery. This land, just across the old stone wall from the cemetery, \nwas purchased by the 13 veterans, who took out a loan, and who then \nsought contributions and worked the crowds at American Legion and VFW \nhalls throughout the region to raise money to pay off the loan. Once \nthe loan was paid off, the veterans donated the land to the Department \nof Veterans Affairs.\n  On Veterans Day, this year, November 12, 2001, this land will be \ndedicated and ready to handle about 3,300 burial sites. I applaud the \ninitiative of these Fort Scott veterans who have successfully \nundertaken the effort to expand this historic cemetery and provide a \nplace of honor for veterans and their eligible dependents for several \ndecades to come.\n  I point this out because Fort Scott National Cemetery is one of the \noldest veterans cemeteries in the country, dedicated by Abraham \nLincoln. It is filled up--or soon will be full. These veterans, by \ntheir own initiative, secured the loan, purchased the land, got the \nloan paid off, and donated it to the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nwhich is receiving the land, and now will be able to provide an \nadditional 3,300 burial sites for veterans.\n  I think that this is such a commendable thing that these veterans \nhave done. I will be there on November 12, along with a number of other \npeople, to recognize and honor what these men have done. I think it is \nwholly appropriate to recognize what they have done in this body as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there are now 20 \nminutes of debate evenly divided on the Hutchison amendment. The Chair \nrecognizes the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understood it was 30 minutes equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I suggest the Senator from Connecticut \nbe recognized--and this has been cleared on both sides--as in morning \nbusiness for 7 minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dodd are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, so there is no misunderstanding, I have \nspoken with Senator Landrieu and Senator Hutchison, and the unanimous \nconsent request Senator Landrieu made takes 3\\1/2\\ minutes off each \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to use 5 minutes and be \ninformed at the end of 5 minutes so Senator Durbin may take the floor, \nand I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, my amendment attempts to be a compromise between those \nwho wish to take the caps off the attorney's fees for suing the \nDistrict of Columbia School District and what I think is a quite \nreasonable approach, which is to keep the caps but raise them.\n  For the last 3 years, we have had caps on attorney's fees. That was \nmade necessary because of the exorbitant fees that were being charged \nto the District, and that was money coming directly out of the \neducation system. In fact, before the caps were put in place, \nattorney's fees represented $14 million of the DC school budget. Since \nthe caps have been put in place, we have had a figure of $3.5 million \nper year average for attorney's fees, and the extra $10.5 million has \nbeen able to go into the services we are seeking to provide for \nhandicapped and special needs children.\n  Moreover, we have been informed by the District of some of the \nexcessive fees that were being billed before the caps. This is billing \nthe school district for plaintiff's lawyer fees when the plaintiff has \nbeen successful. One attorney before the caps individually made $1.4 \nmillion in fees in 1 year suing the District of Columbia schools.\n  Another law firm billed over $5 million in a single year to the \nDistrict of Columbia schools. Submission of a variety of questionable \nexpenses, including flowers, ski trips, and even a trip to New Orleans \nostensibly made to scout out private schools far from the District that \nmight be able to accommodate special needs students.\n  The reason we are trying to put some reasonable caps on these \nattorney's fees and excessive billings is so the money will go into \neducation. Our amendment has a cap of $150 an hour. If a lawyer billed \n2,000 hours at $150 an hour, that would be a $300,000 annual income.\n  So, we are not saying lawyers should not make a reasonable amount, \nand we are certainly not subjecting parents to lawyers who cannot make \na living. I think $150 an hour is quite respectable. That is why we \nhave tried to reach out to the other side and do something that is \nreasonable but not exorbitant.\n  We are trying to help the District of Columbia schools. We have a \nletter from the superintendent of schools and the president of the \nschool board requesting us to take this action. They are very concerned \nthat millions of dollars will go into lawyer's fees rather than to \nimprove the services they give. In fact, they are increasing the number \nof teachers for special needs students. They are increasing the amount \nof medical equipment for these special needs students, and that is \nexactly what we want them to do. So I am trying to be helpful to the DC \nschools. Educators are the ones who can best determine need.\n  Our amendment also has an out; that if the District itself believes \nthe caps are too low, they have the ability to override this amendment \nand this act of Congress and increase the fee caps, with the mayor and \nthe school district working together.\n  I think that takes care of letting the local people have a final \ndecision, doing what they have asked us to do in putting on reasonable \ncaps, as they are trying to do the very difficult job of providing a \nquality education for all the students of the District of Columbia.\n\n[[Page S11527]]\n\n  I was the chairman of the DC Subcommittee and I want so much to do \nwhat is right for the District. I learned their needs, and I worked \nwith the mayor and the school representatives to try to give them the \ntools to do the job they are doing. That is why I feel strongly enough \nto offer this amendment so the millions of dollars that have been \nactually assessed against the school, even though it was against the \nlaw by one of the judges, will not be able to be collected. It would be \nagainst the Federal law for retroactive fees to be collected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will stop there, and I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I believe the chair of our subcommittee has yielded her \nremaining time in debate to me.\n  I ask the Senator from Texas a simple question, and a yes or no \nanswer would suffice. We are talking about limiting the fees paid to \nattorneys who represent children who are trying to get into special \neducation. Could the Senator from Texas tell me, is there a law in her \nhome State of Texas limiting the fees paid to attorneys in her State \nwho represent children in special education cases?\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the question \nbecause, of course, there are not those kinds of limits in Texas, but \nneither does the State of Texas get 20 percent of its budget from the \nFederal Government. The Federal Government has the constitutional role \nof making sure the District runs. That is why we have taken on 23 \npercent of the Federal budget.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Texas for responding to my \nquestion.\n  Reclaiming my time, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is why we make sure the Federal taxpayer dollars \nare used wisely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has the time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  The answer was no. It was a long answer, but the answer was no, in \nTexas there is no limit on the amount of money paid in her home State \nto attorneys representing the families of children who are seeking \nspecial education. But she is saying with her amendment we are going to \nchange that rule in the District of Columbia. No other State in the \nNation has done what the Senator from Texas wants to do to the District \nof Columbia.\n  What is this all about? It is about a law passed by Congress which \nsaid we want to give kids with disabilities a chance for an education. \nWe know sometimes when they try to seek that education they have to put \nup a fight. The school board says, no, we cannot put them in a special \neducation class. If they put up a fight, they have to hire a lawyer to \ngo through an administrative hearing.\n  The law we passed, for which many of us voted, said if the family \nprevails, if the child goes into special education, the court can \ndecide to pay the attorney's fees for the family. Otherwise, what would \nhappen? Exactly what has happened in the District of Columbia right now \nbecause of Senator Hutchison's amendment the previous years.\n  Poor kids from poor families cannot afford lawyers. As a result, they \ndo not get representation. They do not get a chance to go into special \neducation classes.\n  Senator Hutchison wants to limit the attorney's fees to stop the poor \nchildren in the District of Columbia who are seeking special education \nto have a legal voice in the process. That is just plain wrong. If the \nSenator wants to repeal the Children with Disabilities Act as it \napplies all across America, let her offer the amendment. I would vote \nagainst it, but it would be a fair amendment.\n  What she is doing is zeroing in on this town because some Members of \nthe Senate and the House cannot help themselves from playing the role \nof city councilman and mayor. They just love it. They will not leave to \nthe District of Columbia the power to make its own decisions. They want \nto make the decisions for it. Whether we give the District of Columbia \n10 percent or 20 percent of the money it spends, the fact is it is \nresponsible under the same laws as every State in the Union.\n  My colleagues ought to see the letters I received in opposition to \nthe Hutchison amendment. The Senator from Texas would have us believe \nthis is a battle over whether or not lawyers get paid. This letter I \nreceived from the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities makes it \nclear all of these organizations--and these are not bar associations, I \nmight say for the record: Easter Seals, the American \nOccupational Therapy Association, Higher Education Consortium for \nSpecial Education, Council for Learning Disabilities, Council for \nExceptional Children, Epilepsy Foundation, Helen Keller National \nCenter--oppose the Hutchison amendment.\n\n  If it was such a wonderful idea to stop paying the attorney's fees so \nwe could give money for special education, would you not think these \ngroups that represent disabled kids would be in favor of this \namendment?\n  They know better. They know what Senator Hutchison is doing. She is \ntaking away the legal voice of the poorest kids in the District of \nColumbia.\n  Then we received letters from some lawyers, and the lawyers tell us \nwhat has happened as a result of the Hutchison amendment over the last \n3 years. The number of hearings filed in 1998, before the Hutchison \namendment, for special education purposes in the District of Columbia: \n2,140. As of last year, that number was cut more than 50 percent to \n1,011--more than a 50-percent drop.\n  Why? Because the poorest kids in the District of Columbia who cannot \nafford to have their families pay for a lawyer cannot get to court, \ncannot get into special education. Imagine the life of that small child \nwhich has been decided at an early age, which says that whether they \nhave a learning disability, a physical handicap, or a mental \ndisability, they do not have a chance. If the District of Columbia \nschool system turns them down, they are finished because under Senator \nHutchison's amendment they would limit the attorneys to being paid \n$3,000 and not one penny more.\n  I want to say something about the attorneys who are involved in this. \nI made a statement earlier, but I want to make sure it is clear in the \nRecord. The men and women involved in this practice are doing a great \nservice to the families and a great service to our Nation, giving these \nkids a chance for special education to receive their fullest potential. \nThe fact is, if we hold the fees to $3,000 as a maximum in these cases, \nmany attorneys cannot afford to take the case and, sadly, some taking \nthese cases are not prepared to deal with them because they frankly \ncannot put in the time necessary to be successful.\n  The worst part of the Hutchison amendment is the fact that even \nthough each year she continues to pass this along, to stop the poor \nkids in the District of Columbia from having access to special \neducation, the courts have said they are going to ignore it. They \ncontinue to award attorney's fees to these firms. Now the District of \nColumbia cannot pay out anything more than Senator Hutchison has \nallowed them, but the amount of money that the District still owes to \nthese attorneys is there and continues to earn interest and grow. It is \na huge element of debt for the District of Columbia that is not being \nserved by the amendment of the Senator from Texas.\n  I urge all Members to think about the simple justice of this \nsituation. Senator Hutchison says she is just declaring war on trial \nlawyers. Very few trial lawyers are going to take on cases involving \nspecial education. It takes a special attorney with a special \ndedication to make it happen. She may pick or choose some of the \nattorney's fees, if a particular fee is excessive, but each has to be \napproved by the court. If that court and that judge make a decision \nunder the law, we have said that is the way it will apply to Texas, to \nLouisiana, and to the State of Illinois. But at this point in time, to \ntake this city, the Nation's Capital, and say DC children will be \ndenied access to special education at a time when all of the major \ndisability groups beg us to vote against the Hutchison amendment is \nunfair.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S11528]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 6 minutes 19 \nseconds, and the Senator from Illinois has 6 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, please notify me when I have used 4 \nminutes. I want the right to close on my amendment. I will then yield \nto the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. President, I will discuss some of the issues raised by the \nSenator from Illinois. First, he says the number and quality of \nattorneys who take special education cases has declined since the \nimposition of the cap. This is not supported by the facts. The number \nof attorney representations in 1997 before the caps were put into place \nwas over 2,000. Last year, there were 1,700 such representations. We \nhave not seen a steep decline in the number of attorneys willing to \ntake these cases. Most certainly, $125 an hour, which is what used to \nbe the cap, and $150, which we are proposing, makes a good living for a \nperson.\n  A lawyer working 2,000 hours in a year earns $300,000 with a $150-an-\nhour fee structure. It is not as if we are looking at people who would \nnot be able to have a quality of life. This is a reasonable amendment.\n  Second, he made the statement that access to special education will \nbe inhibited, that the disabled students will not be able to get access \nto this education. Access to special education in the District has \nimproved since the imposition of attorney fee caps in 1999. The backlog \nof IDEA initial assessments shrank from 1,805 before the caps to 143 as \nof March 2001. The backlog of hearings has been reduced from 900 to 20 \nduring the same period. Overall expenditures for special education in \nthe District have increased 38 percent since the caps were imposed. The \nnumber of new special education placements, the number of children who \nhave been able to be served, has increased from 8,120 before the fee \ncaps to 11,991 last year. The argument that children are being denied \naccess is not supported by the facts. More children have been able to \nbe accommodated because the money is going into special education and \nnot into the coffers of lawyers.\n\n  The Senator talks about who is against my amendment. Let's talk about \nwho is for my amendment. The school board of the District of Columbia \nis elected by the people of the District. They are for this amendment. \nThey have asked the caps be left in place because they know the money \ncan go into education, and they are very concerned if the caps go off \nand the judge who has been awarded lawyer's fees, even against the \nFederal law, has said he is going to require the District to pay the \nfees that were illegal, which is a convoluted reasoning, at the very \nbest, but nevertheless the judge has said he is going to do it.\n  We are told we better lift the caps so the judge can go ahead and do \nit, and we are told that will be good for the children of the District.\n  I have not quite gotten that line of thinking. The bottom line is the \npeople elected by the people of the District of Columbia want the caps. \nThey did not ask me to raise the caps. I did that because I was trying \nto come up with something that would be reasonable, to try to make sure \nwe were not in any way doing something to harm anyone.\n  My bottom line is when the superintendent of schools and the chairman \nof the school board, elected by the people of the District, ask me to \nkeep the caps and, for Heavens' sake, not allow a retroactive use of \nthe District's funds to go to lawyers instead of education, to the \nchildren of the District, it will not wash.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it should not come as a surprise the \nSenator from Texas says since she put a limitation on attorney's fees, \nfew cases are filed. That is no surprise. The poor children in this \nDistrict looking for special education cannot get attorneys who will do \nit for $3,000. What happens to those kids? They end up sitting in the \nback of the classroom, falling behind. They become discouraged and drop \nout. Then think of the problems that follow in their lives.\n  What a great solution offered by the Senator. We are keeping out of \nspecial education kids who have learning disabilities, mental and \nphysical handicaps. That is the outcome. We can tighten up the system \neven more, I say to the Senator from Texas, by limiting how many \nchildren can go into special education. Then think of how much money \nwould be spent per pupil. That is not fair. It is not just.\n  When she says we ought to do this because the DC public school board \nwants it done, I am sorry, I have seen the DC public schools. I have \nseen reports on them for years. And I frankly think the management of \nthe DC public schools could be a heck of a lot better. It is one of the \nreasons the District of Columbia, year in and year out, has such poor \nratings by the Annie Casey Foundation when it comes to the quality of \nlife for children.\n  Let me tell you something else the DC public schools did not tell \nyou. The average cost per case before the Hutchison cap for attorney's \nfees, for those representing kids going into special education, was \nbetween $7,500 and $10,000. That is the average. Senator Hutchison \ngives reference to $1 million here and $1 million there. That is not \nthe case.\n  What you have here is as a result of the Hutchison amendment, the DC \ncity council has said we should keep in mind in voting against the \nHutchison amendment--8 out of 13 members of the city council said by \nputting the Hutchison cap on the payment of fees for those who want to \nget kids into special education, it makes it more difficult for the \nkids to get the education to which they are entitled.\n  It discriminates against low-income families. Make no mistake, if you \nlive in the DC area and you want to get your child into special \neducation, and you are wealthy, you will hire a lawyer. But if you are \npoor, you are out of luck under the Hutchison amendment. The effect of \nthe cap is to treat the children in the District of Columbia \ndifferently than any other State, including the State of Texas.\n  The way to improve special education, according to the District of \nColumbia city council, is programmatic. Improve the programs rather \nthan limit the advocacy. The fact is, the inefficiency of the DC public \nschool system, their inability to deal with the legal challenges that \nface them, has led to this problem.\n  Although the Hutchison amendment in the last 3 years may have made us \nfeel good about limiting DC liability, we have not done it. During that \nperiod of time, the amounts awarded to attorneys for the work they have \ndone have continued to grow and interest has continued to grow. There \nwill be a day of reckoning for the District of Columbia. It is time for \nus to face reality. These are legitimate debts of the District for \nattorneys who have represented some of the poorest kids in the District \nof Columbia. If a cap on attorney's fees in the State of Texas is not a \ngood idea, it is not a good idea in the District of Columbia.\n  I ask Members to remember the simple fairness that if we stand for \nspecial education and access for all children, poor and rich alike, you \ncannot deny for those poor children the voice and the process they need \nto get into school. The Hutchison amendment denies to these children \nand their families a chance for special education. That is wrong. It is \nunjust. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting against the \nHutchison amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time is left on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 2 minutes and 6 \nseconds. The Senator from Illinois has 27 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask the Senator from Illinois if he has any further \nuse for his time or has he yielded back?\n  I want to address a couple of points made by the Senator from \nIllinois. He says it is no surprise that since the caps were put in \nplace there were fewer lawsuits filed. No, that is not the issue. The \nissue is that more students are actually being served and there is no \ncharge by anyone that there is a denial of due process.\n  In fact, before the caps went into place there were 8,120 special \nneed students in the DC schools. Now there are 11,191. There are only \nfewer than 50 cases even left pending.\n  I think the District is now getting a handle on the situation. They \nare putting more students in the classrooms.\n\n[[Page S11529]]\n\n That is because they have the money not going to lawyers but going \ninto education. That is why the elected representatives of the school \ndistrict have asked that the caps be left in place.\n  We are raising the caps to keep in step with the times. One hundred \nand fifty dollars an hour certainly will get a quality lawyer. I think \nthat has been proven. The fact is, before the caps, these were the \nkinds of abuses that the attorneys made of the system. One attorney, \nbefore the caps, earned $1.4 million in fees alone on suing the \nDistrict schools. One law firm billed over $5 million in fees in a \nsingle year, suing the District schools. There were submissions of \nincredible expenses, asking the District to pay for flowers, for a trip \nto New Orleans to supposedly scout out another school where they would \nargue a child should be sent, a ski trip--my goodness.\n  We need some limitations on these kinds of abuses. That is what the \namendment would do.\n  The District is asking us to do this. It has worked well. It has \nallowed the District to increase its ability to serve the special needs \nstudents and the amendment also allows the mayor and the school \nsuperintendent to increase the caps if they think it is necessary.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment for the DC children, \nthe schoolchildren of the District.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that upon disposition of all \namendments to H.R. 2944, the District of Columbia Appropriations bill, \nthe bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to vote on passage \nof the bill; that upon passage, the Senate insist on its amendment, \nrequest a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two \nHouses, and that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the \npart of the Senate, with this action occurring with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  All time for the amendment has expired. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay the Hutchison amendment on the table and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, didn't the unanimous consent agreement \nsay there would be a vote on my amendment? I ask there be a direct \nvote.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, could we find out if it \nsaid ``on'' or ``in relation to.'' If not, the motion would be in \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from Texas, the unanimous consent \nagreement said the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Hutchison \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Let me try to clarify it. I may be confused about what \nwe are doing. We had committed to a vote on the Hutchison amendment, \nwhich is supposed to be at this time. Then I am aware of no other \namendment to this bill, and we could move to final passage.\n  I am also aware that Senator Levin had a request for a colloquy about \na subject that he is very interested in. I wanted to bring that to the \nattention of our leader.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Louisiana, I guess the question is \nwhether or not Senator Durbin's motion to table would be in order and \nit is according to the unanimous consent agreement. I don't know if \nthere was some other agreement.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \nmotion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Cleland pertaining to the introduction of S. 1650 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2111\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself and \n     Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 2111.\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Sec.   . The limitation on attorneys fees paid by the \n     District of Columbia for actions brought under I.D.E.A. (20 \n     U.S.C. 1400 et seq) (Sec. 138) shall not apply if the \n     plaintiff is a child who is--\n       (a) from a family with an annual income or less than \n     $17,600; or\n       (b) from a family where one of the parents is a disabled \n     veteran; or\n       (c) where the child has been adjudicated as neglected or \n     abused.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding, pursuant to the \nunanimous consent request, that there are 30 minutes equally divided. I \nwill not use the 15 minutes on my side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I hope to bring this amendment to a vote quickly.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to dramatize for those who voted for \nthe Hutchison amendment the types of children who will be affected by \nthe limitation on attorney's fees. Without this Durbin amendment, \noffered by myself and Senator Boxer from California, literally children \nfrom families with less than poverty income, children from families \nwhere one of the parents is a disabled veteran, or children from \nfamilies where there has\n\n[[Page S11530]]\n\nbeen adjudication that the child has been neglected or abused would \nhave been limited in being represented in an effort to bring them into \na special education class. These kids face learning disabilities and \nother mental and physical disabilities.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to say we are making a clear \nexception to the Hutchison limitation, and that section applies to \nthese three categories--children and the families as they are described \nin the amendment. I sincerely hope that those who vote for this \namendment will pause and reflect on the fact that these are only three \ncategories of children who will be disadvantaged by the Hutchison \namendment. There are many others, I am sure, who will come to light as \nwe consider the impact of her amendment.\n  To think the District of Columbia, the Nation's Capital, would be the \none city in the United States of America where we would not give the \nfull protection of the laws to the poorest children is unacceptable. At \nleast with this amendment, children in three categories will have a \nfighting chance, if they need special education to have any opportunity \nto be successful in life.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be glad to yield.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know the Senator from California is \nhere to speak on the amendment. I think the amendment the Senator from \nIllinois has offered has a great deal of merit. If we are called to \nvote on it, we will be happy to vote for this amendment because it \npoints out some of the real problems we are trying to resolve.\n  My question for the Senator from Illinois is, I have some language \nthat I am prepared to offer requesting the GAO to study some of the \ncosts associated not just with the District but for other districts in \nthe Nation that have comparable demographics and size. Will he mind if \nwe discuss the possibility of including this language as we debate his \namendment and perhaps decide to vote on it if that will expedite this \nprocess and get to a vote more quickly on this bill?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, I consider this a friendly \namendment. I want to have a chance to review it while the Senator from \nCalifornia is addressing my amendment. I hope we can find a way to deal \nwith this issue.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his \nleadership this afternoon on behalf of children and families who \nperhaps have the softest voice. Why do I say that? It is because these \nfamilies are struggling with children who have disabilities, who are \nunable to speak for themselves, who need to get special help in school \nand sometimes have to fight and struggle and work to get that help.\n  I believe the amendment that was just adopted by this body on a \nnarrow vote sends a very bad message. It sends a message that disabled \nchildren, children in need of special education, simply are not as \nimportant as a governmental entity that has an unlimited ability to \nhire the highest paid attorneys.\n  In the case of the District, I have learned that, in fact, the \nDistrict does go to the private sector, does throw the best they can \nagainst these children and against their families. There is no limit, \nas my friend from Illinois pointed out, on the attorneys the school \ndistrict decides to hire. Yet this onerous amendment that was just \nadopted quite narrowly treats these children differently.\n  We have the greatest country in the world, and in these days more \nthan ever we have come to recognize that every minute of every hour of \nevery day. One of the reasons is that before the law, everyone is \nequal. That is what we stand for: Before the law, everyone is equal.\n  But when we say to a governmental entity it can pay whatever it wants \nagainst a family who has a child in need of special help, but then we \nrestrict the kind of attorney, the number of dollars that can go to \nfight that child's battle, we are setting up a playing field that is \nnot level.\n  That is why I am so happy the Senator from Illinois, with the support \nof the chair of the subcommittee, Senator Landrieu, has put forward \nthis amendment for the two of us because what we are saying is: Let's \ntake a look at these children. Let's not just have some vague amendment \nthat says attorney's fees shall be limited. That always looks good on a \nvoting record, but if we dig a little bit, what do these kids look \nlike? A lot of them are living in poverty. A lot of them are abused and \nneglected. Some have parents, one or two, who served in the military \nwho may be disabled. These families need special help for these special \nchildren.\n  I am very proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment. I look forward \nto a resounding vote which will, in fact, change the amendment we just \nadopted and say in these circumstances, which will cover many children \nI am happy to note, we will not have this double standard.\n  I thank the Chair, and I reserve the remainder of the time for \nSenator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask for 3 minutes to speak in behalf \nof the Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Minnesota be yielded 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have not had a chance to examine \nevery word of the Durbin amendment, but my understanding of what the \nSenator from Illinois has said is when it comes to making sure parents \nof children with disabilities have legal representation if they need it \nto make an appeal for their children whom they believe are not \nreceiving the support and education they need, in light of the \namendment of the Senator from Texas being adopted, when it comes to a \nsingle parent or low-income or a disabled Vietnam vet or veteran and \nother such categories, it is clear these families absolutely should not \nbe without legal representation. Therefore, the amendment of the \nSenator from Texas would not apply.\n  My colleague from Illinois has made an appeal to Senators to avoid \nthe harshness, to make sure there is the legal representation for \nfamilies who need it, to make sure we are on the side of vulnerable \nchildren and vulnerable families.\n  This amendment is compassionate. This amendment goes directly to what \nis at issue. I hope there will be 100 votes for the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Illinois. I add my support.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, we are ready to vote on this amendment. \nThe Senator from Illinois perhaps has some additional time, but if \nthere are no other speakers, if the Senator from Illinois wants to call \nfor the yeas and nays, we probably can have this vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to make certain the other side has the \nopportunity, if they want, to speak. Otherwise, I am prepared to yield \nall my time back and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Before I yield the time, I want to see if there is anyone \non the other side--the Senator from Texas or others--who wants to speak \nto this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time under the \nunanimous consent request, and I ask unanimous consent that all time on \nthis\n\n[[Page S11531]]\n\namendment be yielded back so we can go to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2111. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Hagel) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska).

Mr. President, the amendment I have offered is an \namendment I have offered on two previous appropriations bills. I will \nnot go into a long and tortured explanation. The Advance Passenger \nInformation System should now be in the law. But because of a \njurisdictional issue that arose a couple of weeks ago, it is not in the \nlaw. In a couple minutes, I will explain exactly what it is.\n  I just came from S. 207 where I am a conferee on the aviation \nsecurity issue. That conference is ongoing right now. We are dealing \nwith the issue of aviation security which is of great importance to all \npeople in this country. How do we make flying more safe and more \nsecure? We are doing that because of the concern about terrorism.\n  One of the issues in dealing with terrorism has been to try to make \nmandatory something that has been voluntary with respect to all \nairlines that are carrying passengers into this country. Some 78 \nmillion people fly into this country each year as guests of our \ncountry. They come on visas. They are guests of the United States. Most \nof them are precleared. Their names are provided by airline carriers \nunder what is called the Advance Passenger Information System, APIS. \nThey are provided to us in advance so we can run\n\n[[Page S11532]]\n\nthe names of the people who are coming from other countries against a \nlist that the FBI has, that the Customs Service has, and that 21 \ndifferent Federal agencies have. It is a list to determine whether any \nof these people who are coming into the country are known or suspected \nterrorists or are people who are acquainted with and associated with \nterrorists because we don't want them to come to this country. People \nwho come in are guests of ours with visas. But if they are on a list of \nsuspected people who associate with terrorists or who are suspected of \nterrorist acts, we don't want them in this country.\n  Eighty-five percent of the people coming into the United States have \ntheir names submitted to this Advance Passenger Information System. \nFifteen percent do not.\n  Among the airlines that do not comply with this voluntary system are \nairlines from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan, and, until last \nweek, the country of Kuwait. I could name others.\n  One should ask the question: Wouldn't we want passenger information \nfrom those airlines flying here from that part of the world? The answer \nis clearly yes. The head of the Customs Service, the Bush \nadministration, and others say this ought to be made mandatory. I \nagree.\n  I offered the amendment in the Senate to make it mandatory on the \ncounterterrorism bill. The Senate approved that amendment, and we \nwould, therefore, have mandatory information about who is coming into \nthis country, and that would be applied to the various devices we have \nin the Customs Service and the FBI to check these names. It went to \nconference with the other body, and it was kicked out of conference \nbecause of jurisdictional issues. Some believed committee \njurisdictional issues were more important than national security, so \nthey kicked it out.\n  I stated that I would offer it to the bills that are on the floor of \nthe Senate until we get it passed and into law. It should have been on \nthe counterterrorism bill the President signed. Since the day the \nPresident signed that bill, a bill that contains this provision, \n180,000 people have come into this country whose names have not been \nprecleared under the Advance Passenger Information System. A fair \nnumber of them came from Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, \nand others.\n\n  Does that improve security in this country? In my judgment, no. We \nought to do the right thing. This is not about committee jurisdiction; \nit is about national security. In my judgment, we ought to say to all \nforeign carriers and airlines coming into this country and bringing our \nforeign guests that if they do not subscribe to mandatory submission of \nnames under the Advance Passenger Information System, they are welcome \nto land elsewhere; they may not land at an airport in this country.\n  That is all my amendment does. It is supported by the administration. \nIt was requested by the administration and should now be law, but is \nnot because we had a squabble here a couple of weeks ago and it was \nkicked out in conference. I have offered it previously. I offer it \nagain today. My understanding is that it will be approved by a voice \nvote. I also intend to offer it in the conference on aviation security, \nof which I am a member and which is now meeting in S. 207.\n  I ask for immediate consideration of my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, we have no further debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2112) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, we are ready to move to final passage. \nThere are no other outstanding amendments that will require a vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2113\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I have an amendment by Senator DeWine \nand myself referencing the need for a GAO report. I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be agreed to at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2113) was agreed to.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 68, after line 4, insert:\n       Sec.  . The GAO, in consultation with the relevant agencies \n     and members of the Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee \n     on DC Appropriations, shall submit by January 2, 2002 a \n     report to the Committees on Appropriations of the House and \n     the Senate and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Government Reform of the House of \n     Representatives detailing the awards in judgment rendered in \n     the District of Columbia that were in excess of the cap \n     imposed by prior appropriations acts in effect during the \n     fiscal year when the work was performed, or when payment was \n     requested for work previously performed, in actions brought \n     against the District of Columbia Public Schools under the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Act (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1400 et \n     seq.). Provided further, that such report shall include a \n     comparison of the cause of actions and judgments rendered \n     against public school districts of comparable demographics \n     and population as the District.\n\n\n                            FOOD AND FRIENDS\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the distinguished floor manager yield for the \npurpose of a colloquy with Senator Mikulski and myself regarding Food \nand Friends, a nonprofit organization that provides meals to adults and \nchildren battling AIDS and other life-threatening illnesses in the \nWashington metropolitan region?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. For the past 12 years, Food and Friends has been \nproviding an invaluable and unique service to people in Washington, DC, \neight counties of Maryland and seven counties in Virginia, living with \nHIV/AIDS and other life-challenging illnesses. The group's network of \nover 700 volunteers and some 45 chefs, registered dieticians and other \nstaff provide home-delivered meals and groceries, nutrition counseling, \nas well as friendship and care to more than 1,300 clients daily and the \nnumber of people seeking these services continues to grow dramatically. \nIn order to accommodate the service demands, Food and Friends has \nembarked on a $6 million capital campaign to construct a new facility \nto serve its clients. We recognize that the committee was faced with \nmany significant funding demands in this bill and limited allocations \nand could not accommodate the $2 million in funding provided by the \nHouse. We hold out hope that, as the Chairwoman and the other conferees \nnegotiate with our colleagues in the House, you could find some way to \nprovide funding needed by Food and Friends.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We would not make this request unless we were truly \nconvinced of the need and the terrific work that Food and Friends does. \nFood and Friends serves individuals from diverse economic backgrounds, \nbut 64 percent of their clients live on incomes of less than $550 per \nmonth. With the cost of medication and treatments for critically ill \nindividuals estimated at between $500 and $1,000 per month, the \nservices provided by Food and Friends are critical. This funding would \nallow the organization to serve more than 2,000 clients daily. The \norganization has already raised $1.6 million for this initiative and \nexpects to raise an additional $2 million, but needs Federal support to \ncomplete the project. For me this is a hand-up to Food and Friends, not \na hand-out.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senators from Maryland. I am certainly \naware of this wonderful organization and this project and the good work \nthat they do delivering meals to people suffering from terminal \nillnesses and AIDS. I know that the Senators from Maryland are very \nconcerned about this matter and I will certainly be willing to work \nwith you both to see if we can include this worthy project in \nconference with the House.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair and look forward to working with her.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. As an appropriator, I appreciate the efforts of the \nchairman, and also look forward to working with her.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, since the late-1980s, I have urged the \nmayors of the District of Columbia and Commissioners of the DC Taxicab \nCommission toward implementation of recommendations from numerous \nDistrict of Columbia studies to replace the current taxicab zone fare \nwith a meter\n\n[[Page S11533]]\n\nsystem. According to the nationwide Taxicab, Limousine, and Paratransit \nAssociation, the District of Columbia is the only major city in the \nNation where taxi fares are calculated by a zone system rather than a \nmeter system. The use of the zone system is especially unfair to our \ngreat number of out-of-town tourists who have to cope with a \ncomplicated, confusing zone fare system with no basis on which to judge \nthe accuracy of a particular fare. In my own experience, as a DC \nresident, I have encountered at least 10 different cab fares for the \nexact same trip to and from National Airport. A metered system would \neliminate this problem.\n  There is a lot of correspondence that has transpired over the years \non this matter. I would like to share with the Senate the letter I \nrecently received from Mayor Williams. I would also like to include \nearlier correspondence I received from Representative Eleanor Holmes \nNorton, who I have kept informed at every stage of the taxi meter \nissue, as well as several letters from the Barry and Kelly \nadministrations. There have been broken promise after broken promise. \nMayor Williams' letter sets out a course of action. If it is not \nfollowed, I intend to bring this matter to a head next year--after two \ndecades of broken promises.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me just say from the outset that I \nappreciate my colleague's comments. The District of Columbia is the \nonly major city that does not have a meter system in place. The current \nzone system compromises the integrity of the DC taxicab system. The \napparent variance among cab fares to the same destination shows how the \ncurrent system can be misunderstood and even abused. I deeply \nappreciate Senator Levin's decision to withhold an amendment at this \ntime based on the mayor's letter. And I certainly understand that \nSenator Levin will be back with his amendment if meters are not in \nplace, as indicated in Mayor Williams' letter, early next year, and I \nintend to support Senator Levin's efforts to end the current \nintolerably confusing situation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letters to \nwhich I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 10, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: In accordance with your request, I am \n     writing to advise you of the status of the introduction of a \n     meter system for District of Columbia taxicabs. Let me state \n     at the outset that I support a change from the current zone \n     system to a meter system. A proposal to that effect was \n     approved by the District of Columbia Taxicab Commission and \n     transmitted to the Council of the District of Columbia for \n     review in 1999. At that time, the Council requested that the \n     proposal be withdrawn and resubmitted with more detailed \n     information on the potential impact of increased fares on the \n     riding public.\n       Since that time, the District of Columbia Taxicab \n     Commission has developed a proposed fare structure and \n     conducted the analysis requested by the Council. In addition, \n     the Chairman of the Commission has held a number of meetings \n     with drivers, individual taxicab owners, taxicab companies, \n     and others in the industry to explain the impact of the \n     planned change and allay any fears regarding implementation \n     of the new system. The most recent of those meetings was held \n     last week.\n       It now appears that the Commission is prepared to act on \n     the proposal. The matter is expected to be referred to the \n     Commission's Panel on Rates and Rules for a vote as early as \n     next week and will thereafter be acted upon by the full \n     Commission and transmitted to the Council for final approval. \n     It is anticipated that meters could be required in District \n     taxicabs by early next year.\n       I thank you for your interest in this matter and for \n     sharing my commitment to improve the District's taxicab \n     industry. Should you require any additional information, do \n     not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n     Anthony A. Williams.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 15, 1999.\n     Hon. Linda W. Cropp,\n     Chairman, Council of the District of Columbia, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Cropp: I am transmitting for the \n     consideration of the Council of the District of Columbia \n     (Council) a proposed resolution entitled the ``District of \n     Columbia Taxicab Commission Metered System for Determining \n     Fares Approval Resolution of 1999.'' The proposed resolution \n     is submitted in accordance with D.C. Law 6-97, the ``District \n     of Columbia Taxicab Commission Establishment Act of 1985,'' \n     as amended, specifically, D.C. Code Sec. 40-1707(b)(1)(B) \n     (1998 Repl. Vol.). The law provides that the Commission's \n     Panel on Rates and Rules shall not authorize a metered system \n     for determining taxicab fares without a 60-day period of \n     Council review of the proposal.\n       If you have any questions regarding this matter, please \n     contact George W. Crawford at the Taxicab Commission.\n       I urge the Council to take prompt and favorable action to \n     approve the Commission's proposal for the use of meters for \n     determining taxicab fares at your earliest convenience.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Anthony A. Williams,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 22, 1998.\n     Senator Carl Levin,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Carl: Thank you for coming in to see me last week \n     regarding the failure of the District to adopt a meter system \n     for cabs, following the recommendations of several studies. I \n     very much appreciate your willingness to discuss the matter \n     with me and to give the District the opportunity to consider \n     the matter before you consider any action. I write to provide \n     you with a status report on my efforts since our meeting.\n       I have spoken directly with the new Chair of the Taxicab \n     Commission, Chairman Novell Sullivan and with the Chair of \n     the D.C. City Council, Linda Cropp. Chairman Sullivan has \n     agreed to submit the matter to the full Commission at its \n     next regularly scheduled meeting on October 6th to consider \n     whether the District should adopt a meter system. Although \n     Chairman Sullivan could not say what the outcome of the vote \n     will be, he is eager, as I know you are, to resolve this \n     matter without further study or delay. The Commission's \n     recommendation must be submitted to the City Council for its \n     final review and approval. I have assigned my Legislative \n     Director, Jon Bouker, to follow-up with the Commission's \n     General Counsel, Mr. George Crawford, and with staff from the \n     office of City Council Chair Linda Cropp to ensure that the \n     process moves forward as expeditiously as possible.\n       I hope that this information is responsive to your \n     concerns. I appreciate that you want the District and the \n     Taxicab Commission to resolve this matter at the local level. \n     As always, if I can be of further assistance on this or any \n     other matter concerning the District of Columbia, please do \n     not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n     Eleanor Holmes Norton.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 1998.\n     Re Taxicab Issue Follow-up.\n\n     Jackie Parker,\n     Deputy Legislative Director (Senator Carl Levin).\n       This memo is a follow-up to our recent conversations on the \n     taxicab issue. As you know, Senator Levin came in to see the \n     Congresswoman regarding the D.C. Taxicab Commission's \n     reluctance to forward to the City Council the previous \n     Commission's recommendation to move to a meter system for \n     D.C. cabs. Following the meeting with Senator Levin, the \n     Congresswoman called Taxicab Commission Chair Novell Sullivan \n     and City Council Chair Linda Cropp. Council Chair Cropp \n     confirmed that the new Taxicab Commission had not yet \n     forwarded a recommendation to the full Council for its \n     consideration. However, Commission Chair Sullivan agreed to \n     schedule the meters issue for a vote before the full \n     Commission at its next regularly scheduled meeting. That vote \n     occurred on October 6, 1998, and the Commission voted \n     unanimously to recommend meters to the Council. Once the \n     Council receives the transmission (after the Corporation \n     Counsel reviews the legal sufficiency of the transmission and \n     the Mayor gives his approval), it has 60 days to decide \n     whether or not it will approve the recommendations of the \n     Commission. The Commission does not have the authority, on \n     its own, to effectuate a change to a meter system for D.C. \n     cabs.\n       I hope that this information is useful. Please do not \n     hesitate to call me if you have any further questions.\n\n                                                   Jon Bouker,\n\n                                  Legislative Director and Counsel\n     (Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton).\n                                  ____\n\n         Government of the District of Columbia, Taxicab \n           Commission,\n                                  Washington, DC December 1, 1998.\n     Jackie Parker,\n     Senator Levin's Office.\n       This is to inform you that the Office of the Corporation \n     Counsel has approved the Taxicab Commission's proposal to \n     covert to a meter system for determing fares. The Office of \n     Chief Financial Officer is reviewing the proposal for fiscal \n     impact on the District. It is anticipated that the proposal \n     will be transmitted to the City Council within the next few \n     days. Should you need additional information, please let me \n     know.\n                                               George W.

Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Levin: Thank you for taking time from your \n     very demanding schedule to meet with me on August 5th. Let me \n     assure you again that both Mayor Kelly and I understand and \n     share your concerns about taxicab service in the District of \n     Columbia. The Mayor has directed me to resolve the long \n     standing issues and problems as quickly as possible. We \n     sincerely appreciate your support and patience as we work \n     toward this goal.\n       When we met, you requested a description of specific \n     strategies we are undertaking, including timeframes, to \n     fulfill congressional mandates and to improve regulation of \n     the taxicab industry. Our strategies will accomplish three \n     major goals by the end of fiscal year 1994:\n       (1) establishment of an appropriate mechanism--zones, \n     meters, a new technology or a combination--for calculating \n     taxi fares;\n       (2) development of a rate-setting methodology; and\n       (3) improvement of the Commission's regulatory and \n     enforcement efforts.\n       Funding for these initiatives is being provided by fees \n     imposed by the Commission for the Taxicab Assessment Fund; no \n     appropriated funds will be used. Descriptions of the \n     strategies and timeframes for each goal are enclosed.\n       Much needs to be done, and I am excited about the prospects \n     for improving taxi service in the District. My plans and \n     goals for the Taxicab Commission, and an overview of the \n     issues facing the Commission, are provided in my testimony \n     that was recently submitted to the House Appropriations \n     Subcommittee on the District of Columbia. A copy of that \n     testimony is also enclosed for your information.\n       Let me thank you again for your long-standing support of \n     the District of Columbia, and your continuing interest in the \n     District's taxicab policies and services. I am available to \n     you and your staff if you have any questions or need \n     additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Karen Jones Herbert,\n     Chairperson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     The District of Columbia,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 18, 1993.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I understand you recently met with \n     Karen Herbert, our new chairperson of the D.C. Taxicab \n     Commission. Ms. Herbert has developed an ambitious, but long \n     overdue reform agenda for the D.C. Taxicab Commission. In \n     addition, she has taken steps to improve driver training and \n     testing, complaint resolution and enforcement activities.\n       I fully understand your concerns and frustrations and want \n     to assure you that we are aggressively seeking consultants \n     who specialize in taxicab regulation and transportation \n     economics to assist us in developing a rate methodology and a \n     definitive analysis of meters versus zones. The selection is \n     scheduled to be made before the end of September and I will \n     be certain that you will be provided with a timeline that \n     will enable you to track the progress of this effort.\n       In the months ahead, I intend to work closely with Ms. \n     Herbert and will be pursuing initiatives designed to make a \n     visible difference in our regulation of the vehicle for hire \n     industry. Your continued interest and support of this issue \n     are helpful and have been greatly appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Sharon Pratt Kelly.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the FY 2002 \nDistrict of Columbia appropriations bill. I want to congratulate \nSenator Landrieu and Senator DeWine for their hard work in crafting \nthis annual appropriations bill for the District of Columbia. This is \nan important piece of legislation and they have done their best to help \nensure that the District of Columbia gets the resources it needs to run \nour Nation's capital.\n  In addition to many important policy provisions and essential funding \nprovisions, this legislation removes several restrictions Congress has \nplaced upon the District of Columbia during the last several years. \nThese congressional provisions have prevented locally passed laws and \ninitiatives from being implemented even with the use of local funds. \nWith the leadership of Senator Landrieu, the underlying legislation \ntakes the necessary steps to correct those past wrongs.\n  I am particularly pleased with Senator Landrieu's leadership in \nlifting the restriction limiting the autonomy of the local government \nin the District of Columbia and the rights of domestic partners who \nreside here. For the past 9 years, Congress has prohibited the District \nfrom using Federal or local funds to enact the locally passed Health \nCare Benefits Expansion Act. This law, passed by the D.C. City Council \nin 1992, would allow domestic partners to register with the Mayor's \noffice. The Health Care Benefits Expansion Act would require all health \ncare facilities to grant domestic partners visitation rights, and allow \nDistrict employees to purchase health insurance at their own cost for \ndomestic partners.\n  This law recognizes the legal and civil rights of domestic partners \nin the District of Columbia and is similar to laws passed by more than \n100 jurisdictions and city governments throughout this country--\nincluding my own State of Vermont. Vermont passed its version of a \ndomestic partnership law for health benefits in 1994. Last year, our \nState went even further when it took the bold and courageous step of \nextending the same legal State benefits already enjoyed by married \ncouples to same sex couples.\n  This restriction Congress placed on the D.C. Government sent the \nwrong message to District residents and local officials by telling the \npeople of Washington, DC, that the U.S. Senate knows best how local \nofficials should spend their local dollars. This restriction sent the \nwrong message to the American public by disregarding the rights of \ndomestic partners. I am pleased that the Senate has not continued down \nthe unfortunate path of dictating social policy for the District of \nColumbia.\n  During consideration of the D.C. appropriations bill last month, the \nHouse Appropriations Committee approved an amendment to remove the ban \non the use of local funds to implement the Health Benefits Expansion \nAct. During the House debate on the legislation, the provision \nprevailed, despite an effort similar to the one before us today to \nreinstate the ban on local funds. Our colleagues in the House have \nspoken on this measure, and the Senate has concurred.\n  This is a challenging time for our entire Nation. During this time, \nleaders at all levels of government--especially our local leaders--are \nworking to ensure the safety and preparedness of their communities. \nMayor Anthony Williams and the local government of the District of \nColumbia should be provided the same opportunity to perform those \nduties, and others, as are enjoyed by other cities and jurisdictions \nthroughout the Nation. With the hard work of Senator Landrieu, the \nunderlying bill recognizes the rights of D.C. residents and their \nelected officials to debate and decide for themselves the same policy \nquestions that each of the states and cities in our country may debate \nand decide for themselves.\n  The issue of the rights of domestic partners--like rights for women, \nracial minorities, and people with disabilities--is one of basic civil \nrights for all people. Individuals should be evaluated on the basis of \nwhat they can offer and what they can contribute--not on irrelevant \nconsiderations like their race, gender or sexual orientation. It is a \nquestion of fundamental fairness. The United States Congress did not \ninterfere with Vermont's approach to providing equal access to health \ninsurance benefits, or with any of the other cities and localities \nthroughout the country that passed their own laws governing domestic \npartnership. I strongly believe that Congress should follow its own \nexample set in those instances, and should not treat the District of \nColumbia any differently.\n  Again, I applaud Senator Landrieu for her leadership in drafting this \nbill and I encourage my colleagues to vote in support of the FY 2002 \nDistrict of Columbia appropriations bill.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as we move to final passage on this \nbill, I again thank my ranking member for his very extraordinary and \ndedicated work over the weeks and months to bring this bill to the \nfloor and to work out many important and challenging issues. Together, \nwe have tried to focus our efforts on post-control board financial \ndiscipline and laying a foundation so that the District, which is in a \nsurplus today because of a lot of hard work that has been done, will \nremain in a surplus. Together, we have tried to enhance local \ndecisionmaking, where appropriate. I believe we have made a lot of \nprogress along that line.\n  In addition, particularly with Senator DeWine's excellent leadership, \nwe are reforming the child welfare system\n\n[[Page S11535]]\n\nin the District and working with the mayor and the local government \nofficials to do that. We have put significant investments in this bill \nto accomplish that end.\n  In addition, because of the September 11 attack, we have provided \nadditional resources for the mayor and the local government and for \nregional public officials--our own Senators representing Virginia and \nMaryland--of course, to be a part of that to enhance the security of \nthe District and this region.\n  Finally, we have together made some tremendous headway in providing \nresources to create more excellence in the public schools here in DC \nand reform that system, as well as to step up the environment and \nchildren's health with some of the projects with which Senator DeWine \nhas been particularly helpful.\n  In closing, I again thank publicly the mayor and the city council \nchairperson, Linda Cropp, and all of the members of the city council \nwho have been so helpful in working with us on this bill.\n  I would like to acknowledge the work of the District chief financial \nofficer, Dr. Gandhi, and particularly his staff, Sam Kaiser, for their \nwork in putting the local portion of this bill together.\n  I want to recognize Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton. She \ncontinues to work with us almost daily on these issues. I thank her, \nand also the shadow Senator from the District, Paul Strauss.\n  Our staff members, Cathleen Strottman, Kate Eltrich, Kevin Avery, \nChuck Kieffer, and Mary Dietrich on the Republican side have been \nterrific in their help bringing us to this point.\n  I have no further remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Landrieu, \nfor doing a great job on this bill. This is a bill that will make a \ndifference for people of the District of Columbia, particularly \nchildren of the District.\n  I thank Senator Landrieu and her staff, Chuck Kieffer and Kate \nEltrich, for their hard work on this bill.\n  I also thank my appropriations team, particularly Mary Dietrich, who \nhas been working hard on this bill for a long time, as well as Stan \nSkocki from my team.\n  I also commend and thank the other members of our subcommittee: \nSenator Hutchison, Senator Durbin, and Senator Reed.\n  Mr. President, as Senator Landrieu has indicated, this was a \nbipartisan effort. This bill makes a downpayment and is a real \nbeginning on what we said we were going to do several years ago. In \nCongress, we took on the responsibility of trying to improve the court \nsystem, specifically the court system that deals with our young people. \nI do not have to remind anyone in this Chamber of the tragedy of the \nchildren's system in the District of Columbia--headline after headline, \nstory after story, tragedy after tragedy, of children who have died in \nthe system in the District of Columbia. This bill provides the money to \nbegin to change that system.\n  Senator Landrieu and I have also been working, along with some of our \nother colleagues, to get a family court bill passed. Money in this bill \nwill go a long way to making the changes that we have outlined in that \nfamily court bill.\n  This bill we are about to vote on also provides some significant \nmoney for Children's Hospital in the District of Columbia, which serves \nnot only children who come from the District but serves children who \ncome from many States.\n\n  It also provides money for the Safe Kids Program, a program that \nsaves lives. I am convinced the money we will provide will help to save \nthe lives of young children in the District of Columbia.\n  We also provide money for the Green Door Program, a mental health \nprogram of which Senator Domenici has been a strong supporter.\n  Finally, the bill provides, as Senator Landrieu indicated, some much \nneeded money and resources to tie our communications system together in \nthe District of Columbia. That need has been apparent for some time. \nCertainly, after the events of September 11, it is even more apparent \nand more obvious. So this bill provides money to do that as well.\n  I, again, thank my colleague for her great work on the bill. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote aye, to pass the bill. I hope we will be able to \nwork any differences out with the House fairly quickly and get this \nbill on to the President.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know of no further amendments to be \noffered. I believe we are ready for third reading of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDIING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 75, nays 24, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 331 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--75\n\n     Akaka\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--24\n\n     Allard\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Craig\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kerry\n       \n  The bill (H.R. 2944) was passed, as follows:\n\n  Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives (H.R. 2944) \nentitled ``An Act making appropriations for the government of the \nDistrict of Columbia and other activities chargeable in whole or in \npart against the revenues of said District for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2002, and for other purposes.'', do pass with the \nfollowing amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     That the following sums are appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the District of \n     Columbia for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002, and \n     for other purposes, namely:\n\n                             FEDERAL FUNDS\n\n              Federal Payment for Resident Tuition Support\n\n       For a Federal payment to the District of Columbia, to be \n     deposited into a dedicated account, for a nationwide program \n     to be administered by the Mayor, for District of Columbia \n     resident tuition support, $17,000,000, to remain available \n     until expended: Provided, That such funds, including any \n     interest accrued thereon, may be used on behalf of eligible \n     District of Columbia residents to pay an amount based upon \n     the difference between in-State and out-of-State tuition at \n     public institutions of higher education, or to pay up to \n     $2,500 each year at eligible private institutions of higher \n     education: Provided further, That the awarding of such funds \n     may be prioritized on the basis of a resident's academic \n     merit, the income and need of eligible students and such \n     other factors as may be authorized: Provided further, That \n     the District of Columbia government shall establish a \n     dedicated account for the Resident Tuition Support Program \n     that shall consist of the Federal funds appropriated to the \n     Program in this Act and any subsequent appropriations, any \n     unobligated balances from prior fiscal years, and any \n     interest\n\n[[Page S11536]]\n\n     earned in this or any fiscal year: Provided further, That the \n     account shall be under the control of the District of \n     Columbia Chief Financial Officer who may use those funds \n     solely for the purposes of carrying out the Resident Tuition \n     Support Program: Provided further, That the Resident Tuition \n     Support Program Office and the Office of the Chief Financial \n     Officer shall provide a quarterly financial report to the \n     Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives for these funds showing, by object class, the \n     expenditures made and the purpose therefor: Provided further, \n     That not more than seven percent of the amount provided \n     herein for this program may be used for administrative \n     expenses.\n\n           Federal Payment to the District of Columbia Courts\n\n       For salaries and expenses for the District of Columbia \n     Courts, $140,181,000, to be allocated as follows: for the \n     District of Columbia Court of Appeals, $8,003,000, of which \n     not to exceed $1,500 is for official reception and \n     representation expenses;

Madam President, nearly 2 months have passed since \nthe events of September 11. The tragedy and its ramifications have been \npart of the life of every American family in the weeks that have \nfollowed. Even American schoolchildren can recount not only the images \nbut recite the numbers of the dead, the cost, and the consequences.\n  In my State there are hundreds of people who did not come home on \nthat night. The changes experienced by average Americans cannot \nobviously be compared with the families themselves--wives and husbands, \nchildren, brothers and sisters who are rebuilding shattered lives. They \nwake up every day reminding themselves of the new reality that will \nfollow them throughout their lives.\n  Recently, Senator Corzine and I met with a number of the widows and \nwidowers. You can only imagine, if this entire Nation has found it \ndifficult to accept the reality of these circumstances, what it is like \nfor a young mother still recoiling from the experience of informing her \nchildren, or a father, now left to raise children alone.\n  The pain of September 11 is measured on many scales. It has changed \nthe finances of this Government. It has forever impacted our national \nsense of safety. But for these few thousand families, it has changed \nlives in ways we could never hope to understand.\n  There is little in terms of the things that matter that any of us can \ndo to generally offer comfort or consolation. But in the ways that \nGovernment can measure compassion, there are things we must try to do.\n  Families that Jon Corzine and I met with indicated to us that when \nthey are not dealing with the pain or the trauma, life has returned to \nmuch more mundane things: A woman who even as she buries her husband \nthinks about next month's mortgage; the young family who even when they \nare consoling their children are dealing with colleges or grade schools \non next year's tuition; the young family who may have just started life \ntogether and bought a home or rented an apartment and used all their \nresources; and now, as a mother thinks about her children's future, she \nis thinking about the groceries next week.\n  America can afford to debate this issue philosophically and how it \nmay have changed our laws or our lives. That luxury is not available to \nthese young families.\n  It raises in the Senate an important question about how we can \nrespond. Some weeks ago the House of Representatives passed legislation \nto provide tax relief to families of these victims so that as these \nyoung mothers or fathers received their last paychecks or struggled to \ndeal with the financial realities or negotiate perhaps bonuses from \nemployers who are themselves struggling to deal with the impact, they \ncan at least husband these resources without concern that the Federal \nGovernment will tax what they have remaining. That legislation has been \nsent to the Senate Finance Committee. These weeks we have been working \nto prepare it and have it ready for committee consideration.\n  I want my colleagues to know that enough time has now passed. I am, \non this day, introducing this legislation to the Senate. I will offer \nit as an amendment when the Senate Finance Committee meets tomorrow to \nconsider stimulus and tax legislation as an amendment.\n  I commend Senator Baucus for not only his support but his efforts in \ndrafting this legislation. I also understand Senator Nickles wants to \nunderstandably change the legislation to include equitable treatment \nfor the victims of Oklahoma City.\n\n  The victims' tax legislation will essentially extend the benefits \ncurrently offered to military personnel and Government employees who \ndie as a result of combat or terrorism to civilians abroad. The \nlegislation will waive income tax liability for both this year and last \nyear and will refund any income taxes paid in those years to the \nfamily.\n  As I am certain my colleagues would agree, these funds are better \nused by families to rebuild their lives rather than used by the Federal \nGovernment at this moment.\n  There is, however, the question of those employees who lost their \nlives and their families who may have had income so modest, they did \nnot pay Federal income tax. Under my legislation, which improves upon \nthe version of the House of Representatives, the Senate bill I am \nintroducing will refund 2 years' worth of payroll taxes to families of \nthose who lost their lives on September 11.\n  I have also drafted legislation to include significant estate tax \nrelief for families by exempting the first $3 million in assets from \nboth Federal and State estate taxes and $8.5 million from Federal \nestate tax.\n  These are the funds these families will use for this generation and \nperhaps\n\n[[Page S11545]]\n\nsucceeding generations to bring order and security to their lives. They \nshould keep this money. It is not for us. If this is the last and only \ngift a mother or father had to give to their children or husband, or \nwife to their spouse, that is as it should be. It is not for us.\n  Current law excludes disability benefits from income if a U.S. \nemployee is injured in a terrorist attack outside the United States. \nThis legislation will also expand this to include those injured in a \nterrorist attack in the United States.\n  Every Member of the Senate should feel proud to be part of this \nlegislation. We have offered assistance to the States of Virginia and \nNew York and New Jersey because of the terrorist attacks. We have \noffered relief to the airline industry to save them from bankruptcy. \nThere is debate now on what should be done for the insurance industry. \nThese things may all be right and proper. They are not complete.\n  No financial arrangement, no change of the law could possibly be \ncomplete unless we address the question of families themselves. Senator \nCorzine and I made a solemn pledge to these families that we would not \nrest until this is done. I can assure you that promise will be kept. \nThere is little else this Government can offer these people. This much, \nMadam President, we can and should do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/07/senate-section/article/S11545-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THANKING SENATOR ALLEN\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Madam President, I want to bring the full attention of \nthe Senate to a national security issue about which I am deeply \nalarmed. Plans are well underway to reactivate and expand a liquefied \nnatural gas, LNG, terminal at Cove Point in Maryland.\n  What would this mean? It would mean that foreign ships, transporting \nflammable liquid natural gas, would come up the Chesapeake Bay and dock \n3\\1/2\\ miles down from the nuclear powerplant at Calvert Cliffs.\n  Can you believe that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has \ngiven preliminary approval to reopen the Cove Point LNG facility and \nwill let this type of tanker steam up the bay and park next to a \nnuclear powerplant? And guess when they did it? They did it on October \n11, the 1-month anniversary of the terrorist attack on America.\n  The President of the United States was warning us against more \nattacks. The Attorney General had us on high alert. And FERC is signing \nlittle pieces of paper saying ``you all come from Algeria.''\n  I cannot believe it. Calvert Cliffs, 3\\1/2\\ miles away, needs to be \nprotected. The International Atomic Energy Agency and U.S. officials \nhave warned that nuclear powerplants are at risk.\n  The Homeland Security Director, Tom Ridge, has called for increased \nsecurity at nuclear powerplants.\n  We cannot fly over nuclear powerplants. Why should we be able to dock \nnext to them with an LNG tanker?\n  From where do these LNG tankers come? One of the main sources is \nAlgeria. Algeria is on every terrorist watch list. It is the home of \nthe Armed Islamic Group, or IGA, a terrorist group with international \nreach. Islamic radicals from Algeria are key players in bin Laden's \nterrorist network. But that is OK; an Algerian tanker can just come up \nand park in Maryland next to a nuclear powerplant. I am concerned that \nthese terrorists could attack ships carrying fuels, posing a real risk.\n  The mayor of Boston is also worried about it. That is why he tried to \nkeep an LNG tanker out of Boston Harbor.\n  If LNG tankers are allowed in the Chesapeake Bay near Calvert Cliffs, \na nightmare scenario could become a reality.\n  As America leads the war on terrorism, we cannot do business as usual \nand issue permits without analysis through a national security prism.\n  I acknowledge we do need more natural gas in our country. I \nacknowledge we need to look at energy policy. But while we are looking \nat the long-range solutions, we should not make short-range decisions \nthat put us further at risk.\n  So what am I doing about it?\n  I am demanding that the Chairman of FERC review their permitting \nprocess and review their Commission's decision on Cove Point in the \ninterest of national security and national safety. I don't know what \nthey were thinking about on October 11, but they are going do have to \nrethink this whole process.\n  I am bringing this matter to the attention of Homeland Security \nDirector Tom Ridge and FBI Director Robert Mueller, urging them to \nfully consider potential risks from terrorism and to get a hold on the \npermitting processes that are going on in this country.\n  I am turning to U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Loy to ensure that the Coast \nGuard rigorously reviews the Cove Point proposal, working with the \nOffice on Homeland Security and the FBI to fully consider potential \nrisks from terrorism.\n\n  The Coast Guard has authority over foreign LNG tankers that would \ncome into the Chesapeake Bay. I have already discussed this with our \nlocal commander, Captain Peoples, who is now taking a look at this \nissue.\n  I am asking the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to look into the \npotential threat to the safety of Calvert Cliffs by this proposed \nreopening.\n  Finally, I am asking the Governor of Maryland, Parris Glendening, to \nuse his local regulatory authority to review this proposal.\n  You can be sure that I will follow up with all these officials. I am \nvery serious about the threat of terrorism. And I am sure some of my \ncolleagues will share my concern.\n  I want to make sure that LNG shipments into Cove Point and other \nAmerican terminals are thoroughly considered as a national security \nissue, not just an energy issue, and that they are part of our threat \nassessment.\n  I am not confident that those who gave preliminary approval to reopen \nCove Point gave this matter the rigorous review it deserves.\n  I want every single agency with authority over LNG plants and \nshipping to take a look at the risk of terrorist attacks.\n  Madam President, let me conclude by saying this. We are all warriors \nin the war on terrorism. Whether we are a bureaucrat or a technocrat or \nwhether we are a soldier in Afghanistan, we all need to stand sentry. \nThousands of people died at the two World Trade Center Towers because \nof sloppiness and incompetence at our airports. We cannot let the same \nsloppiness go on at our seaports.\n  I will stand sentry, working for the United States of America and \nprotecting the Chesapeake Bay. I wanted to bring this to my colleagues' \nattention. I say to my colleagues, where they are giving permits, you \nwant to make sure that it is not quite as permissible as people might \nthink.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana, the distinguished Senator from Texas, and the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois for allowing me to speak for 7 minutes on an \nunrelated subject matter.\n  It was 1 year ago on this very day that we had a national election. \nIt was on November 7 of last year when 105 million of our fellow \ncitizens went to the polls to elect a President of the United States, \nCongress, and a variety of governorships and State legislative offices. \nAs we all recall, although it is hard to imagine it has been a year, it \nwas a very controversial election, one that went on for a month before \na final decision was made by the Supreme Court.\n  According to the CalTech-MIT report, as many as 4 million to 6 \nmillion people actually showed up to vote that day, but for a variety \nof reasons in States across the country, were told they could not vote \nor they voted and their vote was not counted. That is according to \nCalTech and MIT.\n\n[[Page S11546]]\n\n  According to that same report, these votes were lost due to a variety \nof reasons that have existed for a long time. They did not just happen \nin one place or in one election: Faulty equipment, confusing ballots, \nregistration mixups, flawed polling place operations, absentee ballot \nproblems, and the list goes on.\n  It was not about one State. We all focused on Florida, but the fact \nremains, in the other 49 States there were problems to varying degrees. \nAgain, these problems were not limited to one State. In fact, the \nGeneral Accounting Office found that 57 percent of voting jurisdictions \nnationwide experienced major problems conducting the November 7, 2000, \nelections.\n  These problems were not limited to one election. In fact, many of \nthese are systemic problems with our election systems that have existed \nfor years. For example, over 11 million Americans who are blind or have \na hand mobility disability have never been able to cast a secret \nballot. Not a single ballot in America is in braille.\n  In fact, according to the General Accounting Office, of the 120,000 \npolling places in America, 50,000 of them are physically inaccessible \nto the disabled. Despite the fact we passed the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, there still is a staggering number of our voting \nplaces that are not accessible.\n  We could spend a lot of time talking about what happened a year ago, \nbut I want to take the few minutes available to me to strike a more \npositive note. Senator Bond of Missouri, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, \nmyself, and Senator Schumer of New York are all working to put together \na bill to bring to the Senate in the coming weeks. We are working on a \ncompromise proposal that will allow us to try to fix the problems that \nexisted in the year 2000 elections.\n  This is not about the past, but about the future of our democracy. As \nThomas Paine once said, the right to vote is the right upon which all \nother rights depend. Certainly we ought to be able to get this right in \nthe 21st century.\n  To reach that goal, those of us who are interested in the issue have \nbeen working together to come up with a bipartisan proposal that will \nmeet the concerns and objectives of all of us in this Chamber and, \nhopefully, in the other body as well.\n  On August 2, the Rules Committee, which I chair, approved a bill \nwhich does three major things:\n  It creates a temporary commission to study election reform issues and \nissue ``best practice'' recommendations.\n  It creates a grant program to provide States and localities with \nFederal funds to acquire updated voting systems and technology, improve \nvoter registration systems, and educate voters and poll workers.\n  It establishes three minimum Federal requirements for Federal \nelections and authorizes Federal funding for these requirements.\n  These three requirements provide for: Federal standards for voting \nmachines and technology, provisional voting, and distribution of sample \nballots and voting instructions.\n  There are a lot of ideas for improving our system that can be \nincorporated. It is not about ideology, it is about what reforms need \nto be made to enhance the voting systems of our country.\n  Our staffs are meeting. Senator Bond is deeply interested in the \nfraud issue. He has said what I think is the best line about the \nelection process. Senator Bond says: Voting ought to be easy, and \ncheating ought to be hard. He is exactly right, and his efforts to try \nto deal with the fraud issues are ones I welcome.\n  I am hopeful we can weave reforms which address these issues into a \nbill to which we all will be willing to lend our names. I intend to \ncontinue to work with those Members who are interested in this subject.\n  We do not have the answer yet, but I did not want this day to pass \nwhen I know there will be a lot of discussion about what happened a \nyear ago. Obviously, the events of September 11 threw the entire agenda \nof the Congress off its predictable path. We are scrambling to get back \nto some of these issues that need to be addressed. For Americans who \nwonder if anything has been done over the last year, the answer is yes. \nThese are not simple matters. There are strongly held views. We have \nlongstanding traditions about how voting is to be conducted in this \ncountry.\n  Americans, as they demonstrated yesterday in New Jersey, Connecticut, \nVirginia, and in places all over the country where elections were held, \nstill believe very deeply in the right to vote and have their votes \ncounted. I am hopeful that in the coming days we will be able to \nannounce a compromise proposal.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, my colleague \nfrom Kentucky, Senator McConnell, my colleague from New York, Senator \nSchumer, and many others interested in this subject matter. Our hope is \nwe will soon be able to bring a compromise election reform bill before \nthe Senate of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/07/senate-section/article/S11546-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               LABOR, HHS, EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n\n                        compassion capital fund\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to inquire about the Compassion \nCapital Fund, which is funded in this bill at $89 million. As my \ncolleagues know, this fund was requested by the President as part of \nhis Faith-Based Initiative. This is a significant amount of money and I \nwant to note that the Senate has not yet considered legislation \nauthorizing various aspects of the President's Faith-Based Initiative, \nincluding provisions which might alter longstanding rules on government \nfunding of religious organizations.\n  Therefore, I would like to clarify several points with the chairman \nand ranking member of the subcommittee about the uses of these funds. \nIt is my understanding that this fund is supposed to provide grants to \norganizations for the purpose of advising charitable organizations on \nexpanding their operations effectively and providing guidance on how to \nemulate model social service practices. Am I correct on that point?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is correct. The Compassion Capital Fund will \nprovide grants to public/private partnerships to help charitable \norganizations develop ``best practices'' as a social service agency. \nThe goal of grantees of the Compassion Capital Fund will be to improve \nthe effectiveness of social programs and community initiatives around \nthe Nation. The Senate has not yet debated the President's Faith Based \nInitiative, and the Senator is correct that this fund is only for the \ndevelopment of model best practices.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I appreciate the chairman and Senator from Rhode Island \nfor clarifying these points. It is important to note that this \nappropriations bill is not changing any of the rules or standards for \ngovernment funding of religious organizations and we have funded the \ntwo programs in the President's Faith-Based Initiative that we believe \nare authorized.\n  Mr. REED.

Madam President, section 314 of the Congressional Budget \nAct, as amended, requires the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto adjust the budgetary aggregates and the allocation for the \nAppropriations Committee by the amount of appropriations designated as \nemergency spending pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced \nBudget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended. The \nconference report to H.R. 2620, the Departments of Veterans Affairs and \nHousing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations \nAct of 2002, provides $1.5 billion in designated emergency funding in \n2002 for FEMA disaster relief. Because that budget authority is not \nestimated to result in any new outlays in 2002, the adjustment made \nherein is for budget authority only.\n  Pursuant to section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act, I hereby \nrevise the 2002 allocation provided to the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee in the concurrent budget resolution in the following amounts.\n  Pursuant to section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, I hereby \nrevise the 2002 budget aggregates included in\n\n[[Page S11547]]\n\nthe concurrent budget resolution in the following amounts.\n  I ask to print tables 1 and 2 in the Record, which reflect the \nchanges made to the committee's allocation and to the budget \naggregates.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     TABLE 1.--REVISED ALLOCATION FOR APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE, 2002\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Budget\n                                                 authority     Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent Allocation:\n  General Purpose Discretionary...............      547,944      537,907\n  Highways....................................            0       28,489\n  Mass Transit................................            0        5,275\n  Conservation................................        1,760        1,232\n  Mandatory...................................      358,567      350,837\n                                               -------------------------\n      Total...................................      908,271      923,740\n                                               =========================\nAdjustments:\n  General Purpose Discretionary...............        1,500            0\n  Highways....................................            0            0\n  Mass Transit................................            0            0\n  Conservation................................            0            0\n  Mandatory...................................            0            0\n                                               -------------------------\n      Total...................................        1,500            0\n                                               =========================\nRevised Allocation:\n  General Purpose Discretionary...............      549,444      537,907\n  Highways....................................            0       28,489\n  Mass Transit................................            0        5,275\n  Conservation................................        1,760        1,232\n  Mandatory...................................      358,567      350,837\n                                               -------------------------\n      Total...................................      909,771      923,740\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                TABLE 2.--REVISED BUDGET AGGREGATES, 2002\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      Budget\n                                    authority     Outlays      Surplus\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent allocation: Budget           1,516,219    1,481,928      186,737\n Resolution......................\nAdjustments: Emergency funds,            1,500            0            0\n FEMA............................\nRevised allocation: Budget           1,517,719    1,481,928      186,737\n Resolution......................\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                                             \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/07/senate-section/article/S11547-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         EMPOWERING STUDENTS TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, over the past several years, there have \nbeen a number of incidents of gun violence in our schools. Tragedies \nsuch as the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO, have \namplified concerns among students across the Nation that gun violence \ncould happen in their schools.\n  Many organizations have initiated efforts to help students cope with \ntheir fear. The National Crime Prevention Council, NCPC, for example, \nhas developed a list of ``12 Things Students Can Do'' to stop school \nviolence. Some of the suggestions include, reporting any crime \nimmediately to school authorities or police and reporting suspicious or \nworrisome behavior or talk by other students to a teacher or counselor. \nThere are also recommendations for students to manage their anger \neffectively and to refuse to bring a weapon to school, refuse to carry \na weapon for another, and refuse to keep silent about those who carry \nweapons. The complete list can be found on the NCPC website at http://\nwww.ncpc.org/2schvio2.htm. Every student should read this list and \nconsider involvement in the safety and security of his or her own \nschool.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/07/senate-section/article/S11547-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nthis year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred February 9, \n1993, in Hartford, CT. Johny Pittman, 29, and John L. Pittman, 21, \nallegedly robbed, abducted, and sexually assaulted a gay man. The \nassailants allegedly asked the victim if he was gay before assaulting \nhim. They were charged with a hate crime and four other offenses \nrelated to the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/07/senate-section/article/S11547-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11547-S11548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        IN MEMORY OF JOSEPH CURSEEN, JR. AND THOMAS MORRIS, JR.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to two men \nwho lost their lives while serving their country, and to express the \nprofound sorrow that our entire country feels as a result of this loss. \nI want to extend my deepest sympathies to the families of Joseph \nCurseen, Jr. of Clinton, MD and Thomas Morris, Jr. of Suitland, MD. I \ncommend their service to our country, which combined totals nearly 50 \nyears, and pay tribute to the honorable lives they lived.\n  The sudden deaths of two District of Columbia postal employees a few \nweeks ago shook our nation. We have come to realize that in our battle \nagainst terrorism at home, our postal workers, men and women in \nuniform, are on the front lines.\n  Joseph Curseen, Jr., 47, an employee of the United States Postal \nService for 15 years, never missed a day of work--a truly commendable \nfeat. He worked evenings at the Brentwood Road mail facility in \nNortheast Washington, D.C. where he supervised bar coding machines that \nhandled government mail. Mr. Curseen was dedicated to his community and \nserved as president of the homeowners' association. He helped institute \na neighborhood watch and, although he did not have children of his own, \nhe helped build the neighborhood playground. Shortly before his death, \nMr. Curseen, concerned about speeding traffic, went door to door to \nurge his neighbors to sign a petition to install speed bumps in their \nneighborhood. One of his neighbors has pledged to carry on Mr. \nCurseen's petition drive for the speed bumps.\n  A religious man, who led a bible study group at work and was often \nthe first one at church on Saturdays, Mr. Curseen never forgot the \nWashington, D.C. neighborhood where he was raised and often returned to \nvisit his old church and school. The Reverend Lowell Chase of Our Lady \nof Perpetual Help church in Washington said of Mr. Curseen, He was just \na good and honorable man who did his duty in a very simple and \nresponsible way.\n  The account of Mr. Curseen's illness and sudden death is tragic. On a \nTuesday, he started feeling ill, but assumed it was just a cold. \nDespite his worsening pain in the following days, he insisted on going \nto work, and was upset on Friday when he had to leave work early \nbecause he was so ill.\n  Mr. Curseen did not suspect that his illness might be something more \ndangerous than a cold. He was not worried that he might have contracted \nanthrax, according to his wife Celestine, because the Postmaster-\nGeneral had told the workers that there was little risk of infection \nfrom sealed envelopes at mail sorting facilities. Still, Mr. Curseen \ntook some precautions and purchased rubber gloves and shared them with \nseven co-workers.\n  In church that Saturday, he fainted. The medics who came to revive \nhim asked if he wanted to go the hospital. Replying that it would not \nbe necessary, Mr. Curseen went to work instead. At work, he felt worse \nand decided to go to the hospital. There, he was treated for flu-like \nsymptoms and released only to faint again on Sunday, this time at home. \nHis family rushed him to the hospital where he died six hours later.\n  His sister, Joan Jackson, has remarked,\n\n       And I just feel that my brother did not die in vain; that \n     he is an example, he is a saint, he's a martyr for this \n     country. He's every man, and . . . He's an example to us of \n     how this affects home, how it affects us in all of our \n     lifestyles.\n\n  Thomas Morris, Jr., 55, fondly called ``Moe'' by those who knew him, \nhad 32 years of service with the Postal Service. His strong work \nethic--he often worked overtime on the night shift--was well known. He \nhad a passion for bowling and served as president of the ``Tuesday \nMorning Mixed League'' at the Parkland Bowl in Silver Hill, Maryland. \nMr. Morris was dedicated to his family. He leaves behind his wife, \nMary, a son, two stepchildren and three grandchildren.\n  Mr. Morris was an intensely private man and, in keeping with this, \nhis family requested that people who knew him not share their memories \nof him with the media.\n  Washington Mayor Anthony Williams, who attended Morris' funeral, said \nof him, ``He was a man who worked in the Post Office, a God-fearing \nman, a diligent man trying to support his family.''\n\n[[Page S11548]]\n\n  Our nation's postal employees are mothers and fathers, grandparents, \nsons and daughters and neighbors who, just like other Americans, go to \nwork and earn a living. Unlike our men and women in uniform overseas, \nthey did not sign up for this new battle. However, like their own \npredecessors in years gone by, they are serving our country with \ncourage and distinction.\n  Mr. Curseen and Mr. Morris, two men who were dedicated to their jobs \nand never sidestepped their responsibilities even when there were \nrisks, have inspired us all to live up to our responsibilities and face \nwith determination and courage the obstacles that are placed before us. \nTheir lives have become an inextricable part of our nation's history \nand their spirits live on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/07/senate-section/article/S11548-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE EMPLOYEES OF DELL COMPUTER \n                              CORPORATION\n\n Mr. GRAMM.

Dell employees also worked diligently \nto prioritize and facilitate orders critical to the rebuilding effort, \nintelligence gathering, and our Nation's military offensive. Shipments \nfor financial services firms were also pushed to the head of the \nassembly line so they had needed computers to reopen for business when \nWall Street and the financial markets resumed trading. On a personal \nlevel, Dell and its employees contributed more than $3.4 million to the \nrebuilding and recovery effort, including equipment to the American Red \nCross to help serve the families directly affected by those terrible \nattacks.\n  I am grateful for the hard work and generosity of the people at Dell, \nand I am proud of their efforts in the difficult and challenging \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/07/senate-section/article/S11548-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/07/senate-section/article/S11548-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/07/senate-section/article/S11548-4", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:28 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1408.

RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Santorum, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n        Cleland, Mr. Bond, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1643. A bill to provide Federal reimbursement to State and local \ngovernments for a limited sales, use and retailers' occupation tax \nholiday; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise today along with my colleagues, \nSenator Snowe, Senator Lieberman, Senator Santorum, Senator Dorgan, \nSenator Thurmond, Senator Durbin, Senator Craig, Senator Cleland, \nSenator Bond, and Senator Feinstein, to introduce the Sales Tax Holiday \nAct of 2001.\n  Our economy needs a shot in the arm. The GDP is declining, consumer \nconfidence is at a 7-year low, and consumer spending has slowed to its \nlowest level in 8 years. But consumer spending is just what we need to \nget our economy going again. In fact, two-thirds of our economy depends \non consumer spending.\n  Today, we are proposing an innovative way to get Americans back into \nstores and to get our economy back on its feet. What we are proposing \nis a national sales tax holiday, a 10-day period where every American \ncan shop without having to pay a State sales tax.\n  The national sales tax holiday will save one money on everything from \ncars and computers to books and baby clothes. It will boost retail \nsales and consumer confidence, and it will help everyone in the retail \nchain, from assembly line workers and truck drivers to shelf stockers \nand sales people.\n  This national sales tax holiday we are proposing is immediate. Every \nAmerican can take advantage of it. It will not break the bank, and it \nwill directly stimulate our economy by boosting sales and supporting \nretail, transportation, and manufacturing jobs throughout our entire \ncountry.\n  Many businesses rely on the holiday season to make it through the \nyear, and many workers count on those retail jobs before the holidays. \nOur bill will help both. Even before September 11, this was shaping up \nto be a very difficult time for retail businesses and the thousands of \nworkers they employ. This sales tax holiday will give our economy a \nshot in the arm and will give families a break when they need it the \nmost.\n  Our bill sets the date of the tax holiday from November 23 to \nDecember 2. That is the traditional start of the holiday shopping \nseason. Many Americans are looking for ways to support our country. \nWith the sales tax holiday, we can help jump-start our economy by \nbuying things for school, for work, or for home.\n  It is all so easy. You do not have to wait for a check. You do not \nhave to fit into a certain income tax bracket. You buy what you need, \nyou put someone to work, you give our country a boost, and you save \nmoney.\n  Seven States, plus the District of Columbia, have used these sales \ntax holidays, and they have had great results. Under our approach, the \nFederal Government will reimburse States for the lost sales tax \nrevenue. Right now we estimate the cost to be about $6.5 billion, \ndepending on how many States participate and how strongly consumers \nrespond.\n  Under our plan, every penny of the $6.5 billion will go directly into \nthe economy.\n  In the coming weeks, the Senate will debate legislation to stimulate \nthe American economy and to help workers who have lost their jobs as a \nresult of the economic downturn. The final product needs to stimulate \nadditional economic activity. It needs to boost consumer confidence and \nspending. It needs to encourage business investment and job creation. \nIt needs to address the needs of workers and their families who have \nlost their jobs. It must maintain a commitment to fiscal discipline and \nthe long-term economic health of this Nation. And it should help return \nthe country to a sense of normalcy.\n  I believe the legislation I am introducing today with Senator Snowe \ncan be an important part of a balanced economic stimulus package.\n\n  First, our proposal will stimulate economic activity and consumer \nconfidence. States and businesses that have participated in sales tax \nholidays reported an increase in sales during their sales tax holiday. \nMost importantly, businesses have found that consumers do not just \nshift their spending to the holiday period, but these holidays create \nnew spending that would not have otherwise occurred.\n  Second, our proposal will stimulate business investment and job \ncreation. Retail businesses will need to boost inventories to prepare \nfor larger crowds. That is good news for manufacturers, distributors, \nand other businesses that help meet consumer demand for all kinds of \nproducts.\n  Third, it benefits all Americans. Low, middle, and upper income \npeople all pay sales taxes on the products they buy, and since the \nsales tax is the most regressive kind of tax, lower income consumers \nwill benefit the most.\n  Our proposal is fiscally responsible. This tax holiday will last for \nno more than 10 days in any State and, therefore, there are no \nexploding costs in the long term.\n  Our proposal does not negatively affect State and local budgets. \nHere, in fact, is how the States will get reimbursed: Every State that \nparticipates in the holiday will receive a quick payment of their \nestimated lost revenue. Before the tax holiday, a State can decide if \nit wants to be reimbursed for the exact amount of its loss. Then after \nthe tax holiday, those States would go through a reconciliation process \nwith the Federal Government.\n  We need a sales tax holiday. The economic slowdown and other factors \nare having a tremendous impact on the ability of State and local \ngovernments to provide critical services and to help working families \nwho have been hurt by higher unemployment. That is why I have worked \nvery hard to make sure that the Federal Government will fully \ncompensate the States that take advantage of this holiday. In addition, \nour plan is optional so States can choose to opt in if they want to \nstimulate their own economy.\n  Even without Federal incentives, seven States and the District of \nColumbia have already used sales tax holidays to help working families \nbuy school clothes, computers, and to stimulate economic activity.\n  This will help return this country to a sense of normalcy. Our \nNation, and each of our lives, have been changed forever by the events \nof September 11. We can never go back to September 10. Those events \nreminded us how fragile life is. They reminded us of everything for \nwhich we have to be thankful--our family, our friends, our faith, our \ncommunities, and our democracy. But as we celebrate these important \nthings during the upcoming holiday season, I believe it is important \nthat we not feel guilty about getting back to business and to our daily \nlives.\n  President Bush has urged all of us in the wake of the September 11 \nattacks to return to our daily lives and get back to business. I \nbelieve this legislation will help us get the Nation back to business. \nIt is fair, it is responsible, it will help families, and it will \nstimulate our economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support including it in the economic stimulus \npackage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1643\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sales Tax Holiday Act of \n     2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Consumer confidence and spending is critical to a \n     healthy United States economy.\n       (2) In order to prevent a further decline in consumer \n     spending, which fell 1.8 percent in September 2001, and \n     consumer confidence, which is at its lowest level since \n     February 1994, the Federal Government needs to provide an \n     immediate and targeted tax incentive to encourage consumer \n     spending.\n       (3) The most immediate and targeted incentive for \n     consumption would be to reduce the price of goods to \n     consumers, which can be done most effectively by removing \n     sales taxes imposed on those goods.\n       (4) A 10-day sales tax holiday, prior to the 2001 Holiday \n     season, would encourage Americans to make immediate purchases \n     and help to counteract the decline in consumer confidence \n     Americans have experienced since September 11, 2001. The \n     direct boost to consumption resulting from a sales tax \n     holiday\n\n[[Page S11551]]\n\n     would enhance the benefits of individual tax cuts provided by \n     any Federal tax stimulus legislation.\n       (5) A State and local sales tax holiday would allow all \n     taxpayers to benefit, especially lower-income Americans who \n     spend a larger portion of their income.\n       (6) To encourage a State and local sales tax holiday, the \n     Federal Government should ensure that each participating \n     State and local government receives fast and fair \n     reimbursement for lost sales tax revenue.\n       (7) Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Iowa, \n     Connecticut, Maryland, Ohio, North Carolina, and the District \n     of Columbia currently provide consumers with similar \n     temporary sales tax holidays. Consumer response to these \n     holidays has been extraordinary, with retailers reporting \n     greatly increased foot traffic in stores as well as an \n     increase in incremental retail sales.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATE AND LOCAL SALES TAX RELIEF FOR CONSUMERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall reimburse each State \n     for the amount of State and local sales tax payable and not \n     collected during the sales tax holiday period.\n       (b) Determination and Timing of Reimbursement.--\n       (1) Predetermined amount.--Not later than December 20, \n     2001, the Secretary shall pay to each State an amount equal \n     to the sum of--\n       (A)(i) the amount of State and local sales tax payable and \n     collected in such State during the same period in 2000 as the \n     sales tax holiday period, times\n       (ii) an acceleration factor equal to 1.73, plus\n       (B) an amount equal to 1 percent of the amount determined \n     under subparagraph (A) for State administrative costs.\n       (2) Reconciliation amount.--Not later than February 20, \n     2002, the Secretary shall pay to each electing State under \n     subsection (c)(2) an amount equal to the excess (if any) of--\n       (A) the amount of State and local sales tax payable and not \n     collected in such State during the sales tax holiday period, \n     over\n       (B) the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A) and paid \n     to such State.\n       (c) Requirement for Reimbursement.--The Secretary may not \n     pay a reimbursement under this section unless--\n       (1) the chief executive officer of the State informs the \n     Secretary, not later than November 15, 2001, of the intention \n     of the State to qualify for such reimbursement by not \n     collecting sales tax payable during the sales tax holiday \n     period,\n       (2) in the case of a State which elects to receive the \n     reimbursement of a reconciliation amount under subsection \n     (b)(2)--\n       (A) the chief executive officer of the State informs the \n     Secretary and the Director of Management and Budget and the \n     retail sellers of tangible property in such State, not later \n     than November 15, 2001, of the intention of the State to make \n     such an election,\n       (B) the chief executive officer of the State informs the \n     retail sellers of tangible property in such State, not later \n     than November 15, 2001, of the intention of the State to make \n     such an election and the additional information (if any) that \n     will be required as an addendum to the standard reports \n     required of such retail sellers with respect to the reporting \n     periods including the sales tax holiday period,\n       (C) the chief executive officer reports to the Secretary \n     and the Director of Management and Budget, not later than \n     January 31, 2002, the amount determined under subsection \n     (b)(2) in a manner specified by the Secretary,\n       (D) if amount determined under subsection (b)(1)(A) and \n     paid to such State exceeds the amount determined under \n     subsection (b)(2)(A), the chief executive officer agrees to \n     remit to the Secretary such excess not later than February \n     20, 2002, and\n       (E) the chief executive officer of the State certifies that \n     such State--\n       (i) in the case of any retail seller unable to identify and \n     report sales which would otherwise be taxable during the \n     sales tax holiday period, shall treat the reporting by such \n     seller of sales revenue during such period, multiplied by the \n     ratio of taxable sales to total sales for the same period in \n     2000 as the sales tax holiday period, as a good faith effort \n     to comply with the requirements under subparagraph (B), and\n       (ii) shall not treat any such retail seller of tangible \n     property who has made such a good faith effort liable for any \n     error made as a result of such effort to comply unless it is \n     shown that the retailer acted recklessly or fraudulently,\n       (3) in the case of any home rule State, the

Madam President, I rise today with Senator Murray and our \nother colleagues to introduce the Sales Tax Holiday Act of 2001.\n  Since last Wednesday, when Senators Murray, Lieberman and I first \npublically raised the idea of a national sales tax holiday, this \nexciting and innovative concept has truly taken root. Indeed, the idea \nof a sales tax holiday has been supported by economists and editorial \nwriters alike and from all across the political spectrum--from Alan \nBlinder, former Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank to Grover \nNorquist, President of Americans for Tax Reform. So we are talking \nabout a bipartisan bill with support as wide as it is deep.\n  And one thing everyone agrees on is that our National Sales Tax \nHoliday legislation offers the ultimate economic stimulus, literally \nfeeding Federal stimulus dollars directly into the economy. We believe \nthat this direct approach is perhaps the most immediate, fair, and \nresponsible approach that will have the most stimulative effect on the \neconomy.\n  With December fast approaching, we need to give a ``shot in the arm'' \nto our economy and help restore the confidence of consumers, because we \nhave seen a dramatic and negative reaction to the events of September \n11. In fact, the Conference Board's first report on consumer confidence \nsince the attacks showed the steepest two-month drop since the 1980 \nrecession--and confidence has plummeted to the lowest level in 7 years, \nsince 1994, even as consumer spending dropped 1.8 percent in September, \nthe first decline in 2\\1/2\\ years and the biggest spending drop since \n1987.\n  According to a survey released yesterday by the Credit Union National \nAssociation and the Consumer Federation of America, almost one-third, \n28 percent, of those surveyed plan to spend less this year than last. \nWith the economy already on the brink of a recession following the \nattacks--including economic growth actually declining 0.4 percent in \nthe third quarter--a one-third decline in spending this season could be \ndetrimental.\n  Clearly, we need to take action to restore this confidence in the \neconomy, and tell consumers that ``Help is on the way.'' As Lynn \nFranco, director of The Conference Board Consumer Research Center said \nrecently, ``Widespread layoffs and rising unemployment do not signal a \nrebound in confidence anytime soon. With the holiday season quickly \napproaching, there is little positive stimuli on the horizon.''\n  Indeed, the signs are ominous. According to the National Governors \nAssociation, dollar Christmas sales may actually fall below last year--\nwhich\n\n[[Page S11552]]\n\nwould be the first decline since Christmas of 1953, in the wake of the \nKorean War.\n  Our Sales Tax Holiday Act of 2001 will provide that positive stimuli \nat a critical time when consumers need the help most. Holiday sales \nmake up one-fifth, 22.8 percent, of annual consumer spending, so we \nwill target our bill directly toward these sales. States that opt to \nparticipate by rolling back their sales tax will be ``held harmless'' \nfor their decisions, with reimbursement made by the Federal Government \nfor lost sales tax revenue. This revenue will be replaced on a timely \nbasis so that States' cash flows are not affected, with States opting \nto be reimbursed for lost revenue based on a formula which is based on \nhistorical December sales tax revenue, or opting to receive dollar for \ndollar reimbursement based on actual sales. States will have to choose \nwhich method of reimbursement they would like to receive prior to \nimplementation of the sales tax holiday.\n  Forty-five States, and the District of Columbia will be eligible to \nparticipate in our plan, with an estimated overall economic impact of \nabout $6.5 billion for the 10-day sales tax holiday. Needless to say, \nno State would be required to take action, but we think they deserve to \nhave the option.\n  This is a proven approach that can dramatically boost sales. When \nMaryland and the District of Columbia tried sales tax holidays last \nAugust, for example, monthly sales jumped by 10 percent. One retailer \neven saw sales jump 35 percent over the same period a year ago. And the \nWall Street Journal in 1997 reported that a survey of 102 stores in the \nNew York City metropolitan area averaged 125 percent increases in sales \nduring the region's January sales tax holiday on most clothing and \nfootwear.\n  The fact is, this is an approach that fulfills every one of the \nprinciples for a stimulus that the Centrist Coalition I cochair laid \nout earlier this month. And as the Los Angeles Times reported on \nOctober 12, ``in the view of many economists--conservative as well as \nliberal--most plans fall short of the key criteria for stimulus \nproposals: they should take effect quickly, promote new spending or \ninvestment that otherwise would not occur, and do no long-term \ndamage.''\n  Our plan fits the bill and makes perfect sense--and will pay off for \nconsumers with more dollars and cents in their pockets. What better \nsignal of holiday cheer and confidence than to include a savings on \nevery purchase, enticing consumers back into the stores and giving a \nmuch-needed boost to our economy?\n  As we approach this holiday season, rather than being ``a day late \nand a dollar short'' in helping consumers and stimulating the economy, \nwe should pass this legislation and give America the gift of an \nimmediate boost to our economic strength and well-being.\n  I thank the Chair.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1644. A bill to further the protection and recognition of \nveterans' memorials, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/07/senate-section/article/S11552-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11552-S11562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PROTECTING THE SITES HONORING THOSE WHO PROTECT US\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, today, 4 days before Veterans Day, I \nintroduce legislation that would recognize and protect the sanctity of \nveterans' memorials. Currently, there is no comprehensive Federal law \nto protect veterans' memorials, which is why I am introducing the \nVeterans' Memorial Preservation and Recognition Act of 2001.\n  My bill would prohibit the desecration of veterans' memorials, \nprovide for repairs of veterans memorials and permit guide signs to \nveterans' cemeteries on Federal-aid highways.\n  Under this legislation, someone who willfully desecrates any type of \nmonument commemorating those in the Armed Forces on public property \nwould be fined or put in jail. The violator would be subject to a civil \npenalty in addition to the fine, equal to the cost of repairing the \ndamage.\n  The funds generated by these penalties would then go into a Veterans' \nMemorial Restoration Fund, established by the Secretary of Veterans' \nAffairs, to make those monies available for the repair of the damaged \nmemorials. But the vandals won't be the only ones contributing to the \nfund; individuals and veterans' organizations could also make donations \nand get a charitable contribution deduction. In essence, this would be \na new way to provide for the repair of veterans' memorials without any \nnew appropriation or providing other Federal funding.\n  The second part of this bill would permit states to place \nsupplemental guide signs for veterans' cemeteries on Federal-aid \nhighways. These veterans' cemeteries deserve recognition; by allowing \nsigns to be posted, we pay our respect to these sites by offering \ndirection to them. It is my goal to make these important sites easily \naccessible.\n  Our veterans, living and lost, are a reminder of our unity. Those who \nserved in our Armed Services are more than just symbols of freedom and \njustice in the midst of conflict and during times of peace.\n  They are real people, integral to our entire population, who enrich \nour day-to-day lives with their proud service, with their personal \naccounts of war, their organizations of service, and their expressions \nof deep-down American pride. Not only have we lost many of these brave \nmen and women in conflict, but we lose thousands of them forever each \nyear as the veteran population ages. We have to honor their sacrifices \nby protecting the sites that recognize them.\n  It is a shame that there is no comprehensive federal law to protect \nveterans' memorials.\n  Sometimes they are the only tangible reminders we have of courageous \nservice to this country. We can easily read about those brave Americans \nwho served in war, but it's not always easy to gather more than just \nhard facts from newspapers or history books. Being in the presence of a \nstatue or memorial structure can evoke a deeper response. We can walk \naround it, sometimes we can touch it, and oftentimes we can see the \nnames of each brave American who died in conflict.\n  Madam President, the timing of this bill is appropriate. This Sunday, \nNovember 11, we will recognize Veterans' Day, which informally began as \na series of memorial gestures to celebrate the end of World War I in \n1918. Three years later, on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of \nthe eleventh month, an unknown American soldier of the war was buried \non a hillside in Arlington Cemetery, overlooking the Potomac River. \nThis site became a summit of veneration for Americans everywhere. \nSimilarly, at Westminster Abbey in England and the Arc de Triomphe in \nFrance, an unknown soldier was buried in each of these places of \nhighest honor.\n  These three memorial sites are symbols of our reverence; it is only \nappropriate that we do everything we can to preserve sites like these \nacross America.\n  There are hundreds of veterans' memorials, on public property, here \nin the United States. From nationally-known places such as Iwo Jima, to \nsmaller sites such as the Colorado Veterans' Memorial across from the \ncapitol in Denver, each is a site where we go to heal and to remember. \nAs a veteran myself, I am committed to seeing that not a single one is \nstripped of its dignity.\n  I encourage my colleagues to work together for swift consideration of \nthis timely and important legislation. I have the support of several \nveterans' organizations, who have offered words of encouragement for \nthis bill. These Americans know, firsthand, the concept of service. \nLet's honor what they and thousands of others have done to preserve our \nfreedom.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair and ask unanimous consent that \nletters of support from the American Legion, Rolling Thunder, Inc., and \nthe Paralyzed Veterans of America be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 2001.\n     Hon.

Fuller,\n                                    National Legislative Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HELMS:\n  S. 1645. A bill to provide for the promotion of democracy and rule of \nlaw in Belarus and for the protection of Belarus' sovereignty and \nindependence; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, on top of the mayhem and slaughter in New \nYork and at the Pentagon in Washington last September, a travesty \nagainst democracy occurred, again, in Belarus. Aleksandr Lukashenka, \nthe dictator controlling this country, stole through intimidation and \nrepression, the presidential elections that took place on September 9.\n  Tragic as the events in our own country were and as serious an \nundertaking as the war against terrorism will continue to be, we must \nnot overlook the brutality and injustice of a regime such as the one \nled by Lukashenka, especially in the heart of Europe.\n  For this reason, I am introducing today the Belarus Democracy Act of \n2001, the purpose of which is to support the people in Belarus who are \nstruggling, often at great peril to their lives, to revive democracy, \nand to reconsolidate their country's declining independence and \nsovereignty.\n  Democracy has been crushed in Belarus by a fanatical dictatorship \nthat can only be described as a brutal throwback to the Soviet era. \nAleksandr Lukashenka is an authoritarian obsessed with recreating the \nformer Soviet Union, which he believes he will ultimately lead. Because \nof Lukashenka, Belarus has emerged as a dark island of repression, \ncensorship, and command economy in a region of consolidating \ndemocracies.\n  Belarus has tragically become the Cuba of Europe. Nonetheless, the \npeople of Belarus have not succumbed to Lukashenka. Independent \nnewspapers struggle to publish. The leadership of the parliament he \nunconstitutionally dismissed refuses to concede legitimacy to his sham \nregime. Scores of non-governmental organizations fight to promote the \nrule of law and to protect fundamental human rights. The vibrancy of \nBelarus's struggling civil society has been made evident by the \n``Freedom Marches'' that have attracted literally tens of thousands of \nBelarusians to the streets of Minsk and countless other anti-Lukashenka \ndemonstrations elsewhere in Belarus.\n  Their agenda is the promotion of a free, independent, democratic and \nWestern-oriented Belarus, a sharp contrast to Lukashenka's efforts to \nreanimate the former Soviet Union.\n  This is an agenda not without risk. Those who have dared to take a \nstand against Lukashenka have disappeared. Yuri Zakharenko disapproved \nsoon after he resigned his post as Lukashenka's Minister of Interior \nand began working with the opposition. Opposition leader Victor Gonchar \nand his colleague, Anatoly Krasovsky, vanished just hours after \nLukashenka, in a drooling rage broadcast on state television, called \nupon his henchmen to crackdown on the ``opposition scum.''\n  Other opposition leaders such as Andrei Klimov, have been imprisoned \nunder harsh conditions simply for expressing their opposition to \nLukashenka's regime.\n  This regime has tried to crush opposition marches with truncheon-\nwielding riot police. The independent press and non-governmental \norganizations promoting democracy, rule of law and human rights in \nBelarus are subject to constant government harassment, intimidation, \narrests, fines, beatings, and murder. Dmitry Zavadsky, a cameraman for \nRussian television, known for his critical reporting of the Lukashenka \nregime, disappeared under mysterious circumstances.\n\n  If passed, this bill will impose sanctions against the Lukashenka \nregime. It will deny international assistance to his government. It \nwill freeze Belarusian assets in the United States. It will prohibit \ntrade with the Lukashenka government and businesses owned by that \ngovernment. It will also deny officials of the Lukashenka government \nthe right to travel to the United States.\n  And, if Lukashenka continues to surrender Belarusian sovereignty, \nthis bill will strip his government of the diplomatic properties it \ncurrently enjoys in the United States. Indeed, if he is successful in \nhis warped effort to recreate the Soviet Union, the Government of \nBelarus will sadly have no need for these properties.\n  This bill supports our Nation's vision of Europe that is democratic, \nfree and undivided. That vision will never be fulfilled as long as \nBelarus suffers under the tyranny of Aleksandr Lukashenka. It is our \nmoral and strategic interest to support those fighting for democracy \nand freedom in Belarus and the return of their country to the European \ncommunity of free states.\n  To ignore this struggle for democracy and freedom and to turn an \nindifferent eye upon Lukashenka's effort to reconstruct the former \nSoviet Union would be a grave error. Not only would it be immoral, it \nwould be strategically shortsighted.\n  Allowing Moscow to reabsorb a state that was once independent and \ndemocratic would only whet Moscow's appetite to restore the old Soviet \nborders. That would set a precedent that would only jeopardize the \nsecurity of Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. Indulging \nantiquated Russian imperial pretensions would also undercut the \nprospects for democratic reform in Russia.\n  For these reasons the Belarus Democracy Act of 2001 authorizes $30 \nmillion in assistance to restore and strengthen the institutions of \ndemocratic government in Belarus. It specifically urges the President \nof the United States to furnish assistance to political parties in \nBelarus committed to those goals.\n  It expands the resources available to support radio broadcasting into \nBelarus that will facilitate the flow of uncensored information to the \npeople of Belarus.\n  The September elections in Belarus were stained by the Lukashenka \nregime's cruel suppression of democratic and human rights. Let the \nBelarus Democracy Act be America's response to Europe's last dictator, \nAleksandr Lukashenka.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1645\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S11554]]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Belarus Democracy Act of \n     2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States has a vital interest in the \n     consolidation and strengthening of the independence and \n     sovereignty of the Republic of Belarus and its integration \n     into the European community of democracies;\n       (2) the United States supports the promotion of democracy, \n     the rule of law, and respect for human rights in Belarus;\n       (3) in November 1996, Belarusian President Aleksandr \n     Lukashenka orchestrated an illegal and unconstitutional \n     referendum that enabled him to impose upon the Belarusian \n     people a new constitution, abolish the old parliament, the \n     13th Supreme Council, replace it with a rubber stamp \n     legislature, and extend his term office to 2001;\n       (4) in May 1999, the Belarusian opposition challenged \n     Lukashenka's illegal extension of his presidential term by \n     staging alternative presidential elections and these \n     elections were met with repression;\n       (5) the Belarusian opposition has organized peaceful \n     demonstrations against the Lukashenka regime in cities and \n     towns throughout Belarus, including the Freedom I March of \n     October 17, 1999, the Freedom II March of March 15, 2000, and \n     the Chernobyl Way March of April 26, 2000, each of which took \n     place in Minsk and involved tens of thousands of Belarusians;\n       (6) the Lukashenka regime has responded to these peaceful \n     marches with truncheon-swinging security personnel, mass \n     arrests, extended incarcerations, and beatings;\n       (7) Andrei Klimov, a member of the last democratically \n     elected Parliament in Belarus remains imprisoned under harsh \n     conditions for his political opposition to Lukashenka;\n       (8) Victor Gonchar, Yuri Krasovsky, and Yuri Zakharenka, \n     who have been leaders and supporters of the opposition, have \n     disappeared under mysterious circumstances;\n       (9) former Belarus government officials, including four \n     police investigators, have come forward with credible \n     allegations and evidence that top officials of the Lukashenka \n     regime were involved in the murders of opposition figures \n     Yury Zakharenka, Victor Gonchar, Anatol Krasovsky, Dmitry \n     Zavadsky, and scores of other people.\n       (10) the Lukashenka regime systematically harasses and \n     persecutes the independent media and actively suppresses \n     freedom of speech and expression;\n       (11) Dmitry Zavadsky, a cameraman for Russian public \n     television, known for his critical reporting of the \n     Lukashenka regime, disappeared under mysterious \n     circumstances;\n       (12) the Lukashenka regime harasses the autocephalic \n     Belarusian Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, \n     evangelical churches, and other minority groups;\n       (13) Lukashenka advocates and actively promotes a merger \n     between Russia and Belarus, and initiated negotiations and \n     signed December 8, 1999, the Belarus-Russia Union Treaty even \n     though he lacks the necessary constitutional mandate to do \n     so;\n       (14) the Belarusian opposition denounces these intentions \n     and has repeatedly called upon the international community to \n     ``unambiguously announce the nonrecognition of any \n     international treaties concluded by Lukashenka'';\n       (15) the United States, the European Union, the NATO \n     Parliamentary Assembly, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, and \n     other international bodies continue to recognize the 13th \n     Supreme Council as the legal Belarusian Parliament;\n       (16) the parliamentary elections of October 15, 2000, \n     conducted by Aleksandr Lukashenka were illegitimate and \n     unconstitutional;\n       (17) these elections were plagued by violent human rights \n     abuses committed by his regime, including the harassment, \n     beatings, arrest, and imprisonment of members of the \n     opposition;\n       (18) these elections were conducted in the absence of a \n     democratic election law;\n       (19) the presidential election of September 2001 was \n     fundamentally unfair and featured significant and abusive \n     misconduct by the regime of Aleksandr Lukashenka, including--\n       (A) the harassment, arrest, and imprisonment of opposition \n     leaders;\n       (B) the denial of opposition candidates equal and fair \n     access to the dominant state-controlled media;\n       (C) the seizure of equipment and property of independent \n     nongovernmental organizations and press organizations and the \n     harassment of their staff and management;\n       (D) voting and vote counting procedures that were not \n     transparent; and\n       (E) a campaign of intimidation directed against opposition \n     activists, domestic election observation organizations, \n     opposition and independent media, and a libelous media \n     campaign against international observers; and\n       (20) the last parliamentary election in Belarus deemed to \n     be free and fair by the international community took place in \n     1995 and from it emerged the 13th Supreme Soviet whose \n     democratically and constitutionally derived authorities and \n     powers have been usurped by the authoritarian regime of \n     Aleksandr Lukashenka.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to identify certain routes in the states of Texas, \nOklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico as part of the Ports-to-Plains \nCorridor, a high priority corridor on the National Highway System; to \nthe Committee on Environmental and Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will enhance the future economic vitality of communities in Union \nand Colfax Counties and throughout all of Northeastern New Mexico. By \nimproving the transportation infrastructure, I believe this legislation \nwill also help promote tourism across all of northern New Mexico.\n  The bill we are introducing today completes the designation of the \nroute for the Ports-to-Plains High Priority Corridor, which runs 1,000 \nmiles from Laredo, Texas, to Denver, CO. I am honored to have my \ncolleague, Senator Domenici, as a cosponsor of the bill.\n  I continue to believe strongly in the importance of highway \ninfrastructure for economic development in my State. Even in this age \nof the new economy and high-speed digital communications, roads \ncontinue to link our communities together and to carry the commercial \ngoods and products our citizens need. Safe and efficient highways are \nespecially important to citizens in the rural parts of New Mexico.\n  It is well known that regions with four-lane highways will more \nreadily attract out-of-state visitors and new jobs. Travelers prefer \nthe safety of a four-lane highway rather than sharing a two-lane road \nwith a large number of semi tractor-trailer rigs.\n  In 1998, Congress identified the Ports-to-Plains corridor between the \nborder with Mexico to Denver, CO, as a High Priority Corridor on the \nNational Highway System. This designation arose in part as a result of \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement. Under NAFTA, commercial border \ntraffic is already increasing, and the Ports-to-Plains corridor was \nconsidered to be centrally situated to serve international trade and \npromote economic development along its entire route. Congress had \npreviously designated a parallel route, the Camino Real Corridor, \nincluding Interstate Highway 25 through central New Mexico, as a high \npriority corridor; this corridor runs from the Mexican border at El \nPaso, TX, through Albuquerque and Denver, and on to the Canadian \nborder.\n  Last year, a comprehensive study was undertaken to determine the \nfeasibility of creating a second continuous four-lane highway along the \nproposed Ports-to-Plains High Priority corridor. Alternative highway \nalignments for the trade corridor were developed and evaluated. The \nstudy was conducted under the direction of a steering committee \nconsisting of the State departments of transportation in Texas, New \nMexico, Oklahoma, and Colorado. The Ports-to-Plains feasibility study \nwas completed and a final report circulated earlier this year.\n  With the results of the feasibility study in hand, representatives of \nthe four State highway departments met on July 30 to reach consensus on \nthe preferred designation for the northern portion of the Ports-to-\nPlains corridor between Dumas, TX, and Denver, CO. The four \nrepresentatives agreed to recommend designating the route north of \nDumas, TX, along U.S. Highway 287 through Boise City, OK, to Limon, CO, \nand then along Interstate 70 to Denver. They also recommended including \nthe route from Dumas, TX, along U.S. Highway 87 through Clayton, NM, to \nRaton in the corridor.\n  I am pleased the four States were able to come to a unified consensus \non the route for the Ports-to-Plains corridor. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a letter from the directors of the four State highway departments \nto the Federal Highway Administration summarizing the four-State \nconsensus recommendation be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  I do believe the consensus recommendation is a good result for all \nfour States in the region. Both New Mexico and Texas plan to upgrade \ntheir portion of the corridor to the full four lanes envisioned in the \nfeasibility study for the Ports-to-Plains trade corridor. Indeed, the \nState of Texas will soon begin construction that will four-lane its \nportion of Highway 87 from Dumas to the New Mexico State line. \nMeanwhile, Colorado plans to develop it's portion as a super-two-lane \nhighway at a cost of $537 million. The estimated cost to four-lane New \nMexico's 81 miles of the corridor between Clayton and Raton is $185 \nmillion.\n  I do believe that once Highway 87 has been upgraded to four lanes \nbetween Dumas and Raton, the route will act as a magnet for out-of-\nstate visitors to the year-round tourist attractions throughout \nnorthern New Mexico. Tourists in particular will prefer the safety and \na convenience of a four-lane highway.\n  Congress designated the southern portion of the Ports-to-Plains \ncorridor last year. Now the feasibility study has been completed and \nall four States are in unanimous agreement on the preferred route for \nthe northern portion. The time to act is now. Congress should move \nquickly to confirm the four-state consensus of the Ports-to-Plains \nTrade Corridor by passing our bill. I look forward to working with the \nChairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator \nJeffords and the Ranking Member, Senator Smith, to confirm the four \nstates' recommendation with this non-controversial, bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  Once the route is established, I am committed to working to help \nsecure the funding required to complete the four-lane upgrade as soon \nas possible. I do believe the four-lane upgrade of Highway 87 is vital \nto economic development for the communities of Raton and Clayton and \nthroughout all of northeast New Mexico.\n  I again thank Senator Domenici for cosponsoring the bill, and I hope \nall Senators will join us in support of this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the previously \nreferenced letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1646\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S11557]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands \nManagement Act of 1996 to increase the authorization of appropriations \nfor the Vancouver National Historic Reserve and for the preservation of \nVancouver Barracks; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I am introducing legislation today \nthat will reauthorize Federal participation in the historic \npreservation efforts of one of the most historically significant sites \nin the Pacific Northwest, the Fort Vancouver National Historic Reserve.\n  The Historic Reserve is rich in cultural and historic national \nsignificance, pre-dating the arrival of Lewis and Clark through the \nmid-20th century. For more than 10,000 years, Native American groups \ninhabited the prairies along the Columbia River that include the site \nof present-day Vancouver and the historic reserve.\n  Located on the great American waterway, the Columbia River, the \nVancouver National Historic Reserve site became the base of Columbia \nregion operations for the Hudson's Bay Trading Company in the early \n19th century. As my colleagues know, Hudson's Bay was the powerful \nBritish fur trading company that vied for control of the trapping \nindustry in Western lands of the present-day United States, even before \npolitical control of those lands were established. At its peak, the \ncompany built an enormous network through the region, with Fort \nVancouver as the administrative headquarters and supply depot for the \nhundreds of employees at dozens of posts in the region.\n  Fort Vancouver became a trade center for the Western territories, \nwith goods arriving frequently from Europe and the Hawaiian Islands and \nlarge quantities of furs and other natural resource products returned \nto London. The Fort came to serve as a hub for numerous other \ndeveloping industries, including sawmills, dairies, shipbuilders, \nfishers and tanneries. In essence, Fort Vancouver truly served as a \nhistoric foundation for the development of the entire Pacific Northwest \nregion.\n  But this history of the trapping industry is not the only significant \naspect of this site. The Fort also served as the Northwest's military \nadministrative headquarters beginning in 1849. The United States Army \ncontinuously occupied the Vancouver Barracks at the historic reserve \nsite for 150 years. In the 1920's, the Army created a small airfield \nfor the Army Air Corps, which is now the site of the oldest operating \nairfield in the Nation, Pearson Airfield. In the 1930's, the Fort was \nused as a training camp for those participating in the Civilian \nConservation Corps' reforestation program. And, during World War II, \nGeneral George C. Marshall presided over the Barracks and resided on \nOfficer's Row.\n  Thanks to the wisdom, respect for history, and foresight of numerous \nindividuals including Representative Russell Mack, the esteemed \nchairwoman of the House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, Julia \nButler Hansen, Congressman Don Bonker, and Congresswoman Jolene \nUnsoeld, among many others, the tremendous resources of the site have \nbeen protected for future generations.\n  President Truman signed legislation in 1948 that first authorized for \nFort Vancouver National Monument. The act allowed the War Assets \nAdministration to transfer surplus property in Vancouver Barracks to \nthe Secretary of the Interior. On June 30, 1954, the National Monument \nwas officially established and the nearly 60 acres of the Vancouver \nBarracks were transferred to the National Park Service. Finally, the \nsite was designated as a National Historic Site in 1961.\n  In 1996, the expanded, 366-acre Vancouver National Historic Reserve \nwas established to protect all of the historically significant \nhistorical areas within adjacent to the barracks. The reserve includes \nFort Vancouver, the Vancouver Barracks, Officers' Row, Pearson Field, \nthe Water Resources Education Center, and portions of the Columbia \nRiver waterfront. The sites serve as an enormously significant resource \nin Southwest Washington.\n  The restoration of the barracks alone is an enormously important \nproject to stimulate the economic revitalization of Vancouver. Last \nyear, Congress authorized the transfer of the 16 buildings that \ncomprise the West Barracks to the City of Vancouver, and the partners \ninvolved in this tremendous project have devised a Cooperative \nManagement Plan that identifies $40 million in necessary spending to \nreplace failing infrastructure and rehabilitate the 16 buildings to the \nstandards established under the National Historic Preservation Act.\n  The Partner's Cooperative Management Plan for the Historic Reserve \ncalls for the Barracks to be reused primarily for historic \npreservation, education, and other forms of public use. But the \nlocation of the site near the heart of Vancouver and the potential for \ndrawing additional economic activity back to the city make this vitally \nimportant for Southwest Washington.\n  The public-private partnership plan for the Barracks has also \ndeveloped a cost-sharing plan between federal, state, and private \nsources to locate the necessary funds and perform the renovation during \nthe next four to six years. While we at the Federal level have \ncontributed to the project in recent years, the State of Washington and \nthe City of Vancouver have also committed significant resources, and \nthe Vancouver National Historic Reserve Trust has initiated aggressive \nefforts to raise funds quickly. I have\n\n[[Page S11558]]\n\nworked this year, and my colleague Senator Murray has successfully \nworked this year and in years past, to obtain those critical federal \ndollars for the project.\n  However, I believe that more can and should be done to keep this \nproject moving ahead. We must never forget our cultural, political, and \neconomic heritage, and our historic resources help educate and remind \nus of those origins. That is why we have come together to introduce \nthis legislation that will authorize additional federal spending on the \nproject.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Murray and others on the \nAppropriations Committee to move this legislation quickly and \ncontinuing progress on this significant project for the Pacific \nNorthwest and our Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND:\n  S. 1650. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to change \nprovisions regarding emergencies; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, the events of the past month have \npresented the agencies of the Federal Government with a challenge like \nnone we have ever seen. The anthrax attacks in Florida, New York, New \nJersey, and Washington have placed unprecedented demands on both the \npublic health and law enforcement arms of the Federal Government. Yet, \nin spite of the fact that the men and women of the Federal Government \nhave never before encountered circumstances like these, I am pleased to \nsay that, by and large, their response has been exceptional, and I \nwould like to thank them for their courageous efforts. However, as \nmight be expected, this latest trial has exposed a number of weaknesses \nin our bioterrorism response mechanism which we must now act swiftly to \nremedy.\n  The Federal response to the anthrax crisis has revealed some \nuncertainty with regard to the precise roles assigned to each of the \nseveral Federal agencies with responsibilities in such situations and \nwith regard to coordination between these agencies and the \ndissemination of public information. For example, while the CDC took \nthe lead in testing anthrax samples from Florida, the anthrax samples \nfound in New York and Washington were collected by the FBI and sent, \nnot to the CDC, but to DoD labs for testing. By sending these samples \nto different facilities, not only are we duplicating services, but, \nmore importantly, we run the risk of critical results not being \nexpeditiously reviewed by the appropriate health officials thereby \nunacceptably increasing the response time in what is quite literally a \nlife and death situation.\n  I believe the uncertainty that has prevailed as to the proper role of \nthe CDC in a bioterrorist incident, particularly vis-a-vis law \nenforcement agencies, is largely due to ambiguity in present statutes \nand regulations. Presidential Decision Directive 39 of 1995 clearly \ndesignates the FBI as the overall lead federal agency for domestic \nterrorism incidents. At the same time, per last year's Public Health \nThreats and Emergencies Act, P.L. 106-505, if the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services determines, after consulting with the Director of \nthe CDC, that a public health emergency exists, the Secretary is \nauthorized to take such action as may be appropriate to respond to the \npublic health emergency, including conducting and supporting \ninvestigations into the cause, treatment, or prevention of a disease. \nFurther, the Federal Response Plan designates HHS as the primary \nfederal agency for the medical and public health response to \nemergencies. So it seems that, under current law and regulation, the \nFBI is the lead agency in the event of a terrorist attack, and HHS has \nsignificant authority to act in the event of a public health emergency. \nBut if a terrorist attack is also a public health emergency, as has \nbeen the case of late, it is not readily evident who is in charge. \nClearly, both the FBI and the CDC have essential roles in such a \nsituation. These roles are distinct but do occasionally overlap, \nnecessitating a clarification of how precisely the agencies are to \ncoordinate with one another in a bioterrorism crisis.\n  While the law enforcement and public health response to terrorist \nattacks are both vital, in the event of a public health emergency, the \nunique life and death health ramifications of such an attack mandate, \nin my view, that public health experts take the lead role in \ninvestigating and treating the attack. Bioterrorism is a new arena for \nus all, including the CDC and in such uncharted territory nothing we do \ncan guarantee that no mistakes will be made. However, with adequate \nfunding and armed with their training and expertise, the public health \nexperts of the CDC constitute our best defense against this emerging \nthreat. Therefore, the measure I am introducing today will clarify the \nrole of the CDC and minimize the problems caused by bureaucratic \ninfighting over agency roles, thereby preventing time from becoming an \nadditional enemy.\n  Law enforcement agencies and the CDC have equally important, but \nseparate, roles in the event of a terrorist attack involving \nbiological, chemical, or radiological weapons. Such an attack allows us \nabsolutely no room for confusion over these roles, however, as \nevidenced by the tragic results of the current anthrax attacks. While I \nam eagerly awaiting further definition of the role of the new Office of \nHomeland Security and I will support giving it the necessary authority \nto get the job done, the American people cannot afford any delay in \neliminating existing uncertainties in the federal response to \nbioterrorism.\n  My Public Health Emergencies Accountability Act is an attempt to \neliminate the confusion of the current system and address the immediate \nthreats stemming from this uncertainty. In proposing this measure, I am \nbuilding upon current law by clarifying the role of the CDC when acting \nduring a public health emergency. Furthermore, my measure is consistent \nwith the proposed Kennedy-Frist Bioterrorism Preparedness Act and \nbuilds on our work in last year's Public Health Threats and Emergencies \nAct. We have already had to endure the consequences of the current \nconfusion over the important, but distinct, roles of public health and \nlaw enforcement in responding to terrorist attacks. It is our \nresponsibility to act immediately to rectify this situation in order to \nassure public health, safety, and security.\n  The Public Health Emergencies Accountability Act changes current law \nin several ways. First, it redefines ``public health emergency'' to \ninclude chemical and radiological attacks, in addition to bioterrorism, \nand to make suspected as well as proven such attacks eligible for \nemergency designation. Second, as under last year's Public Health \nThreats and Emergencies Act, the Secretary of HHS, acting in \nconsultation with CDC, is given the authority to determine the \nexistence of a public health emergency, and to respond to such an \nemergency by making grants and conducting investigations. My measure \nprovides additional authority for the Secretary and CDC in these cases \nto take the lead in ``directing the response of other Federal \ndepartments and agencies'' and in ``disseminating necessary \ninformation'' to the general public. Third, the time period of the \nemergency is to be set by the Secretary and is not to exceed 180 days, \nbut may be extended by the Secretary after notification of Congress and \nother Federal agencies.\n  Finally, and most importantly, the determination of a public health \nemergency by the Secretary of HHS, in consultation with CDC, is made \nthe defining action in clarifying who should take the lead role in \nhandling a biological, chemical or radiological attack. Thus, when it \nis determined that a given situation does not rise to the level of a \npublic health emergency, law enforcement will assume the lead position. \nOn the other hand, when the Secretary of HHS has identified and \ndeclared a public health emergency, public health and the CDC will take \nthe leading role. In either case, my proposal mandates that the lead \nagency keep all other relevant authorities, including the Congress, \nfully and currently informed. If there is one message that emerges time \nand time again about shortcomings in the Federal Government's current \nresponse to terrorism, especially bioterrorism, it is that the relevant \nFederal agencies don't talk to each another soon enough or completely \nenough. The Public Health Emergencies Accountability Act will put an \nend to that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S11559]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1650\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 1.

A bill to establish the United States Consensus Council to \nprovide for consensus building process in addressing national public \npolicy issues, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould create the United States Consensus Council. This council would be \na non-profit, quasi-governmental entity that would serve both the \nlegislative and executive branches of government. Its role would be to \nbuild agreements among stakeholders primarily on legislative issues \nwhere there are diverse and conflicting views and bring these \nagreements back to Congress or other decision-makers for action.\n  Leaders from the Administration and the Congress have worked together \nin recent weeks to respond to the terrorist attacks against our \ncountry. This has shown the benefit of working across party lines to \ndevelop consensus on a variety of policy issues. At a time when the \nNation is unified and focused on these unprecedented challenges, the \nConsensus Council can help institutionalize this spirit of comity. The \nCouncil can provide ongoing support to Congress by bringing \nstakeholders to the table to resolve a wide range of difficult national \nissues.\n  The North Dakota Consensus Council in my home State serves as a model \nfor this national proposal. In North Dakota, the Consensus Council has \nhelped to find common ground on the use of grasslands in the western \npart of the State, the structure of judgeships across the State, and \nflood mitigation efforts in the Red River Valley. By bringing together \nall of the interested parties, the North Dakota Consensus Council was \nable to find solutions to problems that had previously seemed \nunsurmountable. Washington, DC, is ripe with opportunity for the same \nkind of consensus building and mediation. We can not only build on the \nexperience of consensus building in North Dakota, but similar successes \nin Montana, Florida, Oregon and many other States.\n  The United States Consensus Council would bring people together and \nthen help to develop recommendations. These recommendations would be \nadvisory, subject to normal legislative or regulatory processes. The \nboard of directors would be appointed by the President and the \nbipartisan Congressional leadership. The council would remain neutral \non substantive policy matters.\n  The Council would focus primarily on issues that Congressional \nleaders and the White House have agreed are appropriate. These could be \nissues that are contentious or deadlocked, or they could be emerging \nissues where mediation could help to prevent later polarization.\n  The Council's role will be to design and conduct processes that lead \nto common ground on effective public policy for a particular issue. The \nCouncil could be called upon to convene key stakeholders in face-to-\nface meetings over time to build agreements on complex issues.\n  The legislation authorizes $5 million for the first year and would \nalso allow private contributions to the Council. The Council would not \nbe a part of the Federal Government and its employees would not be \nconsidered Federal workers.\n  I have long been a supporter of building consensus and finding ways \nto reach compromise. I believe that this legislation could help the \nCongress and the administration to find that middle ground. There are \nso many important issues that get deadlocked in Washington, and this \napproach will help to break that logjam. Recent weeks have shown that \nit can be done. I hope that this bill will allow it to happen more \noften.

A bill to amend the Agricultural Market Transition Act to \nconvert the price support program for sugarcane and sugar beets into a \nsystem of solely recourse loans and to provide for the gradual \nelimination of the program; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Sugar \nProgram Reform Act. This bill is a continuation of my ongoing efforts \nto bring needed reform to Federal agriculture programs that have \nperpetuated Federal control over prices and production.\n  While the 1996 farm bill modernized Federal agriculture policy for \nsome commodities, the sugar program, however, only realized minor \nreforms. As a result, trade opportunities for other agriculture \nproducers have been hampered, and Americans have been twice affected, \nboth as consumers and taxpayers.\n  A GAO report released in June 2000, presents information suggesting \nthe Federal sugar program is not serving consumers and taxpayers well. \nThat report, an update to a 1993 report on the same matter, estimated \nthat the sugar program resulted in net losses to the U.S. economy of \nabout $700 million in 1996, and about $900 million in 1998. Moreover, \nit found that the primary beneficiaries of the sugar program's higher \nprices are domestic sugar beet and cane producers who were estimated to \nreceive benefits of about $800 million in 1996 and nearly $1 billion in \n1998.\n  In terms of trade opportunities, the sugar program harms other \nagricultural producers by slowing efforts to\n\n[[Page S11562]]\n\nopen foreign markets for American farm products. As long as the United \nStates uses restrictive sugar import quotas to stiffle trade, these \ncounties have a ready excuse not to drop their own trade barriers.\n  The Sugar Program Reform Act, which I am pleased to introduce with \nSenate McCain, will finally bring major change to the sugar program. It \nwill accomplish that goal by: reducing support prices and ending them \nafter 2004; requiring that loans be repaid ending sugar processors' \nability to turn over surplus sugar to the government instead of \nrepaying the amounts they have borrowed; and assuring adequate \nsupplies, requiring that import quotas be administered to maintain \nprices at no more than the price support level established by Congress.\n  When the Senate considers legislation to reauthorize farm programs, I \nlook forward to a spirited debate on the necessity of reforming \npolicies that have not served the best interests of taxpayers or the \nagricultural community at large.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1652\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sugar Program Reform Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Madam President, in a memorandum issued yesterday to \nDrug Enforcement Administration chief Asa Hutchinson, Attorney General \nAshcroft overturned a 1998 decision by Attorney General Janet Reno that \nallowed for the use of controlled substances for physician assisted \nsuicide.\n  Until June 5, 1998, everyone understood that assisted suicide was not \na ``legitimate medical purpose.'' On that date, Attorney General Janet \nReno issued a letter carving out an exception for Oregon to use \nFederally-controlled substances for assisted suicide, a decision that \noverturned an earlier determination by the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration and which was in direct conflict with 29 years of \npractice under the Controlled Substances Act.\n  Attorney General Ashcroft wrote that assisting in a suicide is not a \n``legitimate medical purpose'' under federal law and determined that \nprescribing, dispensing, or administering federally controlled \nsubstances to assist suicide violates the Controlled Substances Act, \nregardless of whether State law authorizes or permits such conduct by \npractitioners.\n  This important decision restores the uniform national standard that \nfederally-controlled substances can not be used for the purpose of \nassisted suicide by applying the law to all 50 states.\n  Federal law is clearly intended to prevent use of these drugs for \nlethal overdoses, and contains no exception for deliberate overdoses \napproved by a physician. The Controlled Substances Act requires that \nthese substances can only be used for a ``legitimate medical purpose'' \nin the interest of ``public health and safety''. Assisted suicide can \nneither be counted as a ``legitimate medical purpose'' or in the \ninterest of ``public health and safety.''\n  I have personally been a long, strong advocate of States' rights and \nthe limited role of the Federal Government. This decision neither \noverturns or pre-empts any State legislation related to suicide. \nInstead, it clarifies that the dispensing of controlled substances for \nthe purpose of assisted suicide is prohibited under longstanding \nfederal law.\n\n[[Page S11565]]\n\n  Because of Attorney General Reno's letter, for three years the \nfederal government has been complicite in allowing the use of Federally \ncontrolled substances for the specific purpose of causing death--in my \nopinion, in violation of Federal law. There is no role for the Federal \nGovernment in providing assisted suicide. I compliment Attorney General \nAshcroft's decision to return to the correct and only reasonable \ninterpretation of the Controlled Substances Act. Federally controlled \nsubstances should be used for a ``legitimate medical purpose'' and not \nfor assisted suicide.\n  In my opinion, this is very good news for patients and health care \nproviders in all 50 States. Yesterday's decision encourages doctors to \naggressively use Federally-controlled drugs to treat pain while making \nsure that one State cannot overturn Federal law. This move by Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft was absolutely the right thing to do and I applaud him \nfor it.\n  A couple of other editorial comments: I heard someone say, Well, wait \na minute; this directly overturns Oregon law. It does not. Conversely, \nthe State of Oregon cannot overturn Federal law, and that is what the \nState of Oregon tried to do.\n  Federal law has been in effect for 29 years. The Controlled \nSubstances Act goes way back, and it said the Federal Government \nregulates the use of these very strong and in some cases deadly drugs. \nThe Federal law states it can only be used for a legitimate medical \npurpose.\n  The State of Oregon tried to pass by referendum a law that says these \ndrugs can be used for assisted suicide. The Drug Enforcement \nAdministration said they cannot be used for assisted suicide.\n  Attorney General Reno made a serious mistake 3 years ago when she \nsaid it was okay. She was wrong. She was overturning basically and not \ninterpreting the law correctly, not agreeing with the Drug Enforcement \nAgency that said they never could be used. They reviewed it \nextensively. I think she made a serious mistake, and as a result some \nphysicians in Oregon were using federally controlled drugs to assist in \ndeath.\n  Attorney General Ashcroft has overturned her letter. Her letter, in \nmy opinion, was in direct contradiction of law. It was very explicit. \nThese drugs can only be used for a legitimate medical purpose, and \nassisted suicide was never considered a legitimate medical purpose.\n  Attorney General Ashcroft has now corrected that. Somebody says he \nhas overturned Oregon law. No. What he did was interpret the Federal \nstatute exactly as it was written, exactly as it has been interpreted \nfor the last 30 years, and overturned Attorney General Janet Reno's \nmistaken interpretation of law.\n  The fact is, neither Oregon nor Oklahoma can overrule Federal law. If \nso--we have Federal laws against cocaine--some States could say, we are \ngoing to legalize cocaine. But they cannot do that. Individual States \ncannot overturn Federal statutes. That is exactly what the State of \nOregon tried to do. They were mistaken in their legislative approach \nthrough the referendum.\n  Some people say this is denying the people of Oregon their right to \nvote. That is not correct. The people of Oregon can vote all they want. \nThey just cannot change public law by a public referendum. That is what \nthey tried to do.\n  So again I compliment Attorney General John Ashcroft for his decision \nand for his memorandum to Asa Hutchinson, who is the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration chief. I think both are doing an outstanding job, and I \nthink the decision is good news for patients because now these drugs \ncan be used to alleviate pain.\n  I still hope we will pass legislation to encourage the use of these \nvery strong drugs to alleviate pain. We have thousands of citizens all \nacross this country who are suffering greatly, and they should be \nallowed and encouraged to use these very strong drugs to alleviate the \npain. If that is the purpose, that is fine. If the purpose is to cause \ntheir death by suicide, assisted by a doctor or not, that is not right. \nThat is not allowed under this statute. This statute cannot allow these \nvery strong drugs to be used to alleviate pain.\n  We should encourage that. Senator Lieberman and I have introduced \nlegislation to that end, and I hope and expect we can get that passed \nin the not-too-distant future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/07/senate-section/article/S11565-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1428\n\n  Mr. REID.
