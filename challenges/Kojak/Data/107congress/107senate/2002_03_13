DAVID RUSSELL\n\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of Senator Warner, I welcome Dr. David Russell, \nwho has been our guest Chaplain, for his very timely prayer and also \nthe representation of the American Legion which has rendered such great \nservice to our country.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are grateful this morning to have a \nvery distinguished member of the clergy of Virginia participate in the \nopening of today's session as the Chaplain. It is my honor and \nprivilege to join others this morning. My colleague, Mr. Allen, was \nhere, and Senator Reid participated in introducing Dr. David Russell.\n  Dr. Russell hails from Spotsylvania, VA, and is pastor of the \nCornerstone Baptist Church in Falmouth, VA, a community of just over \n3,600 outside Fredericksburg. He served in the Korean war, as did I, \nand he served in the U.S. Air Force from 1949 until 1952. It is \ninteresting that our periods overlapped. I served in the Marines in \nKorea in the fall of 1951 until the spring of 1952.\n  In short, Dr. Russell has served his Lord, his nation, stretching \nback over 50 years. He is also privileged to be the national chaplain \nof the American Legion, an organization of which I am privileged to be \na member, as was my father. My father served in World War I as a young \ndoctor in the trenches in France and proudly joined the Legion. I still \npossess the American Legion pin that my father carried in that period \nof time.\n  Dr. Russell's distinguished background, however, includes another \nprofound and noteworthy matter. It has to do with his service as a \nlong-time member of the Chapel of Four Chaplains. In fact, he now \nserves as the Virginia State Chaplain of the Chapel of Four Chaplains. \nThere may be some who are not familiar with the Chapel of Four \nChaplains. I would like this morning to advise the Senate on this \nhistoric moment in America's history.\n  The inspiration for the Chapel of Four Chaplains and its mission of \nunity without uniformity comes from the courageous acts of four Army \nchaplains who were serving aboard the USS Dorchester when it was hit by \nan enemy torpedo and sank in the North Atlantic on February 3, 1943. \nThe four chaplains, LT George Fox, LT Alexander Goode, LT John \nWashington, LT Clark Poling, a Methodist, one of Jewish faith, one of \nCatholic faith, and one of the Dutch Reform Church, respectively--\nquickly spread through the ship to tend to the wounded and dying, to \ncomfort those able to attempt survival in the icy arctic water. They \ndied together, going down with the ship, after giving their lifejackets \nto other members of the crew. Of the 902 service persons aboard that \nmerchant seaman ship and civilian workers on that ship, 672 died, 230 \nsurvived.\n  President Truman was the Commander in Chief under whom the \ndistinguished guest today and I served in the Korean war, and indeed in \nmy brief service at the conclusion of World War\n\n[[Page S1800]]\n\nII when I served in the Navy, he was Commander in Chief at that \ntime. In his dedication speech, in 1951, in a memorial to these four \nbrave men, he said:\n\n       This interfaith shrine will stand through long generations \n     to teach Americans that as men can die heroically as \n     brothers, so should they live together in mutual faith and \n     good will.\n\n  These words are as important today as they were 51 years ago. The \nSenate is indeed privileged to have this distinguished American before \nus today.\n  This has been an unusual week for me in the sense that on Monday I \nattended the funeral services at Arlington of Corporal Matthew Commons, \nU.S. Army, Company A, 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, who lost his \nlife just a few days ago in Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan. Last \nnight, I delivered a eulogy on behalf of an old friend in Virginia, an \nAfrican American who served aboard the carrier Yorktown and was in 11 \nmajor engagements in World War II. His name was Richard Hall. He worked \nwith me down in Virginia for these many years, and was a dearly beloved \nfriend.\n  In the last 2 weeks, America experienced approximately nine deaths in \nOperation Anaconda. But I reflected last night, as I do briefly this \nmorning, on the history of two battles which took place 70-some-odd \nyears ago. Let's see, it was 16 December 1944 to 19 January 1945--the \nBattle of the Bulge. I mention this because we, the United States, \nsuffered about 41,000 casualties in that battle: Killed in action, \n4,000; wounded, 20,000; missing, 17,000; all occurring in 35 days of \nfighting. That was in Europe.\n  In the Pacific, where Richard Hall served in so many conflicts, the \nBattle of Iwo Jima was fought over 36 days from 19 February to 26 March \n1945. I remind America we had 26,000 casualties: Killed in action, \n6,800; wounded, 19,200. I also remind America of the enormous service \nthese men and women have given this Nation. Today we can stand and \nshare in the freedom provided by the members of our Armed Forces. This \nfreedom is predicated on the sacrifices, be it by CPL Matthew Commons \n10 days ago, or in those two battles of World War II. We must be ever \nmindful of the service of men and women in the Armed Forces throughout \nour history that makes possible our life today.\n  I thank my colleagues for this opportunity to address the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/13/senate-section/article/S1800-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak about the \nSenate Republican high-tech task force. Today is an important day for \nour high-tech task force, as we are unveiling our policy agenda and \nprinciples for the upcoming session and the rest of the year.\n  First, I express my gratitude to Senator Reid and Senator Daschle for \nallowing us this half hour of time to address our colleagues on the \nvery important issue of technology and the policy issues that we have \nfaced, are facing, and will face this year.\n  The purpose of the high-tech task force is to advise Republican \nleadership and, hopefully, others on the other side of the aisle on \nissues important to the technology community. We look at ourselves as a \nportal to the technology innovators and entrepreneurs to get their \nideas and messages to the Senate so that we are well informed as to the \nimpact of any potential changes in laws, or there may be laws that are \noutdated and need to be updated or upgraded.\n  The advancement of technology in the United States is important. It \nis important for our quality of life, for our competitiveness as a \nnation. It is also very important for providing good-paying jobs for \nAmericans.\n  Technology improvements benefit our lives and our businesses and our \ncompetitiveness in many ways. For example, in manufacturing, it allows \nmanufacturers to manufacture whatever the good or product is, more \nefficiently, with greater quality, with less waste, and fewer toxins. \nIn a distribution center, if you went to a Dollar Tree or a Family \nDollar or Dollar General distribution center, you would see how they \nuse technology to pick different items for their various stores and \nthen loading them on trucks.\n  Technological improvements help our communications systems within our \ncountry. It also helps education opportunities, life sciences, and \nbiological advancements that are allowing people to lead better, \nhealthier, longer lives. It can help in law enforcement and \ncoordination of law enforcement efforts at the State, local, and \nnational level. And it can provide for a better transportation system \nwith smart roads and smart cars, and the concept of telecommunicating, \nteleworking, allowing people to have a better quality of life while not \nhaving to fight traffic every day and have more time with their \nfamilies.\n  It improves in so many ways our quality of life, our efficiency, and \nalso our environment. On the high-tech task force, in addition to \nmyself, I am joined on the task force by Senators Allard, Bennett, \nBrownback, Burns, Collins, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Ensign, Sessions, and \nGordon Smith, as well as ex officio members who are the ranking members \nof the various important committees that deal with technology, \nincluding the Armed Services Committee with John Warner, Banking \nCommittee, Phil Gramm; Senator McCain of Commerce; Senator Grassley of \nFinance, and Senator Orrin Hatch, a great leader of our Judiciary \nCommittee.\n\n  We had many accomplishments last year. The education bill was an \nimportant one. No child left behind. Education is the key--making sure \nwe have a capable population in our country so youngsters can seize the \nopportunities not just of the silicon dominion of Virginia, but \ntechnology jobs all across the country. That was a very important bill. \nThe clean 2-year extension of the Internet access tax moratorium was \nimportant. I don't think there should be access taxes on the Internet, \nbut we were able to get a 2-year extension to prevent Internet taxes, \nwhich would only exacerbate the digital divide.\n  We also passed the Export Administration Act in the Senate. We \nupdated those laws so computers can be sold from this country as \nopposed to other countries getting them from France, Germany, or Japan. \nWe can compete. The House has a different view.\n  There was a proposed merger of ASML, a Dutch company, with SBG,\n\n[[Page S1801]]\n\nwhich is a Silicon Valley group. The importance of this was helping \nwith the next generation of microchips. ASML has the extreme \nultraviolet lithography tools which are important for the smaller \ngeometries on microchips.\n  We were able to advocate appropriations of additional funds for \njustice for anti-piracy prosecution. Intellectual property rights is \nvery important, and we need to enforce those. We also turned back \nefforts to change the current encryption export rules--again, very \nimportant.\n  Now, for the upcoming session, one of the successes was the 3-year, \n30-percent bonus depreciation measure, which was finally passed last \nFriday as part of the economic stimulus bill. That is important for all \nbusinesses, but especially the technology community so businesses can \nupgrade their technology and other equipment. Senator Gordon Smith was \nthe lead for our high-tech task force in getting that accomplishment, \nwhich will help stimulate the economy, save and create more jobs.\n  Now, the agenda is really one based on principles. The principles we \nhave this year are the same as last. We have added a few issues that \nhave arisen recently. We want a Federal Tax Code that is appropriate \nfor the 21st century. That means several different things. We want to, \nNo. 1, continue working to make the research and development tax credit \npermanent.\n  Secondly, we want to accelerate and reform the depreciation schedules \nfor technology equipment. We also want to encourage capital formation \nfor small technology companies. And also of recent importance we are \ngoing to work to preserve the current tax treatment for stock options.\n  Just yesterday, the high-tech task force urged Leaders Daschle and \nLott to oppose any effort to consider S. 1940, which is a bill to \nrequire above-the-line expensing of stock options. Not to get into all \nthe minutia of tax laws, but the fact is, passage of such legislation \nwould dramatically deter companies from providing rank and file \nemployees with stock options, and they are an important part of \ncompensation. That proposal will certainly be harmful for technology \ncompanies.\n  We also are going to work to enhance free trade, in that it is \nimportant for opening up fair and free trade. We will open up new \nmarkets for our technology and our services. One must recognize that, \nwhile computers are fairly prevalent in this country, they are not all \nthat prevalent in the rest of the world. Nearly half of the people in \nthe world have yet to make their first telephone call. Only about 2 \npercent of the world's population has a computer. That tells us there \nare great opportunities for our technologies, as well as construction \nequipment, and so forth, all over the world; and tearing down barriers \nwill help our jobs in this country and our technological advancements \nto continue. Also, it would not only benefit our country, but it would \nincrease the standard of living for those who tear down those barriers \nso that their citizenry can have the opportunities of advanced \ntechnology for their quality of life, a better environment, and more \nopportunities. So we are going to continue to advocate trade promotion \nauthority. We will also continue working to protect Internet security, \nand we will continue combating terrorism.\n\n  To that end, we are going to seek advancement of the Bennett-Kyl \nlegislation to allow information sharing between private companies and \nthe Government by codifying a limited Freedom of Information Act \nexemption.\n  We are going to support the Bush administration's budget, as far as \nfunding for cyber-security issues. We are going to continue working to \nsafeguard copyrights in the digital age. That is very important. The \nprivate sector needs to work together with a variety of companies to do \nit, rather than worry about an inept Federal Government dictating \nstandards in that regard.\n  We are going to continue promoting education and technology in a \nvariety of ways. There are some good ideas that we are supporting--\nparticularly, the President in his effort on education, proposing that \nfamilies of students who are in failing schools get a tax credit. A \n$2,500 tax credit could go toward purchasing computers, peripherals, \nbooks, and also tuition. Personally, I am for a tax credit focusing on \ncomputers and peripherals, educational software and tutoring. It should \nnot just be for kids in failing schools, but for all schools, in order \nto bridge the digital divide.\n  We are going to work to expand broadband technologies. The Patent and \nTrademark Office funding is important. Those fees ought to go to the \nPatent and Trademark Office and should not be diverted to other \nefforts. We want to keep government out of competition with e-commerce \nbusinesses.\n  Digital decency. We are for it. We want the private sector to look at \nways to put in a filter so people can enjoy the Internet as they see \nfit, as opposed to the government censoring it.\n  In the area of legal reform, there are several areas--especially \nclass actions. We have these class action lawsuits filed all over the \ncountry. The diversity of that jurisdiction, at the option of the \ndefendant, ought to be more easily removed to Federal court to get a \nbetter, more expedited and fair judgment.\n  Also, spectrum reform is very important, particularly in rural areas. \nI am going to yield in a minute to the Senator from Montana.\n  Before I do that, I ask unanimous consent that endorsements of these \npolicy principles and ideas by the Information Technology Association \nof America, Information Technology Industry Council, the Business \nSoftware Alliances, the Electronic Industries Alliance, TechNet, and \nACT be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 ITAA Lauds High Tech Task Force Agenda\n\n       Arlington, VA.--The information Technology Association of \n     America (ITTA) today praised the Senate Republican High Tech \n     Task Force as the group kicked off its 2002 agenda on Capitol \n     Hill.\n       ``We look forward to working with the Republican High Tech \n     Task Force as well as Democrats in the Senate to achieve \n     sound policy that will allow the high tech industry to once \n     again become the engine of our U.S. economy,'' said ITTA \n     President Harris N. Miller, adding ``Last week's passage of \n     the Economic Stimulus legislation on a bipartisan basis \n     showed that the HTTF, under Senator Allen's leadership, \n     reaching across the aisle can accomplish great objectives for \n     the IT industry.''\n       ``In 2001, we worked on a bipartisan basis to support \n     passage of key tech related bills such as the extension of \n     the Internet tax moratorium and education reform,'' Miller \n     continued. ``This year, Trade Promotion Authority and \n     improving information security are some of ITAA's top \n     priorities, so we are gratified to see them also topping the \n     HTTF agenda.''\n       The Information Technology Association of America (ITTA) \n     provides global public policy, business networking, and \n     national leadership to promote the continued rapid growth of \n     the IT industry. ITAA consists of over 500 corporate members \n     throughout the U.S., and a global network of 47 countries' IT \n     associates. The Association plays the leading role in issues \n     of IT industry concern including information security, taxes \n     and finance policy, digital intellectual property protection, \n     telecommunications competition, workforce and education, \n     immigration, online privacy and consumer protection, \n     government IT procurement, human resources and e-commerce \n     policy. ITAA members range from the smallest IT start-ups to \n     industry leaders in the Internet, software, IT services, ASP, \n     digital content, systems integration, telecommunications, and \n     enterprise solution fields.\n                                  ____\n\n\n ITI Applauds Senate Republican Task Force Agenda, Recent Legislative \n                            Accomplishments\n\n       Washington, DC.--The Information Technology Industry \n     Council (ITI) applauds the Senate Republican High-Tech Task \n     Force for its 2002 agenda and its work securing passage of \n     key legislative initiatives during the past year.\n       ``We are pleased to support the Task Force's agenda and \n     would like to thank them for their work last year to secure \n     passage of legislation vital to the IT industry,'' said Rhett \n     Dawson, President of ITI.\n       ``The 30 percent bonus depreciation provision in the \n     stimulus bill, Senate passage of education reform \n     legislation, and the two-year moratorium on Internet access \n     taxes were key victories for the IT industry. The work of the \n     Task Force was key to achieving these goals.

The HTTF was instrumental in securing a two year \n     extension to Internet tax ban, the Export Authorization \n     Administration Act and a new 3 year, 30 percent accelerated \n     depreciation schedule for technology equipment. The HTTF was \n     also an important force in thwarting efforts to restrict \n     export rules for encryption that would have been disastrous \n     to software companies, e-commerce and privacy.\n       The HTTF technology agenda announced today demonstrates \n     that their continued commitment to providing entrepreneurial \n     technology companies with the ability to succeed. ACT is \n     especially excited by HTTF's goals for issues such as \n     protecting privacy, educating a workforce for the 21st \n     century, expanding free trade and updating our nation's tax \n     code to reflect the realities of the New Economy.\n       ``The Republican Senate High Tech Task Force has been a \n     powerful ally for entrepreneurial technology companies. ACT \n     looks forward to working the issues that will be critical to \n     ensuring the continued success of the American technology \n     industry,'' said ACT President Jonathan Zuck.\n       ACT is a national education and advocacy group for the \n     technology industry. Representing mostly small- and mid-size \n     companies, ACT is the industry's strongest voice when it \n     comes to preserving competition and innovation in the high \n     tech sector. ACT's membership includes businesses involved in \n     all aspects of the IT sector including computer software and \n     hardware development, IT consulting and training, dot-coms.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. I now yield to the Senator from Montana, Mr. Burns, who \nhas been a strong and knowledgeable advocate and leader of improving \ntechnology. The Commonwealth of Virginia has rural areas, but not as \nmany as Montana. One of the ways that rural areas, whether out West, or \nin the South, or in Hawaii, can benefit from technology and \ncommunication is with leadership of people such as Senator Burns.\n  I yield to Senator Burns.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from \nMontana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my good friend from Virginia. The Senator from \nVirginia has rural areas; we have frontier areas. That kind of draws a \ndistinction. I think the Senator from Virginia has picked up a big part \nof the responsibility of furthering the agenda of high technology \nbecause our States do have a lot of similarity, such as in distance \nlearning and telemedicine. These areas are isolated by mountains, where \ncommunications and the free flow of information have eluded people. Of \ncourse, with that in mind, I think he has picked up on what he wants to \ndo with his State of Virginia, so that not only Northern Virginia \nbenefits from research and development but the advancement of the \ninformation age, and also that the rest of the State can participate in \nit as well.\n  If you look at my State of Montana, you see we have similar \nchallenges ahead of us. I congratulate Senator\n\n[[Page S1803]]\n\nAllen for his fine work. He has done a marvelous job chairing this \nhigh-tech task force. Under his leadership, we were able to aid in some \nvictories last year, including the extension of the Internet tax \nmoratorium for 2 years and the inclusion of an enhanced depreciation \nprovision in the stimulus package that the President just signed.\n  Senator Allen went over the list that pretty well sets our \npriorities, and not necessarily in that order; they are all very \nimportant.\n  I am a member of the Internet caucus, which is a bipartisan group. \nThis year in our opening reception we had over 40 exhibitors. Senator \nAllen came. Approximately 1,000 people attended that reception. The \nfree flow of information has become very important.\n  I want to go over a couple of points. I gave a lot of speeches before \nI ever came to the Senate saying there have been three interventions \nthat have changed our whole way of life. It has really brought the size \nof our planet down considerably. First is the jet engine, second is the \ntransistor, and third is the silicon chip. In a matter of hours, we can \nbe anywhere in the world. We can in 5 seconds exchange ideas visually \nand audibly anywhere in the world, whether it be land line or through \nspace. The silicon chip has sped up the way we handle information. It \nhas changed our life forever. This planet is smaller because of those \ninventions.\n  Look at what has happened since. As the information age came upon us, \nwe realized as far back as 1989 and 1990, when I first came to the \nSenate, that the policies that guided the infrastructure for that flow \nof information were passed in 1934. We soon understood that some policy \nchanges were going to have to take place before we could see gigantic \nmoves or an extension of the way we were to deal with the free flow of \ninformation. As a result, it only took 6 years to pass the Telco Act of \n1996 because we were trying to set policy for technologies that went \nway beyond what was thought in 1935.\n  The free flow of information is democracy. We all base our decisions \non the information we get. As long as it is a free flow of information, \na free flow of ideas, our democracy and our Republic will remain strong \nand people will participate in the political arena. Freedom equals \nopportunity, but it is also held together by an ingredient called \nresponsibility.\n  We were not finished looking at the policies before we got the \nInternet, this great infrastructure of information. We have to take a \nlook at the insurance to be sure we have sound organizations as the \ngatekeepers.\n  Specifically, before we can look at the complex area of comprehensive \nspectrum reform, we should keep in mind the vital nature of spectrum to \nthose on the front line of homeland defense, our first responders: The \npolice, fire, medical, public health, and other emergency response \nagencies.\n  We passed a bill in the last Congress that is revolutionizing the \ncell phone industry. For the first time, we made 911 the national \nemergency number. Now, with new technology, one can dial 911 on a cell \nphone and reach the nearest first responder. Before, in the cell phone \nindustry, if one dialed 911, they were apt to get anybody anywhere. The \ncalls now go into the nearest communications center that can handle an \nemergency.\n  Another topic that will prove of utmost importance to critical \ninfrastructure is the operation of a shadowy organization known as the \nInternet Corporation for Names and Numbers, commonly known as ICANN. \nThe formation of ICANN originated with the so-called green and white \npapers of the Clinton administration in 1998 that proposed the \ndelegation of control of the domain name system from the Commerce \nDepartment to an entirely new organization which would be a new, not-\nfor-profit corporation formed by private sector Internet stakeholders.\n\n  The Clinton administration further proposed that the U.S. Government \nshould end its role in the Internet numbers and names address system. \nSoon thereafter, ICANN was created and the Commerce Department began to \ndelegate the functions of the Internet domain name system to it.\n  In the eyes of many critics, this delegation has happened far too \nswiftly. While ICANN is supposed to function by consensus of the \nInternet community, its operation has often been controversial and \nshrouded in mystery. Recently, even the President of ICANN, Stuart \nLynn, admitted publicly the organization is not working and needs to \nundergo comprehensive structural reform because it is losing sight of \neffectiveness in accomplishing our real mission.\n  Taking into account that the ICANN mission is ensuring the stable and \nsecure management of the Internet domain system, I am extremely \nconcerned at these developments which are so critical to our national \nsecurity.\n  In another area, to make the Internet more responsible and make it \nrespond to the users, to give the users confidence in this system, we \nhave to look at spamming. Spamming is the receiving of unwanted junk \nmail. I do not know of a time on my address anyway that I have received \nmore spam than I am right now. It is a lot more than when I was in the \nU.S. Marine Corps, I can tell you that. The irresponsible use of \nspamming by marketers cannot be tolerated. To ensure the free flow of \ninformation and confidence in this system, we have to take a look at \nprivacy.\n  Those are the areas we should be focusing on now in order to let this \ngreat technology be a workhorse for us.\n  I thank the chairman of the high-tech task force. I applaud him for \nhis leadership in taking on this great responsibility. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana for his \neloquent remarks, his strong leadership, and his understanding that \nwith freedom come innovation and improvements in our lives.\n  I now yield to Senator Bennett of Utah who was chairman of this task \nforce previous to me but is still a leader on our task force and \nsomeone who is greatly respected in the area of technology and, as I \nmentioned earlier, he has provided the key leadership in the Senate on \ncyber-security.\n  I yield to the Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, my plea is very simple and can be stated in 1 minute: \nWe must, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, think anew and act anew, \nrecognizing that in the cyber-age, many of the attitudes we have had \nabout warfare, about vulnerability, about opportunity have to be \nthought through entirely differently.\n  If we can understand that and put aside some of our old prejudices \nand old ideas about technology and about regulation, we will be on the \nroad to the prosperity and security we need. If we cling to the old \nideas, the old paradigms with respect to information sharing and \nantitrust activities, we are in for serious trouble.\n  So in 1 minute, that is my message. Let us think anew, let us act \nanew, and let us recognize the technological age has changed \neverything.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President. I rise today to briefly speak about the \nimportance of technology to our economy and our way of life.\n  Just think about how technology has changed our lives over the past \nfew decades. Not so long ago, documents could only be sent through the \nmail, computers were enormous metal boxes with limited functionality, \nand the Internet--although it had been invented--was neither user \nfriendly nor accessible. When I was growing up, watching television \nmeant the handful of network channels we could get from an antenna on \nthe roof; and when our car broke down we'd have to hitch hike to the \nnext gas station or pay phone to call for help. It's hard to believe \nthat for my three young children, those are things of the past. They're \nused to cell phones and cable TV.\n  We now live in a world where technology represents one of the largest \nand fastest growing sectors of our economy. Technology employs millions \nof Americans and was largely responsible for the tremendous economic \nexpansion from 1994 to 2000. Technology certainly helped fuel the \ngrowth of my State's economy. According to the U.S. Department of \nCommerce, Nevada is second in the Nation for net creation of high-tech \nbusinesses. And I strongly encourage that growth because those\n\n[[Page S1804]]\n\nbusinesses paid my constituents over $1.3 billion in wages.\n  Advances in technology have made our personal lives easier and our \nprofessional lives more productive. Speed bumps in the communication \nprocess have been eliminated and replaced with wireless phones and e-\nmail. Advances in technology and the Internet now allow me to visit \nregularly with my constituents in Nevada while I am working in \nWashington through a real-time video teleconferencing network. \nConstituents of mine back in Nevada are able to listen to my remarks \nhere on the Senate floor by logging on to my website.\n  Indeed, 10 years ago I would have never imagined technological \nadvances such as these, and I am certain that there will be more \nunforeseen breakthroughs in the coming years.\n  Although new technologies greatly benefit American society, new \nissues have arisen for legislators to address in order for America to \nremain a world leader in technological innovation. We must grapple with \nbroadband deployment, copyright protection and enhanced wireless \nservices if we want America to have a competitive advantage.\n  High-speed Internet access, or broadband, will drive the economy of \ntomorrow and every American household should have access to it at \nreasonable rates. I believe that broadband Internet will serve as the \nfoundation for technological and communications advances in the future. \nAccording to Commerce Secretary Evans, broadband is vital to America's \neconomy and will produce over 1 million new American jobs and an \nadditional $50 billion a year for our economy. The importance of this \ntechnology cannot be underestimated, and surprisingly few Americans \nhave access to this service or subscribe to it due to its high cost and \nits lack of desirable content. While there are a number of legislative \nproposals currently before the U.S. Senate which aim to increase \nbroadband availability, this issue is far from resolved.\n\n  I am working with my colleagues on the Senate Commerce Committee to \naddress this important issue in a way that will level the regulatory \nplaying field for service providers, create incentives for private \ninvestment in the networks, and preserve competition in the \nmarketplace. In short, instead of rolling out the red tape on private \nindustry, we should roll out the red carpet to allow competition in the \nfairest manner possible.\n  As more Americans subscribe to broadband, private industry must work \ncooperatively to ensure that copyrighted material is protected from \npiracy. While America leads the world in software, entertainment, and \nother kinds of intellectual property innovation, piracy is on the rise \nand has taken a serious toll on our economy. In 2000, piracy cost \nAmerica an estimated 107,000 information technology jobs, $5.3 billion \nin wages and $1.8 billion in U.S. tax revenue. It is clear that the \npractice of piracy must be stopped. If not, the American economy will \ncontinue to suffer and we will lag behind other nations in technology \ninnovations. We must aggressively protect copyrighted works--both at \nhome and abroad--that will drive the economy of tomorrow. The Commerce \nCommittee recently held a hearing on this important issue, and I am \naggressively working with my colleagues to stop piracy and bring a new \nlevel of protection to copyrighted works.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we must encourage further advances in \nwireless technology. In the last 10 years, wireless phone use has \nskyrocketed, and over 132 million Americans now have a cell phone. \nPrices have fallen and service quality has improved. Wireless has \nexpanded beyond voice to include wireless e-mail and text messaging, \nlike by Blackberry, which allows me to send and receive e-mail when I \nam on the road.\n  Overseas, next generation wireless technology, such as wireless video \nand Internet, have been deployed along with many other exciting new \nservices. Unfortunately, the United States has begun to lag behind \nother nations in offering advanced wireless services. A number of \nissues--such as spectrum management, spectrum harmonization, and \nwireless security--demand our immediate attention in order to bring \nthese exciting new services home. As a member of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee and Co-chair of the Internet Caucus Wireless Task Force, I \nwill continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to reestablish \nthe United States as the global leader in wireless technology.\n  In conclusion, we have accomplished much over the past year on many \ntechnology issues. The Republican High Tech Task Force has been an \neffective voice for technology on Capitol Hill. Members of the Task \nForce have helped secure additional funding for the Patent and \nTrademark Office, encourage greater copyright enforcement within the \nDepartment of Justice, and provide tax incentives to stimulate business \ninvestment in technology infrastructure. I look forward to another \nproductive year.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate High \nTech Task Force, HTTF, I am proud to speak about the importance of the \nhi-tech sector, a sector of our economy that has in the past been such \nan effective engine of growth in my State of Oregon.\n  And it is this engine of growth that needs strengthening in order to \nhelp the Oregon economy grow.\n  I am so pleased that the President signed into law last weekend an \neconomic stimulus package that included both an extension of \nunemployment benefits and the bonus depreciation changes that I and \nother members of the Task Force worked so hard to pass in the Senate.\n  Oregon, as many of you know, had an unemployment rate of 8 percent in \nJanuary, well above the national average.\n  The stimulus package included a much-needed unemployment benefit \nextension, one that Oregon had already qualified for because of its \nhigh unemployment rate.\n  But this stimulus package also included real economic stimulus that I \nbelieve will boost the Oregon economy.\n  Both this year and last I have had the privilege of introducing bonus \ndepreciation amendments to various economic stimulus bills in an \nattempt to actually stimulate business investment.\n  I did this because the current Tax Code penalized businesses, \nespecially the hi-tech sector, by forcing them to choose between either \nretaining outdated equipment to fully recover their costs or foregoing \nfull recovery in order to stay abreast of the latest development in the \nhi-tech fields.\n  Businessmen, farmers, the hi-tech industry all benefit from \naccelerated depreciation, and the impact on this Nation's economy will \nprovide greater opportunities for jobs in my home State of Oregon where \nthe hi-tech sector is so critical to economic recovery.\n  Now we must take the next step in bolstering the hi-tech community by \nmaking permanent the R tax credit.\n  The R tax credit encourages investment in basic research that over \nthe long term can lead to the development of new, cheaper, and better \ntechnology products and services.\n  Research and development is essential for long-term economic growth. \nInnovations in science and technology have fueled the massive economic \nexpansion we witnessed over the course of the 20th century.\n  These advancement have improved the standard of living for nearly \nevery American.\n  Simply put, the research tax credit is an investment in economic \ngrowth, new jobs, and important new products and processes.\n  The R credit must be made permanent: This credit was originally \nenacted in 1981, and has been temporarily extended many times. \nPermanent extension of long overdue.\n  Because this vital credit isn't permanent, it offers business less \nvalue than it should. Business, unlike Congress, must plan and budget \nin a multiyear process. Scientific enterprise does not fit neatly into \ncalender or fiscal years.\n  Research and development projects typically take a number of years, \nand may even last longer than a decade.\n  As our business leaders plan these projects, they need to know \nwhether or not they can count on this tax credit.\n  Current uncertainty surrounding the credit has induced businesses to \nallocate significantly less to research than they otherwise would if \nthey knew the tax credit would be available in future years.\n  This uncertainty undermines the entire purpose of the credit.\n\n[[Page S1805]]\n\n  Investment in R is important because it spurs innovation and \neconomic growth: Information technology was responsible for more than \none-third of real economic growth in the late 1990s.\n  Information technology industries account for more than $500 billion \nof the annual U.S. economy. R is widely seen as a cornerstone of \ntechnological innovations, which in turn serves as a primary engine of \nlong-term economic growth.\n  This tax credit will result in higher wages. Findings from a study \nconducted by Coopers & Lybrand show that workers in every State will \nbenefit from higher wages if the research credit is made permanent.\n  Payroll increases as a result of gains in productivity stemming from \nthe credit have been estimated to exceed $60 billion over the next 12 \nyears.\n  Furthermore, greater productivity from additional research and \ndevelopment will increase overall economic growth in every State in the \nUnion. Research and development is essential for long-term economic \ngrowth.\n  The tax credit is cost-effective: The R tax credit appears to be a \ncost-effective policy instrument for increasing business R \ninvestment.

Under the previous order, the time until 11:30 \na.m. shall be for debate only relative to ethanol.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, for the next several minutes, \nI will speak about the renewable fuel standard as part of the energy \nbill. For more than an hour, perhaps closer to 2 hours, my colleagues \nand I will be talking about the importance of the renewable fuel \nstandard as a part of the energy bill and as a part of our national \ndefense, as well as our economy, and for the environment.\n  In the early days of the automobile, Henry Ford believed at first \nthat the best source of power for the automobile was with ethanol made \nfrom farm crops and other renewable materials. It is interesting to \nnote, after a century of domination by oil, that we have now come \nperhaps full circle to recognizing there is a place for ethanol and \nrenewable fuels as part of the fuel standard in order to power the \nautomobiles that we continue to drive some 100 years later.\n  Ultimately, the power of oil interests led to policies that made oil \nking, with depletion allowances, foreign tax credits, and naval convoys \nand armies dispatched to protect oilfields around the world. Of course, \nthe direct or indirect control of oil remains an American economic, \ndiplomatic, political, and military priority.\n  While we have had, in fact, a petroleum age, it has ushered in many \ntechnological advances. The industrialized world's love affair with oil \nhas not been without costs. Dependence on imported oil threatens our \nnational and our energy security, our economy, our jobs, our farmers \nand ranchers, our industry and our environment. Public policy decisions \nand discussions have continued that began nearly a century ago, \nlaunching upon a path which led us to our current reliance on imported \noil.\n  Today we have a historic opportunity to begin the process of swinging \nback full circle, at least to some degree, in our national energy \npolicy. The energy policy today embodied in this bill offers us a \nchance to realize the potential that Henry Ford saw even then, and that \nhis successors managing Ford, GM, and Chrysler are making possible \nevery time they produce an E-85 automobile capable of running on 85-\npercent ethanol. More than 2 million of these so-called flexible fuel \nvehicles are on the road at this time.\n  Additionally, essentially all automakers in the world produce cars \nthat run well on blends of ethanol, up to 10 percent, as well as those \nthat will run up to 85 percent. We have the cars. Now we need the fuel. \nThis bill provides the means in order to get it.\n  The Energy Policy Act of 2002 will boost biofuels and biorefinery \nconcepts to realistically address oil import levels that have now \nsurpassed the 56-percent mark, with ever higher levels ahead of us if \nwe do not do something significant now to change the direction in which \nwe have been heading.\n  From the perspective of a Senator from a farm State, and a former \ntwo-time chair of the Governors' Ethanol Coalition, one of the most \nimportant aspects of this landmark energy bill is the establishment of \na 2-billion-gallon renewable fuel standard in 2004 that gradually grows \nto 5 billion gallons by 2012. Even if this approximate tripling of the \nethanol industry from today's levels represents less than 4 percent of \nthe total projected U.S. motor fuels demand over the next decade, it is \na critical beginning of national importance. Enactment of this RFS, \nalong with other provisions in this bill that emphasize new sources of \nenergy production from renewables such as wind power, as well as \nconservation to further reduce our dependence upon foreign sources of \nenergy, will help us reverse this 100-year-old reliance on fossil \nfuels. It will not replace them, but it will help us reduce the amount \nof reliance.\n\n  There is now a revolution driving American agriculture as surplus, \nlow-value starch and oils are converted into high-value liquid fuels, \nwith the proteins being fed locally so that American taxpayers save \nmoney. Rural communities are reinvigorated. High-value, high-quality \nfinished products enter the export market and the Nation's energy \nsecurity and environment are dramatically improved.\n  The Senate energy bill represents a historic step away from business \nas usual in U.S. energy policy. Just as we cannot export ourselves out \nof an agricultural crisis, we also cannot drill ourselves out of our \nenergy crisis. With the renewable fuel standards, it will no longer be \na matter of whether or not there will be a biofuels industry to augment \nour oil and auto industries. Rather, it will be how fast can we advance \nthese domestic renewable fuels? How do we enhance their environmental \nperformance, reduce their costs, and advance the technology to include \nthe conversion of all forms of clean biomass into biofuels, \nbiochemicals, and biopower?\n  I am unabashedly proud of what my home State of Nebraska has \naccomplished. The formation of the National Governors' Ethanol \nCoalition was one of the most important steps. Nebraska and several \nother Midwestern States created this coalition that now represents 26 \nStates and one U.S. territory, as well as Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and \nSweden.\n  Since its formation in 1991, the Governors' Ethanol Coalition has \nworked to expand national and international markets for biofuels. I \nmight add that this Governors' Ethanol Coalition included the current \nand the previous Presidents of the United States when they were \nGovernors of the State of Arkansas and the State of Texas. Within the \nState of Nebraska during the period of 1991 to 2001, seven ethanol\n\n[[Page S1806]]\n\nplants were constructed and several of these facilities were expanded \nmore than once during the decade. I do not want to take full credit for \nthat timeframe, but I want the record to reflect it happened during my \nwatch.\n  Specific benefits of this national ethanol program in Nebraska \ninclude more than $1.2 billion in new capital investment in ethanol \nprocessing plants, 1,005 permanent jobs at the ethanol facilities, and \nover 5,000 induced jobs directly related to plant construction, \noperation, and maintenance. The permanent jobs alone generate an annual \npayroll of $44 million. More than 210 million bushels of corn and grain \nsorghum are processed at the plants annually. Economists at Purdue \nUniversity and the USDA estimate that the price of corn increases from \n9.9 cents to 10 cents per bushel for every 100 million bushels of new \ndemand. Local price basis increases in Nebraska range from 5 cents to \n15 cents, quite a stimulus for agriculture in ethanol-producing areas.\n  These economic benefits and others have increased each year during \nthe past decade due to plant expansion, employment increases, and \nadditional capital investment.\n\n  If each State produces 10 percent of its own domestic renewable \nfuels, as Nebraska does, America will have turned the corner and that \nnoose of oil import dependency and climate change will begin to fade \naway. In the world of renewable biomass, there are no wastes, just feed \nstocks for other production systems, without the fossil-based toxins \nblocking the next biological step.\n  I ask my colleagues to take a new look at the opportunities offered \nby RFS and grasp the full potential of the biorefinery portions of this \nenergy legislation. These provisions are urgently needed to increase \nour energy and our national security, create new basic industries and \nquality jobs, reduce the vulnerability of our energy supplies, enhance \nthe environment, contribute to the stabilization of greenhouse gases, \nwhile improving America's economic performance. Everyone gains from \nthis effort.\n  This balanced and comprehensive piece of legislation is the end \nresult of the dedication of so many of my colleagues. It was not always \neasy to foresee the day when biofuels and other renewable resources \nwould be poised to be a major component of our national energy policy. \nThe farsightedness of a few has directly led to the creation and wide \nacceptance of the bill before the Senate today.\n  The oil production versus imports chart shows the domestic oil \nproduction peaked in 1970 and again in 1985 and has continued to drop. \nThe oil imports on the graph are shown to have expanded from 1950 to \nthe point where they are more than 10 million barrels per day, and the \ntrend continues. We must, in fact, support the growth of our own \nindustry in the domestic production of fuels to power our energy needs.\n  Last summer, Senator Tim Johnson and my colleague from Nebraska, \nSenator Hagel, introduced legislation that dealt with this very issue. \nTheir hand is felt throughout the bill. I congratulate them and thank \nthem for their efforts. Senator Daschle's and Senator Lugar's tireless \nefforts created a bill with broad consensus, taking shape in the form \nwe see today, the legislation before the Senate. They have taken an \nissue that could have been controversial and instead introduced a bill \nthat provides a wide-reaching blueprint for future renewable energy \ngoals. These provisions are a direct result of their leadership. I am \nhonored to be a cosponsor of this bill.\n  I personally take a moment to recognize and thank staff who have \nworked on this issue as well. They worked long hours to put the bill \ntogether. Their efforts are much appreciated. Eric Washburn from \nSenator Daschle's staff and the rest of the team are a real asset to \nSenator Daschle and have been a tremendous help to me personally \nthroughout this process.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in promoting new opportunities for the \ntechnologies that will put our fuels and our world transportation fuels \non solid, sustainable, and environmentally enhancing ground. We owe it \nto our country now and to future generations to pass this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I yield time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. That will be fine.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his \nleadership on this issue. Where we come from, ethanol is a big deal. It \nis a big deal because we have a lot of corn growers, farmers who need \nto have a better price for their corn. They need increased demand for \ntheir sales in the United States and overseas, and we know the ethanol \nindustry consumes about 1 out of every 6 acres of corn across America. \nSo as we increase the demand for ethanol in America, we increase the \ndemand for corn, raising the prices and helping our farmers to sustain \ntheir farm operations and to have less dependence on the Federal \nGovernment from year to year.\n  This is a major breakthrough. I salute all those responsible for it: \nSenator Tom Daschle, Senator Jeff Bingaman, Senator Ben Nelson of \nNebraska, as well as all those on the Republican side of the aisle. \nWhat has happened for the first time in 20 years since I have been on \nCapitol Hill is that we finally have reached this moment where we have \nan agreement, an agreement between the ethanol producers--the corn \ngrowers, obviously--and the oil industry. This is a big breakthrough \nbecause this has been a pitched battle for two decades, with the oil \ncompanies doing everything they can to suppress ethanol production.\n  In this bill, we have a consensus agreement that has been crafted by \nthe leaders who brought the bill to the floor, and with that agreement \nwe will triple the use of ethanol in the United States over the next 10 \nyears. In tripling it, it will not just help the economics of the farm \nbill, it will mean we are going to have cleaner air in America, a \nbetter environment for America in its cities and its towns, and less \ndependence on foreign oil. That, to me, is a positive at three \ndifferent levels.\n  I salute all those responsible for it: the Renewable Fuels \nAssociation, National Corn Growers, American Petroleum Industries, the \nAmerican Farm Bureau, the Farmers Union, and so many others. This \nreally makes a difference.\n  As a result of this decision, we are going to see more ethanol \nblended with gasoline. It is going to mean the exhaust coming out of \nour tailpipes across America for years to come is going to be less of a \nthreat to the families across America. When we face an epidemic of lung \nand respiratory disease such as asthma and other problems, it is \nessential we continue to move forward with the use of this clean-\nburning fuel.\n  I have been chairman of the House Alcohol Fuels Caucus and a member \nof the Senate Alcohol Fuels Caucus. I can tell you this is a great day. \nI salute all those who crafted this wonderful compromise which is going \nto really make a commitment.\n  I think Senator Nelson alluded to what will happen. Now that there is \nsome certainty this bill will be signed into law, you will have more \nand more ethanol production coming on line. And for my selfish reasons, \nfor downstate Illinois, where our economy is struggling with high \nunemployment and where we have more ethanol produced than anywhere in \nAmerica, we want to see plants springing up, not just in Illinois but \nin Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa, South and North Dakota--wherever we can \nfind the agricultural feed stock to produce ethanol. We have the \npotential of creating good-paying jobs and then to have the technology \nfrom its source near the usage point that can help our economy all \nacross the Midwest.\n\n  This is a terrific shot in the arm in terms of the economy of the \nMidwest, in terms of the environment of the Nation. I salute all those \nwho worked so hard to make this a reality.\n  The second half of my statement is not as positive or optimistic or \nhopeful, but I want to add it because I think it is essential that we \nkeep this achievement in perspective with what we are about to do this \nmorning in just 2 hours on the floor of the Senate.\n  By every vote count that I have seen, we are about to reject any \nsignificant increase in fuel efficiency in automobiles and trucks \nacross America as part of this energy bill. The special interests who \nhave come to Capitol Hill\n\n[[Page S1807]]\n\nto fight off any improvement in fuel efficiency are about to score a \nbig victory this morning. That is a sad commentary on the Senate and on \nour efforts to be honest in trying to find a way, at least, to move \ntoward energy independence and energy security for America. It is a \ntriumph for these special interests. It is a defeat for the American \npeople. It is about to happen in just 2 hours on the floor of this \nSenate.\n  The opponents of increasing fuel efficiency have no faith in the \nability of America's creative genius to come up with better technology \nand better science so we can have more fuel-efficient vehicles. The \nopponents of this fuel efficiency standard have no faith in the \nAmerican people. They stand in the Chamber and say: We wouldn't dare \ntell people they couldn't buy bigger and fatter SUVs year after year.\n  I think more of the American people understand we are at war against \nterrorism; we are a nation at risk; we are dependent on foreign oil. \nThese American families and businesses are ready to participate, roll \nup their sleeves and help America move toward energy security. To \nsuggest we would not dare ask them to consider buying a different \nvehicle 5 or 10 years from now is an affront to the unity which America \nhas shown since September 11.\n  Finally, it is a reflection on this Senate, as well as the House of \nRepresentatives, for its failure to show leadership on this critical \nissue. In 1975, this Congress took a look at the average fuel economy \nof fleets across America at 14 miles per gallon, brought together the \npolitical courage despite the opposition of the Big Three in Detroit, \nand said in 10 years we are going to double fuel efficiency in vehicles \nacross America from 14 to 27.5 miles a gallon.\n  We were told by the Big Three: it is impossible; we can't do it. We \nwill be selling vehicles people don't want to buy. They will be kiddy \ncars and go-carts--that is the only way to achieve it, and you will \ndrive businesses overseas.\n  They were wrong then, and they are wrong now. In over 10 years we \ndoubled the fuel efficiency of vehicles across America. By 1985, we \nwere at 27.5 miles per gallon. So what happened between 1985 and today? \nIn terms of increasing fuel efficiency, absolutely nothing. Nothing has \nbeen done by Congress or by the industry in the United States to \nproduce automobiles and trucks that are more fuel efficient.\n  So we come today with a proposal that over the next 12 or 13 years we \nwill increase fuel efficiency by 30 percent. It is going to be rejected \non the floor of the Senate. That, to me, is shameful. It is shameful \nthat we have reached the point where we have no faith in America's \ntechnology, no faith in the people of this country to stand behind \nenergy security, and no faith in the ability of the Senate to show \nleadership at a time when this country expects us to do so.\n  I can tell you, quite frankly, that the Senate will bow down to the \nspecial interests this morning so that America has to bow down to OPEC \nfor decades to come.\n  That is a sad commentary on the Senate and this energy bill.\n  It is naive for the American people to believe we can truly have \nenergy security and independence if we don't address the efficiency of \nthe vehicles we drive. Approximately 40 percent of the oil we are \nbringing up today from underground is being used to fill our vehicles. \nBy the year 2020, over 50 percent is going to be used for highway \ntravel and for vehicles and trucks. If you do not address fuel \nefficiency, you are not dealing honestly with the question of America's \nenergy future.\n  I can't believe we are standing here today to witness this on the \nfloor of the Senate. But by every vote count that I have seen, we are \ngoing to lose big. The special interests are going to come in and tell \nus there is no way they can design an engine for fuel efficiency. I \ndon't believe it. Frankly, I am embarrassed by the fact that most of \nthe good technology that is leading the way in fuel efficiency and \nemissions has come from overseas automakers. We are better than that. \nAmerican is better than that.\n  For the Senate to abandon any hope that we can develop this \ntechnology is a sad commentary on this view of what our potential is as \na nation. For them to turn their backs on the fact that if we don't \nhave better fuel efficiency we are going to continue to be independent \non foreign oil for decades to come is, frankly, a tragic mistake.\n  I sincerely hope that good numbers about renewable fuel standards \nwill be part of this ultimate legislation. I hope even more that before \nthe end of the morning hour we will see some courage in this Senate to \nstand up to the special interests, stand up to OPEC, and say we are \ntruly going to move towards energy security in this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, it is my pleasure at this \npoint to yield the floor to the distinguished senior Senator from the \nState of Nebraska, my colleague, Mr. Hagel. I welcome his support for \nethanol. As a colleague, as a Nebraskan, and as Member of this body, I \ncongratulate him and Senator Johnson on their support of this very \nimportant bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I ask that I be given 10 minutes of time from the \nRepublican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair.\n  I first acknowledge the statements of my friend and colleague from \nNebraska, Senator Nelson. He has been a leader on renewable fuels for \nmany years--long before he came to the Senate, when he served our State \nof Nebraska ably as its Governor for 8 years, and for his leadership \nover those years. He brings that leadership and experience to this body \nin regard to not only this issue but many others.\n  I rise in support of the renewable fuels standard included in the \nunderlying bill. This legislation is important if we are to increase \nthe market share for renewable fuels, such as biodiesel, ethanol, and \nbiogas from landfills and feedlots.\n  I, too, wish to recognize and thank other colleagues who have been \nvery important to this debate over many years, especially Senators \nGrassley, Lugar, Daschle, Bond, and in particular, as Senator Nelson \nhas stated, Senator Johnson, who has been a strong leader both during \nhis tenure in the House and here in the Senate, and, of course, again, \nmy colleague from Nebraska, Senator Nelson. \n  Also, those groups that represent many of the important interests of \nthis country that were very involved in bolting together a compromise \nfor this section of the energy bill, as Senator Durbin pointed out, \nshould be recognized and thanked for their participation and their \nsupport in helping to develop this section of the bill.\n  During a recent stop to the Midwest, President Bush proclaimed the \npromise of renewable fuels, saying,\n\n       Renewable fuels are gentle on the environment, and they are \n     made in America so they cannot be threatened by any foreign \n     power. Ethanol and biofuels are fuels of the future for this \n     country.\n\n  The President is right. Renewable fuels afford us the opportunity to \ndevelop energy, environmental and economic policies that work together. \nA renewable fuel standard would enhance our environment, strengthen \nnational security, reduce our trade deficit, and decrease our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  Today, less than 1 percent of America's transportation fuel comes \nfrom renewable sources. Under this energy bill, renewable fuel use \nwould increase to approximately 3 percent of our total transportation \nfuel supply. This would more than triple the amount of renewable fuel \nwe now use.\n  Today, America imports nearly 60 percent of the crude oil it \nconsumes--estimated to climb as high as 70 percent by 2020.\n  Senator Nelson displayed a chart which I think very clearly indicates \nthe danger this presents to our foreign policy, to our interests, and \nto our geopolitical and strategic trade interests around the world, \nwhich now are, as we know, interconnected.\n  Almost a fourth of these imports come from the Persian Gulf, where \nIraq currently sells the United States between 600,000 and 1 million \nbarrels of oil a day.\n  This renewable fuel standard is a fair and workable compromise based \non\n\n[[Page S1808]]\n\nmonths of work with the petroleum industry, the environmental \ncommunity, DOE, USDA, and EPA. This is flexible legislation--not a \ngallon-by-gallon mandate. It will not force a specific level of \ncompliance in places where compliance may be difficult.\n  To guard against possible fuel shortages, it permits the EPA \nAdministrator, in consultation with USDA and the Department of Energy, \nto adjust the renewable fuel requirement.\n  To make this legislation even more flexible, refiners, blenders, and \nimporters will have access to a credit trading program--so those who \nuse more renewable fuel can sell credits to other refiners, blenders, \nand importers who fall short on meeting their requirements. Producers \nwill not be penalized if there are insufficient supplies of renewable \nfuel. Finally, small refiners will be exempt from their requirements \nestablished by this program.\n  In the wake of September 11, America and the rest of the free world \nface dramatic new challenges. Energy independence is one of the most \nserious of these challenges.\n  Our Nation needs a broader, deeper, and more diverse energy \nportfolio--one that ensures we have clean, reliable, and affordable \ndomestic sources of energy. Expanding the market for renewable fuels is \na modest, but significant part of the solution. To enhance national \nenergy security and improve environmental quality, we need a reasonable \nrenewable fuel standard. As President Bush said, ethanol, biodiesel, \nand other biofuels are the fuels of the future for this country.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the renewable fuel standard in this \nenergy bill to make renewable fuels an important component of a new \nnational energy plan which is so vitally important to the future of \nthis country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I thank the Senator from \nNebraska for his very articulate comments supporting the efforts for \nthe renewable fuels standard and for his support for ethanol. It is a \npleasure to work with him on this issue.\n  Madam President, I thank members of my staff, as a matter of \nprivilege, for their support and their work on this important issue. I \nhave identified Eric Washburn of Senator Daschle's staff. It is my \npleasure to also thank my staff, Tom Litjen as well as Scott McCullers.\n  At this time, I yield the floor to the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota, to be followed by the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues this \nmorning in congratulating the officials and organizations that came \ntogether recently to negotiate a broad compromise agreement on the \nregulation of clean-burning fuels in the United States. This is truly \nan historic agreement that reconciles a variety of competing interests \nin order to meet several important national policy objectives.\n  The fuels provision establishes greater flexibility in the Nation's \ngasoline regulations, protects air quality and nearly triples the use \nof domestic, renewable fuels over the next 10 years. And, \nsignificantly, it enjoys the support of the ethanol industry, the oil \nindustry and environmental organizations, three segments of society \nthat have not always agreed on transportation fuels issues.\n  A number of organizations worked diligently to fashion this agreement \nand deserve a lion's share of the credit for its success. They include \nthe American Coalition for Ethanol, the Renewable Fuels Association, \nthe Governor's Ethanol Coalition, the National Farmers Union, the Farm \nBureau, the National Corn Growers Association, the American Corn \nGrowers Association, the American Petroleum Institute, the Northeast \nStates Coordinated Air Use Management Agency, the Clean Fuels \nDevelopment Coalition and the American Lung Association. It is indeed \ntestament to the spirit of compromise in the U.S. Senate that all these \ngroups representing often divergent constituencies and interests can \ncome together to create a product that benefits all.\n  While these groups came to the negotiating table with the interests \nof their members firmly in mind, they also understood that the fuels \ncomponent of any viable energy strategy must serve a variety of \nnational goals. Without their embrace of this far-sighted approach, \nthis balanced agreement would not have been possible.\n  Among the Senators that I would like to thank, first and foremost is \nSenator Dick Lugar. The seeds of this agreement were planted a few \nyears ago when Senator Lugar and I first introduced legislation to \nestablish a renewable fuels standard and provide greater flexibility in \nproducing reformulated gasoline. Senator Lugar's enthusiastic support \ngave this idea needed momentum and helped lay the groundwork for the \nagreement that was reached last week.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the involvement of the \nWhite House in crafting this agreement. Andrew Lundquist, who has a \nunique perspective gained as a former staff director of the Senate \nEnergy Committee and Director of Energy Policy for the President, has \nbeen extremely helpful throughout the negotiation process, both in \nidentifying effective policy and working with diverse parties to \nachieve it.\n  Among those whose opinions I sought early in this effort and who \nalways provide me with intelligent and helpful advice are Trevor \nGuthmiller and Bob Scott of the American Coalition for Ethanol, and \nDave Hallberg, the first president of the Renewable Fuels Association \nwho currently is developing an innovative ethanol plant and cattle \nfeedlot in Pierre, SD. Their common sense, South Dakota counsel on \nthese tough national fuels issues has never led me astray.\n\n  This agreement could not have been fashioned without the leadership \nand advocacy of Red Caveney, president of the American Petroleum \nInstitute, Bob Dineen, president of the Renewable Fuels Association, \nJason Grumet, former executive director of the Northeast States \nCoordinated Air Use Management Agency, Bruce Knight, president of the \nNational Corn Growers Association, Tom Buis, executive director of the \nNational Farmers Union, and Doug Durante, chairman of the Clean Fuels \nDevelopment Corporation. I am deeply grateful for the hard work and \nfocus of these dedicated individuals as well as for the valuable \ncontribution of Todd Sneller, administrator of the Nebraska Ethanol \nBoard, Larry Pearce, director of the Nebraska Energy Office, and Bill \nHolmberg, an original foot solider in our 20 year campaign to promote \nthe use of renewable fuels in America.\n  Senators Tim Johnson and Chuck Hagel deserve enormous credit for \nlegislation they introduced to establish a very ambitious renewable \nfuels standard, and for their tireless work in promoting this concept. \nAnd there are many others Ben Nelson, Tom Harkin, Chuck Grassley, Mark \nDayton, Paul Wellstone, Max Baucus, Dick Durbin, Kit Bond, and others--\nwho also deserve recognition for the progress we have made on this \nissue. Senator Nelson, for example, has, at my request, taken on the \nresponsibility of managing this debate on the fuels provision.\n  Chairman Jim Jeffords and Ranking Member Bob Smith also deserve \ntremendous credit for moving this legislation through the Environment \nand Public Works Committee and for bringing their expertise and steady \ndemeanor to the negotiating table. Their involvement was critical to \nthe successful brokering of this agreement.\n  This agreement makes a number of important changes in Federal law \nbased on the experience we have gained over the last 7 years of \nimplementing the reformulated gasoline program. It eliminates the \noxygen requirement from the reformulated gasoline program, a change \nthat is very important to the efforts of States like California and New \nYork, who are planning to eliminate MTBE from their gasoline supplies \nin the near future. But, in so doing, it also ensures that we preserve \nthe hard-fought air quality gains that have resulted from the \nimplementation of that requirement.\n  The agreement establishes a renewable fuels program to nearly triple \nthe use of renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel over the next 10 \nyears. It also provides special encouragement to biomass-based ethanol, \nwhich holds great promise for converting a variety of organic materials \ninto useful fuel, while substantially reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions. This will have substantial benefits for the environment and \nfor rural economies, while helping to lower\n\n[[Page S1809]]\n\nour dangerous dependence on foreign oil.\n  It bans MTBE in 4 years and authorizes funding to clean up MTBE \ncontamination and to fix leaking underground tanks. This section is \nparticularly important to States like California that are struggling to \nclean up groundwater contaminated by MTBE.\n  It allows the most polluted States to opt into the reformulated \ngasoline program, and provides all States with additional authority \nunder the Clean Air Act to address air quality concerns.\n\n  I would like to take a moment to acknowledge concerns about this \nprogram that have been expressed by my friends and colleagues from \nCalifornia, who in light of their recent experiences with electricity \nmarkets are understandably wary of new energy regulation in the fuels \nmarket. In response to their concerns, I and those participating in the \ndevelopment of this compromise have taken a number of steps to ease \nCalifornia's transition from MTBE to ethanol. Under the compromise, \nCalifornia no longer needs to meet the oxygen requirement of the \nreformulated gasoline program upon enactment; this is one year ahead of \nother States with reformulated gasoline programs. This modification was \npossible because of California's progressive State fuels program that \nensures protection of air quality in the absence of the oxygen \nrequirement.\n  To address concerns that have been raised about ethanol supplies, \nprices and logistics, the compromise requires that during 2003, before \nthe renewable fuels standard takes effect, the Department of Energy \nstudy these issues. If that study determines that there will be any \nproblems with the ethanol program in 2004, then the EPA Administrator \nis directed to reduce the level of the mandate for 2004.\n  Under the renewable fuels program, California and any other State can \napply to EPA under separate provisions of the bill to request that the \nAdministrator reduce the ethanol mandate in any year of the program, \nbased on supply or economic concerns. The Congress will expect the \nAdministrator to enforce this provision diligently.\n  Moreover, the compromise allows California in 2004 to meet its \nethanol requirement by blending ethanol only in the wintertime. This is \nvery significant, because California is expected to use 300 to 400 \nmillion gallons of ethanol in 2004 to meet its wintertime carbon \nmonoxide Clean Air Act requirements anyway, while the new renewable \nfuels program will require the use of less than 250 million gallons \nthat year. In other words, California will use more than 100 million \ngallons of ethanol in 2004 than the new mandate requires. So the \nethanol mandate that is in this bill should have no effect on \nCalifornia in 2004, and will substantially lessen California's ethanol \nrequirements compared to current law unless the State decides not to \nimplement its ban on MTBE.\n  As with all compromises, this agreement is not ideal for anyone, but \nmeasured against maintaining the status quo, this agreement will \nprovide considerable additional flexibility to California and other \nstates in producing and using clean-burning gasoline. For example, if \nthis compromise were not developed, California would need to meet the \nexisting reformulated gasoline oxygen requirement and implement the ban \non MTBE that the governor has stated will go into effect either at the \nend of 2002 or, if extended, at the end of 2003. This scenario would \nresult in the need for California to use over 800 to 900 million \ngallons of ethanol in 2004, far more than the renewable fuels \nrequirements of this compromise.\n  Finally, under the bill, refiners in California and throughout the \nNation can buy credits from refiners that use ethanol in other States \nto meet its requirement, rather than use actual gallons of ethanol. \nThis ensures that ethanol will be used where it is most efficient and \neconomical.\n  In the development of this compromise, I have had numerous \nconversations with my colleagues, Senators Feinstein and Boxer, and \nwith California Governor Gray Davis and the director of the California \nDepartment of Environmental Protection, Winston Hickox, about the \neffect of a renewable fuels standard on their state. I respect their \nknowledge of their State's energy situation and their passion and \ntenacity in defense of their State's interests. No one wants to see \nprice volatility in any regional market. The renewable fuels provision \nhas been modified in response to California's concern about possible \nfuture energy scenarios, and, I believe, effectively protects the state \nagainst unintended consequences.\n  In the finest tradition of the U.S. Senate, this agreement represents \na careful balance of often disparate and competing interests. No member \nor organization got everything they wanted. But in the end, each \nparticipant won important victories that made this agreement stronger.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate, the House \nand the White House to enact this important compromise this year.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to place a letter into the Record \nthat I received yesterday from the Governor's Ethanol Coalition. The \ncoalition has been a strong supporter of my efforts to enact a \nrenewable fuels standard from the very beginning, and it gives me great \npleasure to have worked closely with that organization for the last few \nyears in this regard.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 Governors' Ethanol Coalition,\n\n                                      Lincoln, NE, March 12, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle and Senator Lott: On behalf of the 27 \n     members of the Governors' Ethanol Coalition, we are writing \n     to express our strong support for the provisions including in \n     the Energy Policy Act of 2002 (S. 517), which will establish \n     a national renewable fuels standard.\n       The provisions set forth in the Manager's Amendment to S. \n     517 reflect an agreement negotiated over the last two years \n     by the states, agricultural interests, refiners, and the \n     environmental community that will address such important \n     issues as MTBE water contamination and the oxygenate \n     requirements in reformulated gasoline while providing a \n     significant market for renewable fuels such as ethanol and \n     biodiesel. Specifically, we support those provisions in S. \n     517 that: Create a national renewable fuels standard, \n     ensuring a growing part of our nation's fuel supply, up to 5 \n     billion gallons by 2012, is provided by domestic, renewable \n     fuels; eliminate the use of MTBE in the United States within \n     four years; eliminate the oxygenate requirements in the \n     reformulated gasoline program; and maintain the air quality \n     gains of the reformulated gasoline program.\n       By enacting these provisions, we will strengthen our \n     national security, displace imported oil from politically \n     unstable regions, stimulate ethanol and biodiesel production, \n     expand domestic energy, supplies, and continue to reduce air \n     pollution.\n       We encourage you to support these provisions and to resist \n     any amendments that would alter this landmark agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Holden,\n       Governor of Missouri, Chair.\n     John Hoeven,\n       Governor of North Dakota, Vice Chair.\n     Mike Johanns,\n       Governor of Nebraska, Past Chair.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe ethanol provision that has been included in the Energy Policy Act. \nI was pleased to join my colleagues, Senators Grassley, Daschle, Bob \nSmith, Hagel, Bond, Brownback, and Ben Nelson, in developing a policy \non ethanol that addresses the concerns of a variety of stakeholders in \nthe energy debate while providing a tangible benefit for the American \npeople. I believe the inclusion of this provision is a key element in \nour effort to construct a viable energy policy.\n  As I have often stated, we face an incredible challenge in putting \ntogether an energy policy for our Nation. In my view, the Senate's \nfinal product has to be a policy that harmonizes energy and \nenvironmental policies, acknowledging that the economy and the \nenvironment are vitally intertwined. It has to be a policy that \nbroadens our base of energy resources to create stability, guarantee \nreasonable prices, and protect America's security. It has to be a \npolicy that won't cause energy prices to skyrocket, which would \nunfairly affect the\n\n[[Page S1810]]\n\nelderly, the disabled, and low-income families. Finally, it has to be a \npolicy that won't cripple the engines of commerce that fund the \nresearch that will yield future environmental protection technologies.\n  The Senate is currently working to address these challenges, and I \nbelieve the inclusion of an ethanol provision in this bill will help \nthe environment, protect public health, promote fuel efficiency, reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil, boost the economy, and create and retain \njobs for Americans, all at the same time. As the ranking member of the \nSenate Clean Air Subcommittee, I am especially pleased that expanding \nthe use of ethanol will help reduce auto emissions, which will clean \nthe air and improve public health.\n  Becuase of the events of September 11, perhaps our greatest energy \nchallenge is to lessen our reliance on foreign sources to meet our \nenergy needs. As my colleagues know, the United States currently \nimports about 58 percent of our crude oil. For both national security \nreasons, particularly now, and as part of a comprehensive energy \npolicy, it is crucial that we become less dependent on foreign sources \nof oil and look more to domestic sources to meet our energy needs, and \nethanol is an excellent domestic source. Ethanol is a clean burning, \nhome-grown renewable fuel upon which we can rely for generations to \ncome.\n  Creating a greater market for ethanol is good for our Nation's \neconomy and, in particular, good for Ohio's economy. Ohio is one of the \nNation's leading consumers of ethanol, with 40 percent of the gasoline \nconsumed in the State having an ethanol content. Ohio has placed a \ntremendous importance on expanding the use of ethanol, so much so, we \nare actively pursuing an opportunity to get ethanol production plants \nbuilt in Ohio.\n  In addition to consumption of ethanol, Ohio is also a major producer \nof the main component of ethanol, corn. In fact, Ohio is 6th in the \nNation in terms of corn production, and an increase in the use of \nethanol across the Nation means an economic boost to thousands of farm \nfamilies across my State.\n  Finally, I am also pleased that the tax package reported out of the \nFinance Committee to accompany the energy bill includes a provision \nthat would transfer the 2.5 percent per gallon of the federal tax on \nethanol-blended fuels from the General Fund to the Highway Trust Fund. \nThis provision is similar to the Highway Trust Fund Recovery Act, a \nbill that Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus and I introduced last \nsummer.\n  As my colleagues may know, 2.5 cents of 13.1 cents-per-gallon ethanol \ntax presently goes straight to the Treasury. That is more than $400 \nmillion for transportation improvements lost per year, including $50 \nmillion to Ohio. The Finance Committee provision ensures that the money \nis used for our roads, the purpose for which it was collected in the \nfirst place, and keeps ethanol viable by restoring people's faith that \nthe taxes they pay on this clean fuel are used properly.\n  I am delighted that the Senate was able to come together and craft a \nbipartisan agreement on the treatment of ethanol. It is my hope that \nthe spirit of bipartisanship will continue throughout the energy debate \nso we can finally put in place a comprehensive national energy policy.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, our dependence on oil from the Middle East \nrepresents a grave national security threat. The events of September 11 \nhave underscored the urgency of moving forward on multiple fronts to \nimprove our energy situation in the short term and achieve energy \nindependence in the long term.\n  I have long believed that renewable energy is a vital part of the \nsolution. Renewables are essential to freeing ourselves and developing \ncountries from growing dependence on oil imports from volatile regions \nof the world. They also help address climate change. This is why I have \nlong supported increased funding for biomass, solar, and other \nrenewable energy programs.\n  Today I am proud to introduce with my colleagues a bipartisan \nagreement on provisions in the energy bill that would go far toward \ndiminishing our Nation's dependence on oil imports. The proposal \nincorporates into the energy bill the Daschle-Lugar national renewable \nfuels standard legislation that Senator Daschle and I introduced in May \nof 2000.\n  This proposal, like the legislation I introduced with Senator \nDaschle, would phase-out the use of MTBE, Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether, \nand increase the use of ethanol and biomass ethanol as the clean fuel \nadditive to gasoline. Use of biofuels would nearly triple over the next \ndecade.\n  Fuel derived from biomass offers the most promising long-term \napproach to the problems of oil dependence. Previously, ethanol could \nonly be produced efficiently from a tiny portion of plant life \nincluding corn and other feedgrains. High production costs made a broad \ntransition to ethanol fuel impractical. But recent breakthroughs in \ngenetic engineering of biocatalysts, enzymes, bacteria and yeasts, make \nit possible to break down a wide range of plants. Like the Daschle-\nLugar legislation, the proposal that we are introducing today includes \na special credit for ethanol used under the renewable fuels standard \nprogram that is produced from non-grain cellulosic materials like rice \nstraw, municipal waste, and fast-growing poplars. Such fuel is \nenvironmentally friendly and would not require significant changes to \nAmerica's automobile-based infrastructure.\n  There is a virtual consensus among scientists that when considered as \npart of a complete cycle of growth, fermentation, and combustion, \nethanol contributes no net carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The \ntransition to cellulosic ethanol would have a positive effect on air \nquality in American cities.\n  Cellulosic ethanol could be introduced directly into our current auto \ninfrastructure with only modest changes. In fact, Henry Ford originally \nthought ethanol would be the fuel of choice to power cars. Studies \nindicate that the United States has more than enough idle land to \nsupply a significant portion of its transportation fuel needs with \ncellulosic ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol compares favorably to gasoline \nin its performance as an internal combustion engine fuel with \nconsiderably higher octane levels. Reductions in processing costs of \nethanol are already occurring, and further reductions are imminent. We \nmust remember that ethanol processing remains a relatively young \nindustry. Oil processing is cheaper now because it has had the benefit \nof a century of intensive research and development.\n  Further market penetration of cellulosic ethanol as a fuel provides a \ncash crop to any region that grows grass, trees or other vegetation. \nThis offers enormous potential for rural development both in the United \nStates and abroad. Such a democratization of world energy supplies \ncould reduce armed conflict, lower the risk of global recession, and \naid in the development of emerging markets. National security \ncomplications and costs stemming from the need to safeguard Middle \nEastern oil resources will be diminished.\n  The agreement my colleagues and I reached on the renewable fuels \nstandard provision of the energy bill will form an important and \nessential component of our national energy policy, but it is only the \nbeginning. I encourage my colleagues to support this agreement and to \nwork with President Bush to achieve national energy security.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the renewable fuels \nprovision in the energy bill that we are debating. Renewable energy \nsources are an increasingly important part of our energy generation, \nand it is clear that they will only continue to increase in importance. \nThus, the debate is not over whether or not we will develop renewable \nenergy resources, but how we will do so.\n  Throughout my career in Congress, I have supported and led efforts to \nexplore the development and promotion of renewable fuels. I have done \nthis for several reasons including their value in offsetting our \nnation's dependence on foreign sources of energy, their environmental \nbenefits, and the potential economic opportunities for agricultural \nproducers and rural communities. Clearly, hydropower is our greatest \nrenewable supply. About ten percent of our nation's electricity is from \nhydropower. However, another very promising renewable energy source \nwith\n\n[[Page S1811]]\n\ngreat potential is ethanol, and this is the area where I want to \nconcentrate my discussion of renewables.\n  Ethanol has already proven its importance to the nation. Its use as \npart of the clean fuel program has dramatically reduced air pollution \nin many cities across the nation. In fact, cities around the nation \nhave found that using fuels with an ethanol blend help them to meet \nfederal clean air targets. Ethanol also helps us to take a step closer \nto energy independence. By increasing our use of ethanol, we will rely \nless on imported foreign oil and more on America's farmers.\n  Another benefit of ethanol is that, at the same time it helps the \nenvironment and makes our nation more energy independent, it also helps \nour rural communities. As a rancher in Midvale, Idaho, I believed--and \nstill do--that energy can be a value-added opportunity for agriculture \nand I have worked to advance technological opportunities for ethanol \nand other bio-fuels. Currently, ethanol uses around seven percent of \nour nation's corn crop, and ethanol production facilities are an \nimportant economic resource in many states, including my own. Without \nthis economic stimulus, many rural communities, which are already \npoorer and have higher unemployment than the rest of the Nation, would \nbe hurting even more.\n  For these reasons, I have always been a supporter of ethanol. As part \nof my efforts to promote it, there have been numerous times in the past \nwhen I supported legislation to help our nation develop its ethanol \nindustry. For example, I was proud to join a majority of Senators in \nvoting to support the 5.4 cent per gallon tax credit for ethanol, which \nensures the ethanol tax credit will be in place until at least 2007--\nsomething crucial to existing ethanol plants and to those considering \nnew production facilities. I also led an effort, in cooperation with \nthe American Soybean Association, in the 105th Congress to ensure that \nbiodiesel was considered an ``alternative fuel'' under the Energy \nPolicy Act of 1992 (EPACT). My legislation, which was passed by \nCongress and signed into law by the President, now allows fleet \noperators to purchase vehicles powered by biodiesel under the \nrequirements of EPACT.\n  However, more needs to be done. Ethanol and other renewable energy \nresources must be encouraged in order to protect our environment and \nhelp our quest for energy independence. This bill has many important \nprovisions relating to ethanol, and I want to encourage my colleagues \nto support these provisions. The increased use of ethanol that would \noccur if this bill passes will be good for the environment, good for \nour energy independence, and good for our farmers. It is much better to \nrely on the farmers of Idaho or Iowa or Kansas for our energy needs \ninstead of Saddam Hussein.\n  I look forward to working with the Bush administration, my colleagues \nin the Senate, and my constituents to develop a comprehensive energy \npolicy that includes a new and strengthened resolve to develop \ndomestically grown renewable sources of energy. The ethanol language in \nthis bill is an important step in that direction. Bio-fuels, including \nethanol, can and should be an important part of our path to energy \nindependence, and I urge my colleagues to support the renewable fuels \nprovisions in this bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, America needs a new energy policy that \nwill increase America's energy independence and reduce the dramatic \nenergy price spikes that hit Iowans right in the pocketbook. We need a \nforward looking, sustainable and environmentally friendly policy that \nwill provide for America's national security and economic security.\n  One of the keys to our energy future is a sustainable, \nenvironmentally friendly energy policy that includes the adoption of a \nnationwide renewable fuels standard. By requiring that a percentage of \nall the gasoline marketed in America contain renewable fuels we can \ngreatly improve our energy security, protect the environment, and \ncreate jobs through the farm-based products used in energy production.\n  I've worked for years in the Senate to build bipartisan consensus for \nthe creation of a national renewable fuel standard, introducing my own \nlegislation and cosponsored similar legislation by Senators Tim \nJohnson, and Chuck Hagel. This bipartisan effort paid off when we \nincluded a renewable fuels provision in the Senate energy bill \nrecognizing the benefits of the oxygen content requirement in the \nreformulated gasoline program.\n  The bipartisan renewable fuels provision will greatly increase the \nproduction of the fuels of the future, such as ethanol and biodiesel. \nBy directing refiners and importers to increase the use of renewable \nfuels to 2.3 billion gallons in 2004 and 5 billion gallons in 2012 we \ncan significantly increase the nationwide demand for ethanol, which was \napproximately 1.8 billion gallons in 2001.\n  This bipartisan proposal also says that the government should lead by \nexample and use alternative fuels in 50 percent of all Federal \nGovernment vehicles by 2003 and 75 percent by 2005. This is a common \nsense approach which has been proven to work in Midwestern States, like \nIowa, where 100 percent of all gasoline used in State vehicles contain \nclean-burning, renewable ethanol.\n  Renewable fuels already help improve our environment, provide energy \nsecurity, and increase farm incomes and create jobs in rural America. \nAuthoritative estimates indicate that a renewable fuels standard would \nincrease demand for corn for ethanol from 650 million bushels to 2.5 \nbillion bushels in 2016 which would increase the price of corn by an \naverage of 28 cents per bushel and create 300,000 jobs nationwide.\n  America's energy past has been one of fossil fuels, air pollution, \nand dependence on foreign oil. Our new energy policy should not repeat \nthe mistakes of the past. It must be forward looking, it must invest in \na sustainable and independent energy future and not subsidize the \nfailed policies of the past. America's energy future can start today \nwith a greater investment in renewable energy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nNebraska for his leadership on this issue. We are talking about the \nenergy bill today in the Senate Chamber. We have been on this bill for \nsome while, and we hope very much we will conclude it soon. But one \npiece of the energy bill deals with what is called the renewable fuel \nstandards. For those who are not accustomed to what the titles mean, it \nsimply means alternative fuels, such as ethanol.\n  Ethanol is an awfully good example--there are others--of what would \nhelp us reduce our reliance on foreign sources of energy.\n  I have been to ethanol plants around the country, and a couple of \nthem in North Dakota. It makes good sense, from a kernel of corn or a \nkernel of barley, to be able to take the drop of alcohol from that \nkernel of corn to extend America's energy supply, and, at the same \ntime, have the protein feed stock left to feed the cattle. So you have \na circumstance where you grow your fuel.\n  Frankly, I did not know much about this a couple of decades ago. I \nsaw an ad in one of the big daily newspapers, and it was by one of the \nlargest oil companies in the country. It said: We oppose ethanol \nproduction because it really isn't very viable and doesn't contribute \nmuch.\n  I thought: Well, if the biggest oil companies are opposing this, I \nought to take a look at it. And I did. I discovered, sure enough, using \nthe approach to take alcohol from grain, for example, to extend \nAmerica's energy supply, holds great promise for our country.\n  Since that time we have, of course, seen additional plants be \ndeveloped in this country as well as more production of renewable \nfuels. But, it seems to me, everyone here understands that we have an \nenormous amount of our energy coming from a part of the world that is \ninherently unstable: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, part of the Middle East, and \nCentral Asia. We have all of this oil and natural gas coming from parts \nof the world that are unstable. And our economy depends on that \nconstant source of supply.\n  That is an enormous risk to our economy in this country. What do we \ndo about that? We do a lot of things, one of which is to create a \nrenewable fuel standard by which we aspire, as a country, to get more \nof our energy supply in renewable fuels. We can do that. We can have \nthat kind of future if we set goals and reach those goals.\n\n[[Page S1812]]\n\n  Today, ethanol reduces the demand for gasoline and for MTBE imports \nby 98,000 barrels a day. That makes great sense, as I said, to take the \nalcohol from a kernel of corn and extend America's energy supply.\n  The American Petroleum Institute now supports this. The National Corn \nGrowers, the Renewable Fuels Association, the National Farmers Union, \nand the Farm Bureau all have sent letters to Senator Daschle and \nSenator Lott expressing their support for this version.\n  Madam President, 1.8 billion gallons of pure ethanol are currently \nproduced in our country. This provision that we are debating would add \n3.2 billion new gallons of ethanol, for a total of 5 billion gallons by \nthe year 2012. That translates, for example, into a new market for \nAmerican corn of 1.19 billion bushels of corn.\n  That helps family farmers, obviously, to be able to produce a crop, \nand use that crop, on a renewable basis, to extend America's energy \nsupply. It means new opportunities for farmers to invest in value-added \nprocessing of a product they are already growing.\n\n  I might, while I am here, also say there are some other interesting \nand exciting things happening in my home State of North Dakota.\n  The Aerospace Program and the Environment and Energy Research Center, \nboth at the University of North Dakota located in Grand Forks, are \nresearching potential uses of ethanol as aviation fuel.\n  Aviation fuel is the last fuel in the United States that still \ncontains lead. Ethanol, in our judgment, could be used for aviation \nfuel, and so the University of North Dakota is teaming with South \nDakota State University and the FAA on a program to get ethanol \napproved and certified to help replace lead-based aviation fuel. The \nUniversity of North Dakota, in fact, is hosting a conference on this \nsubject in the month of May. And they are going to bring together \naviation fuel distributors, pilots, plane manufacturers, and others, to \ndetermine the future role that ethanol can play in the aviation \nindustry as an aviation fuel.\n  We are talking, in this energy bill, about a lot of things. As I have \nindicated before, we are talking about electricity. We are talking \nabout a renewable portfolio standard in that area. We are talking about \nlimitless and renewable fuels in this area, the renewable fuels \nstandard.\n  There are a lot of people who deserve credit for bringing us to this \nposition, because it has been a lot of hard work. We have had a lot of \nopposition over the years for ethanol production. But I think, finally, \nwe have broken through, and this represents a kind of a new beachhead \nfor opportunities in our country to understand what ethanol and what \nrenewable fuels can do to extend America's energy supply.\n  I indicated yesterday the I have been recently, in the last couple of \nmonths, to Central Asia. Those of us who have traveled in the Middle \nEast and Central Asia understand that we cannot continue to hook \nAmerica's economy to a constant fuel supply that comes from parts of \nthe world that are so inherently unstable.\n  We need to do better than that. We need to produce more of our own \nenergy. Part of that is, yes, digging and drilling for natural gas, \noil, coal, and doing that in an environmentally sensitive way, and the \nunderlying bill does that. But a significant part of it is also in the \narea of limitless and renewable sources of energy. That is exactly what \nwe are talking about today. That is what the Senator from Nebraska \nbegan talking about this morning.\n  I am really pleased to be in this Chamber to support this. I want to \nsee a series of ethanol plants dotting the prairies in the Northern \nGreat Plains in this country which can take kernels of corn, barley, \nand other grains, put them in an ethanol plant, extract the drop of \nalcohol, extend America's energy supply and still have protein feed \nstock left for animals. That makes good sense for family farmers and \ngood sense for America. It is not just national security; it is also \nenergy security, which translates into national security. And that has \nits roots in this renewable fuels standard.\n  So I thank my colleague from Nebraska. I am pleased to be with him \nand so many others in this Senate Chamber who have worked hard on this \nfor a long period of time.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I yield myself 15 minutes from this \nside's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2997\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I want to talk today about one aspect of \nthis debate about CAFE standards. To me, this aspect is the most \nimportant consideration.\n  I know we have talked about many different things. We have argued \nthis issue, and we have talked about many statistics which have been \ngiven.\n  I believe it would be a mistake to approve the underlying bill \nwithout the Bond-Levin amendment. I support the Bond-Levin amendment \nbecause I believe the underlying bill, quite bluntly, will cost \nthousands and thousands of lives. So for this Senator, while the other \nissues are important, the most important is this: Are we going to say, \nas a Congress, as a Senate, as the Government, that we are going to \nforce people into smaller cars, when we know, by every piece of \nevidence that we can find, that smaller cars lead to higher fatalities? \nTo me, that is the question. I think it would be a tragic mistake for \nus to do this.\n  I know people have come to this Chamber--and I have listened to a lot \nof the debate--and have said that is just not true, it is not going to \ncost lives. They have argued about how many lives it will be. They have \nargued about whether the statistics that have been cited are accurate. \nBut every scientific study that I have seen that really has much \nvalidity shows that some lives will be lost. In addition to that, I \nthink good common sense tells us that as well.\n  In 1989, a study by Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institution and \nJohn Graham of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis provided the first \nevidence suggesting a negative relationship between weight and vehicle \noccupant fatality risk.\n  Another study from Dr. Leonard Evans, president of the International \nTraffic Medicine Association, found that large, heavy cars lower the \nrisk to drivers. His study suggested that more passengers, i.e., more \nweight within the vehicle, reduced fatalities by 7.5 percent.\n  The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, NHTSA, and \nthe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that since 1975, \n46,000 people have died because of the 1970s-era push for greater fuel \nefficiency that has led to smaller cars.\n  For every mile per gallon gained by the standards increased, 7,000 \npeople have died according to the USA Today. According to the National \nAcademy of Sciences and supported by the National Safety Council and \nthe American Trauma Society, CAFE standards have led to 1,300 to 2,600 \nadditional crash fatalities and 97,000 to 195,000 total injuries. The \nNAS report says:\n\n       [I]t is clear that there were more injuries and fatalities \n     than otherwise would have occurred had the fleet in recent \n     years been as large and heavy as the fleet of the mid-1970s.\n\n  According to the July 2001 issue of the American Journal of Public \nHealth, the rates at which drivers crash are strongly influenced, of \ncourse, by drunk driver behavior. But the relative risk to each driver \nwhen a crash does occur is not affected in any obvious way by driving \nbehavior. The relative risk is enormously influenced by relative masses \nof the involved cars. That is pretty simple. In other words, if two \ncars crash into each other, and one of them is twice as heavy as the \nother, then the driver of the lighter car is about 12 times as likely \nto be killed.\n  Again, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, \nbetween 1991 and 1997, 41 percent of all car deaths occurred in single-\nvehicle accidents. So we need to ask ourselves this: If you or a member \nof your family are going to be in one of these single-vehicle \naccidents, in what kind of a car should you be sitting? Obviously, the \nheavier the car, the safer you are.\n  In the year 2000, the motor vehicle death rate per 100,000 people was \nespecially high among 16 to 24-year-olds--that is what we continue to \nsee--and people 80 years and older. These are the portions of the \npopulation most likely, candidly, to buy a car based on financial \nsituations since lighter cars are\n\n[[Page S1813]]\n\ncheaper to purchase and fuel. Now, in all fairness, there are other \nreasons why 16 to 24-year-olds are involved in more fatal accidents, \nbut this is certainly one of them.\n  Finally, according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, based on \nJ. DeFalco's findings in the ``Deadly Effects of Fuel Economy \nStandards, CAFE's Lethal Impact on Auto Safety,'' in my own State of \nOhio, it is estimated, based on the data, that in the year 2000, 768 \npassenger car occupants died because of these CAFE standards.\n  I believe the statistics are clear. Simply put, we cannot increase \nCAFE standards without increasing fatalities. Yes, there are actions \nyou can take to improve safety, such as airbags and other safety \ndevices, and we are certainly moving in that direction, albeit more \nslowly than this Member would like. Yes, you can argue that the safety \neffect of downsizing and downweighting as a result of CAFE standards \nhas been negligible because the injury and fatality experience per \nvehicle mile of travel has, in fact, steadily declined during the \nchanges in the fleet. That is true.\n  However, a 1992 National Research Council report suggested that \nreduced risk of motor vehicle travel is part of a long-term historical \ntrend tracing way back to 1930, and the improving safety picture is the \nresult of various interacting and sometimes conflicting trends.\n  So while things such as enhanced vehicle designs, increased rates of \nsafety belt use, better roads, and decreased drunk driving are, in \nfact, reducing crash injury risk, there are other variables, such as \nhigher speed limits or no speed limits on some roads, increased \nhorsepower, and an increased number of teenagers and other risky \ndrivers on the road that are increasing crash injury risk. In short, \ntechnological innovations don't get you out of a CAFE safety bind.\n\n  In the words of Dr. Leonard Evans, to argue this is\n\n       [L]ike a tobacco industry executive saying that smoking \n     doesn't endanger your health because with everything we know \n     about diets and exercise, you can smoke and still be as \n     healthy as a non-smoker. It is true that with current \n     knowledge about keeping fit, smokers can be healthier. But, \n     this knowledge can make a non-smoker even healthier yet. If \n     you smoke, you're going to be taking a risk no matter what.\n\n  Similarly, if you get in a car, you are taking a risk no matter what. \nThat is just reality. We accept that there will be a certain number of \naccidents and injuries and deaths. We know that. We may not accept it, \nbut we understand it. But the question really is about the weight and \nsize of cars. You can argue about how many lives are lost or saved, \nwhat the exact figure is, what the exact number is. You can argue about \nhow many variables impact safety and which variables have the most \nimpact.\n  You can argue about how much the environment will be affected by this \nbill. You can argue about oil dependency. But in the end, one of the \nmain variables that we know will make a difference in determining how \nmany Americans die next year driving automobiles or as passengers in \nautomobiles is the weight of the car. That is a variable we know will \nmake a difference.\n  For me, that is what it comes down to. As millions of Americans, I do \nread Consumer Reports. Year after year, I take a look at the annual \nreport that lists the cars and rates them for many reasons. It rates \nthem for safety. One of the special reports every year is a safety \nreport. You can look down and see how they rate each size car. They \nalways break them down into the larger cars, the heavier cars, all the \nway down to the light cars.\n  What you will see is that, yes, some of the midsize cars do very \nwell. Some of the smaller cars do better than you might expect. But \nwhat you clearly can see is that by and large, if you are interested in \nsafety, you buy a bigger, heavier car.\n  I am not suggesting that every American should do that or can afford \nto do that. I am suggesting that is something that every American \nshould have the option to do. Every American should have the option \nwithin their means to as best they can protect their family from \nhighway fatalities. They should be able to intelligently choose their \ncar. They should make the choice of the car, what safety features the \ncars have, and they should be able to make the choice in regard to the \nweight of that car.\n  I believe the underlying bill strikes at that freedom, at that \nliberty, and at the ability of parents to protect their children in the \ncar, the ability of someone buying a car to protect themselves or their \nloved ones. It is a tragic mistake.\n  I will be supporting the Levin-Bond amendment. It is a rational \ncompromise. It is an approach that makes sense. It is not \nmicromanagement from the Congress but is allowing the science and \ntechnology to take place and to be utilized. I hope if that amendment \ndoes pass, when the decisions are made in regard to setting of the \nstandards, highway safety will not just be one of the items \nconsidered, that highway safety will be at the top of the list.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, we yield time to the \ndistinguished Senator from the State of Missouri, who will speak. We \nare alternating, but if there is no one on the other side to speak, \nthen Senator Johnson will be next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Madam President, the Senate is engaged in an important \ndebate on our Nation's energy policy. America needs an energy policy \nthat reduces our dependency on imported oil, one that increases our \nenergy efficiency, promotes the use of renewable fuels, and encourages \nadditional domestic production of fossil fuels.\n  We need an energy policy for the 21st century--not a pipeline to the \npast. The bill the Senate is now considering is a good foundation for \nthis debate.\n  This legislation promises to increase our domestic natural gas supply \ndramatically. It improves energy efficiency standards. It requires that \nthe Federal Government lead in using our natural resources more \nefficiently. To me, the most exciting aspect of this bill is that it \nencourages production and use of renewable fuels. One of the most \npromising of these is ethanol. By blending ethanol with gasoline, we \ncan reduce our oil imports and we can reduce the environmental damage \nof vehicle emissions.\n  This legislation lays out a plan for increasing the amount of ethanol \nAmericans use, and I strongly support these provisions. As America \nstruggles to meet its growing energy needs, ethanol provides \nextraordinary opportunities. This product is made from corn and, unlike \nfossil fuels, can be produced in abundance. The more ethanol we use to \nfuel our cars and trucks, the less oil we will need to import from \nhostile countries such as Iraq. Rather than looking to the Mideast for \nenergy, we would be far better off to look to the Midwest. With the use \nof a corn-based product such as ethanol, we can create an enormous \nmarket for home-grown agricultural products. At the same time, we can \nreduce the emission of harmful greenhouse gases. In short, ethanol use \nis good for the economy, good for the environment, and good for our \nnational security interests.\n\n  Ethanol is a relatively new fuel, and we are still building the \ninfrastructure and capacity for wider use of this product. Last year, I \nintroduced legislation to promote the production and the use of \nethanol-blended fuels and other value-added agricultural products.\n  My legislation proposed to expand eligibility for the tax credit \navailable for small producers of ethanol. I am very pleased that these \naspects of my bill have been included in the amendment crafted by the \nSenate Finance Committee. These changes will ensure that farmer-owned \ncooperatives are eligible to receive the tax credit. They will also \nencourage small producers to expand the size of their operations to \nmeet increased demands.\n  Under this legislation, facilities that produce as much as 60 million \ngallons a year could still qualify as small producers. These changes \nare necessary if America is to meet the demand for ethanol envisioned \nby this bill.\n  Last year, America produced less than 2 billion gallons of ethanol. \nUnder this legislation, annual ethanol use would increase to 5 billion \ngallons over the next 10 years.\n  Ethanol is truly a win-win solution to our energy needs. The \nincreased use required by this legislation represents\n\n[[Page S1814]]\n\na positive step for our farmers, for our environment, and for energy \nindependence.\n  I support the compromise of this bill that will lead to the increased \nuse of ethanol, and I urge my colleagues to support it as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I am pleased to rise today to speak \nabout the inclusion of a renewable fuels standard in the pending energy \nbill. In the midst of the ongoing debate about this legislation, it is \nheartening to see us come together on an issue that has the potential \nto enormously improve our Nation's transportation fuel supply.\n  This is a landmark provision that will improve our energy security \nand provide a direct benefit for the agricultural economy in my State \nand in other rural States across our country. Senator Daschle should be \ncommended for his hard work in bringing the parties and the industries \ntogether to reach a bipartisan consensus that will help our Nation in \nthe next decade and in the decades to come. Senator Jeff Bingaman, \nchairman of the Energy Committee, also deserves commendation for \nworking with us to include this package in a comprehensive energy bill.\n  As we all know, there has been a great deal of discussion this past \nyear about our Nation's energy. The increasing volatility in gasoline \nand diesel prices and the growing tension in the world from terrorist \nattacks have affected all of us. There is a clear need for energy \npolicies that will address issues of the environment, issues of \nimproving our trade balance, clean air, energy security, our farm \neconomy, and more jobs in America. This provision addresses all of \nthose issues.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced legislation with my friend and \ncolleague from Nebraska, Senator Chuck Hagel. Our legislation, the \nRenewable Fuels for Energy Security Act of 2001, S. 1006, was designed \nto ensure future growth for ethanol and soybean-based biodiesel fuels \nthrough the creation of a new renewable fuels content standard in all \nmotor fuel produced and used in the United States. I am also a \ncosponsor of another renewable fuels bill that was introduced by \nSenator Daschle and Senator Lugar. I am pleased that an effort has been \nmade here to incorporate these bills in a comprehensive energy \nlegislation bill and that we have the package we are considering today.\n  Meanwhile, the House of Representatives passed an energy bill that \ncontains no renewable fuels standard of any kind. It is the Senate \nlegislation that is the groundbreaking bill which will determine \nwhether our Nation will, in fact, go forward with a thoughtful \nrenewable fuels standard for our Nation. So it is with some pride and \nsatisfaction that, in a bipartisan fashion, the Senate has come \ntogether on this issue. It is clear that Senators--particularly from \nrural States but others as well--understand the importance of including \na new standard in our energy legislation.\n  Today, ethanol and biodiesel comprise less than 1 percent of all \ntransportation fuel in the United States, and 1.8 billion gallons is \ncurrently produced in our country. The consensus package we have today \nwould require that 5 billion gallons of transportation fuel be \ncomprised of renewable fuel by the year 2012. Ambitious but doable. \nThat is nearly a tripling of the current ethanol production for the \ncoming decade as we incorporate this new standard.\n  I don't need to convince anybody in my State of South Dakota or other \nrural areas of the benefits of ethanol to the environment and the \neconomies of rural communities. We have several plants in South Dakota \nand more are being planned. These farmer-owned ethanol plants in South \nDakota, and in neighbor States, demonstrate the hard work, commitment, \nand vision we see in rural areas and the commitment to a growing market \nfor clean domestic fuels.\n  Based on current projections, construction of any new plants will \ngenerate roughly $900 million in capital investment and tens of \nthousands of construction jobs in rural communities. For corn farmers, \nthe price of corn is expected to rise as much as 20 to 30 cents a \nbushel. Farmers will have the opportunity to invest in these ethanol \nplants to capture a greater piece of the ``value chain.'' Combining \nthis with the provisions in this bill and the potential economic impact \nfor South Dakota is tremendous.\n  An important but underemphasized fuel is biodiesel, which is chiefly \nproduced from excess soybean oil. We all know soybean prices are \nhovering near historic lows. Biodiesel production is small but has been \ngrowing steadily. The renewable fuels standard would greatly increase \nthe prospects for biodiesel production and greatly benefit soybean \nproducers all across our land.\n  It is important that Congress take a serious look at these issues \nbeyond just the economic impact to our region. Bio-based fuels offer \nmultiple benefits--from addressing climate change to improving our \ntrade balance.\n  By increasing fuels production in rural areas of our Nation, we can \nalso reduce the need for new refineries and new pipelines.\n  The renewable fuel standard over the next decade will displace \nroughly 1.6 billion barrels of oil without any additional drilling and \ncould increase ethanol renewable fuels being more widely used. In \naddition, it takes 1 gallon of ethanol to the same amount of fuel that \nproduces 2 gallons of oil.\n  A substantive bill that improves the Nation's energy security can \nonly be enacted if we work in a bipartisan manner. Problems and \ndifficulties our Nation faces are simply too important to be bogged \ndown in partisan rhetoric. The consensus emerging on this issue \ndemonstrates the benefits of working together to find real solutions \nfor our Nation and should serve as a model for the consideration of the \nrest of the legislation we take up this year.\n  Again, I thank Senator Hagel, Senator Daschle, and Senator Bingaman \nfor their extraordinary efforts and for working with me as we have \ndeveloped this amendment and included it in this important legislation.\n  We know we are not to the goal line yet relative to the renewable \nfuel standard. This energy legislation remains controversial as a \nwhole, with issues ranging from drilling in ANWR to CAFE standards, all \ncreating hurdles to its final passage. But I am pleased to see the kind \nof bipartisan consensus that reaches across industries on the renewable \nfuel standard.\n  It is my hope when the dust settles at the conclusion of this debate \nthat we will have a comprehensive energy bill that will include this \nprovision. Whatever else happens, this Congress cannot adjourn at the \nend of the year without having addressed the need for a renewable fuel \nstandard in this or some other comprehensive legislation.\n  I thank the Chair. I urge my colleagues to be supportive of the \nrenewable fuel standard, and I look forward to final passage of this \nlegislation. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I thank my colleague from \nSouth Dakota, who has worked so long and hard on this issue and has \ncosponsored the Hagel-Johnson/Johnson-Hagel legislation that helped \nlead the way to this particular part of the energy bill. I thank him \nfor his constant support and vigilance on the issue.\n  It is clear that this issue has achieved a wide bipartisan result \nwith strong support from both sides of the aisle. It is also very \napparent that some of the challenges the ethanol or biofuels industry \nfaced in the past have lessened as a result of the hard work of so \nmany.\n  There was a time when there was an absolute conflict between oil and \nethanol producers and between the interests that supported each of \nthose industries. This past week, an agreement was announced that \nbrought together the environmental industry as well as the petroleum \nindustry. I thank the API for their support. It is a clear recognition \nthat this is a way to work together to support an energy policy that \nwill benefit all Americans and benefit our world as well.\n  It is important to point out that while we continue to stress the \nimportance of more domestic production and reduce the reliance on \nforeign sources of oil, there is a role that the industry domestically \nand the renewable fuels industry today can play together, a role that \nfinds room for both domestically produced oil as well as foreign-\n\n[[Page S1815]]\n\nproduced oil and domestically produced energy in the area of renewable \nfuels.\n  It is pleasant to recognize we have crossed that line and have been \nable to bring together parties from different industries to recognize \nthe common goal of the ability to rely on our own needs to the extent \nwe can with our own production. That is clear in moving from 1 percent \nof the oil and fuel needs of our country and the supply to up to 4 \npercent in just 10 years. That is not only a move in the right \ndirection, it is a move away from some of the reliance we have had in \nother areas of the world where stability is not strong for our future \nbut certainly puts us in peril for the future needs of our energy.\n  It is also very important to point out that this industry, with the \nrenewable fuel standard that will be created and with the ethanol and \nother biofuels processing plants that will be springing up all over \nAmerica, can extend to the rural areas.\n  I know the distinguished Presiding Officer is concerned about, in her \nown State, the erosion of the rural areas in population and the \ndecreasing opportunities that exist in some of the rural areas. This \nindustry can extend across America because of the reliance on biomass--\nand it is not simply limited to the corn-producing States or other \nStates more closely associated with farm products--and not only be a \nstrong industry far beyond a cottage industry, but it can certainly \nextend to many of the other States that are not always considered part \nof the agricultural producing industry in America today, but we know \nthey are. Therefore, this is, as the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri said, a win-win situation for all of us.\n  I am also pleased there is a cutting-edge technology that continues \nto be a part of this biofuels effort. Many States are today advancing \nthe new technology, which the distinguished Senator from North Dakota \nmentioned, of aviation fuel that can be extended to biorefinery \nproducts.\n  The High Plains facility in my State of Nebraska at York is \nprocessing the plant's waste stream in an anaerobic digester for the \nproduction of biogas that can be used to dry the distiller's grains and \noperate the plant, so that the plant has the opportunity ultimately to \nbe self-sustaining in terms of its own energy needs as it produces \nenergy for the rest of the country.\n\n  The Dow-Cargill facility in Blair, NE, is currently producing ethanol \nbut in short order will be producing biodegradable plastics for use in \nthe food industry in that same facility. They produce energy, but they \nwill be producing an environmentally friendly plastic that will be \nbiodegradable rather than what we are currently using.\n  Later in this session, I hope to offer an amendment calling for a \nManhattan-type project to aggressively advance the biorefinery \nconcept--the production of biofuels, bioenergy, and biochemicals in \nintegrated facilities. A major resource commitment, utilizing the \nunique capabilities of the Department of Defense to take a concept from \ninception to fruition, is needed in this country to ensure that 10 \nyears from now we have established the commercial technology base to \nproduce many billions of gallons of renewable fuels in dispersed and \ndecentralized installations around our country.\n  There is the opportunity for increased technology, for increased \nproduction of biofuels that will assist us in the growth that is being \nsponsored by this legislation with the expectation that perhaps it is \nonly the beginning--that, in fact, we can exceed the requirements that \nwill be provided in this bill in years to come.\n  I am proud the production and the testing of these products is \nunderway today and will expand into the future and be a nationwide \nemphasis, whereas today clearly the emphasis has been more limited and \nmore discussed in terms of the rural areas of the Midwest. This is \nabout more than the Midwest. It is about, in fact, a national energy \npolicy that will end up with national energy needs, in meeting those \nneeds from so many different parts of our world and our Nation.\n  The energy needs are clear, and that is why this energy bill is \nimportant. But not only are the needs important, but the sources of \nproduction to fill those needs likewise are important. That is why this \nparticular provision is extremely important to deal not only with the \nenergy needs, but to deal with a cleaner environment, for economic \ndevelopment, and obviously for national security by relying on our own \nsources for more of our own energy production.\n  Shortly, Senator Lincoln from Arkansas will be joining us. I might \nmention, as I did before, as part of the Governors' Ethanol Coalition \nthat was established in 1991, we had a distinguished Governor from the \nState of Arkansas in that initial group who kept his commitment to \nsupporting ethanol not only in his role as Governor but as the \nPresident of the United States. It is also important to point out that \nas we have continued to expand the role of the current President, while \nthe Governor of Texas he participated in that Governors' Ethanol \nCoalition, making it a broad-based group of 26 States and several \ncountries working together to continue to support ethanol and the \ndevelopment of biofuels to deal with our energy needs.\n  Until the distinguished Senator from Arkansas arrives, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, as we are waiting for \nSenator Lincoln, perhaps it is important to point out some of the \ntruths about the renewable fuel standard and debunk some of the myths \nthat sometimes have continued for a period of time as a method of \ntrying to avoid dealing with the need for more domestic production and \nas a means of deterring our efforts for this renewable fuel standard.\n  There is a myth that somehow there are inadequate supplies of ethanol \nto meet the demand that will be created by this renewable fuel \nstandard. The fact is, the ethanol industry has been growing \nsubstantially in recent years. If I could get the chart that shows the \ngrowth within the industry, it has been growing in recent years in \nanticipation of the phaseout of MTBE, particularly in the State of \nCalifornia. We can see the historic fuel ethanol production over the \ncourse of the last 20 years. It continues to increase.\n  According to the Renewable Fuels Association, 15 new plants have \nopened and several expansions have been completed, increasing U.S. \nethanol production capacity to 2.3 billion gallons. Thirteen plants are \ncurrently under construction and will bring the total capacity to 2.7 \nbillion gallons by the end of 2002. A survey conducted by the \nCalifornia Energy Commission concludes that the ethanol industry will \nhave the capacity to produce 3.5 billion gallons a year by the end of \n2004. So achieving the 5 billion gallon requirement over a 10-year \nperiod is clearly within reach, and we are clearly on our way to \nachieving that.\n  There is also a myth that MTBE will result in a shortage of gasoline-\nblending components; that if we remove MTBE it will result in a \nshortage of gasoline-blending components that will therefore reduce \nU.S. fuel supplies. The fact is, while acknowledging there will be \nenough ethanol, some have suggested there will be a shortage of \ngasoline-blending components needed to replace MTBE.\n  MTBE is currently blended at 11-percent volume, largely in Federal \nreformulated gasoline in the Nation's nine severe ozone nonattainment \nareas so we can satisfy the oxygenate requirements.\n  Ethanol is used exclusively today in RFG in Chicago and Milwaukee, \nwhere it is blended at 10-percent volume. Ethanol used in RFG to \nreplace MTBE will similarly be blended at the 10-percent level, \nmitigating any loss in supply from MTBE's removal. A large share of the \nethanol-blended formula will satisfy the renewable fuel standard. It \nwill be blended in conventional gasoline where it simply is blended \nwith finished gasoline, adding an additional 10-percent volume to the \nU.S. fuel market. In other words, it will, in fact, expand the \navailability of fuel rather than reduce it.\n\n  There is another myth: that the RFS will result in significant price \nincreases for consumers at the pump. The\n\n[[Page S1816]]\n\nfact is, S. 517 does not require a single gallon of renewable fuels be \nused in any particular State or region. The additional flexibility \nprovided by the RFS credit-trading provisions of S. 517 will result in \nmuch lower costs to refiners and therefore to consumers. The credit-\ntrading system will ensure that ethanol is used where it is most cost \neffective.\n  According to ChevronTexaco, the free market will not allow a \nCalifornia price differential of 20 to 30 cents per gallon to be \nsustained. The market will always find ways to take advantage of a much \nsmaller differential. Furthermore, a nationwide Federal MTBE ban \nprovides certainty for investments and eliminates the greater use of \nboutique fuels, thereby lowering gasoline prices.\n  One of the constant challenges we have today is the use of boutique \nfuels, the blending of certain grades and certain kinds of fuels, which \nactually has the impact that while reducing efficiency it raises the \ncost of gasoline prices. This will have the effect of moderating that, \nand it will, in fact, reduce the number of boutique-blended fuels and \ntherefore reduce the cost of production of these fuels.\n  Increasing the use of renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel \nwill diversify our energy infrastructure, making it less vulnerable to \nacts of terrorism and increases the number of available fuel options, \nincreasing competition, and reducing consumer costs of gasoline.\n  There is a myth that more time is needed for the MTBE phaseout to \nensure adequate fuel supplies. The fact is, the negotiated agreement \nset forth in S. 517 announced last week provides for a 4-year phaseout \nof MTBE, giving the petroleum and the transportation industries \nadequate lead time to make necessary changes to accommodate the \nincreased use of renewable fuels. In fact, the American Petroleum \nInstitute, the lead trade association for the refining industry, agrees \nthat 4 years is an adequate phaseout period, and cost estimates for \nremoving MTBE must also consider the cost incurred in additional MTBE \nwater contamination if MTBE is not removed from the fuel supply.\n  A recent poll conducted by the California Renewable Fuels Partnership \nconcluded that 76 percent of likely voters supported banning MTBE \nbecause we cannot afford the pollution caused by MTBE, while only 13 \npercent think it is a bad idea because of potential higher gasoline \nprices.\n  The myth is it will raise gasoline prices when it is not expected to \nraise those prices. But 13 percent is a bad idea because of potential \nhigher gasoline prices. If they are aware of the fact that it will not \nraise gasoline prices, perhaps the 76 percent favoring the phaseout, \nbanning it, will increase substantially.\n  There is another myth important to debunk; that is, ethanol cannot be \ntransported from production centers in the Midwest, where it is \ncurrently produced, to coastal markets without incurring substantial \ninvestments and therefore large costs to the consumer. Furthermore, \nethanol must be blended at the terminal and cannot be shipped by \npipeline, constraining the distribution network. The fact is, today \nethanol is transported cost effectively from coast to coast by barge, \nrailcar, and oceangoing vessel.\n  An analysis completed in January for the U.S. Department of Energy \nassessed the infrastructure requirements including transportation, \ndistribution, and marketing issues for an expanding ethanol industry. \nThe report concludes that no major infrastructure barriers exist to \nexpanding the U.S. ethanol industry to 5.1 billion gallons per year, \ncomparable to the renewable fuel standard established in S. 517. \nTherefore, the study concludes the logistics modification necessary \nunder the scenario can be achieved cost effectively.\n  Myths are important to debunk because they will, if not countered, \nvery often stand in the way of the progress of this important part of \nour energy efforts.\n  One final myth: Air quality will actually suffer as ethanol use \nincreases nationwide. The fact is, the use of ethanol significantly \nreduces tailpipe emissions of carbon monoxide, an ozone precursor, VOCs \nand fine particulates that pose a health threat to children, seniors, \nand those with respiratory ailments. Importantly, renewable fuels help \nto reduce greenhouse gases emitted from vehicles, including carbon \ndioxide, methane, and other gases that contribute to global warming.\n  S. 517 protects against any backsliding on air quality. First, the \nagreement tightens the toxic requirements of reformulated gasoline by \nmoving the baseline refiners must meet by 1999 to 2000.\n  The Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management concluded \nthat they are satisfied to have reached an agreement that substantially \nbroadens the ability of the U.S. EPA and our Nation's Governors to \nprotect, and in some cases actually improve to a greater extent, air \nquality and public health as we undertake major changes in the Nation's \nfuel supplies.\n  Those who typically have proposed the myths and have supported those \nmyths and made them a part of current mythology relating to biofuels \nand ethanol in particular have very often done so out of a lack of \ninformation but very often as a result of trying to derail the effort \ntoward expanding this important part of our energy source. That is why \nit is important we take the opportunity to point out the truthfulness \nof the facts underlying ethanol and point out the falsehoods in the \nmyths being used to deter our actions toward this amendment.\n  I note my colleague from the other side. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank both of my friends from Nebraska. Both have been \nchampions for renewable fuels, especially in the area of ethanol \ndevelopment.\n  We all know we have not put forth our best effort toward research and \ndevelopment for the best use of this fuel. I was raised in the Midwest. \nWhen people think of ethanol, they think of corn. But corn is not the \nonly grain that can be used. I lend my support to what the Senator from \nNebraska is saying, and also to all our work in research and \ndevelopment for making this fuel more viable, making it work, and \nmaking it cost effective. It must be one of our big challenges.\n  I have heard my good friend from Nebraska, the former Governor of \nNebraska, make a couple of speeches on ethanol; both his enthusiasm for \nthe product and the benefits it provides. It is not only good for our \ncountry, but good for our air and for the agricultural community that \nsorely needs help.\n  Increasing the use of ethanol to 5 billion gallons is a step in the \nright direction. Some say it is possible to increase that figure. It is \na number we finally settled on that was acceptable to folks who want to \nparticipate in this industry in my State of Montana.\n  As I have stated, early this morning we spoke of the high-tech task \nforce that we put together on this side of the aisle. We talk of all \nthe research and development for the free flow of information. Here is \nanother area we should zero in on. It will be new structures that will \nallow us to take advantage of this fuel and make it as efficient as \nusing total gasoline or oxygenated gasolines.\n  I talk to refiners in the private sector. Nobody wants to make a \ncleaner fuel than the refiners. The increase in production of ethanol \nis a good step. However, we should look at what we can do with our land \ngrant universities who have the wherewithal to do some real research \nand development on this fuel, making it more viable than it is today. \nWe have shortchanged making it better and more cost effective. We can \nlet this work for us.\n  I support my good friends from Nebraska. I thank them for their \nleadership on this issue. It is important. I would like to be part of \ntrying to round up a little more money in a government-private sector \npartnership and allow the research to go forward on this matter.\n  I thank my good friend from Nebraska. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank my colleague from the great State of \nMontana for his support. He does have Midwest connections. He had the \ngood fortune to marry a woman from the State of Nebraska. We appreciate \nhis connection with the Midwest and his support.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Arkansas, who will speak on the \nrenewable fuel standard.\n\n[[Page S1817]]\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nebraska, who \nhas done critical work on this issue. I am delighted to be joining many \nof my colleagues in discussing the critical role that renewable fuels \nwill play in our national energy policy.\n  The energy bill we have been considering contains an important \nprovision for renewable motor fuel standards. This provision \nestablishes a national program for renewable fuels to be phased in \nbeginning in 2004.\n  This program would be flexible, so as not to adversely affect small \nproducers and refineries, and it would provide incentives to encourage \nthe development and use of renewable fuel.\n  What would be the end result of this program? It would require 5 \nbillion gallons of renewable fuels by the year 2012, significantly \nreducing our dependence upon foreign energy sources.\n  What does this mean? This is incredible. I think this is so important \nfor us to stop and take a moment and realize what we are actually \ndoing--5 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2012. What a dramatic \nmove we are making in the right direction.\n  I should also mention that this provision includes measures to \nprotect consumers. It would require a Department of Energy study next \nyear, before the program begins, to assess the possible consumer \nimpacts of a renewable fuels program. If the program would have a \nnegative effect on consumers, the Environmental Protection Agency would \nbe authorized to adjust the requirements to prevent these negative \neffects. By delivering the United States from the whims of groups like \nOPEC, who manipulate the production and price of oil, we will also \nreduce our trade deficit by an estimated $34 billion. That will be good \nfor both American economic security and national security.\n  Furthermore, a renewable fuel standard would create new economic \nopportunities in rural America. As many as 214,000 new American jobs \ncould be created in response to the renewable fuel standard. It would \nincrease the demand for grain by an average of 1.4 million bushels per \nyear. It would create nearly $5.3 billion in new investment, much of \nthat in rural areas.\n  Importantly, a renewable fuel standard has attracted broad support--\nand not only from the agricultural and fuel industries. The American \nLung Association, for example, has also offered strong support for this \nprovision, since renewable fuels would provide an effective strategy to \nreduce toxic air emissions and protect our air quality.\n  It is an exaggeration to say that a renewable fuel standard could \nprotect the health and well-being of future generations of Americans. \nThose of us from rural states appreciate the remarkable potential of \nrenewable fuels. That is one reason why the farm bill that recently \npassed in the Senate also included a renewable motor fuels standard.\n  In Arkansas, we recognize the importance of renewable fuels in \nhelping the United States to become more energy-independent. That is \nwhy we are continuing to move forward with the development of a \nvaluable new alternative fuel: Biodiesel. Biodiesel is a clean-burning \nfuel that can be produced from domestic renewable sources, such as \nagricultural oils, animal fats, or even recycled cooking oils. It \ncontains no petroleum, but it can be easily blended with petroleum \ndiesel at any stage of the process--during production at the refinery, \nin the pipeline, or even from the gas pump into a diesel tank.\n  Biodiesel can be used in compression-ignition diesel engines with no \nmajor modifications. We are there. We are there with a product that is \nenvironmentally safe, that is good for our economy, and good for our \nenvironment.\n  In road tests, biodiesel blends have demonstrated performance, fuel \nmileage, and drivability comparable to petroleum diesel. Biodiesel is \nsimple to use, biodegradable, non-toxic, and essentially free of sulfur \nand aromatics.\n  Athough new to our country, its use is well-established in Europe \nwith over 250 million gallons consumed annually. Farmers in Arkansas \nand other rural States have embraced the development of biodiesel \nbecause it makes good economic sense for the farm industry. Biodiesel \nwould allow us to develop new markets and to expand existing markets \nfor soybean oil, cottonseed oils, and other types of agricultural oils.\n  I have fought to include biodiesel as an alternative fuel, most \nrecently by inserting a biodiesel tax credit in the Finance Committee's \nenergy tax incentives package. This provision was overwhelmingly \napproved by the committee in a vote last month.\n  Biodiesel is not yet cost-competitive with petroleum diesel. In order \nto create favorable market conditions for biodiesel, we need market \nsupport and tax incentives to foster these conditions. With today's \ndepressed market for farm commodities, biodiesel would serve as a ready \nnew market for surplus farm products.\n  Investment now in the biodiesel industry will level the playing field \nand create new opportunities in rural America.\n  I believe that biodiesel could be made more available by allowing its \nuse under the Energy Policy Act which Congress passed in 1992. If we \nexpand the alternative fuels options to include biodiesel, we can make \neven more progress on bringing renewables to a wider market and making \nthem more cost-effective.\n  Reduced dependency on foreign oil, greater protection of our air and \nwater against pollution and contamination, a strengthened rural economy \nwith new jobs and productive uses for surplus farm commodities, energy \nsources that are natural, sustainable, and renewable--and all of this \nnow. We do not have to wait. We do not have to retrofit our \nautomobiles. All we have to do is move forward in making this product \ncomparable in the sense that it can be competitive in the marketplace. \nWe can do it now.\n\n  These are only a few of the major benefits we will see from \nincreasing our investment in renewable fuels. Now is the time to lay \nthe groundwork to move our Nation in the direction of energy \nindependence. How excited we should be that we have come this far, that \nwe can move quickly now in energy policy to lessen our dependence on \nforeign oil, to use our own economy, our own production, and our \nagricultural and rural States to create a better environment and less \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  I am very pleased to join Senator Nelson and the rest of my \ncolleagues today in making sure that efficient, renewable fuels will \nplay a key role in our Nation's future energy plan. Now is the time to \nact.\n  We have been void of energy policy in our Nation for far too long--\none that is progressive, meets our needs, lessens our dependence on \nforeign oil, as well as putting our people to work --all the while \nprotecting our environment.\n  I thank my colleagues for bringing up such a critical issue, and I \nlook forward to moving forward on this one quickly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that several letters be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  Red River Valley\n\n\n                                Sugarbeet Growers Association,\n\n                                      Fargo, ND, January 18, 2002.\n     Hon. Ben Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: As the Senate prepares to work on an \n     energy bill, you will have a voice on some important \n     decisions that will affect our country in many ways and for \n     many years to come. One of the most important things you can \n     do to make a difference is to support including a renewable \n     fuels standard in the energy bill. Such a measure would \n     require the oil industry to use an increasing amount of \n     ethanol and biodiesel every year, while giving the oil \n     industry the flexibility to determine when and where it is \n     best to use it.\n       More importantly, a renewable fuels standard that would \n     require the use of at least five (5) billion gallons of \n     ethanol by 2012 is good energy policy. We hear a lot of talk \n     about reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and this would \n     be the best measurable and tangible step we could take to \n     actually accomplish that goal.\n       A renewable fuels requirement would increase jobs, \n     something our country desperately needs, create markets for \n     farm products, and help us reduce our reliance on oil from \n     the Middle East--over 66% of the world's oil reserves lie in \n     the politically unstable Persian Gulf. Ethanol and biodiesel \n     can help our country, but we need your support in order to \n     help make that happen. The time is right, and we need your \n     support for this effort. I urge you to contact me if for any \n     reason you cannot support such a provision. Thank you for \n     your help on this issue.\n       A renewable fuels standard has been incorporated in S. \n     1766, and we strongly support\n\n[[Page S1818]]\n\n     that provision. No matter what form the final bill takes, we \n     want to see a renewable fuels requirement in the final \n     version of the Senate's energy bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Mark F. Weber,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                          ACE,\n\n                                   Sioux Falls, SD, March 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Ben Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: I am writing to thank you for your \n     support for including a renewable fuels standard in the \n     Senate energy bill. The American Coalition for Ethanol (ACE) \n     was one of the first organizations to advocate the creation \n     of a renewable fuels standard (RFS). In fact, I testified on \n     behalf of ACE in support of an RFS in front of the Senate \n     Agriculture Committee all the way back on April 11, 2000. As \n     an organization that represents a broad, grassroots base, \n     including many farmer-owned ethanol plants, rural electric \n     cooperatives and public power districts, ACE feels that a \n     renewable fuels standard that phases in ethanol demand over \n     10 years will allow more farmer-led ethanol projects to be \n     developed.\n       A renewable fuels standard will give the ethanol industry \n     the certainty that it needs in order to continue to grow. It \n     will give farmers and bankers the assurance they need in \n     order to keep investing in new ethanol production. At the \n     same time, a renewable fuels standard will also: create badly \n     needed jobs and economic development in rural areas; create \n     opportunities for farmers to invest in the processing of the \n     products they are producing; and significantly reduce our \n     country's dependence on foreign oil, much of which we are \n     importing from Iraq and other countries in the Middle East.\n       Various studies have shown that there are no barriers to \n     the implantation of a 5 billion gallon renewable fuels \n     requirement. Now, as the Senate begins work on its version of \n     the energy bill, it is time that ethanol and biodiesel be \n     recognized for their ability to help provide for a secure \n     energy future for the United States. We thank you for your \n     support for a renewable fuels standard and will look forward \n     to working with you to further expand opportunities for \n     farmers and rural America.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Trevor Guthmiller,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Nebraska Farmers Union,\n\n                                       Lincoln, NE, March 6, 2002.\n     Hon. Ben Nelson,\n     Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: As you prepare for the debate on a \n     national energy policy, I want to re-state the importance of \n     the proposed renewable fuel standard to the Nebraska Farmers \n     Union. I know you have been a long-time supporter of this \n     concept but it is important that others understand the impact \n     this proposal can have on the agricultural economy, the \n     environment, and on our country. One example of the potential \n     impact generated by the proposed national standard is clearly \n     illustrated by the ethanol plants in Nebraska. The Clean Air \n     Act Amendments of 1990 and the ethanol program adopted in \n     Nebraska encouraged investment in ethanol plants. The \n     investment in Nebraska ethanol plants yielded a host of \n     economic and environmental benefits. These include the \n     expansion of grain markets in the state, quality jobs in \n     rural areas, displacement of imported gasoline, diversified \n     local tax bases, and the reduction of carcinogenic gasoline \n     components with clean burning ethanol. Enactment of a \n     renewable energy standard would provide a strong impetus for \n     additional investment in new plants throughout the country. \n     New investment will yield additional jobs, additional grain \n     consumption, increased output of clean burning ethanol and \n     additional tax contributions to state and local tax coffers. \n     All these benefits are crucial to the economy of Nebraska and \n     other states.\n       Higher prices offered by ethanol plants for cash grain \n     helps support our farmers and reduces transportation of crops \n     grown in the state. Local access to expanded grain markets \n     reduces the use of imported fuels and lowers the \n     transportation costs associated with grain marketing. These \n     reduced costs are especially important during times of \n     economic hardship in the agricultural sector.\n       Theses are many reasons why a national renewable fuel \n     standard is of importance to the national economy. I urge you \n     to continue your strong support for the proposed national \n     renewable fuel standard and to convey the importance of this \n     standard to your colleagues in the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John K.

Ben Nelson,\n     Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: As you prepare for the debate on a \n     national energy policy, I want to re-state the importance of \n     the proposed renewable fuel standard to Nebraska corn \n     producers. I know you have been a long-time supporter of this \n     concept but it is important that others understand the impact \n     this proposal can have on the agricultural economy, the \n     environment, and on our country. The ethanol plants in \n     Nebraska perhaps best illustrate one example of the potential \n     benefits that can be generated by the proposed national \n     standard. The ethanol development program adopted in Nebraska \n     encouraged investment in new ethanol plants. The investment \n     in Nebraska ethanol plants yielded a host of economic and \n     environmental benefits. These include the expansion of grain \n     markets in the state, quality jobs in rural areas, \n     displacement of imported gasoline, diversified local tax \n     bases, and value-added grain processing.\n       Enactment of a renewable energy standard would provide a \n     strong impetus for additional investment in new plants \n     throughout the country. New investment will yield additional \n     jobs, additional grain consumption, expanded grain markets, \n     increased output of clean burning ethanol and additional tax \n     contributions to state and local tax coffers. These benefits \n     are crucial to the economy of Nebraska and other states.\n       Increased demand for ethanol tends to stimulate higher \n     prices for corn. Higher prices bid by ethanol plants for cash \n     grain helps support our corn producers and reduces \n     transportation of crops grown in the state. Local access to \n     expanded grain markets reduces the use of imported fuels and \n     lowers the transportation costs associated with grain \n     marketing. These reduced costs are especially important \n     during times of economic hardship in the agricultural sector.\n       These are numerous reasons why a national renewable fuel \n     standard is of importance to the national economy, and to our \n     rural economy in Nebraska. On behalf of Nebraska's corn \n     producers, we commend your hard work and thank you for your \n     strong support for the proposed national renewable fuel \n     standard.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Mark Schweers,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             NE Ethanol Board,\n\n                                       Lincoln, NE, March 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Ben Nelson,\n     Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: As you and your colleagues prepare to \n     continue the debate on a national energy policy, I want to \n     take this opportunity to reiterate the importance of the \n     proposed renewable fuel standard. I know you have been a \n     longstanding supporter of this concept but it is important \n     that others understand the profound impact this proposal can \n     have on our country. One example of the potential impact \n     generated by the proposed national standard is clearly \n     illustrated in Nebraska. The ethanol development program \n     adopted in Nebraska more than a decade ago has yielded a host \n     of economic and environmental benefits. These include the \n     following:\n       Construction of seven grain processing plants that annually \n     convert 20 per cent of the Nebraska corn and grain sorghum \n     crop to clean burning ethanol and value-added protein \n     products.\n       New capital investment in these facilities that totals more \n     than one billion dollars to date. Additional investment is \n     currently underway in new and existing plants.\n       More than 1,000 permanent jobs directly resulting from \n     plant operations and more than 5,000 induced jobs that \n     support the ethanol industry.\n       Quality jobs in rural areas of the state. A recent survey \n     indicates that the average salary paid at ethanol plants in \n     Nebraska is approximately $36,100. This salary level is \n     significantly higher than the average salary for all job \n     categories in the state. Quality jobs help retain skilled \n     workers in rural parts of the state. This income, coupled \n     with tax assessments on the plant, helps to diversify the \n     local tax base.\n       Higher prices and reduced transportation of crops grown in \n     the state. This new demand for grain stimulates cash prices \n     and provides a local market.\n       Increased economic activity in other sectors. For example, \n     a recent analysis by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln \n     indicates that the feeding of high protein co-products \n     produced at ethanol plants yields improved gains in cattle. \n     The study indicates that when fed as a wet ration, energy \n     costs are saved and cattle weight gains are improved. The \n     economic impact of this activity is measured at more than $41 \n     million each year in Nebraska.\n       Improved air quality. Reductions of carbon monoxide in the \n     atmosphere are in part due to the use of ethanol enhanced \n     fuels in Nebraska. In addition, a recent study by the \n     University of Nebraska concludes that ethanol reduces \n     aromatic levels in gasoline.\n       Retention of energy dollars in the state economy. There is \n     no gasoline refined in Nebraska. Every gallon of gasoline \n     must be imported from outside the borders of the state. \n     Displacement of gasoline with ethanol helps retain dollars in \n     our economy.\n       These are a few reasons why a national renewable fuel \n     standard is of such importance to the Nebraska economy. More \n     importantly, the proposed standard offers the opportunity to \n     generate similar benefits nationwide. For that reason, the 27 \n     Governors that comprise the National Governors' Ethanol \n     Coalition stand firmly in their support of this proposed \n     standard.\n       The proposed standard must be a key component of a new \n     national energy plan. The standard presents us with an \n     opportunity to stimulate a significant national biofuels \n     effort that will yield important economic, energy, \n     environmental and national security benefits. I urge you to \n     continue your strong support for the proposed national \n     renewable\n\n[[Page S1819]]\n\n     fuel standard and to convey the importance of this standard \n     to your colleagues in the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n     Todd C.

Ben Nelson,\n     Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: As you prepare for the debate on a \n     national energy policy, I want to re-state the importance of \n     the proposed renewable fuel standard to companies like Chief \n     Ethanol Fuels. I know you have been a long-time supporter of \n     this concept, but it is important that others understand the \n     impact this proposal can have on ethanol companies and on our \n     country. One example of the potential impact generated by the \n     proposed national standard is clearly illustrated by our \n     plant in Nebraska. The ethanol development program adopted in \n     Nebraska encouraged us to invest in the Hastings plant. Our \n     investment has yielded a host of economic and environmental \n     benefits. These include the expansion of our processing plant \n     from 10 million gallons annual capacity to more than 60 \n     million gallons capacity. At our plant, we convert Nebraska \n     corn and grain sorghum to clean burning ethanol and value-\n     added protein products.\n       We continue to evaluate the investment of new capital in \n     our facility when market conditions warrant. Enactment of a \n     renewable energy standard would provide a strong impetus for \n     additional investment. New investment yields additional jobs, \n     additional grain consumption, increased output of clean \n     burning ethanol and additional tax contributions to state and \n     local tax coffers.\n       Our ethanol plant is an aggressive bidder for local grain. \n     Higher prices bid for cash grain helps support our farmers \n     and reduces transportation of crops grown in the state. The \n     ethanol we sell at local terminals helps to retain energy \n     dollars in the state's economy. Since no gasoline is refined \n     in Nebraska, we must import it from outside the borders of \n     the state. Displacement of gasoline with ethanol helps retain \n     dollars in our economy.\n       As the debate on the issues progresses, I would ask that a \n     mechanism be included to assure year around blending and not \n     just Winter season. Smaller ethanol producers do not have the \n     storage capacity or financial wherewithal to store ethanol \n     production during the 6 month Summer season.\n       I urge you to continue your strong support for the proposed \n     national renewable fuel standard and to convey the importance \n     of this standard to your colleagues in the Senate. Thank you \n     for your many years of strong support for ethanol.\n           Sincerely,\n     Roger Burken.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Griffin Industries, Inc.,\n\n                                   Cold Spring, KY, March 5, 2002.\n     Hon.

We currently service the Midwest, \n     East Coast and Southeast regions of the country with ASTM-121 \n     high quality fuel to many non-attainment air quality cities \n     for use in buses and service vehicles and other fleets \n     delivering consumer goods of all types.\n       Our plant has the capacity to produce ASTM standard fuel \n     from various feedstocks including soybean oil and spent \n     cooking oil. This new process is helpful in creating new uses \n     for agri-products and lessens our dependency on foreign oil \n     suppliers, especially the volatile Middle East Region of the \n     world where we are under battle at the present time.\n       Biofuels can play a very important part in the United \n     States Energy Policy while helping agriculture at the same \n     time. We currently have several new projects under \n     consideration at other Griffin Industries locations and will \n     commit new capacities to the biodiesel market if biofuels are \n     included in our nation's energy future.\n       Thank you for ``carrying the flag'' on biofuels. If we can \n     be of assistance, please don't hesitate to contact me.\n           Best Regards,\n                                                Dennis B. Griffin,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Changing World Technologies, Inc.,\n\n                                West Hempstead, NY, March 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Ben Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: Although I am a resident of New York \n     and not Nebraska, I wanted to applaud your efforts in \n     promoting renewable bio-fuels. I am the chairman of a company \n     that is building a bio-refinery in Missouri, which will \n     process turkey slaughterhouse waste into natural gas, oil and \n     fertilizer with no material remaining that requires disposal.\n       Our patented technology, if applied broadly, could replace \n     all imported energy feedstocks, thus insuring our energy \n     independence. In addition to our Missouri plant, which will \n     be operational in August, we are building commercial plants \n     to handle agricultural waste in Nevada, Alabama, Georgia, \n     Arkansas and Colorado. Our process can also be applied to \n     other organic wastes, such as scrap tires, waste plastic, \n     sewage sludge and municipal solid waste.\n       We and others like us have commercial technologies, which \n     can transform costly waste materials into valuable energy \n     products. With your support and that of other like-minded \n     senators, we can advance the commercial viability of the \n     renewable fuels industry, enhance the quality of our \n     environment, and replace imported oil as a significant energy \n     source. You have our full support in all of your efforts.\n           Best regards,\n                                                   Brian S. Appel,\n     Chairman and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Masada, OxyNol,\n\n                                    Birmingham, AL, March 5, 2002.\n     Hon. E. Benjamin Nelson,\n     Dirksen Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: I am writing to tell you how pleased I \n     am that a Renewable Fuel Standard proposal has been included \n     in the Senate energy bill. I know that you are a strong \n     supporter of the renewable fuel standard and I share your \n     hope that it is enacted.\n       A renewable fuel standard will increase national energy \n     security, stimulate economic growth and help protect the \n     environment. The use of ethanol, a domestically produced \n     fuel, will reduce our dependence on foreign oil imports while \n     adding much needed jobs in the United States. Not only is \n     ethanol an alternative to imported oil, it is cleaner burning \n     and helps decrease air pollution by dramatically reducing the \n     production of greenhouse gases.\n       Masada OxyNol TM has patented a unique process \n     that converts household garbage into fuel ethanol. After \n     traditional recyclables are removed, the remaining cellulosic \n     portion of the garbage is processed into ethanol. More than \n     90% of the garbage is beneficially reused or recycled instead \n     of being landfilled or incinerated.\n       As a leader in the field of cellulose to ethanol \n     production, our company realizes the importance of a strong \n     renewable fuel standard. We at Masada OxyNol TM \n     are very much in favor of the inclusion of the renewable fuel \n     standard in the final energy bill. The implementation of such \n     a standard will be good for the nation.\n       Thank you for all of your hard work toward the \n     establishment of the renewable fuel standard.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                   Daryl E. Harms,\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                February 22, 2002.\n       Senators Thomas A. Daschle, Trent Lott, Jeff Bingaman, \n     Frank H. Murkowski, Ernest F. Hollings, and John McCain, and \n     Representatives J. Dennis Hastert and Richard A. Gephardt: As \n     you wrestle with the complex and vitally important energy \n     bill now before the Senate and the subsequent House/Senate \n     Conference, we ask that you carefully consider the national \n     and energy security aspects of this legislation in order to \n     reduce our reliance on oil.\n       The United States is almost out of oil, and our dependence \n     takes us places and forces us to do things that are not \n     always in America's national interest. The power of oil \n     reinforces the top of almost all societies and that strength \n     and privilege too often fails to translate into policies and \n     actions meeting the true needs of the people, their \n     environment and their future. Perhaps the greatest gift \n     America can give to the world is to put the power of oil into \n     perspective.\n       We can use less oil to meet our needs in smarter ways while \n     advancing energy efficiency and renewable energy \n     technologies. Europe is ahead of us in many these areas. \n     Countries rich in oil and poor in dealing with their people \n     and their environment may then begin to take a more \n     insightful look at their 20 year horizon and decide that \n     their current wealth can be better deployed. They should then \n     be able to see that subjugation, terrorism, and war are not \n     good investments for current oil-derived wealth.\n       Here at home: America must reduce its dependency on oil as \n     we deplete our reserves and increase imports that will \n     increasingly come from the Middle East, the Caspian Basin and \n     Indonesia; we must accept our responsibility to reduce \n     America's greenhouse gas and other harmful emissions largely \n     emanating from the combustion of fossil fuels; we must \n     preserve for future generations and for strategic purposes, \n     the last of our oil reserves and pioneer the advancement of \n     non-petroleum transportation fuels; and we must disperse our \n     energy production facilities and reduce our reliance on \n     vulnerable electrical grids and oil and gas pipelines.\n       There are major opportunities for energy efficiency, fuel \n     economy and renewable energy technologies like solar, wind, \n     biomass, geothermal, incremental hydro and hydrogen.\n       While these imperatives will come at a modest investment to \n     our economy, they will bring major returns and benefits: \n     accelerate the process of freeing us from our oil dependency; \n     honor our international environmental obligations; create \n     major new domestic industries and millions of jobs--\n     especially in rural America where opportunities for biomass, \n     solar, wind and geothermal industries abound; take America \n     out of the ``rumble seat'' and into the driver's seat in \n     establishing the world's energy future; and greatly \n     strengthen our energy and national security.\n\n[[Page S1820]]\n\n       We are national security specialists and energy security \n     advocates of biofuels because of their ready potential to \n     replace imported oil. We recommend: passage of a meaningful \n     renewable fuels and a renewable portfolio standard; increased \n     efficiency standards for vehicles--and the use of biofuels in \n     these vehicles--and for facilities/appliances using \n     electricity; and extension of the energy production tax \n     credits for at least two years and include open-loop biomass, \n     agricultural and forestry residues, animal waste, solar and \n     geothermal.\n       We ask that you give our convictions and recommendations \n     careful consideration in your deliberations.\n     Robert C.

Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle and Senator Lott: On behalf of the 27 \n     members of the Governors' Ethanol Coalition, we are writing \n     to express our strong support for the provisions included in \n     the Energy Policy Act of 2002 (S. 517), which will establish \n     a national renewable fuels standard.\n       The provisions set forth in the Manager's Amendment to S. \n     517 reflect an agreement negotiated over the last two years \n     by the states, agricultural interests, refiners, and the \n     environmental community that will address such important \n     issues as MTBE water contamination and the oxygenate \n     requirement in reformulated gasoline while providing a \n     significant market for renewable fuels such as ethanol and \n     biodiesel. Specifically, we support those provisions in S. \n     517 that: create a national renewable fuels standard, \n     ensuring a growing part of our nation's fuel supply, up to 5 \n     billion gallons by 2012, is provided by domestic, renewable \n     fuels; eliminate the use of MTBE in the United States within \n     four years; eliminate the oxygenate requirement in the \n     reformulated gasoline program; and maintain the air quality \n     gains of the reformulated gasoline program.\n       By enacting these provisions, we will strengthen our \n     national security, displace imported oil from politically \n     unstable regions, stimulate ethanol and biodiesel production, \n     expand domestic energy supplies, and continue to reduce air \n     pollution.\n       We encourage you to support these provisions and to resist \n     any amendments that would alter this landmark agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Holden,\n       Governor of Missouri, Chair.\n     John Hoeven,\n       Governor of North Dakota, Vice Chair.\n     Mike Johanns,\n       Governor of Nebraska, Past Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            National Corn Growers Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Corn Growers \n     Association, I want to express our solid support for the \n     inclusion of a Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in S. 517 that \n     is being debated in the Senate. A commitment to a RFS is a \n     commitment to making America energy independent. Our energy \n     security is not a partisan issue and we hope that all Members \n     of the Senate will put America first and vote yes on the RFS.\n       We believe the benefits from passing the RFS are \n     overwhelming. Even a modest RFS that equals to about 3% \n     (phased in over 10 years) of the gasoline used in the U.S. \n     would reduce oil imports by 1.6 billion barrels over the next \n     decade. According to a recent study by AUS Consultants, \n     reducing oil imports by this amount will reduce our trade \n     deficit by nearly $34 billion while creating 214,000 jobs and \n     adding $51 billion to household income. In addition, the RFS \n     will create $5.3 billion in new investment, much of it in \n     rural America. Finally, the RFS provisions of S. 517 will \n     provide flexibility for refiners to produce fuel more cost \n     effectively while protecting the environment.\n       The RFS is a standard, just like the standards we have for \n     automobile fuel economy or the energy efficiency of \n     appliances and buildings. Congress has established these \n     visionary goals for energy efficiency over many years as an \n     integral part of our pubic policy. The RFS simply says that \n     it is good public policy, and in our national interest for \n     some portion of our transportation fuel to be derived from \n     renewable resources.\n       It is time for America to take meaningful steps toward \n     energy independence. A first, small step is to establish a \n     RFS now. Put America first, vote yes on the RFS.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Tim Hume,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the issue of ethanol \nand the renewable fuel standard, but before I do, I compliment the \nSenator from Arkansas for the simple reason that she was the sponsor of \nthe amendment in the Senate Finance Committee in which we adopted this \nas part of our tax incentives for renewable fuels. She led the way in \nthat committee. I was happy to join her as the Republican leader of \nthat effort because not only will Arkansas benefit but half of our \nStates raise some soybeans and they will benefit as well. So I \ncompliment Senator Lincoln.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues in support of the renewable fuel \nstandard, which is an example of true bipartisan cooperation in this \nbody. It was a bipartisan effort that made this possible. Obviously, \nSenator Nelson has already been applauded by my colleagues. I would say \nthat as well. Not only since he has been in the Senate but as Governor \nof the State of Nebraska he helped, through the Governors' Conference, \ncochairing issues of ethanol for that conference. So he has been a \nleader in this area for a long time.\n  So I give my heartfelt thanks to him and to others who were \ninstrumental, both directly and indirectly. Even though President Bush \nis not a member of this body, I think he needs to be complimented in \nthe first instance for denying California's request for a waiver out of \nthe Clean Air Act's oxygenation requirements.\n  Upon taking office, President Bush quickly recognized that there was \nno scientific or legal justification for the waiver. He, in fact, had \nthe courage to take that action. It could have been possible 2 years \nbefore, if President Clinton had done likewise. During that period of \nlost time, we had a dampening and a delaying of efforts, such as we are \nhaving today, to successfully help our national security and our farm \neconomy because these all benefit from the increased ethanol use as an \noxygenate.\n  President Bush, has turned out to be the most pro-ethanol President \nwe have ever had, and because he refused to let the Clean Air Act \nunravel, he gave us the leverage necessary for this process, the \nnegotiation of a new renewable fuel standard. Now we are back on track.\n  I thank Senator Nelson. I also thank the senior Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Hagel, because he provided persuasive leadership last \nfall in securing support for his Senate Energy Committee Republican \ncolleagues to get behind this renewable fuel standard.\n  I also have said this has been a very bipartisan effort. Obviously, \nour majority leader, Senator Daschle, has been involved in a very \nhelpful way. During the negotiations conducted by Senator Hagel, he \nprovided constant assurances that he would be supportive of this final \nproduct.\n  I compliment our Republican leader, who comes from an oil-producing \nState and who has been behind ethanol for several years, Senator Lott, \nand also Senator Murkowski, the ranking member of the Energy Committee. \nLast fall, they gave Senator Hagel, myself, and other Senators their \ncommitment, at least for the Republican side, that they would support \nthis renewable standard.\n  Today, our Nation produces just 1.8 billion gallons of ethanol a \nyear. The renewable fuel standard will require that we use 2.3 billion. \nThat is a one-half-billion increase in gallons by the year 2004. Then \nit steadily increases up the ladder until it is a mandated use of 5 \nbillion gallons by the year 2012.\n  This sounds like just more and cheaper gas to burn. But it also will \nimprove air quality. It strengthens our national security, and it \nreduces our trade deficit. One-third of our trade deficit is caused by \nthe import of oil. It will decrease our independence upon oil from \ndictators who aren't reliable--Saddam Hussein. It will extend markets \nfor agricultural products in a way that we all want--value added. It \ncreates jobs in cities.\n  A 1997 study by the Midwestern Governors' Conference--I would bet \nSenator Nelson had something to do with this when he was Governor--\ndetermined that ethanol demand was responsible for over 195,000 jobs \nthroughout the economy. Forty-two thousand of those jobs were located \nin Iowa.\n\n[[Page S1821]]\n\n  With the passage of the renewable fuel standard, 214,000 new jobs are \nanticipated. I expect a large portion of those would be in my State of \nIowa.\n  Just last week, for instance, Quad County Corn Processors, a \ncooperative in the small town of Galva, IA, began production at their \nnew 18-million-gallon ethanol facility. Iowa now has nine ethanol \nplants and five more are under construction.\n  The Iowa Corn Growers Association provided me an analysis of the \neconomic impact of seven new Iowa farmer-owned ethanol plants in our \nState, two of which have been completed and five are under \nconstruction. Over 4,000 farmers have invested in these facilities. \nThese are farmers helping themselves in a cooperative way. The \nfacilities will create 170 new jobs. While Iowa currently produces 500 \nmillion gallons of ethanol each year, these new facilities will add 150 \nmillion gallons more.\n  According to the Iowa Corn Growers, corn prices will increase 5 cents \nper bushel for every 100 million bushels of corn processed. Therefore, \nthese seven new farmer-owned ethanol facilities alone will increase \ncorn prices by 3.5 cents.\n\n  Every year, about 175 million bushels of Iowa corn are processed into \nethanol. This in turn adds about $730 million per year to the income of \nIowa farm families. It adds up to $1.7 billion of increased economic \nactivity in our State.\n  As I mentioned today, we produce nationwide about 1.8 million gallons \nof ethanol. When fully implemented, the bipartisan compromise in this \nbill--the renewable fuel standard--will almost triple production.\n  Economic analysis by A-U-S Consultants found that this legislation \nwill displace over 1.6 billion barrels of oil, increase farm income by \nalmost $6 billion annually, increase household income by $52 billion \nper year, and create over 214,000 new jobs nationwide.\n  I also would like to share with my colleagues the finding of a study \nproduced 2 years ago by the Department of Energy entitled ``The Impacts \nof Alternative and Replacement Fuel Use On Oil Prices.'' The study \nfound that ``current use of alternative and replacement fuels is \nestimated to reduce total U.S. petroleum costs by about $1.3 billion \nper year.''\n  It is very important to understand that these alternative fuels--\nprimarily MTBE as well as ethanol--made up only 2.71 percent of our \ntotal motor fuel use. I want to say to naysayers who criticize efforts \nto expand alternative sources of motor fuels that the evidence proves \nthat even small amounts of alternative motor fuels can generate huge \nsavings to consumers.\n  The Department of Energy study went on to estimate that if we \nincrease our alternative motor fuels use by just 10 percent by the year \n2010, consumers will save $6 billion per year. By increasing the use of \nalternative motor fuels, we increase price elasticity in the event of \nsupply disruption and thus reduce the potential damage to our Nation's \neconomy. To do otherwise leaves us subjected to our current vulnerable \nsituation where, again, according to the Department of Energy, ``For \nevery one million barrels per day of oil disruption, world prices could \nincrease by $3 to $5 per barrel.''\n  In closing, I emphasize that 1 million barrels per day is a mere 5 \npercent of U.S. oil consumption. Yet this very small amount would cause \nprice hikes of 10 to 25 percent if oil were $20 per barrel. A little in \nalternatives, such as ethanol--or we could even say biodiesel--can go a \nlong way toward protecting all consumers from OPEC efforts of price \ngouging.\n  I thank my colleagues for working together in this bipartisan effort, \nwhich is good for the economy, good for the environment, good for jobs, \nand good for energy independence.\n  As I so often say to describe ethanol, it is good, good, good.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to \nthe distinguished Senator from the State of Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, first of all, alternative fuels \nand ethanol are the subject of the instant amendment, but I think we \nhave to use our creativity and our technology in order to approach the \noverall energy crisis.\n  If a terrorist sinks a supertanker in the Straits of Hormuz, which \nare only 19 miles wide, we are going to see a major disruption in the \nflow of oil to the industrialized world, and we will have wished we had \nused our technology and our creativity to reduce our dependence on that \nforeign oil by doing things that have worked to save our oil \nconsumption in the past, like increasing the miles per gallon of the \nautomobiles we drive. We have the know how to do that.\n  It just amazes me that we have the technology to, for example, \nproduce a car which will go 80 miles per gallon and yet we are still so \nballed up in our politics that we may not pass an initiative that calls \nfor moderate increases in the fuel efficiency of our nation's \nautomobiles. The modest increases called for by the Kerry-McCain \ninitiative would achieve three goals of particular importance to our \nnation in this time of war: lessen our dependence on foreign oil, \nreduce gasoline costs for consumers and protect the environment by \nreducing toxic air emissions and carbon dioxide emissions, which \ncontribute to global warming. Increasing CAFE can achieve these goals- \nwhich are particularly important to our nation's security now that we \nare in a battle against terrorists around this globe.\n  So I wanted to add my voice, hopefully, as a voice of reason, to get \nour representative body to start using our technology and our common \nsense to increase the fuel economy of all of our vehicles.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2997\n\n  Under the previous order, the hour of 11:30 having arrived, there now \nwill be 20 minutes equally divided on the Levin amendment No. 2997.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would assume that I would be dividing the \ntime in support of the amendment equally with my cosponsor from \nMissouri, and we would each control 5 minutes of the 10 minutes on our \nside. So I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our bipartisan alternative to the Kerry-\nHollings language in the substitute before us is aimed at increasing \nfuel economy, helping to protect the environment, and decreasing our \ndependence on foreign oil but doing it in a way which does not harm the \ndomestic manufacturing industries.\n  We have a three-point policy, basically: One, we provide that we will \nincrease fuel economy. Two, we have greater emphasis on positive \nincentives to produce and to purchase fuel-economic vehicles. We do \nthis through joint research and development funds which we would \nincrease over the amount requested by the administration. We would do \nthis through mandatory Government purchases of hybrids. And we would \nalso do this through increased tax credits above those provided by the \nFinance Committee.\n  But the third part of our policy is that many factors should be \nconsidered in raising the CAFE requirement. It should be raised. And \nour amendment says that it will be raised, but it would be raised, \nunder our amendment, not in an arbitrary way, not just by adopting an \narbitrary number on the floor of the Senate, but, rather, by telling, \nin the first instance, the Department of Transportation to look at all \nof the factors which should be considered in adopting a new CAFE \nstandard--many factors, including safety, including cost, including \ncompetitiveness of manufacturers.\n\n  The National Academy of Sciences has specifically said that there is \na safety tradeoff. That is what they have found. The opponents of our \namendment say it is a flawed study. OK. We disagree with that. But, \nnonetheless, if it is a flawed study, the National Academy of Sciences \nhas also then said, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \nshould continue their work in this area. But, point blank, the National \nAcademy of Sciences says there is a tradeoff.\n  I yield myself an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In the year studied, 1993, they found between 1,300 and \n2,600\n\n[[Page S1822]]\n\ndeaths and 13,000 and 26,000 injuries. They said these deaths and \ninjuries were a painful tradeoff that resulted from CAFE. The opponents \nof our amendment do not consider safety. They just say the study is \nflawed. That is their answer.\n  What about the discriminatory impacts of CAFE?\n  The National Academy of Sciences again says that one concept of \nequity among manufacturers requires equal treatment of equivalent \nvehicles made by different manufacturers. We do not have equal \ntreatment of equivalent vehicles made by different manufacturers under \nthe language that is in the substitute of Senator Kerry and Senator \nHollings. It treats equally-efficient vehicles differently and \ndiscriminates, thereby, against American jobs and the American \nindustry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to my colleague from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank my colleague from Michigan.\n  Mr. President, it is important to emphasize today that this debate is \nnot about whether or not we will increase vehicle fuel efficiency. We \nare not arguing for a freeze on CAFE standards. What we are saying is \nthat we need to do this in the best way possible. This needs to be \nsomething where we win environmentally and we win in terms of the \neconomy and jobs.\n  That is what this substitute does. It is comprehensive. It moves \nvehicle fuel efficiency forward. It creates the market incentives and \nthe support to make sure we have what is necessary in terms of \ninfrastructure for these new vehicles. It moves us in the right \ndirection.\n  I simply urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment, to support \nincreased vehicle fuel efficiency, and a vibrant, economically healthy \nU.S. auto industry. We do both through this amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am voting in favor of the Levin-Bond \namendment, and I want to explain my views in detail. Fuel efficiency is \na critically important issue for our country, for my home State of \nWisconsin, and for our future. I remain committed to the goal that \nsignificant improvements in automobile and light truck fuel efficiency \ncan be achieved over an appropriate time frame. Some will argue that my \nvote for Levin-Bond is a vote against increasing the corporate average \nfuel economy, CAFE. I do not share that view.\n  The Levin-Bond amendment seeks to renew the Department of \nTransportation's role in setting CAFE standards acting through the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, part of the \nFederal Department of Transportation, DOT. If Congress does not act \ntoday to try to restore normalcy to the NHTSA process, Congress will \nalways either block or act to set CAFE standards, every 20 years or so, \nwhen the political will is sufficient to do so. NHTSA will never be \nable to carry out the normal process of reviewing and incrementally \nimproving fuel efficiency for automobiles and light trucks, as Congress \noriginally intended when it passed the CAFE law in the 1970s.\n  Both interest groups battling over the CAFE issue, the auto \nmanufacturers and the environmental community, have switched their \npositions in this debate on this bill. The auto industry, who once \nwanted CAFE perpetually frozen with a rider, now support the Levin \namendment. The environmental community, who once opposed the rider and \nwanted NHTSA to act, now wants Congress to set the standard rather than \nNHTSA. With my vote, I am committing to a consistent position. Let me \nexplain the evolution of that position.\n  Months prior to the midterm elections in 1994, NHTSA published a \nnotice of possible adjustment to the fuel economy standards for trucks \nbefore the end of the decade. The following year, however, the House-\npassed version of the FY1996 Department of Transportation \nAppropriations bill prohibited the use of authorized funds to \npromulgate any CAFE rules. The Senate version did not include the \nlanguage, but it was restored in Conference. Much the same scenario \noccurred in the second session of the 104th and the first session of \nthe 105th Congresses. In both those sessions, a similar rider was \npassed by the House and not by the Senate, but included by the \nConferees and enacted. However, the growth in gasoline consumption and \nthe size of the light-duty truck fleet were concerns cited behind \nintroduction in the Senate of an amendment to the bill expressing the \nSense of the Senate that the conferees should not agree to the House-\npassed rider for FY2000. The amendment, sponsored by the former Senator \nfrom Washington, Mr. Gorton, and the Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein, was defeated in the Senate on September 15, 1999, by a vote \nof 55-40, and the rider was once again enacted into law.\n  As I stated on the Senate floor in the debates on the CAFE rider on \nJune 15, 2000, my vote was about ``Congress getting out of the way and \nletting a federal agency meet the requirements of federal law \noriginally imposed by Congress.'' I supported removing the rider \nbecause I was concerned that Congress has for more than 5 years blocked \nNHTSA from meeting its legal duty to evaluate whether there is a need \nto modify fuel economy standards.\n  As I made clear then, I have made no determination about what fuel \neconomy standards should be, though I do think that an increase is \npossible. NHTSA has the authority to set new standards for a given \nmodel year, taking into account several factors: technological \nfeasibility, economic practicability, other vehicle standards such as \nthose for safety and environmental performance, the need to conserve \nenergy, and the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences. I \nwant NHTSA to fully and fairly evaluate all the criteria, and then make \nan objective recommendation on the basis of those facts. I expect NHTSA \nto consult with all interested parties--unions, environmental \ninterests, auto manufacturers, and other interested Wisconsin citizens \nin developing this rule. And, I expect NHTSA to act, and if it does \nnot, this amendment requires Congress to act on a standard.\n  In opposing the Levin-Bond amendment, some subscribe to the view that \nNHTSA has a particular agenda and will recommend weak standards. I do \nnot support that view, just as I could not support retaining the CAFE \nrider in law.\n  NHTSA should be allowed to set this standard. Congress is not the \nbest forum for understanding whether or not improvements in fuel \neconomy can and should be made using existing technologies or whether \nemerging technologies may have the potential to improve fuel economy. \nChanges in fuel economy standards could have a variety of consequences. \nI seek to understand those consequences and to balance the concerns of \nthose interested in seeing improvements to fuel economy as a means of \nreducing gasoline consumption and associated pollution.\n  In the end, I would like to see that Wisconsin consumers, indeed all \nconsumers, have a wide range of new automobiles, SUVs, and trucks \navailable to them that are as fuel efficient as they can be while \nbalancing energy concerns with technological and economic effects. That \nbalancing is required by the law. I fully expect NHTSA to proceed with \nthe intent of the law to fully consider all those factors, and this \namendment ensures they do so.\n  In supporting this amendment, I maintain the position that it is my \njob to ensure that the agency responsible for setting fuel economy be \nallowed to do its job. I expect them to be fair and neutral in that \nprocess, and I will work with interested Wisconsinites to ensure that \ntheir views are represented and that the regulatory process proceeds in \na fair and reasonable manner toward whatever conclusions the merits \nwill support.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, as co-chairman of the Senate Auto \nCaucus, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, Senator Levin and \nSenator Bond, in offering this CAFE standards amendment to the energy \nbill. This is truly an important issue; one that impacts upon our \nNation's economy, our environment and the safety of the traveling \npublic.\n  There is no doubt that each of us wants the automobile industry to \nmake cars, trucks, SUVs and minivans that are as energy efficient as \npossible.\n\n[[Page S1823]]\n\nNot only is it good for the environment, it also means more money in \nthe pocket of the American consumer because they spend less at the gas \npump.\n  However, I am deeply concerned that the extreme Corporate Average \nFuel Economy (CAFE) standard included in the pending energy bill will \nhave a devastating effect on public safety, as well as put a severe \ncrimp in the manufacturing base of my state of Ohio.\n  For the first time in American history, new vehicle sales of trucks, \nSUVs and minivans in 2001 outpaced the sale of automobiles. This \nremarkable result can be attributed to a number of factors, but one \nreason that is often cited is the fact that these vehicles are seen as \nsafer.\n  Indeed, when asked why they bought their particular vehicle, truck, \nSUV and minivan owners overwhelmingly stated that they simply felt \nsafer than they would have in a regular sedan or compact car.\n  Overall, Mr. President, our roadways are safer. In fact, safety \nstatistics show that the numbers of automobile fatalities are at \nhistoric lows while total vehicle highway miles traveled has risen. \nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \n(NHTSA), there were 1.5 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles \ntraveled in 2000, while in 1999, the rate was 1.6 per 100 million \nvehicle miles traveled. Ten years earlier, in 1990, the rate was 2.1 \nper 100 million vehicle miles traveled. Part of the reason traffic \nfatality rates have continued to drop can be attributed to the fact \nthat vehicles are being made safer.\n  However, some in this body are indirectly proposing that we give up \nthe safety accomplishments we have attained in order to achieve an \narbitrary fuel efficiency standard for automobile vehicles.\n  As my colleagues know, the provision included in the energy bill sets \nthe CAFE standard at a combined fleet average of 35 miles per gallon by \n2015.\n  Under current law, light truck fleets and passenger cars make up two \nseparate fleet distinctions with different mile-per-gallon requirements \nfor each. The existence of two separate fleets recognizes that \npassenger cars and light trucks are different vehicles that require \ndifferent capabilities. However, the enactment of a combined fleet \naverage would ignore this distinction.\n  We also need to ask what the scientific basis is for the 35 mile-per-\ngallon threshold? What rational explanation is there for the magic \nnumber ``35,'' or was that number simply fabricated?\n  To achieve this standard, the auto industry would have to modify \ntheir manufacturing base, and produce an automotive fleet that will in \nall likelihood require greater use of lighter materials. Lighter \nmaterials will definitely help increase fuel efficiency, however, it \nwill also make those automobiles less safe.\n  The provision in the bill also will be damaging to auto manufacturers \nthat produce a large number of light trucks because a combined fleet \naverage will factor in both the fuel efficiency averages of passenger \ncars and light trucks by a manufacturer.\n  And, because truck, SUV and minivan demand is not expected to \ndecrease anytime soon, automakers that are meeting this demand will \neither have to manufacture and sell a high-gas mileage vehicle that \nlikely does not exist now, or cut the production of the trucks, the \nSUVs and the minivans that American consumers want. This will only \nincrease prices for the safe vehicles America wants.\n  Ohio is the number two automotive manufacturing state in America, \nemploying more than 630,000 people either directly or indirectly. I've \nheard from a number of these men and women whose livelihood depends on \nthe auto industry and who are frankly very worried about their future. \nI have met with members of the United Auto Workers, and executives from \nthe major automobile manufacturers about the CAFE proposal and there is \ngenuine concern that the provision in the bill could cause a serious \ndisruption in the auto industry resulting in the loss of tens of \nthousands of jobs across the Nation.\n  The Levin-Bond-Voinovich amendment is a rational proposal that will \nkeep workers both in Ohio and nationwide working, allowing these men \nand women to continue to take care of their families and educate their \nchildren while also encouraging greater fuel efficiency and safer \nvehicles.\n  Our amendment calls for the Department of Transportation to increase \nfuel economy standards based on the following factors:\n  The need to conserve energy;\n  Economic practicability;\n  The effect of other government motor vehicle standards on fuel \neconomy;\n  The desirability of reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil;\n  The effect on motor vehicle safety;\n  The effects of increased fuel economy on air quality;\n  The adverse effects of increased fuel economy standards on the \nrelative competitiveness of manufacturers;\n  The effect on U.S. employment;\n  The cost and lead-time required for introduction of new technologies;\n  The potential for advanced technology vehicles (such as hybrid and \nfuel cell vehicles) to contribute to significant fuel usage savings;\n  The effect of near-term expenditures required to meet increased fuel \neconomy standards on the resources available to develop advanced \ntechnology;\n  Technological feasibility; and\n  The report of the National Research Council, entitled ``Effectiveness \nand Impact of Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards,'' issued in \nJanuary 2002.\n  I believe this is a much more responsible approach than picking a \nnumber arbitrarily--literally, it seems, out of thin air.\n  Our amendment also requires that the Department of Transportation \ncomplete the rulemaking process that would increase fuel efficiency \nstandards within 15 months for light trucks, and 24 months for \npassenger cars. If the Administration doesn't act within the required \ntimeframe, Congress will act, under expedited procedures, to pass \nlegislation mandating an increase in fuel economy standards consistent \nwith the same criteria that the Administration must consider.\n  The amendment will also increase the market for alternative powered \nand hybrid vehicles by mandating that the federal government, where \nfeasible, purchase alternative powered and hybrid vehicles.\n  This mandate is nothing new. The federal government, under the Energy \nPolicy Act of 1992, is already required to maintain a covered fleet of \n75 percent of alternative fuel vehicles. This amendment will simply \nincrease the amount to 85 percent for covered fleets and require the \npurchase of hybrid vehicles for fleets that currently are not covered. \nThere are waivers that allow the federal government to purchase \ntraditional fueled vehicles where necessary.\n  However, I believe that this guaranteed market will encourage the \nauto industry to increase their investment in research and development \nwith an eye towards making alternative fuel and hybrid vehicles more \naffordable, available and commercially appealing to the average \nconsumer.\n  Additionally, a federal fleet of alternative fuel and hybrid vehicles \nwill result in an improved infrastructure for these vehicles and \nencourage a commercial growth in such infrastructure as well.\n  Our amendment will not cause shifting within the auto manufacturing \nindustry. It does not pretend that Congress has the scientific \nexpertise to determine the best mile-per-gallon increase for both light \ntrucks and passenger cars, a number which currently would unfairly \npunish the auto companies and auto workers who build what consumers \nwant--larger cars and trucks.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our amendment. It meets our \nenvironmental, safety and economic needs in a balanced and responsible \nway, contributing to the continued and needed harmonization of our \nenergy and environmental policies.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want to take some time to explain to my \nfriends the importance of the CAFE debate to the people of Oklahoma.\n  Today most of the people in Oklahoma buy light trucks, sports utility \nvehicles, and minivans. They are what you see on the road in Oklahoma. \nIn fact, they are what Americans all over the country are buying.\n  Last year national sales of light trucks, sports utility vehicles and \nminivans outpaced cars for the first time, and since 9-11 there has \nbeen a\n\n[[Page S1824]]\n\nspike in sales of these vehicles. We have hard data showing us that \nthis increase is due to Americans' desire for safety, comfort, and \nutility.\n  In the 2001 Customer Satisfaction Study, Maritz Marketing Research, \nInc. surveyed 83,196 new vehicle buyers. When asked what vehicle \nattributes were ``Extremely Important'' in their purchase decision, gas \nmileage ranked 15th on car buyers' lists, behind such things are \nreliability, value for the money, durability, and safety features. 43 \npercent rated gas mileage as ``extremely important'' vs. 70.6 percent \nfor reliability, 59.3 percent of value, 59.2 percent for durability, \nand 57.3 percent for safety features.\n  When asked the same question, truck, SUV, and full-size van owners \nranked gas mileage 32nd on their list of ``extremely important'' items, \nbelow safety features, interior roominess, passenger seating, and cargo \nspace, among others. 29.8 percent rated gas mileage as ``extremely \nimportant'' vs. 51.4 percent for safety features, 41.9 percent for \ninterior roominess, 38 percent for passenger seating, and 36.8 percent \nfor cargo space.\n  A governmental mandate flies in the face of Americans' desire for \nthese very attributes: safety, utility, and comfort. A mandate against \nthe will of the American people is not the way we do things in \ngovernment of the people, by the people and for the people.\n  As far as jobs and economics, a typical assessment comes from Dr. \nRobert W. Crandall, Senior Fellow in the economic study program at the \nBrookings Institution notes that the current proposal would cost the \nUnited States something like $17 or $18 billion a year in lost consumer \nsurplus. This loss of jobs and damage to our economy is unacceptable \nwhen this mandate will also cost lives and fly in the face of \nAmericans' free choice of vehicles.\n  On safety, we have the scientific analyses of our National Academy of \nScience and our National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as well \nas numerous analysts.\n  For example, in 1972, Ralph Nader and Clarence Ditlow published a \nbook entitled Small on Safety. Page after page has such statements as, \n``Small size and light weight impose inherent limitations on the degree \nof safety that can be built into a vehicle.''\n  After all is said and done, drivers and passengers are safer and do \nbetter in crashes about 98 percent of the time when vehicle weight is \ngreater. A Federal Government mandate to cut the weight of vehicles is \ngoing to cost lives. I want safe Oklahomans and therefore oppose CAFE \nmandates.\n  The following groups oppose the Kerry/McCain CAFE provisions because \nthey are bad for safety, utility, performance, consumer choice, and \njobs:\n  United Auto Workers; U.S. Chamber of Commerce; National Automobile \nDealers Associations; American Iron and Steel Institute; Association of \nAmerican Railroads; National Association of Manufacturers; American \nHighway Users Alliance; Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers; American \nFarm Bureau Federation; Union Pacific.\n  Competitive Enterprise Institute; American International Automobile \nDealers Association; Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association; \nOriginal Equipment Suppliers Association; Delphi Automotive Systems; \nAutomotive Coalition for Traffic Safety; National Marine Manufacturers \nAssociation.\n  Small Business Survival Committee; National Cattlemen's Beef \nAssociation; American Horse Council; American Recreation Coalition; \nAssociated General Contractors of America; Automotive Coalition for \nTraffic Safety; Coalitions for America; Coalition for Vehicle Choice; \nNational Association of Plumbing, Heating and Cooling.\n  General Motors; Ford Motor Company; Daimler Chrysler; Toyota; Nissan, \nVolkswagen; BMW; Mazda; Fiat; Isuzu; Mitsubishi Motors; Porsche; Volvo; \nNational Association of RV Parks and Campgrounds.\n  National Grange; National Truck Equipment Association; Recreation \nVehicle Industry Association; Specialty Equipment Market Association; \nNational Four Wheel Drive Association; Business Round Table; AFL/CIO.\n  Please join me in supporting the compromise crafted by Senators Levin \nand Bond.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \ndisappointment with the Senate's inability to act on the important \nissue of corporate average fuel economy standards for our Nation's \nvehicles. Addressing the transportation sector's consumption of fossil \nfuels is an integral part of any energy policy designed to meet the \nneeds of our 21st century economy.\n  I continue to believe that raising CAFE standards is absolutely \ncritical in promoting more efficient fuel use--thus weening this nation \nfrom its dependence on foreign oil--while continuing to meet our \ntransportation needs. At the same time, CAFE standards promise \nenvironmental benefits and savings for consumers. Despite what some in \nindustry might suggest--suggestions that harken back to Congress' first \ndebate on CAFE in 1975, when some claimed the current standards would \nrender this Nation's auto manufacturers extinct--I believe we have the \ntechnologies and the American ingenuity necessary to meet the goals set \nout by tougher CAFE standards.\n  Transportation accounts for 67 percent of U.S. oil consumption and \none-third of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Clearly, improving the \nefficiency of the U.S. vehicle fleet would serve the public interest by \nreducing individuals' exposure to fluctuations in oil prices and \nemitting fewer of climate changing greenhouse gases.\n  To me, the numbers suggest a very clear choice.\n  If my colleagues truly wanted to take the environmentally and \neconomically responsible vote--to mitigate our exposure to foreign oil \nand economically devastating price shocks--they would have acted today \nto increase our fuel efficiency standards.\n  I believe many in this Chamber agree on the theoretical goals of this \nbill--increased energy independence, diversification or our energy \nresources and improving the energy efficiency of our economy. But my \ncolleagues must realize that to meet these goals we must address both \nsupply-side and demand-side of the equation. And we cannot wait to take \naction.\n  Simply cranking up oil production and ignoring the efficiencies at \nour fingertips will ensure that we will be in the same place 20 years \nfrom now--or worse yet, even more dependent on foreign sources of oil.\n  Estimates suggest that if the status quo is maintained, our \ndependence will grow from 51 percent today, to 64 percent in 2020. If \nthe status quo is maintained, we will be asking ourselves the same \nquestions about economic and energy security as we are asking ourselves \ntoday.\n  I believe that the CAFE provision proposed by Senator Kerry and \nSenator McCain, like its predecessor in 1975, would have gone a long \nway toward meeting the multiple goals of the overall energy bill. In \naddition to the energy security and environmental benefits I've already \nmentioned, it would have protected consumers against disruptions in oil \nsupplies that increase the cost of a gallon of gasoline.\n  The current CAFE standard--which has saved 14 percent of fuel \nconsumption from what it would have been without CAFE--has not been \nupdated in 20 years. By increasing fuel economy standards, consumers \nwould travel farther on a gallon of gasoline than ever before. Since \nthe introduction of the first CAFE standards in 1975, vehicle operating \nexpenses have been halved, mostly due to decreased expenditures on gas \nand oil.\n  Increasing fuel efficiency has a second impact, which is to help to \nstimulate the American economy by keeping dollars at home. At present, \nAmericans spend over $300 million dollars per day on foreign oil. By \nreducing how much of that oil we consume, Americans save billions of \ndollars a year at the gas pump. This money would be available for \nreinvestment in our own economy and to help improve the lives of \nAmerican families.\n  Opponents of CAFE standards have argued that increased fuel \nefficiency will result in decreased vehicle safety. To the contrary, \nprovisions to maintain vehicle safety are written directly into the \nlanguage. Furthermore, by bringing SUVs and light trucks under the \nrubric of the CAFE standard, CAFE will without question save lives.\n  Opponents also argued that CAFE standards hurt the American auto \nindustry and American workers.\n\n[[Page S1825]]\n\n  In reality, a high fuel economy standard would put existing \ntechnologies into vehicles and spur technological innovation--something \nin which American industry is a proud leader. The CAFE proposal \nprovided for gradual improvement in fuel economy over time, allowing \nmanufacturers the opportunity to retool processes and redesign product \nlines over time. Consumer fuel savings and technological innovation \nwill lead to an infusion of capital in local economies and investments \nin the auto industry, making U.S. vehicles competitive in a global \nmarket and creating--not destroying--jobs.\n  The first time around, CAFE was created in response to rising oil \nprices. Today, volatility in the oil market continues to be a concern, \nalong with our energy security and the environmental impact of fossil \nfuel emissions. We had before us an opportunity to alleviate threats to \nour national energy and economic security posed by foreign oil \ndependence, while protecting our environment and taking a positive step \nin the battle to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Now is the time to \nmake these changes.\n  I thank Senator Kerry and Senator McCain for their leadership on this \nissue. I want to add that I agree with my colleague from the Energy \nCommittee, Senator Carper, who has suggested that we should--we must--\nreturn to the issue of CAFE standards before we finish our work on this \nbill. Hopefully, we will all come to our senses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The minority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know there is a limited amount of time \navailable, and it has been equally divided, so I would like to speak \nbriefly and use leader time so it will not count against the time that \nhas been reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in very passionate support of the \nLevin-Bond amendment. I know very good work has been done on this \namendment, and it is based on sound science and solid data. It seems to \nme that is the way to go instead of just picking a number out of the \nsky, whether it is 32 or 35 or 37 or moving the years up or down. It \nseems to me it would be wiser to have decisions about the miles-per-\ngallon requirements done in a responsible way, having been studied by \nthe proper entity and based on science and solid data.\n  Of course, the organization to do that is NHTSA. They have the \nexpertise to analyze the numbers and consider all that should be \ninvolved here: the jobs that might be affected, technology, how soon \nthis improved fuel efficiency could be obtained, and safety. Safety is \na big issue.\n  I heard Senator Mikulski from Maryland on the radio this morning \ntalking about her concerns about the safety issue, and that was the \npoint she emphasized. That is certainly understandable.\n  The Levin-Bond amendment would be what we would do instead of the \nKerry provision which adversely affects employment, safety, and \nconsumer choice. I think the Levin-Bond amendment is a much wiser way \nto proceed.\n  The National Academy of Sciences CAFE report declared there will be \nmore deaths and injuries if fuel economy standards are raised too fast \nwithout proper consideration given to how that is going to be done and \nwhat impact it might cause.\n  This amendment, the Levin-Bond amendment, is supported by labor, the \nUAW, the Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO, the National Association of \nManufacturers, the Farm Bureau, automobile dealers, and over 40 other \norganizations, but, more importantly, by real people in the real world, \npeople who do worry about safety, people who do have needs for a van or \nan SUV or a pickup truck who refuse to be relegated to an automobile \nsuch as the one shown in this picture. This type of car may be fine in \nBoston or Chicago, but it is not fine in Lucedale, MS, or Des Moines, \nIA, or a lot of other places around this country. People have to drive \nlong distances. They have large families.\n  In my case, when I move my family around now, I have a choice. I have \na bigger automobile, an SUV. I worry about safety. And I worry about \nstrapping in the grandchildren properly, making sure they are going to \nbe safe. And I even worry about making sure that third seat is secured \nproperly.\n  I have a choice. I either can take two vehicles, the SUV or the van--\none of them being a bigger one--or I can take three automobiles. How \nmuch gas have you saved?\n  This whole area astounds me. Let's talk about what real people do \nwhen they have a choice. After all, this is still America. We should be \nable to make our choices. We should not have the Federal Government \nsaying you are going to drive the purple people eater shown here. I am \nnot picking on this manufacturer. In fact, purposely I wanted to have a \ncar that is hard to identify. This is basically in Europe. And when I \nwas over there, I saw these little cars. I saw people pick them up and \nset them over into parking spaces. I also was trying to figure out how \nI was going to get my 6 foot 2\\1/2\\ inch frame in this automobile.\n  So what do real people do when they have a choice in America? Well, \nthe 10 most fuel-efficient cars account for only 1.5 percent of \nautomobiles sales. Americans value fuel economy, but it ranks far \nbehind other very important competing values, such as safety, comfort, \nutility, and performance.\n  A recent survey of attributes consumers look for when buying a new \nautomobile found that fuel economy ranks 25th out of the 26 vehicle \nattributes they were looking for.\n  Automobile makers produce 50 different automobiles that get 30 miles \nper gallon or better. Anybody can go to a dealer today if they want to \nand drive home a very fuel-efficient automobile, but small cars make up \nonly 14 percent of the market.\n  Today's light truck gets better gas mileage than a subcompact car \nfrom the 1970s. Progress is being made. I do pay attention to it. The \nSUV I own and drive in the Washington, DC, area is the Honda SUV. It is \nactually my wife's car. I have to confess that because I always insist \non still driving an American-made automobile. But a lot of these \nautomobiles now are made by Honda and Nissan and Hyundai and Toyota. \nThey are international companies, as are our domestic companies. So are \nall these other companies.\n  I do pay some attention to what I choose to drive and the fuel \nefficiency that it gets in the District of Columbia.\n  There also is no magic technology. I think progress is being made. \nBut if you had the technology to go immediately to an automobile that \ngot this fuel efficiency number picked out of the sky without \nsacrificing a lot of other very important factors, such as safety and \ncomfort and the needs of the consumers, you would do that.\n  There are those who say technology is going to make it possible for \nus to have much more fuel efficiency without reducing the waste and \nsize of the automobile. I have faith in American technology. I think we \nwill get there. We are headed there. That option will be there. But I \nstill don't understand why we should be trying to mandate the laws of \nphysics and require that these things happen.\n  I heard one of the Senators the other day saying that the goal is to \nuse less foreign oil. I agree with that. This is a national security \nquestion. That is why this bill is important. I have another \nalternative. While we do want to encourage conservation and look at \nalternative fuels, I also don't want us to take actions that basically \nmandate that in America you have to use less. We have a lot of domestic \noil that we can use, natural gas, hydroelectricity, nuclear. We have to \nhave more, not just less.\n  If we conserve and produce more, America can continue to grow. That \nis what we want. We want a growing economy. If you don't have the \nenergy supply, you are not going to have the economic development you \nwant.\n\n  CAFE standards have not reduced imported oil. We started to put these \nstandards in place back in the 1970s. Yet as the efficiency has gotten \nbetter, the use of foreign oil has not gone down. It has been steadily \ngoing up. Now we are dependents for 59 percent of our energy needs \nsupplied by foreign oil. That is a dangerous concept. We should produce \nmore here while we are also conserving.\n  I personally think the CAFE program is a flawed program. I don't \nthink we\n\n[[Page S1826]]\n\nought to be issuing these mandates. I urge my colleagues to vote for \nthe Levin-Bond approach. It is the responsible way. It will be based on \nsomething done by an entity in the Government that has the \nresponsibility to get it done. I am not even sure right now what may be \noffered later on today, perhaps by Senators Kerry or McCain or others. \nIf we don't even know what they are going to offer, what science is it \nbased on?\n  I conclude by saying this is the responsible way to go. It will not \nignore the issue. It sets up a process based on science, capability, \ntechnology. It does take into consideration or will allow consideration \nof safety. And I don't want every American to have to drive this car.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Collins.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join several of my \ncolleagues in rising in support of increased fuel efficiency standards \nfor cars and trucks. Some people have tried to cast this argument as a \nchoice between trucks and better fuel economy. This is simply a false \nchoice. I am convinced that we can, with America's can-do attitude and \ntechnological know-how, provide safer, more efficient cars and trucks \nthat will go further on a gallon of gas and save consumers money at the \ngas pump. CAFE standards will give us better trucks and more money in \nour pockets.\n  OPEC's anticompetitive manipulations have driven the price of oil to \na 6-month high. If we don't increase CAFE standards, America will only \ngrow more and more dependent on foreign oil. Already we rely on foreign \noil for 60 percent of our supply. That is a dangerous dependency. How \nmuch further into OPEC's clutches do we have to let ourselves slide \nbefore we decide that there is another way, a better way? CAFE is the \nAmerican way of sending OPEC a message that we will not stand for their \nanticompetitive manipulative price increases.\n  Our proposal will save more than 1 million barrels of oil a day. It \nwill save billions of dollars for consumers. And it will do more to \nreduce our reliance on foreign oil than any other single measure before \nus.\n  I call on my colleagues to join me in supporting the proposal to \nincrease CAFE standards. This proposal is the right thing to do for the \nenvironment, for the economy, for consumers, and for America.\n  I commend Senators Kerry, Bingaman, McCain, and my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Snowe, for their efforts in coming up with an \nalternative approach.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes in opposition \nto the amendment.\n  The Republican leader was just urging us to consider sound science \nand sound data in making judgments on this issue. I recall several \nyears during which we passed in the Congress prohibitions against the \nadministration, through NHTSA, even considering a change in CAFE \nstandards. That doesn't seem particularly consistent to me with a \nreliance on sound science and sound data. The truth is, the Republican \nleader has set up a totally false choice. He has indicated the choice \nis between what we have now and, as he put it, this purple people eater \nthat he has pictured.\n  The reality is, the technology is there to keep the cars, the SUVs, \nthe vehicles we now drive and shift them to being much more fuel \nefficient. The real choice is in the SUV that the Senator from \nMassachusetts has a picture of, which Ford Motor Company indicates they \nare going to have on the market next year. They say it is the same \npower as before, the same convenience as before, the same room as \nbefore, but it uses half as much gas. That is the option. We just need \nto step up to giving that challenge to the car dealers.\n  When you look at why we are continuing to import more and more oil, \nit is very clear. The main reason is we have stalled out on improving \nefficiency in the motor vehicle sector.\n  This chart shows that, since 1989, there has been absolutely no \nimprovement. In fact, there has been a decline in the fuel efficiency \nof our overall fleet. So this amendment will take the teeth out of our \nefforts to improve efficiency. It should be rejected. I hope my \ncolleagues will do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, time \nis charged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes 20 seconds on the \nopposition side and 5 minutes 13 seconds on the proponents side.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Grassley and Hutchinson of \nArkansas and Allen be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Some people here believe Americans cannot be trusted to \nmake the right choice. In choosing between consumers and Government, I \nwill side with the consumers. I don't pretend to know what is best for \nthe 15 million Americans who are purchasing vehicles each year, but I \nprefer to listen to those who are actually in the business of selling \ncars and trucks. They tell me one consistent message: The Kerry \namendment is a job killer, a threat to the safety of friends and \nfamilies, a mandated market that eliminates consumer choice.\n  Now, 2,000 people a year, according to the National Academy of \nSciences, have been killed by lighter cars. I don't want to tell a mom \nin my State she should not get an SUV because Congress decided that \nwould be a bad choice. I just came from a news conference with Martha \nGodet, who explained last week that she wanted a minivan to carry her \ntwo preteen sons and one baby to various events. Her story in the \nnewspaper was countered by one of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle who said her proposal was ``nonsense.'' She extends an \ninvitation to that Senator to join her in a carpool to see how it would \nbe if they were in a subcompact or a Yugo. She said it would look like \na clown car if they were in a Yugo that managed to meet the fuel \nstandards in the Kerry amendment.\n  I am grateful for the support of the Missouri Soybean Association, \nCorn Growers, and the Farm Bureau. We appreciate the information on \nsafety from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National \nAssociation of Independent Insurers. The best way to get better mileage \nis through sound science and NHTSA.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask that I may speak for 1 minute.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield a minute to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bond-Levin \namendment. I believe the automobiles need to become more efficient; it \nis in our national interest. I think our leader referred to this car \npictured on the chart as the ``purple people eater.'' I think that is a \npretty good name.\n  I do not believe the Senate is in the best position to dictate how we \ndo this. When it comes to Congress dictating what kind of fuels we use \nin our vehicles, we fail miserably. We have about 15 different types of \nfuels we use in the country. It is at a significant cost. We don't even \naddress it in this bill. We have proven we are not very good chemists \nin the Congress. We are not very good automotive engineers either.\n  Congress should not randomly determine vehicle fuel mileage on a \nwhim. We should leave it to the experts who know what they are doing, \nand we will take into account safety and economic impact. The Bond-\nLevin amendment does that and leaves the decision to the experts. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes 12 seconds in opposition, \nand there are 2 minutes 1 second for the proponents.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the remainder of the time to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Let me share what this vote is now about. This vote is about whether \nor not we will keep any standard at all with respect to fuel \nefficiency. If the Bond-Levin amendment passes, there\n\n[[Page S1827]]\n\nwill be not only no standard whatsoever in place, there will be a \nprocess that will allow for delay into the far future. And there is a \nprovision in the Bond-Levin amendment which undoes the current safety \nstandards. There is no safety standard at all. In NHTSA, they ask to \nlook at it, but it undoes the current safety standard.\n  Mr. President, this is a question of whether or not we are going to \ndo what 88 percent of the people in America want us to do and only 9 \npercent are opposed to, and that is to save a significant amount of oil \nthat we import from the Persian Gulf, from countries that have the \nability to dictate to the United States the price in our future--\nwhether we will save that and simultaneously contribute to global \nwarming problems, as well as health in America.\n  There are two stories here. There is the lie and there is the truth. \nTo my right, that purple machine in the photograph is the lie. No \nAmerican will be forced to drive any different automobile. My wife \ndrives an SUV. She supports this effort because she knows she can still \ndrive an SUV that is efficient. Cars such as Suburbans are not even \nincluded in this measure.\n  We have seen advertisements suggesting that people will have to farm \nwith a subcompact car. How insulting is that to the intelligence of \nAmericans, who know they want more efficient cars? This doesn't even \ncover tractors. It doesn't even cover the basic trucks, the large \ntrucks in the country.\n  This is the most extraordinary expenditure of money in phony \nadvertisements to scare the American people that I have ever seen \nhere--perhaps since the tobacco debate. Here is the truth. This is Ford \nMotor Company's own advertisement. They advertise an SUV--a vehicle \nthat gives you all the room and power you want but uses half the \ngasoline. That is the Ford Motor Company advertisement that stands as a \nstark contrast to these extraordinary, ridiculous scare tactics.\n  My colleagues have been told that if we raise the CAFE standards, \nthat will harm safety. Let me read from the Chairman of the National \nAcademy of Sciences, from March 10 of this year. Paul Portney says:\n\n       This proposal of ours is roughly consistent with what the \n     academy identified as being technologically possible, \n     economically affordable, and consistent with the desire of \n     consumers for safety.\n\n  What safety organization in America supports the Bond-Levin proposal? \nNot one. Not the major safety organization, the Public Citizen Center \nfor Auto Safety; they support what we are trying to accomplish. The \nreason they support it is that there are no safety provisions \nwhatsoever in the Bond-Levin proposal. In our proposal, there is, \nhowever, an ability to live up to the safety standards.\n  You have heard the National Academy of Sciences report distorted \nagain and again. The update of that report, on which NHTSA has signed \noff, says you can build a car in America that is just as competent as \nany SUV today and provides safety.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 1 minute.\n  Mr. KERRY. They try to suggest that this is a jobs problem. The fact \nis that our workers in Detroit have the ability to build all the cars \nAmerica can buy that are just as large as the cars we have today but \nare more efficient. What they need is an auto industry that asks them \nto do it, that gives them the cars that are so designed. It is \nextraordinary that my colleagues have so little confidence in the \nability of the American worker and American ingenuity to provide cars \nthat are going to be competitive well into the future with the Japanese \nand Germans.\n  I think we should celebrate the capacity of the American worker, and \nthat is what we are asking people to do. Every year, there has been an \nopportunity to delay, to obfuscate. The opponents have chosen to do it. \nThe only people who support Bond-Levin are those who support the \nspecific automobile interests, the Big Three, people who work there--\nnot the safety people, not consumers, not the environmental interests \nof the country.\n  Generally speaking, this is a pattern of delay and obfuscation. We \nwill have an opportunity after this vote to vote on the Kerry-McCain \nalternative that reduces the level even further. I ask my colleagues to \nremember that there is no CAFE requirement at all in Bond-Levin. We \nwill have no standard whatsoever. We will have years of lawsuits and \nyears of delay. It is one more step in Detroit's effort to prevent us \nfrom having an opportunity to have cars that are competitive and meet \nthe needs of the future.\n\n  I retain the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time remains in support of the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan controls 2 minutes \nand 1 second, and the time of the Senator from Massachusetts has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 30 seconds to Senator Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this is not about the Ford Escape. We \nare pleased the auto industry is moving forward. The CAFE number does \nnot reflect the fuel economy improvements of one particular vehicle. It \nis a fleet average. GM has from 2000 to 2001 improved fuel efficiency \nfor eight different vehicles, and their CAFE number did not change.\n  It is a system that does not work. It is crazy. It is discriminatory \nagainst the American auto industry. I encourage a vote for this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts said the \namendment before us would eliminate existing safety standards. That is \nflat out wrong. He summarized a quote from one member of the National \nAcademy of Sciences. I want to read one line from the National Academy \nof Sciences on the exact point:\n\n       Equal treatment of equivalent vehicles made by different \n     manufacturers is a requirement of equity. The current CAFE \n     standards fail that test.\n\n  I have much more confidence in the workers of this country and their \nrepresentatives than my friend from Massachusetts. They strongly oppose \nthis amendment. The UAW favored CAFE when it first came into existence. \nThey favored CAFE. They strongly oppose the Kerry language because it \ndiscriminates against equally efficient vehicles made in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 10 seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan. It is not \nfair to say there are no safety standards. The Levin-Bond amendment \nrequires safety be considered in setting the standards. There will be \nstandards.\n  I have just come from a press conference with Diane Steed, former \nNHTSA Director, speaking on behalf of the National Safety Council. The \nNational Safety Council is extremely concerned about the Kerry proposal \nand its likelihood to kill more people. Therefore, I urge support of \nthe Levin-Bond amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Voinovich be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  All time has expired. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2997.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Did the Chair add Senator Voinovich as a cosponsor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair did.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 62, nays 38, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 47 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--62\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n\n[[Page S1828]]\n\n\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--38\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Cantwell\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Leahy\n     Lieberman\n     McCain\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 2997) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nGeorgia is to be recognized to offer an amendment on which there will \nbe 10 minutes of debate.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2998\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I call up an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Miller], for himself, Mr. \n     Gramm, and Mr. Hutchinson, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2998.\n\n  Mr. MILLER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the increase of the average fuel economy standard \n                           for pickup trucks)\n\n       On page 177, before line 1, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 811. AVERAGE FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS FOR PICKUP TRUCKS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 32902(a) of title 49, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after the after ``Automobiles.--\n     ''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(2) The average fuel economy standard for pickup trucks \n     manufactured by a manufacturer in a model year after model \n     year 2004 shall be no higher than 20.7 miles per gallon. No \n     average fuel economy standard prescribed under another \n     provision of this section shall apply to pickup trucks.''.\n       (b) Definition Of Pickup Truck.--Section 32901(a) of such \n     title is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(17) `pickup truck' has the meaning given that term in \n     regulations prescribed by the Secretary for the \n     administration of this chapter, as in effect on January 1, \n     2002, except that such term shall also include any additional \n     vehicle that the Secretary defines as a pickup truck in \n     regulations prescribed for the administration of this chapter \n     after such date.''.\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of the Miller-Gramm-Hutchinson of Arkansas amendment to protect \npickup trucks.\n  Our amendment is very simple. In fact, I cannot remember seeing a \nmore simple amendment ever offered on the floor of the Senate. It is \neasy for all of you to understand. And I will tell you something else \nthat is important, it is easy for the folks back home to understand.\n  Pickups are now required to meet a standard of 20.7 miles per gallon. \nThis amendment simply says that standard cannot be increased. The only \nthing greater than its simplicity is its fairness. We absolutely should \nnot impose an undue safety risk and extra cost of higher CAFE standards \non our farmers or on our rural families or on our carpenters, plumbers, \npainters, electricians--those small businesses that rely so heavily on \nthe pickup that keeps our Nation moving.\n  These are the hard-working people with calloused hands who build our \nhomes and work our farms. They are the forgotten Americans who work \nfrom dawn to dark and then turn on the headlights of their pickup so \nthey can see to work another hour.\n  They never ask us for anything they have not earned. All too often in \nthis great citadel of the people we turn our backs on these folks. They \nhave no lobbyists. They don't have a single one; pickup pops are not \norganized. No soft money comes from them, and not much hard money. They \nare too busy working. As the pickup goes, so goes the very heart and \nmuscle of this great country.\n  If you apply higher CAFE standards to pickups, you will make them \nunaffordable for some and you will make them unsafe for all. A ``yes'' \nvote is a vote for the working man. A ``yes'' vote is a vote for rural \nAmerica. A ``no'' vote is a vote against the working man. A ``no'' vote \nis a vote against rural America.\n  In 1 year alone, the year before last, working people in this country \nbought 3,180,000 pickup trucks in 29 of our States. Pickups account for \nbetween 20 percent and 37.4 percent of all registered vehicles. Folks \nacross this country buy pickups, not just because they are affordable \nand not just because they are safe. They also buy them because they \nhave to have them. They have to have them to do their work. Pickups are \nas essential to the carpenter as his hammer; as essential to the \npainter as his paintbrush.\n  So we must leave this American workhorse, the pickup truck, alone. \nDon't pick on the pickup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under the authority of Senator Daschle, I \nyield 5 additional minutes to Senator Bingaman in opposition to this \namendment. That will be a total of 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I do not object. I think I have 5 minutes \nreserved to speak on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes. Is there objection \nto the unanimous consent request? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first of all, I congratulate my dear \ncolleague from Georgia. I thank him for his leadership on this issue. I \nsay to him I am very happy again to be married up together, promoting \nthe interests of the people who do the work and pay the taxes and pull \nthe wagon in America.\n  If you want to know how far out of touch with reality this Congress \nis, all you have to do is look at this CAFE standard debate. The \nAmerican people want to be safe in their cars and trucks, and they have \nwork to do. It is not uncommon in my State for people to get up in \nCorsicana at 4:30 in the morning, get in their pickup, drive to Dallas, \nwork all day and work that pickup all day until 6 or 7 o'clock at night \nand then drive that pickup back to Corsicana. Every morning in small \ntowns all over this country, people who work for a living and get their \nhands dirty in the process use their pickups for transportation and to \nmake a living. There are not good substitutes.\n  Our colleagues tell us: Oh, there are substitutes. We can have a \nsubstitute for the pickup. You don't need that big Dodge. You don't \nneed that Chevrolet. You don't need that Ford. You don't need that \nToyota pickup. They have an alternative. But they don't live in Mexia. \nThey don't carry around tools. They are not hauling lumber. They are \nnot getting their hands dirty working for a living, and they are \ntotally and absolutely out of touch with the people who do the work in \nthis country. Our amendment simply says: Leave pickup trucks alone.\n  Try as I may to understand people who have a different mindset than I \ndo--and I know many of my views are hopelessly out of fashion--but try \nas I do to understand it, sometimes I cannot. We will impose billions \nof dollars of cost on little towns to try to change arsenic standards \nfor drinking water based on a projection of a very small effect on the \nhealth and lives of Americans. But, yet, when the National Academy of \nSciences, the most prestigious scientific body on the face of the \nEarth, concludes that the existing CAFE standards may be costing as \nmany as 3,600 lives a year--we are not talking about the new standards, \nwe are talking about the old standards--the people who go absolutely \nballistic over these little towns are nowhere to be seen. If Fallon, \nNV, has arsenic in its drinking water, and if the mayor\n\n[[Page S1829]]\n\nand his children and grandchildren have been drinking it for years with \nno appreciable effect or no effect, we have no doubt in our mind about \nimposing those costs because we are so concerned about an effect on \npeople. Yet, when hundreds of times as many people are killed by these \nCAFE standards, we act as if that is all right because fuel efficiency \nis a good goal.\n\n  I don't know a better goal than to have people drive pickups. I don't \nknow any more reliable Americans than those who drive pickups. I don't \nknow people who more deserve good government than people who drive \npickups. So this amendment is critically important.\n  Finally, if anybody cares about the automobile industry, let me \nremind my colleagues that we are trying to get out of a slowdown, a \nminor recession. We have just had the administration impose tariffs up \nto 30 percent on steel and while many Members of Congress support that, \nI do not. This action means money will be taken right out of the profit \nmargin of American automobile producers because the Germans and the \nJapanese are not going to pay these higher prices for steel.\n  If we come in now with these new CAFE standards on big-selling items \nsuch as pickups, this will further hurt automobile manufacturers and \ntheir workers. In my State, pickups are the largest selling vehicles. \nIf you take trucks in general, trucks in general outsell cars in Texas. \nMy guess is that is true in most of your States.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this bipartisan effort on behalf of \npeople who drive and use pickups--people who do the work and make \nAmerica work, and who deserve to be represented on the floor of the \nSenate. I am proud that Senator Miller has seen the day that they are \nrepresented.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time remains for the \nproponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no additional time except for the \ntime remaining to the Senator from Georgia, who has 41 seconds \nremaining.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I yield 41 seconds to the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Georgia.\n  For those of you who have ever driven a pickup and gotten stuck in \nthe snow, you need a four-wheel-drive pickup to get out. We would not \nhave been able to develop the Trans-Alaska Pipeline without the U.S.-\nmade pickup. It has the heavy undercarriage that can stand the gravel \nroads. The Senator from Texas is quite correct. The rest of the country \nlives on the pickup, and the transportation is used as part of your \ntoolbag. You get your tools in it, you go out to work, and you get a \njob done. There is simply no other way you are going to accomplish \nthis.\n  I think the Senator from Georgia in his reference to what is in this \namendment--automakers make more fuel-efficient pickups--there is \nnothing in this amendment that would prevent that. The reality is a \npickup is a heavy piece of equipment that is designed to do a job. We \nshould support the amendment of the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time do we have in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes, and then I \nwill yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Let me put this in perspective. We just had an amendment agreed to on \nthe Senate floor which essentially says that we in the Congress are not \ngoing to specify what the corporate average fuel efficiency or economy \nnumber ought to be; that it ought to be left up to NHTSA, the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration, to make those decisions.\n  The Republican leader came to the floor and said we should do this \nbecause clearly we need to be sure that the decision is made on the \nbasis of sound science and solid data. Those were the two phrases he \nkept using--sound science and solid data.\n  The Senator from Michigan continually referred to the fact that we \nshould not adopt some arbitrary number; that is totally contrary to \ncommon sense. Now we have an amendment by my good friend the Senator \nfrom Georgia which says let us make it permanent law--that beginning 2 \nyears from now with model year 2004 and after, for all pickups, it is \nprohibited for NHTSA or anyone else to impose a fuel efficiency \nstandard in excess of what has been the standard for many years, 20.7 \nmiles per gallon.\n  The last amendment said that NHTSA would make the decision. This \namendment takes that away and says we are making the decision. It will \nbe 20.7 miles per gallon on pickups starting in 2004, and from then on \nit is permanent law. I don't think we can have it both ways. If we know \nbest, then fine, we shouldn't have adopted the last amendment. If NHTSA \nknows best, then we shouldn't adopt this amendment.\n  I understand where the votes are. I understand that everyone wants to \nwrap themselves in the flag of the pickup pops and indicate that they \ndon't want to pick on pickups. I understand all that rhetoric.\n  I have a lot of pickups in my State. But I don't see why people who \ndrive pickups should be required to be buying vehicles that are less \nfuel efficient than the rest of the population. The truth is these \npeople who work so hard and have callused hands and are driving pickups \ndon't want to have to pay more at the gas pump than anyone else. And \nthis amendment essentially will ensure that they have to pay more from \nnow on. They may get a very fuel-inefficient pickup, but every time \nthey go in to fill up, they are going to be paying more because of this \namendment, if it is agreed to.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for 2 minutes, and \nthen yield 1 minute to Senator Levin from Michigan.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. With the last \nvote, we threw in the towel on fuel efficiency. We said this Congress \nis incapable of requiring the automobile manufacturers to make a more \nfuel-efficient car so that America could have energy security and \nenergy independence. We gave up on it. We turned it over to NHTSA and \nsaid: Study it, look at it, and we will get back to you.\n  Now, with this amendment, we are saying we are going to exempt pickup \ntrucks forever and that 20.7 miles a gallon is all we will ever ask of \nthem. We will not ask Detroit to make a pickup truck that is more fuel \nefficient. And the argument has been made that it is unfair, that it is \nunpatriotic, that it is impossible to ask the drivers of pickup trucks \nacross America to ask for a more fuel-efficient vehicle--even 1 more \nmile per gallon.\n  Let me tell you what is also unfair. It is unfair to ask the men and \nwomen in uniform in the United States to risk their lives in a war in \nthe Middle East to fight to preserve more imported fuel to fuel these \nvehicles on the highways. These hard-working farmers and ranchers and \nblue-collar men and women who drive these pickup trucks have kids who \nmay be forced to serve in the military to fight a war because of our \ndependence on Middle East oil.\n  With the last vote, we bowed down to the special interests on fuel \nefficiency. And I want to tell you that as a result of it, we are going \nto continue to bow down to OPEC for decades to come. That is not in the \nbest interests of people who drive cars and pickup trucks in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time to the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute fifteen seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will split that time evenly with my colleague from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. President, we have decided to refer to NHTSA for the next 15 \nmonths the complicated question of whether or not we ought to increase \nCAFE on what vehicles and by what amounts. This amendment runs contrary \nto what we just agreed to.\n  I could not disagree more with our friend from Illinois when he says \nwe threw in the towel in terms of increasing CAFE with this last \namendment.\n\n[[Page S1830]]\n\n That was my amendment. We specifically said we are going to increase \nit, but we are going to do it in a rational and responsible way, \nconsidering all the criteria which should be considered. We should not \nadopt the standard on this floor. The Miller amendment, I am afraid, \ndoes that for one particular type of vehicle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this amendment.\n  CAFE relates to fleet-wide averages. If we take out pickup trucks, we \nput more pressure on fuel efficiency standards for SUVs and minivans. I \nhope we will instead use the last amendment as the way that we will \napproach vehicle fuel efficiency and that we will not pit our farmers \nagainst our soccer moms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be made a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Miller amendment, No. 2998.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2999\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], for himself and \n     Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 2999.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. KERRY. On behalf of Senator McCain and myself, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the amendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few moments about \nwhere we now find ourselves. I was talking with the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan, who won a significant vote by the Senate a \nlittle while ago with respect to, instead of having the Senate set a \nstandard, sending the CAFE standard to NHTSA and asking NHTSA to do so \nwithin a specified period of time. I understand the dynamics, but may I \nsay there is an incredible schizophrenia in what the Senate has done in \nthese two votes, because on the one hand the minority leader and many \nof our colleagues came to the floor to argue that the Senate doesn't \nhave the ability--we don't have the science, the information, and we \ndon't have enough capacity to make a determination about how the \noverall fleet ought to be determined. Then, of course, with the \namendment of the occupant of the chair, the Senate decided all of that \ngoes out the window; we do that by exempting pickup trucks.\n  I sympathize with the occupant of the chair that pickup trucks ought \nto be treated differently. I am not arguing about that. Clearly, they \nare a mainstay to a huge amount of economic activity and people who \ncontribute very significantly to the fabric of this country. But it is \ncompletely contrarian to say we are going to have NHTSA try to evaluate \nthis and, on the next vote, we have exempted 20 percent of the \navailable fleet, so that now, whatever fuel savings we have left to \ngain have to come out of the rest of the fleet--either passenger cars, \nSUVs, or others--if it is decided that any savings are going to come at \nall.\n\n  Now, just today, some polls were released that showed that 88.9 \npercent of Americans believe we are better off trying to raise the fuel \nefficiency of our automobiles, and they would like to see CAFE \nstandards be at a level where America is saving oil, where we are not \nimporting oil from abroad to a greater degree.\n  Senator McCain has worked diligently with a group of Senators on both \nsides of the aisle--Senator Snowe, Senator Collins, Senator Gordon \nSmith, and Senator Chafee, and Senators on our side, such as Senators \nHollings and Feinstein--to come up with an agreement on a different \napproach on CAFE. It is an approach that embraces the concept of credit \ntrading, so that you soften, reduce significantly, the pressure on an \nautomobile company to meet the higher standard of, say, the 36 miles or \n35 miles--or whatever it might be--by allowing that company to purchase \ncredits from a greenhouse-gas-producing entity of some kind in the \nUnited States.\n  What you get from this is a two-fer: You get the reduction in \ngreenhouse gases, and you also get the incentive for companies to move \nforward, meeting a higher standard of fuel efficiency. I hope NHTSA--\nnow that the Senate has voted, it is my hope; and I am sure Senator \nMcCain joins me--that this will be a concept maybe they will embrace as \nthey consider how we might come back to more effectively implement the \nstandard.\n  What has happened here in the Senate is the result, to a large \ndegree, of an extraordinary process of distortion over the course of \nthe last days, where huge sums of money have been spent by an industry \nthat has a lot of money, and rather than putting the money into fuel \nefficiency, they put it into advertising to maintain the status quo. It \nis ironic.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield on that point, isn't it \nparticularly entertaining to hear the comments about the drivers of \npickup trucks and how important it is for those good citizens--hard-\nworking, poor citizens who drive the pickup trucks, not a penny of \ntheirs pays for these advertisements that have distorted this issue so \nbadly.\n  Wouldn't it have been more fair in the debate to talk about who is \npaying for all the advertising attacking you and me and anybody who \nwanted to increase CAFE standards? I don't think a single pickup truck \nowner paid for those ads. We know who it is. It is the automobile \nmanufacturers. Isn't it the automobile manufacturers who have resisted \nevery single change in safety or efficiency over the last 40 years in \nthe United States of America? Isn't it true that to drag out a picture \nof an automobile called the ``purple people eater'' and somehow infer \nthat that would be an automobile that the American people would be \nforced to drive, if we increased CAFE standards, has trivialized this \nentire debate?\n  I have to tell my friend from Massachusetts that I have been engaged \nin debates on the floor of the Senate now for quite a few years, as has \nthe Senator from Massachusetts. I haven't quite seen the trivialization \nof a debate\n\n[[Page S1831]]\n\nin the manner with which this one was when they dragged out pictures of \nlittle European cars. Frankly, the Europeans buy those cars because \nthey don't have parking spaces in the major cities in Europe. I suggest \nthat perhaps the occupant of the chair might go to Germany and get on \nthe autobahn sometime. He will see some pretty big automobiles \ntraveling at very high rates of speed. If we had the little ``purple \npeople eater,'' maybe we ought to have shown the Porsches and the \nMercedes Benz, which are extremely popular in Europe, as well.\n  The other thing I ask of my colleague that is a bit disturbing about \nthis debate is this: All these comments about the health of our \ncitizens and the risks to their lives and how this could be so \ndangerous because we would have more accidents, which by the way have \nbeen refuted by recent studies----\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I could interrupt, I need to go into the \ncloakroom for a moment. I will yield the floor and let my colleague \ncontinue to speak.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague. I am sure he will be responding to \nthe questions.\n  Here we have a study from my home State of Arizona, the ``Governor's \nBrown Cloud Summit,'' a study released January 16, 2002, concerning the \nvery serious problem we have in the valley, where the city of Phoenix \nand surrounding cities are located. I hope colleagues will keep in mind \nthat this is the same valley where, many years ago, doctors recommended \npeople to go and live if they had respiratory problems. Part of the \nconclusions here are that:\n\n       Microns, often referred to as PM 2.5, is a significant \n     cause of haze. Each particle, about the size of a single \n     grain of flour, can float in the atmosphere for days, \n     behaving much like a gas. Over half of the PM 2.5 is caused \n     by the burning of gasoline and diesel fuel in vehicles, which \n     are sometimes referred to as on-road mobile vehicles.\n\n  Then it says:\n\n       PM 2.5, the prime cause of poor visibility in the valley, \n     also exacerbates health effects, such as asthma attacks and \n     other heart and lung problems that cause people the need to \n     go to the hospitals and is consistently associated with \n     higher-than-average death rates. Reducing the amount of PM \n     2.5 will make the view of more distant landmarks clearer \n     and reduce health effects. Improvements in visibility and \n     health will be directly proportional to the amount of the \n     emissions eliminated.\n\n  Recently there was an editorial in the Arizona Republic on March 9, \n2002--``New study reveals wider health risks.'' The title is \n``Legislature Must Attack Brown Cloud\":\n\n       We have always known the valley's brown cloud is ugly and \n     unhealthy. Now we know it can be deadly. A new study \n     indicates years of breathing that haze of particulate \n     pollution will significantly raise a person's risk of dying \n     of lung cancer and heart attack. For lung cancer, the risk is \n     the same as living with a cigarette smoker, according to a \n     report published this week in the Journal of the American \n     Medical Association. The study, funded by the National \n     Institute of Environmental Health Sciences--\n\n  Not an automobile manufacturer--\n\n       is compelling because of its breadth. Researchers followed \n     half a million people across the country for over two \n     decades. No, it is not just desert dust. The most dangerous \n     particles are much smaller, 2.5 microns or less, so tiny that \n     it takes at least 28 to equal the diameter of a human hair. \n     These ultrasmall particles which wreak havoc by penetrating \n     deep into the lungs come from combustion.\n       Here in the valley, as elsewhere in the West, a big part of \n     our particulate pollution spews out of tailpipes.\n\n  Long-term exposure to pollution increases risk of lung cancer, \naccording to this study, by 8 percent.\n  The study concludes air pollution puts individuals at greater risk \nfor heart attacks and lung cancer. Pollution has been correlated to \nreproductive, musculoskeletal, respiratory, and gastrointestinal \nproblems. It is of particular concern to children and older people as \ntheir immune responses are less capable of dealing with the stresses \ncaused by pollutants.\n  Arizona has the second highest rate of asthma sufferers in the \nNation. Approximately 300,000 Arizonans have asthma. The 2002 report by \nthe Journal of the American Medical Association, says:\n\n       Six hundred sixty-six premature deaths in Arizona are from \n     exposure to particulate matter.\n\n  This is serious business. This is not pictures of little European \ncars. This is not comments about the great individuality of the pickup \ntruck driver. This is about life and death of children and older \npeople. That is what this argument is about and, unfortunately, that \nhas not been part of this debate. It certainly could not have been part \nof this debate that I know of.\n  It is calculated that brown cloud material would be reduced by 1.8 \nmetric tons per day in 2010, if the use of clean burning fuel was \nimplemented.\n  My State, Arizona, got an F, the worst rating on air quality, in 2001 \nfrom the American Lung Association. Ninety percent of the workforce in \nmy State drives to work. One in every 4.5 cars is an SUV; 54 percent of \nthe passenger vehicles sold in Arizona qualify as light-duty trucks. I \nwould be the last representative to try to take away an SUV from my \nfamily, my neighbors, or my constituents.\n  Phoenix received a D rating for the amount of smog from cars and \ntrucks per person and an F for the amount spent on public transit \nversus highways per person. In Phoenix, we have 70 pounds of smog per \nperson per year. In Pima County, vehicle emissions are responsible for \nup to 70 percent of area air pollution, making them a prime candidate \nfor reduced emissions and cleaner burning cars.\n\n  An increase in CAFE would reduce my State's pollution by about 2.3 \nmillion metric tons per year. The California Air Resources Board \nestablished a zero emission vehicle program in 1990 to meet health-\nbased air quality goals. Ten percent of new vehicles produced in 2003 \nhave to be zero emission vehicles. As of 1990, other States may adopt \nthe California program as their own but are otherwise prohibited from \nsetting their own emissions standards.\n  The State of California has listed over 40 chemicals in diesel \nexhaust as toxic air contaminants. Numerous studies have linked diesel \nexhaust with cancer, bronchitis, asthma, and other respiratory \nillnesses.\n  It is very unfortunate that we are failing to address the severe \nhealth care problems and direct threat to the health of our citizens as \nwe blithely believe the same old rhetoric from the automobile \nmanufacturers of America which were wrong in 1974, they were wrong in \n1976, and they are wrong today. At one time, they were against \nseatbelts. At one time, they were against airbags. At one time, they \nsaid the CAFE standards increase that Congress had the courage to pass \nyears ago would drive them out of business. The last time I checked, \nthey were doing pretty well.\n  I regret this action on the part of the Senate because I believe \npeople will die unnecessarily over time as a result of the action we \nhave taken today. We will revisit this issue because the problem in my \nState and America is getting worse rather than better.\n  I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. I know he has been made \nfamous in newspaper and television advertisements all over America as \nbeing the one who is bent on destroying Western civilization as we know \nit. I do extend to him some sympathy. Some day we will have a rational \ndebate on this issue, and we will bring the scientific facts forward, \nas I tried to do through different studies conducted by the Journal of \nthe American Medical Association and the National Academy of Sciences, \nas to the threats to the health of Americans that our failure to \naddress this issue presents.\n  Some day I am sure we will revisit this issue, and I hope the debate \nis devoid of pictures of small cars that are used in Europe as a threat \nto the American way of life, in which I know the Senator from \nMassachusetts and I would never engage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his \ncomments. I know he has been the recipient of those kinds of comments \npreviously. He and I seem to find ourselves together on that \noccasionally.\n  I came to the Senate hoping I would always find that this institution \ndebated facts and truth. Obviously, I am not naive. I know there are \nsome politics; we all understand that. I am not trying to suggest that \nis not part of it. But the level of Harry and Louise-ing of this issue \nthat we saw in the last days is a commentary on money in American \npolitics and how the agenda\n\n[[Page S1832]]\n\nof the country gets distorted and the ways in which special interests \nand big money can mold an issue into a certain perspective completely \ndevoid of some of the reality.\n  We saw a National Academy of Sciences study used again and again in \nthe most obviously distorted way. People would read from the study \nwhich referenced a 1993 analysis. Despite the fact that analysis has \nbeen redone since then, despite the fact there is a 2002 current year \nanalysis, everybody kept going back.\n  Let us go back to 1993 because that is much more effective, even \nthough it is not true. Across America, people were told they might have \nto farm with a compact car. I know the Chair does not believe that. \nPeople are not going to be farming with compact cars. Tractors are not \neven under CAFE standards. As to the level of reasonableness of the \nstandard that could have been found with respect to light trucks or \npickups, it is beyond imagination we would not be willing to come to \ngrips with what I think is a greater truth.\n  Those most concerned with safety in America, those entities that \nconsistently earn a reputation coming to the Senate with studies and \nanalyses upon which all of our colleagues depend--the Center for Auto \nSafety, Public Citizen, people who have a reputation of representing \nthe consumer--were against what the Senate did. Not one safety \norganization in America supported what was adopted.\n  I have learned to take my losses, and we are all going to live to \nfight another day. This issue is going to come back, I am absolutely \nconvinced about that. We are going to face it.\n  I saw that the price of gas went up about 5 or 6 cents at the pump in \nthe Washington area in the last couple of days. I remember when I was \ngoing to law school what it was like to study my torts and contracts \nsitting for an hour and a half in a line waiting to get gasoline, and I \nwished I had a car that did not require me to go into that line as \nfrequently as it did so I could get to school and back on one tank of \ngas more frequently.\n  In Europe, people are driving cars that get 60 and 70 miles per \ngallon, and the question is pregnant here in America: Why aren't we?\n  There is a new poll that came out yesterday. It shows 88 percent of \nAmericans want cars that are more efficient. I believe even those who \ndrive pickups and light trucks all across America would like a truck \nthat is more efficient. They pay their gas bill. They have to pay for \nthe same costs as everybody else. It would be a lot more efficient if \nthey could have some of that new technology.\n  In my judgment, we missed--it is my judgment, and I could be wrong, \nas everybody knows--an opportunity to help make America more \ncompetitive, to help save money for our consumers, and to beat back \nwhat has been a proven reluctance by an industry for years. This is not \na matter of conjecture.\n  I know the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Georgia, knows Stuart \nEizenstat. I know the Presiding Officer knows President Jimmy Carter \nvery well. President Jimmy Carter sat in front of the Big Three, and \nthey came to him and said:\n  Mr. President, we cannot do this. You are going to put us out of \nbusiness. Stuart Eizenstat testified to our committee that he sat in \nthat meeting and listened to the president of General Motors tell him \nit was impossible to meet the standards, but President Carter himself, \nsomebody who understood technology, an engineer by training, made a \ncourageous decision that we had to move forward. That courageous \ndecision to move forward saved millions of barrels of oil--billions by \nnow. It saved, many would say, the American industry because it made \nthem competitive with the German and Japanese car that was increasingly \ngaining market share because Americans wanted cars that were more \nefficient.\n  I believe in the capacity of every UAW worker and every car \nmanufacturer in America to build a car that is competitive with any car \nin the world. I believe in the capacity of American ingenuity and \ntechnology. I believe in our entrepreneurial spirit.\n  Today, we turned our backs on something President Kennedy did in the \n1960s when he said we could go to the moon in 10 years. He did not know \nfor certain we could get there, but he set a goal, and America met the \ngoal.\n  We could have, today, set a goal for America. We could have said we \nare going to reduce the threat that our kids may have to go to another \ncountry to defend our gluttony on oil by becoming more efficient. We \ncould have, today, had an opportunity to set a standard that would have \npushed the technology curve so America could be the country that sells \nthe cars of the future, all over the world, that are more efficient, \nmore effective, and safer.\n  I misspoke earlier when I said something about the Senator from \nMichigan. I want to clarify it. I told him about it, and it was purely \nmisspeaking. I said his bill would wipe out the safety standards. I did \nnot mean the safety standards of CAFE that are in existence today. I \nmeant it would wipe out the underlying safety standards in our bill. \nThat, it did.\n  We had a safety standard that would have provided a rollover standard \nfor SUVs. Every year we lose 10,000 Americans who are killed in \nrollover accidents in SUVs. SUVs are built with a very fragile roof. I \nthink the roof weighs about 75 pounds, something in that vicinity. When \nthe heavy SUV rolls over, people are crushed and killed. That could be \nprevented.\n  The safety people who supported our bill suggested we should have had \nthat standard in this legislation. That has now been wiped out.\n  The reason this is so important is that there is a history. People \nknow NHTSA has not been a fighting agency for change or for standards. \nThat is why when Ronald Reagan came in and Congress was going to do \nstandards, everybody said: Oh, NHTSA ought to do it. Do not let \nCongress do it.\n\n  When Bush 41 was President, they said: Oh, Congress should not do \nthis. NHTSA ought to do this. Then all of a sudden when President \nClinton was in office, and Congress was in the hands of the \nRepublicans, the whole argument flipped: Oh, we should not have NHTSA \ndo this. We ought to have Congress do this.\n  Lo and behold, in 1995, the Congress prohibited the EPA from even \nevaluating what the impact might be of raising the CAFE standards.\n  There is a history, a history of delay, a history of resistance, a \nhistory of can't-do, a history of we do not want to do, a history of \nthis is going to kill us. But when Congress had the courage to stand up \nand raise the aspirations of Americans, guess what. The industry met \nthe standard and exceeded it. And guess what. We raised the numbers of \nworkers in Detroit up to about 1 million in the year 1999, the highest \nlevel it had been for a number of years.\n  When I hear my colleagues say, ``What about jobs,'' I do not think it \nis Toyota and Honda that moved to Mexico. The last measurement I had, \nit was the Big Three that had moved some plants to Mexico. Honda and \nToyota are building plants in the United States of America, and they \nare increasingly building engines and automobiles in our country and \ngrabbing market share.\n  Maybe the competition of the marketplace will spur some of these \nentities on but history has shown--look at Enron. There is an example. \nIf ever we have learned in recent days what President Teddy Roosevelt \ntaught us when he had the courage, coming from his party, to stand up \nagainst trusts in America, we learned of the unfettered, completely \nunrestrained, absolutely unregulated appetite of most businesses. We \nhave found countless examples of abuses where sometimes someone is \nneeded to act as a referee, to act as a standard bearer. I believe that \nsomeone should have been the Congress. It has not been, and it \nobviously will not be. So my hope is that as we go down the road, \npeople will think hard about the gains that were lost today.\n  This is not the long-term solution for our country. I understand \nthat. The long-term solution for our country is to be independent of \noil, but 70 percent of the oil we consume in America is consumed in \ntransportation. If we are going to reduce foreign dependence, we have \nonly two choices: We either produce it in America or we reduce our \ndependency abroad. Since oil is the principal dependency, we cannot \nsolve the problem when we only have 3 percent of the world's oil \nreserves but we use 25 percent of those reserves every year. The math \nis simple. Every child\n\n[[Page S1833]]\n\nin school can do the math. If the United States is using 25 percent of \nthe oil, and we only own 3 percent of the oil reserves, either find the \noil somewhere else or find an alternative to oil.\n\n  We cannot drill out of this predicament; we have to invent our way \nout. One of the ways to have invented our way out of it would have been \nto have adopted a standard that pushed the technology curve so our \nindustry would suddenly become the world's leader, as we were in \nalternatives and renewables and photovoltaics in the late 1970s, when \nwe made a similar effort to adopt those technologies.\n  I am proud we were fighting for this. I will stand up anywhere in \nthis country and defend the rectitude of what we attempted to do and \ndecry the lies that suggest everybody in America has to get into some \nlittle purple people eater, when Ford Motor Company itself is promoting \nan SUV with all the power you want, and all the room you want, and it \nuses half the gasoline.\n  There it is, the car of the future, from Ford Motor Company. There is \nnot a pickup truck, there is not an SUV, there is not a vehicle in \nAmerica that cannot be driven this size. Look at our buses; look at our \nfleets. In America today we are driving huge numbers of people in buses \nthat are driven on compressed natural gas. We have alternative \nvehicles. Fleets are being purchased that way.\n  The Government has the opportunity to set the standard, requiring \nthat no automobile is going to be bought for fleet use of the \nGovernment unless we are using hybrids and alternatives. We could begin \nto create the demand for the marketplace. There are all kinds of ways \nto try this, but it takes leadership.\n  Today I regret to say I don't think the Senate offered that. I hope \nit will in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, for 2 weeks we have debated the \ncomprehensive energy policy we should have for this country. Most \nMembers and most Americans agree we need to do two basic things: One, \nwe need to create more energy; two, we need to conserve more energy.\n  Throughout the legislation we are debating, there are a variety of \nways we will create more energy: make natural gas more readily \naccessible from northern Alaska; create renewable energy; more solar, \nwind, geothermal; interesting exploitation of biomass, biofuels, soy \ndiesel, among others.\n  On the conservation side, we are not doing so well. On the \nconservation side, we need to do a whole lot better. The Senator from \nMassachusetts has alluded to how much oil we consume. We consume a \nwhole lot, given the size and population of our country, compared to \nthe rest of the world. Our oil imports account for roughly 60 percent \nof the oil we consume. That is up from 30 percent when I came back to \nthe United States at the end of the Vietnam war.\n  By the mid-1970s, we did not have much of a trade deficit. Today we \nhave a trade deficit of $300 billion a year. A good deal of that is \noil. Roughly a little more than half of the oil we consume, we consume \nwith cars, trucks, and vans we drive. To pass from the Senate and send \nto conference with the House energy legislation that does not make \nmeaningful, measurable steps toward reducing the amount of oil we use \nfor our cars, trucks, and vans is shortsighted and a mistake.\n  A month ago I had an opportunity to participate in a meeting convened \nby our majority leader, Senator Daschle. At that meeting were Senator \nLevin, Senator Stabenow, Senator Kerry, Senator Carnahan, myself, and \nothers. We were at the behest of our majority leader to see if we might \ntry to find middle ground between the approach Senator Kerry wanted to \ntake on CAFE standards and the approach of Senator Levin.\n  I thought on that day and today I still believe there is a \ncompromise, and a good compromise, between what each proposed then and \nwhat each proposes to do today. At that early meeting I laid out what I \nthought were five principles that should underlie any changes we make \nwith respect to the fuel efficiency of our cars, trucks, and vans. I \nmention those again. Senator Mikulski alluded to them yesterday. No. 1, \nwe need to reduce oil imports. That should be an embodied principle. \nNo. 2, we should set clear, measurable objectives. No. 3, we should do \nour dead-level best to preserve American jobs. No. 4, we should provide \nreasonable leadtime to the auto industry for any changes that are going \nto be coming. No. 5, we need to think out the box. We need to be \ninnovative.\n  I have never been a big one for micromanaging. I urged Senator Kerry \nin his legislation to move away from the idea that the Congress would \nset these interim goals for fuel efficiency. It is appropriate for \nCongress and the Senate to set longtime goals for fuel efficiency, be \nit CAFE or a reduction, a measurable, tangible reduction in oil \nimports. I am not as comfortable for the Congress setting interim \ngoals. I would have that delegated to an appropriate entity.\n  Earlier today we debated the Levin amendment, for which I voted. I \nwould like to be able to vote for the Kerry amendment not because I \nthought Levin was perfect, but there are a lot of elements that are \ngood. Not because I think Kerry-McCain is perfect, but there is a lot \nthat is good. If you put it together, we would have a good package.\n  I mention a couple aspects of the Levin amendment that I think are \nhelpful and ought to be in the final package that hopefully will go to \nthe President for his signature. The Levin amendment focuses on three \nor four major things that the Government ought to do and can do well. \nOne is significant investments of Federal dollars in research and \ndevelopment, for fuel cells, for hybrid technology, including diesel \nhybrid technology.\n\n  The Levin amendment acknowledges there is a responsibility, and a \ngood opportunity, a responsibility for the Federal Government to help \ncommercialize the new technologies in fuel efficiency, vehicle \nefficiency that are coming along. The Federal Government has the \nopportunity to use its purchasing power to buy large numbers of cars, \ntrucks, vans, jeeps, SUVs, trucks, semitrucks, others that are more \nfuel efficient. We should do that in the military and on the civilian \nside and use our purchasing power to help commercialize the new \ntechnologies.\n  Another role for the Federal Government is with respect to tax \npolicy. If we want producers of vehicles to produce more fuel-efficient \nvehicles, we need to include a tax incentive. The Levin approach \nprovides that.\n  Similarly, if we want to make sure the vehicles that are energy \nefficient are purchased by consumers, we need to provide incentives for \nconsumers to buy. We do that under the Levin approach.\n  The one element that is missing in the approach of Senators Levin and \nBond is the biggest hole in the amendment: We do not set a clear, \nmeasurable objective. We can argue until the cows come home about \nwhether or not we need to change CAFE, concerns of foreign and domestic \nproduction, are we fearful of exporting the building of small cars to \nother countries if we approach this the wrong way.\n  Maybe the debate should not be about CAFE at all. Maybe the clear, \nmeasurable objective we ought to debate is an objective that reduces \noil imports, reduces the consumption of oil by our cars, trucks, and \nvans.\n  The House of Representatives has passed by a very narrow margin a \nflawed energy bill, flawed with respect to the measurable objective \nthey set in reducing consumption of oil. But at least they have a \nmeasurable objective. And their measurable objective, as I recall, is \nover roughly another 5 or 6 years to reduce by, I think, 5 billion \ngallons the amount of oil that we consume. That is in their bill, with \nrespect to our light trucks, vans, SUVs.\n\n  If we actually consider how many miles per gallon that equates to, it \nsays we are going to improve our fuel efficiency by maybe a mile or \nmile and a half per gallon over roughly the next half dozen years. That \nis not much. That is far too modest a goal and certainly far too modest \na goal for the next dozen years.\n  We are going to stay on this bill for a while longer. I wish very \nmuch we could vote for the Kerry-McCain amendment because it has \nchanged a whole lot from what was originally envisioned and, frankly, \nwhat has been originally put in this bill, and it has been changed in \nways that I think\n\n[[Page S1834]]\n\nmake sense. I thank them for the changes, including ones I proposed, \nthat they have been willing to accept.\n  Before we move off this bill, I hope we will come back to this \nthought; that while it is important that we preserve jobs and while it \nis important that we provide reasonable lead time for the auto \nindustry, and while it is important that we think outside the box and \ninvest in R and tax credits and commercialize the technologies that \nare coming along--those are all things that are important to do--it is \nalso important for us to reduce our reliance on foreign oil.\n  For us, today, to think we are going to have to cram into these tiny \nlittle cars like the purple people eater that was put on display by \nSenator Lott earlier is just not the case.\n  We build Dodge Durangos in my State. They get about 17 miles per \ngallon. If they introduce a gas hybrid engine, they will increase their \nfuel efficiency next year by about 30 percent. That is just next year, \nby 30 percent. There are ways we can use diesel hybrids to increase \nthat 30 percent to something like 60 percent, if the diesel hybrid is \nable to meet our requirements for tier 2 clean air standards, \nparticularly for nitrogen oxide and particulates. We can do these \nthings and we don't have to sacrifice comfort, we don't have to \nsacrifice space, we don't have to sacrifice safety in order to have the \nkind of vehicles people want to buy and want to drive and to be able to \nremove our country's future from the hands of the folks who control so \nmuch of the oil in the world.\n  My wife has a Ford Explorer. She likes it a lot. It doesn't get very \ngood gas mileage, but she likes it a lot. She likes the size and a lot \nof things about it. Probably the next car she buys will be a similar \nvehicle. I drive a Chrysler Town and Country minivan. I like it a lot, \nand with a young family, it meets our needs. I sure wish it got better \ngas mileage. I wish it got a lot better gas mileage. We can do those \nthings.\n  Senator Kerry mentioned--I will just close with this--when John \nKennedy was running for President in 1960, he talked about a goal of \nputting a man on the Moon, an American on the Moon by the end of that \ndecade. Today, that may not seem to be a very big undertaking, but in \n1960 it sure was. The idea we could take a man and put him in a space \nsuit, put him in a missile and send him up to the Moon and let him walk \non the Moon and turn around and fly back safely, the idea somebody at \nthe time could was almost incomprehensible. But he said we could do \nthis as a nation; that we ought to do it before the end of the 1960s. \nAnd we did.\n  If we could do that as a nation four decades ago, we can build cars, \ntrucks, and vans that people want to buy and want to use in this \ncountry and at the same time reduce our reliance on foreign oil.\n  When I filled up the tank of my Chrysler Town and Country minivan in \nDover earlier this week, I know some of the $20 I charged on my credit \ncard to fill that tank is going to people around the world, or will end \nup in the pockets of people in nations that do not like us very much \nanymore. They don't have our best interests in mind, necessarily. In \nsome cases, they will use the resources we continue to ship overseas \nwhen we purchase the oil--some of them are committed to using the \nresources we give them against us, to hurt us and hurt our people here \nand in other places around the world. We should not continue to be so \nfoolish as to do that.\n  Before we leave this bill and vote on final passage next week, I \nbelieve we need to come back and address the issue of clear, measurable \nobjectives and make sure as we go to conference with the House with \nrespect to the use of oil, consumption of oil in our cars, trucks, and \nvans, that we have put in place some clear, measurable objectives that \nwill reduce our reliance on that foreign oil.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/13/senate-section/article/S1834-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1834-S1835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I come to the floor to discuss briefly \nthe qualifications of two individuals who have been nominated for \nessential positions within the Department of Transportation.\n  Mr. Jeffrey Shane has been nominated to be the Associate Deputy \nSecretary for the Department of Transportation, and Emil Frankel has \nbeen nominated to be Assistant Secretary of Transportation Policy.\n  Last December, the Commerce Committee held a hearing to consider both \nthese nominees and reported them out unanimously on December 19, 2001. \nWe are approaching 3 months since they received committee approval. I \nthink it is time for this Chamber to act on these two qualified \nnominees.\n  These are very important positions. One is Associate Deputy Secretary \nfor the Department of Transportation and the other is the Assistant \nSecretary for Transportation Policy.\n  There is very little doubt, with all of the issues surrounding post-\nSeptember 11 and our transportation security requirements, the \nsituations at our airports, et cetera, that we should be putting \nqualified men and women who have been nominated without objection into \nthose offices. They are important positions. The confirmations of Mr. \nShane and Mr. Frankel have been placed in limbo due to an unrelated \nlegislative matter.\n\n  As Associate Deputy Secretary, Mr. Shane would be in charge of the \nOffice of Intermodalism at DOT. Secretary Mineta proposed a \nreorganization plan concerning DOT's policy functions. It would \nultimately broaden Mr. Shane's responsibilities.\n  Under the proposal, the Deputy Secretary positions would be retitled \n``Undersecretary of Policy'' and would manage all aspects of \ntransportation policy development within the Department of \nTransportation. In addition, the Office of Intermodalism, the Office of \nAviation and International Affairs, and the Office of Transportation \nPolicy would report to the Under Secretary under this reorganization.\n  While this reorganization plan must be considered separately from the \nnomination, at this point it is important that Mr. Shane be permitted \nto carry out his duties as soon as possible. He has extensive \nexperience and expertise that would be invaluable to the Department. He \nhas also served in several prominent positions at DOT and the State \nDepartment and has been confirmed on several occasions by the Senate.\n  I believe Mr. Shane is one of the most widely respected individuals \nin the transportation community, particularly with respect to aviation \nissues. I have not always agreed with Mr. Shane in the past, but I have \nalways respected his capability and his judgment. We should consider \nourselves fortunate that such a qualified and distinguished individual \nwants to return to public service when he could continue a much more \nfinancially rewarding life in the private sector. It is inexcusable \nthat his and Mr. Frankel's nominations have languished for nearly 3 \nmonths.\n  As Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy, Mr. Frankel would \nbe the chief domestic policy officer at the Department of \nTransportation. In that position, he would be responsible for the \nanalysis, development, communication, and review of policies and plans \nfor domestic transportation issues.\n  If there is anyone in this body who has not been to an airport \nrecently, I have to tell them, we certainly need all the help we can \nget right now. On my last trip back from Phoenix, I spent an hour and a \nhalf standing in line in order to get through security, which is \nwarranted, certainly, in these times. But we also need to modernize \nthat system as soon as possible.\n  Since September 11, the Department of Transportation has been under \ntremendous strain dealing with critical aspects of interstate \ntransportation as it relates to national security. The Department needs \nall the help it can get as it struggles with the new wartime reality. \nIt is our obligation to give the Department of Transportation every \nreasonable resource at this time.\n  I am dismayed we continue to deny the Department the benefit of these \nnominees' public service. Our inaction sets a miserable example for \nothers who might consider devoting part of their lives to public \nservice.\n\n[[Page S1835]]\n\n  If someone has a substantive problem with either of these nominees, I \nwant to hear about it. But as far as I am aware, their nominations are \nnot controversial in any substantive way. I am unaware of any \nlegitimate reason for not acting on these nominations today.\n  I am informed that at least one Member of this body is holding these \nnominees because that Member believes he can best advance the cause of \none mode of transportation security--in this case, Amtrak--by holding \nup their confirmations. I believe this is most unfortunate and, in \nfact, a big mistake.\n\n  I support Senate passage of rail security legislation. In fact, I \nintroduced the first rail security measure last year that would help \naddress Amtrak safety and security funding needs. On October 10, I \nintroduced S. 1528, the Rail Transportation Safety and Security Act, \nalong with Senator Gordon Smith. I am also lead cosponsor of S. 1550, \nthe Rail Security Act of 2001, introduced by Senator Hollings and \nmyself on October 15, 2001.\n  S. 1550 would authorize $515 million for security and $989 million \nfor addressing the tunnel life safety needs in the Northeast. It was \nreported unanimously by the Commerce Committee on October 17 and is \nawaiting full action by the Senate.\n  I urge the majority leader to schedule floor time for us to consider \nS. 1550. I understand a number of Members are interested in offering \nadditional security-related amendments to that measure. I would also \nsupport allowing it to pass by unanimous consent if such agreement \ncould be reached. It is an important bill not just for Amtrak but for \naddressing all rail security, both passenger and freight.\n  But to hold these two nominees hostage to somehow better position the \npassage of Amtrak security legislation is not the best approach. After \nall, these positions are largely about security. We are holding up \nnominees who are good and qualified people because they are being held \nhostage to some other piece of legislation. That is wrong.\n  What is going to happen if we do not move with these nominees? They \nwill withdraw their candidacy. And this also sends a very disturbing \nmessage to others who are willing to serve this country. Usually when \nwe find people who are willing to serve in positions of responsibility, \nthey make a financial sacrifice. It is just because we do not compete \nsalary-wise with the private sector. And that is entirely appropriate.\n  But if these men and women are presented with situations like this, \nwhere two perfectly qualified nominees are prevented from being \nconfirmed by the Senate and have to wait months after being unanimously \nreported out by the committee of oversight, and not even given a \nhearing on the floor of the Senate on their nomination, then, \nobviously, we are going to have more and more difficulty in getting \nqualified men and women to serve.\n  I have been around here since 1987. I have never put a hold on a \nnomination. I have opposed nominees, and I have opposed them on the \nfloor and forced votes on their nomination, but it is not correct to \nhold these two good and decent Americans hostage for some other agenda \nitem.\n  So, Madam President, I intend to come back to the floor later this \nafternoon, since there are those who have put a hold on it, and ask \nunanimous consent that these nominees be confirmed or, if need be, have \na rollcall vote.\n  I think it is time we move forward with these nominations, as I have \ndiscussed at some length.\n  Let's not do this to these people. They are not responsible for any \nfailure or perceived lack of consideration of any Senator. They are not \neven in the job. Let's give them a chance to serve the country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, let me take a moment while there is a \nlull in the proceedings to reiterate a request that I believe has been \nmade by both Democratic and Republican cloakrooms last night, to \nSenators on both sides of the aisle, and it is my hope, as floor \nmanager, along with Senator Murkowski, that we can, at some stage later \nthis week, seek a finite list of amendments that would be in order on \nthe bill.\n  As all Members know, we have been on this bill now for all of last \nweek; and so far this week, we have addressed some significant issues. \nThere are some other amendments that are being negotiated and \nfinalized, and we have been working with some Members on those. There \nare others that we just hear about. There are rumors of amendments \nwhich we hear about.\n  I think the majority leader is trying to get as much done as possible \nbefore we move to the issue of campaign finance reform, which he is \ncommitted to move to later.\n  I think our chances of completing action on this energy bill would be \ndramatically improved if we could get a finite list of amendments to \nwork through.\n  So I once again encourage all Members to cooperate with the two \ncloakrooms and give copies of their amendments to those cloakrooms so \nthat we can see them and can talk to Senators about how to move ahead \nwith those amendments or with votes on those amendments, if those are \nnecessary.\n  I know there will be an amendment at some stage fairly soon by my \nfriend Senator Thomas.

Madam President, the bill we are considering is an \nextremely large and expansive bill dealing with many important and \ncontroversial topics. Although the bill was stripped from its committee \nof jurisdiction pretty much completely behind closed doors, we have an \nidea of the issues with which we have been dealing. CAFE, ANWR, and \nrenewables are all topics we are familiar with and which have been \ndebated for some days now.\n  I am here to discuss a very small provision that many of my friends \nmay not have noticed because it is buried pretty deeply. That \nprovision, unlike several others that have been discussed and studied, \nwill be discussed for the first time, I believe, now.\n  Before getting into my comments, I wish to state that a comprehensive \nenergy bill is no place to put this new and untested idea; such an \naction is, at best, poor policy. In particular, I wish to discuss \nsection 822 of the current bill.\n  Section 822 sounds as if it is not very offensive in a big bill such \nas this, but it lies within the CAFE title. In short, section 822 \nprovides grants for States to establish scrappage programs for cars \nthat are 15 years old or older. Car owners who choose to turn in their \ncar for scrap receive a ``minimum payment.'' Section 822 does not tell \nus what the ``minimum payment'' might be, but they pay now about $1,000 \nto $1,200 for scrapping cars.\n  Further, section 822 would have the Department of Energy pay the \nformer car owner a ``credit'' toward the purchase of a new vehicle. \nLike the ``minimum payment'' language failing to state how much that \nwould be, this provision fails to tell us the value of the taxpayer-\nsubsidized ``credit.'' However, unlike the minimum payment, we have no \nguidance what that ``credit'' might be because, as with so much of this \nlittle section, this is the first time we have heard of it.\n  Since no hearings were held on section 822, we don't know how much it \nwould cost U.S. taxpayers. We do know, however, that the cost would be \nenormous since there are approximately 38 million cars at least 15 \nyears old or older currently on the roads. If we estimate that just \none-quarter of those car owners choose to scrap their automobile and \nreceive the $1,000 and get another $1,000 to purchase a DOE-approved \nvehicle, the cost to the U.S. taxpayer would be about $19 billion--\ndeficit dollars that could go to much better uses as we approach \ndeficits next year.\n  When I first heard of section 822, I wondered: Why should we do this? \nWhy should States be burdened with establishing a voluntary program to \nscrap old cars? Why should U.S. taxpayers be subsidizing some people to \nbuy new cars? I am a big supporter of the auto industry, but I don't \nsupport Government subsidizing their sales.\n  Section 822 simply states its purpose: To retire fuel-inefficient \nvehicles, the assumption being that any car 15 years old or older would \nbe inefficient.\n  This is a brandnew approach to address fuel efficiency and gasoline \nconsumption, an approach that has not been discussed at any level and \nthat has not been studied. In principle, I oppose the making of rash \ndecisions without adequate knowledge or public hearings, or input from \nthe public at large, particularly when the results could hurt the \nAmerican people, since section 822 was included in this bill without \nany study whatsoever.\n  Beyond principle, I also oppose section 822 on its merits as it is \nfundamentally flawed, expensive, and potentially a harmful policy. Some \nStates have elected to establish scrappage programs to get vehicles \nwith poor emissions off the road. Again, section 822's purpose is to \nget fuel-inefficient cars off the road--the first of its kind.\n\n[[Page S1839]]\n\n  States that choose to enact scrappage programs are not in compliance \nwith clean air regulations. Those States choose scrappage programs as a \ntool, among others, because they believe they are effective in meeting \nhealth concerns.\n  Section 822 creates incentives not to further public health but to \nfurther unfounded prejudices against older vehicles.\n  Under State scrappage programs, the State is able to means-test a \npolluting vehicle so that only those affecting public health would be \nscrapped. Yet this federally promoted, State-run scrappage program does \nnot provide any means testing to ensure that only fuel-inefficient \nvehicles are scrapped. Therefore, a 1986 Ford Escort getting 41 miles \nto the gallon would be treated the same as a Cadillac Seville of the \nsame year that only gets 17 miles per gallon.\n  The only criteria would be that they are both 1986 automobiles. I \ngive that example to show simply that section 822 is fundamentally \nflawed: that older cars are all inefficient and, therefore, should be \ntreated the same.\n  Since this is the first time the Senate has heard about this \nprovision, we should review who is benefited and who is injured and \nwhat are the costs and benefits of section 822.\n  First of all, section 822 would have a disproportionate impact on \nlow- and fixed-income individuals. It is more cost effective for people \nof low means to maintain older vehicles than to buy new ones. However, \nthe scrappage program in section 822 would reduce the supply of car \nparts, thereby increasing the cost to citizens with lower incomes.\n  The reduction of car parts would detrimentally affect the aftermarket \nparts industry, 98 percent of which are made up of registered small \nbusinesses.\n  I think it is safe to assume the authors did not intend to hurt low-\nincome individuals and small businesses during a recession. Yet that is \nthe unintended consequence that most surely would happen.\n  Who would benefit? Just as this provision hurts the most vulnerable, \nsection 822 unjustly enriches people of better wealth. In short, \nsection 822 is tantamount to corporate welfare for automotive companies \nand upper classes.\n  I submit the Federal Government should not be in the advertising \nbusiness to sell cars. The Department of Energy credit to purchase new \ncars is akin to a mail-in rebate as advertised on television, a \nwasteful expense that cheapens important energy issues and the work of \nthis body.\n  Further, I do not believe the Federal Government should have any role \nin pushing certain vehicles on consumers. The private market is \ndescribed as an ``invisible hand.'' However, section 822 would \ncertainly strengthen that hand. By paying people to choose certain cars \nover others, the Federal Government would inappropriately insert itself \ninto private decisions.\n  I mentioned this provision would reward those people who do not want \nto put money out for repairs. In addition to establishing a scrappage \nprogram, section 822 also requires States to establish repair programs. \nAs provided in that section, a car owner paying 20 percent of the cost \nwould have the State fix his vehicle, normally through a tuneup, to \nincrease fuel efficiency.\n  The Federal Government and States should not be turned into tuneup \nstations to have people properly maintain their vehicles, something \nwhich they should do out of their own pockets.\n  The majority correctly states that section 822 is a voluntary \nprogram, but it is not voluntary for the Federal Government which is \ncompelled to establish a carrot-and-stick approach to entice States to \nengage in potentially disastrous and certainly burdensome actions.\n  The participating State must create two new programs just in case \nsomeone might decide to volunteer to scrap their car or have the \nFederal Government pay 80 percent of their repair costs. The burden on \nStates could be enormous.\n  My friends, the authors, might say the State would not be hurt \nbecause the Federal Government provides funds through grants for those \nprograms, but we have no idea how much that will cost. We do not know \nbecause we have had no hearings and no studies on this section.\n  We all know the Federal Government never provides enough money to \nStates to enact programs and, in uncertain times such as these, I do \nnot think we should approve ill-conceived and uncertain measures when \nwe do not know the bottom line pricetag.\n\n  How is the State going to administer the public notification and \nsalvage of parts? Who may participate in the parts salvage? Will that \nbe open to individuals or restricted to businesses? And how will a \nState value and sell the parts of the cars? We simply do not know.\n  In closing, those of us who are cosponsoring this amendment have had \nonly a brief time to look at this section. We believe it is the wrong \napproach. Our amendment will strike section 822 from the bill.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, first, I am disappointed that the \nSenator from Colorado has chosen to propose striking this provision \nentirely. The provision is clearly written in a way that provides \nabsolute maximum flexibility to States to participate or not \nparticipate.\n  The Senator starts out with the argument that we do not know how much \nthis will cost. That is right because this is strictly an \nauthorization. It will cost whatever we decide to appropriate for this \nprogram. Congress will still have to make a judgment as to whether to \nappropriate anything for this program.\n  This is a grant program to States that want to participate. We will \neither put some money in to fund this grant program or we will not, and \nwe will specify each year the amount of funds we think should be made \navailable to the Department of Transportation to fund this program.\n  It is clear it is a purely voluntary program on the part of States. \nThere are some States that have vehicle scrappage programs in place \ntoday. There may be other States that would want to consider that. The \npurpose of the provision is obvious. The purpose of the provision is to \ntry to assist with getting extremely fuel-inefficient vehicles, high-\nemission vehicles off the road where there is a desire on the part of \nthe owner of the vehicle to either improve the efficiency of that \nvehicle or to trade that vehicle in and get something else. That is the \nclear intent of these programs that some States have adopted.\n  What we are saying is that the Federal Government would be authorized \nthrough the Department of Transportation to assist States in these \nprograms to the extent that we appropriate money to support them.\n  The argument by the Senator from Colorado is that this is a terrible \nburden on people with low incomes. There is obviously a \nmisunderstanding about what this provision says. This is purely a \nvoluntary provision. Nobody is required to do anything under the \nlanguage of this section 822. If an individual wants to continue \ndriving a 30-year-old vehicle, that is their option. There is no \npenalty; there is no requirement they do anything. They clearly would \nnot even have the opportunity to do anything if they were in a State \nthat did not have one of these vehicle scrappage programs.\n  If they were in a State that did have a vehicle scrappage program, \nthen at least if that program was receiving Federal funds, the State \ncould use some of those Federal funds under the program that is \ndesigned by the State. The individual could use some of those funds to \ncompensate for having the vehicle scrapped or to repair the vehicle so \nthat it is more efficient, so that it has fewer emissions. That is \nclearly the purpose of it.\n  As to the argument that this will cause a problem with the salvage of \nvaluable parts for vehicles, there is a specific provision in the bill \nthat the Secretary cannot provide any funds to a State under this \nprogram. The Secretary could not provide funds unless the State's plan \nallows for giving public notification before any parts are scrapped so \nthat those parts could be purchased or auctioned or otherwise salvaged.\n\n[[Page S1840]]\n\n  And as to the objections that the Senator has cited, we heard similar \nobjections to an earlier version of this section. Frankly, we thought \nwe had accommodated the concerns that were brought to us and modified \nthe amendment in order to do that.\n  Now, of course, after making the modifications, we are faced with an \namendment to strike the section entirely. I think it is good public \npolicy for the Federal Government to assist States that want to have \nthese programs. I do not see why it is in the public interest to strike \na provision that enables the Secretary of Transportation to pursue \nthis, to the extent the Appropriations Committee puts in funds to \nsupport the program.\n  So I very much hope we will not adopt the Senator's amendment and \nhave this provision stricken from the bill. To my mind, it is a good \nprovision. It provides an opportunity for States to move ahead with \nthese programs where they would like to do that and where Federal funds \nare made available.\n  As I see it, it is not onerous in any respect as to either what \nStates are required to do or what individuals are required to do. The \nentire effort is purely voluntary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as I indicated to Senator Lott and as I \nindicated yesterday to a joint leader meeting, we would be required to \nfile cloture on the motion to proceed to the campaign finance reform \nbill today, this afternoon. We have been working patiently with our \ncolleagues who have opposed campaign reform now for some time. I am \nstill hopeful that perhaps we can reach an agreement which will allow \nus to vitiate this cloture motion, and if that can be done, we will \nvitiate the vote on cloture on Friday and we will move forward, but \ntime has run out.\n  It is essential we at least file cloture today on the motion to \nproceed in order to accommodate a worst case scenario on campaign \nfinance reform. I have put all of our colleagues on notice that this is \none piece of legislation that must be completed prior to the time we \nleave for the Easter recess. So we will have the cloture vote on \nFriday, if it is required. We will then be on the bill on Monday. I \nwill notify our colleagues that we will file cloture on Monday for a \nWednesday cloture vote, and assuming we get cloture on Wednesday, we \nwill be in session all night Wednesday night, all night Thursday night, \nand we will then have our vote on Friday.\n  So Senators should be aware, it may be unusual but we will be \ninvolved in an all-night session Wednesday and Thursday night in order \nto complete our work on the bill by Friday.\n  Now again, it is my hope that perhaps we can reach some agreement \nwith regard to the package of technical amendments. We have not been \nable to do it to date. I am concerned that time is quickly running out, \nbut we are certainly more than willing to continue our discussions. I \nhave run out of time in terms of our ability to assure we can have the \ncloture votes at a time that will accommodate completing our work by \nthe end of next week.\n  So I thank my colleagues. I especially thank the distinguished \nSenators McCain and Feingold for their extraordinary work and effort in \ngetting us to this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the majority leader for his \nsteadfastness in this effort. It has been a long odyssey, and as we \nhave reached crucial points he has been extremely helpful in moving \nthis process along. It has been pretty clear in the last few weeks that \nthe opposition has chosen to delay consideration of the bill. So I \nthank him and look forward to trying to reach an agreement with the \nopponents of the bill so we are not required to follow the scenario as \noutlined by the majority leader. I am not sure we can get an agreement \nwithout that scenario being presented. So I thank him for that.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, Senator McConnell approached me a \nshort time ago. He said he wanted to continue negotiations on a so-\ncalled package of technical amendments and that he would not insist \nthat a substantive amendment be considered on it. I will be glad to, \nalong with my colleague Senator Feingold, consider any technical \nchanges that are purely technical in nature, but we have found out in \nthe course of this long odyssey we have been involved in that words do \nhave meaning and some people view words that are technical as not \ntechnical.\n  We require the agreement of all of our colleagues who have been \ninvolved in this issue, including Members of the House, and we have to \nbe sure of a certain methodology that would be taken up in the other \nbody. So we will be glad to continue to negotiate. I hope we can reach \nagreement, but under no circumstances would our failure to reach an \nagreement on a technical package of amendments impede the process we \nare now embarked on of reaching final resolution on Shays-Meehan/\nMcCain-Feingold before we leave for the next break.\n  I wish to make it clear, I am willing, along with my colleagues, to \nwork on so-called technical amendments, but in no way would they impact \nthe final passage of the bill because they are technical in nature. \nThat is the name of them. So I, again, thank the majority leader. I \nthank my friend Senator Feingold, and perhaps--and I emphasize \n``perhaps''--we can reach some amicable agreements to get this thing \ndone without causing discomfort to the schedules and lives of our \ncolleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I know the Senator from Wisconsin wishes to say a few \nwords, but before these two men leave, I wanted to be able to say to \nthem it is not often in this body that one can make such a significant \ndifference as they have done with campaign finance.\n  I can remember in 1986, I woke up one morning and the State of Nevada \nwas covered with signs of my opponent. I thought to myself, what a \ntremendous waste of money. Why would he be wasting money on signs? They \ncost so much. So I filed a complaint with the Federal Election \nCommission. Two years later I get a response that they have done \nsomething technically in violation.\n  The fact is, the signs were paid for by the State party. That was the \nbeginning of this rush of corporate money. From that time, 1986 to \n1998, 12 years, it changed dramatically. Between John Ensign and Harry \nReid, from signs paid for by the State party, there was $20 million \nspent in the State of Nevada, not counting independent expenditures. \nThe vast majority of that was corporate money. That is not going to \nhappen when this legislation takes effect.\n  I am so grateful to these two men for what they have done to make my \nlife more understandable. I will still have to work hard to raise \nmoney, but I will not have to go to people and ask for large sums of \nmoney for the State party, or for myself for the State party, however \nit worked, however one had to do it just right.\n  I know the Senator from Arizona has indicated he appreciated Shays-\nMeehan. Well, I appreciate the work they have done, also. I admire \nthose two\n\n[[Page S1841]]\n\nmen a great deal. These two gentlemen have to understand that the House \nlegislation would never have passed without their travels around the \ncountry daring people not to do something about this. It was because of \nthese two that a cloture motion was signed and filed in the House \nforcing the House leadership to take up this legislation.\n  Now there is going to be a lot written about this. There will never \nbe enough positive written about the work you two have done. If you \nnever do another thing legislatively--which you both do a great deal--\nyou have done so much. There are very few people in the history of this \ncountry, in my opinion, legislatively, that have done as much as you \nare about to accomplish when this legislation passes.\n\n  I wanted you to be here to tell you how much people will appreciate \nthe fact, even though they may not feel the benefit as some Members \nhere, with the work you have done. It will improve our system of \ngovernment, and it will put it back, in my opinion, the way it used to \nbe, when people campaigned--instead of going out seeing how much money \nthey could raise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. We thank the Senator from Nevada for his extremely kind \nwords and we thank the majority leader for his firm resolve in a very \nreasonable timeframe to bring this matter to a conclusion. I also thank \nthe Senator from Nevada for the many hours he has been here with us on \nthis issue. He has been extremely helpful. I look forward to the final \nstages with the Senator from Nevada and my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Nevada not only \nfor his kind remarks, which may be to some degree undeserved, but his \ncontinuous help as we have gone through every conceivable parliamentary \nobstacle as we moved forward. I am very appreciative of his patience, \nas well as his kind words.\n  Perhaps we are entering the last phase. Perhaps not. As the famous \nphilosopher Yogi Berra said: It ain't over until it's over.\n  I think we have established a scenario which could lead us to a \nconclusion. I believe, for a period of time, this result may have the \nbeneficial effect that Senator Reid predicts.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/13/senate-section/article/S1841-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1841-S1848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL LABORATORIES PARTNERSHIP IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n  Mr. REID. For the information of all Senators, Senator Daschle has \nindicated he would like a vote about 4:30 this afternoon. So everyone \nshould arrange their schedules accordingly. This vote is on the \nCampbell amendment. Senator Campbell has asked for the yeas and nays. \nThey have been ordered. Unless there is a change by the two managers of \nthe bill, we will have that vote about 4:30 this afternoon. We will \nhave announcements at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. What is the pending business?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3007\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is No. 3007, offered by the \nSenator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I rise to speak in favor of the amendment of my \ncolleague from Colorado.\n  Is there a time agreement or allocations on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is none.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I rise to speak in favor of the amendment put forward \nby my colleague from Colorado, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, on the \nvehicle scrap provision that is in the underlying energy bill.\n  The Senator from Colorado has hit it right. This program is not a \ngood idea. It is not a good idea to put forward Federal funds to \npurchase used cars as a way of trying to improve fuel efficiency. This \nis unproven, not wise, and expensive in the process. Plus, by the \nnumber of calls and letters we have been getting in my office, a lot of \npeople do not think it is a very bright idea to go with this program. \nThey do not see the benefits. A number of car enthusiasts think this is \na program aimed at getting at them.\n  This provision creates a federally funded program giving grants to \nStates to establish scrappage programs for vehicles 15 years or older \nor pursue repairs to improve fuel economy. Owners who turn in such \nvehicles receive a minimum payment and future credit toward purchasing \na new vehicle, meeting certain DOE guidelines.\n  The stated intent is to retire fuel-inefficient vehicles, the first \nprogram of its kind. All prior State scrappage programs sought to \naddress poor emissions. The provision requires a vehicle to be \nscrapped, not stripped for parts.\n  To make a couple of points, this provision has no guaranteed \nenvironmental benefit. Vehicle scrapping requires States neither to \ndetermine the fuel efficiency of vehicles being scrapped nor to certify \nthat scrapped vehicles are replaced by more fuel-efficient vehicles. A \ncarowner could scrap an older but more fuel-efficient compact car and \nreplace it with a newer but less fuel-efficient vehicle. While \nrevisions have been made to address this problem, the fundamental issue \nremains: There is no guarantee that the scrapped car is actually \nreplaced by a more efficient one. That is point one.\n  Under this provision, cars rarely or never driven, vehicles that have \nminimal or no impact on overall fuel economy, may be turned into scrap. \nDOE would be required to pay and give credit to carowners for these \ncars, although they are just sitting there.\n  This provision could possibly hurt low- and fixed-income families and \nindividuals. Even if, as proponents claim, section 822 did improve \nemissions somewhat, the program will definitely create a burden on the \nused car market and the low- to middle-income families who buy them.\n  If the vehicles are scrapped, then their parts are destroyed. A \nreduced supply of older auto parts translates into an increased demand \nfor these parts, raising the cost for anyone who desires to responsibly \nmaintain his or her older vehicle. Low- and fixed-income car occupiers \nwho cannot afford to purchase a new DOE-approved vehicle are affected. \nI don't think the authors of this provision desire that sort of \nfeature. That is the likely impact.\n\n  If the Department of Energy gets into a State grant program and buys \nup a bunch of older used cars, it will drive up the market price for \nthe cars. That is not an impact we want on lower or moderate-income \nfamilies, or families seeking to buy a first-time car for a younger \nmember of the family. They should not be competing against the \nGovernment for that car, nor should they compete against the Government \nfor replacement parts for that car because the older vehicles are being \nscrapped.\n  Vehicle scrappage hurts small business by encouraging the destruction \nof older, and in some cases vintage, cars and the parts necessary for \nmaintenance. This provision would have a detrimental effect on the \nautomotive industry on aftersales. After the new car is sold, there is \na huge industry that supports the auto industry in the automotive sales \nafter the original sale; 98 percent of that business is comprised of \nsmall businesses.\n  The potential cost of the program to taxpayers is unclear. Certainly \nthe benefits are unclear, but the costs are unclear. This provision \nstates neither how much DOE will pay for each scrapped vehicle nor the \nvalue of the credit toward a new vehicle purchase. The State programs \ndo not offer a clear precedent. The State of California Bureau of \nAutomotive Repair pays $1,000 for each donated car. However, this \nprogram addresses the State's poor air quality, not fuel efficiency. \nMoreover, no State provides interested car donators with credits toward \nthe purchase of new cars. This vehicle scrap program does not meet its \nown intended goals. It hurts low- and middle-income families who are \nthe predominant buyers of used cars or families buying for first-time \ncar users.\n  It is the wrong way to dedicate our Federal resources. We all want a \nbetter environment, but this is not the way to achieve it. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of the Campbell amendment to take out this \nprovision.\n  This impacts a lot more people than what might appear on the surface. \nIt has broad impact for the public. It is not being well-received by \nthe public. We are getting a number of calls and letters in our office \nsaying this is a bad idea for a program. It seems highly\n\n[[Page S1842]]\n\ncontroversial and questionable in its ability to impact in a positive \nway fuel efficiency. With the lack of support from the public, this \nprovision should be scrapped--not the vehicles.\n  For that reason, I call on my colleagues to vote for the Campbell \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the managers of this \nlegislation and, as a result of that, I ask unanimous consent that at \n4:20 p.m. this afternoon there be 10 minutes of debate in relation to \nCampbell amendment No. 3007, equally divided between Senators Campbell \nand Bingaman prior to the 4:30 vote in relation to the amendment, with \nno second-degree amendments in order prior to that vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Campbell in \nopposing section 822 of S. 517, which is pending. I support the \namendment by Senator Campbell to strike that. The section creates a \nfederally funded program requiring States to establish scrappage \nprograms for vehicles 15 years and older, or pays such car owners to \nimprove the fuel economy. Owners who turn in such vehicles receive the \nminimum payment and a future credit towards purchasing a new vehicle \nthat meets certain DOE guidelines.\n  The section's stated intent is to retire inefficient vehicles. This \nis really the first of its kind. All prior State scrappage programs \nsought to address primarily poor emissions standards.\n  Who is affected by this? Although section 822 is a voluntary program, \neveryone who opts in is penalized. A reduced supply of auto parts \ntranslates to increased costs to everyone who wants to responsibly \nmaintain their older vehicles. Since section 822 disproportionately \nimpacts or penalizes low-income and fixed-income vehicle owners, car \nowners who cannot afford to purchase a new Department-of-Energy-\napproved vehicle are particularly affected by the increased costs of \nparts as they translate to increased maintenance as the car grows \nolder.\n  Section 822 would have a detrimental impact on small businesses. Mr. \nPresident, 98 percent of the aftermarket parts industry are really \nsmall businesses. Some people would refer to them as car yards, yards \nand so forth. But particularly for young people growing up and people \non modest income, that is where they get their parts.\n  Section 822 does not require States to determine the fuel efficiency \nof vehicles being scrapped, where scrapped vehicles are being replaced \nby more fuel-efficient vehicles. A car owner could scrap an older but \nmore fuel-efficient compact car and replace it with a newer but less \nfuel-efficient vehicle.\n  Section 822 would require the Department of Energy to give credit to \ncar owners who turn in cars that are rarely or never driven--vehicles \nthat have minimal or no impact on overall fuel economy.\n  Further, this section requires the States to create a program that \nprovides public notification of the intent to scrap and allow the \nsalvage of ``valuable parts'' from the vehicle without providing for \nthe costs or the regulation of this operation; determines the \nregistration, operational status, and repair needs of vehicles as well \nas the dissemination of funds for these procedures; and provides \nreports on the program's fuel efficiency to the DOE.\n  Since we have spent a good deal of time here on safety and costs, \nwhat about the cost? We don't know what the cost to the taxpayer will \nbe.\n  Section 822 requires all U.S. taxpayers to pay for some to purchase \nnew cars. It does not state how much the DOE will pay for the vehicle \nor the value of the credit towards the purchase of the new vehicle.\n  No State currently provides new car buyers with ``credits'' towards \nthe purchase of new cars. Since there is no precedent concerning \n``credits'' and section 822 provides no guidance, no one knows the \ntotal cost to the U.S. taxpayers.\n  Section 822 would establish the voluntary repair programs for \nvehicles without detailing guidelines or costs of those repairs.\n  I am told there are over 38 million cars 15 years old or older on the \nroads right now. Current State programs currently pay $1,000 for each \ndonated car. This translates into at least $38 billion in potential \nDepartment of Energy costs for scrappage payments alone and does not \ninclude repair or purchase incentive costs included in the provisions \nof this section.\n  As Citizens Against Government Waste states:\n\n       This provision has all the symptoms of developing into a \n     costly government program that can be handled far more \n     efficiently and inexpensively by the private sector.\n\n  What we have here is an effort to take the older cars that are paid \nfor off the road--not because of concern over emissions but rather a \nconcern over taking away parts availability of these cars as a \nconsequence of removing them from the highways.\n  A lot of collectors and others who want to have good used cars \nclearly look upon this as an intrusion of the Federal Government into \ntheir own privacy which they treasure.\n  I support the amendment by Senator Campbell, which is section 822 of \nthe bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think this energy bill is critically \nimportant. The whole question of how we consume and produce energy in \nrelationship to the environment is critically important, especially in \nmy State of Minnesota at the other end of the pipeline where we import \nour oil in barrels and natural gas, and we export our dollars.\n  I will be in the Chamber talking about energy policy a lot, \nespecially as we focus on renewables and clean fuel.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wellstone are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry: Mr. President, are we still on \nthe bill and on an amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the energy bill and on \namendment No. 3007 by Senator Campbell.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have no amendment to offer at this \ntime, but I ask unanimous consent that I be given up to 7 minutes as in \nmorning business for some comments on the economy, which is indirectly \nrelated to the energy bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair and thank the Senate.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I was in the office when the \nelectricity portion was discussed. First, I compliment the staffs who \nworked so hard to reach an accord, Senator Bingaman and his staff, our \nstaff. The adoption of the bipartisan package of amendments was a good, \nencouraging start in this long process to resolve the electricity \nissue. I have long advocated moving forward to promote competition in \nthe electric power industry. Competition certainly benefits consumers, \nincreases supply, helps reduce the cost of power.\n  I have long promoted the three guiding principles for good electric \nlegislation: To deregulate where we can, streamline where we can, and \nnot interfere with the States protecting retail customers.\n  It would be appropriate to basically underline what we have been able \nto accomplish. I also thank a number of my colleagues. Senator Craig \nThomas, particularly, had the initiative under the leadership's \nguidance to coordinate this for the minority. I want to take a few \nminutes to recognize what we were able to do from what the underlying \nbill addressed.\n  Under section 202, mergers, there was a concern. The concern was that \nit would be a major expansion of FERC\n\n[[Page S1843]]\n\nauthority over traditional State matters with no time limit on FERC \nreview and action. By this bipartisan effort, we were able to come up \nwith a solution. The solution reduces the expansion of FERC authority, \nraises the threshold for FERC review of asset sales from $1 million to \n$10 million, excludes from FERC review acquisition of generation that \nis under State jurisdiction, and establishes procedures for expedited \naction on merger applications.\n  Secondly, under section 203, the market-based rates, there was a \nconcern that it gave FERC broad authority to take ``any action''--that \nstartled a lot of people--any action to initiate unjust rates, \nincluding divestiture and mandatory RTO participation. It specified six \nspecific factors FERC must use when granting/revoking market-based \nrates which possibly intrude on State ratemaking.\n  Again, the question was the broad authority to take any action. What \nwe did in the solution was FERC can only fix the rate itself, if found \nto be unjust. And the six specific criteria modified to be three \ngeneral criteria that FERC can use if FERC considers them to be \nrelevant. So we took the authority from any action and conditioned it. \nIf they found it to be unjust, then they have the authority to fix it.\n\n  The other one in section 204, refund effective date: The concern was \nthe provision created an open-ended period for FERC to act to establish \na ``refund effective date.'' Refunds, of course, might never go into \neffect. The solution was: Restore existing law which provides a 5-month \nwindow for FERC to establish the refund effective date.\n  Section 205, transmission interconnections: The concern there was \nwhether it gave FERC authority on own motion to order construction of \ntransmission and sale of electricity. It didn't have to be requested by \na third party.\n  Eliminated protections in existing law--Bonneville, for example--and \ntheir retail wheeling issue: A solution to that was to strike section \n205 entirely. We eliminated that concern.\n  Section 209, access to transmission by intermittent generators: The \nconcern there was: Gave transmission subsidies to ``intermittent'' \ngenerators; created a presumption that intermittent generators do not \ncreate any reliability problem; did not allow utilities to recover all \ncosts of transmitting electricity for intermittent generators. The \nsolution: Eliminate transmission subsidies; eliminate presumption on \nreliability; ensure that utilities recover all transmission costs.\n  The next section was 241, real-time pricing: The concerns: Did not \ninclude time of use metering. The solution was: Add time of use \nmetering.\n  Section 245, net metering: The concern there was: Establishing a \nFederal net metering program that preempted 35 existing State net \nmetering programs. The solution was: Convert PURPA section 111(d) \nrequirement that State PUCs and nonregulated utilities consider the \nFederal standard.\n  Section 256, State authority: The concerns there were: Preempted \nState consumer protection laws and regulations to the extent they are \ninconsistent with FTC regulations. The solution was: Eliminate \npreemption.\n  Section 263: The concern is: Required the Federal Government to \npurchase renewable power--regardless of the cost. That was somewhat \ncontentious. The DOD needs to spend money on the war--not renewables. \nThe solution was: ``Best efforts'' only to purchase renewable power.\n  So we went from a mandate requiring the Federal Government to \npurchase renewable power, regardless of the cost, to a solution that \nwas to use the best efforts only to purchase renewable power.\n  I thought that explanation was in order because there are a lot of \nterms and technology involved here. I think it is meaningful that we \nhave a solution and we have a bipartisan agreement.\n  I thank my colleague, the Senator from New Mexico, and others who \nwere active in this, including the professional staff who worked so \nhard to achieve it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2995\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thought I would take a moment to speak \nabout an amendment that has already been accepted. I was very proud to \noffer this amendment along with Senator Domenici and Senator Craig \nyesterday. I thank the chairman for his leadership in this effort. \nBecause the time was short yesterday and we really did not get to \npresent the amendment, I thought I would say a few words about it while \nwe have time pending a vote.\n  This amendment by Senator Domenici, Senator Craig, and myself says \nwill contribute to the strengthening of this bill.\n  It says that as we develop our nuclear reactors in the future, they \nwill be designed with new technologies that look very promising, not \nonly to make our nuclear industry more powerful and more effective, but \nalso to create the opportunity to produce hydrogen which can help us in \nmeeting our energy needs.\n  I will explain for the record why this is so important.\n  As most Members know, nuclear energy now provides one-fifth of all \nthe electric power used in this country. I do not think that is clear \nto everyone in the United States. Some people think we have shut our \nnuclear industry down or that we have shut our nuclear powerplants \ndown. That is not true. The truth is, 20 percent of the power we use in \nthis Nation is generated by nuclear energy.\n  Nuclear power produces energy without compromising air quality and \nwithout dangerous reliance on fuel exports from politically unstable \nregions of the world.\n  When we look a few years into the future, the projected demand for \nincreased electric power is staggering. That is one of the reasons we \nare considering this legislation: because the demand for power and the \ndemand for energy is far outpacing our ability to produce it. Because \nwe have different views about production, we have conflicting views \nabout conservation; that does not mean the demand, or the challenge, is \ngoing to go away.\n  It means we have to work harder to find solutions, and this is one \nsolution. According to the Energy Information Administration, by the \nyear 2020 the U.S. will need, under current trends, 400,000 megawatts \nof additional electric power capacity. That is the equivalent of 400 \nnew coal plants or gas-fired plants to be built in this country before \nthe year 2020.\n  I am in no way opposed to burning coal. We are doing it in a much \ncleaner and better way for our environment. I am obviously not opposed \nto domestic natural gas production or imported natural gas. That also \nmeets our new environmental standards. We have to meet some of this \ndemand, but for environmental and energy security reasons we cannot \ncompletely rely on these sources.\n  Just to maintain the existing proportion of nonemitting nuclear power \nin our energy mix, we will have to construct 50 nuclear plants. So we \nhave to build more nuclear powerplants, and our amendment helps to \nbuild them in the right ways.\n  It is clear to this Senator that the environmental and energy \nsecurity benefits of nuclear power are so compelling that not only must \nwe ensure the continued operation of our existing plants, but we must \nalso encourage the construction of new plants in this country to help \nmeet this extraordinary demand.\n  Let me be very clear, when push comes to shove, we have a very short \nlist of energy options for the foreseeable future: oil, natural gas, \ncoal, nuclear, hydropower, conservation, and renewables such as solar \nand wind. All of these have substantial roles to play in our future \nenergy mix, but none of these by themselves is enough to address the \nhuge demand that is facing us.\n  Again, that is one of the compelling reasons, if not the principal \nreason, that we are fighting to shape an energy bill that will meet \nthis demand. Why? Because it is important our economy continue to grow \nso we can be not only\n\n[[Page S1844]]\n\nthe great military power we are, but the greatest economic power as \nwell.\n  Nuclear power is perhaps unique in this list in that there is a large \npotential for expansion in the relatively near term with little \ndownside in terms of environmental damage or an increase in our \nreliance on foreign sources. Furthermore, as many Members are aware, \nthere is an exciting next generation of nuclear reactors being \ndeveloped which take a good product and make it even better.\n  These reactors, which should be available by the end of this decade, \nare meltdown proof, substantially more efficient than the old \ngeneration, produce less high-level waste, and are more proliferation \nresistant than existing reactors. That, in this post-September 11 day \nand age, is a goal we need to be mindful of. We need to be mindful that \nthis material in the wrong hands could cause a lot of trouble, a lot of \ndestruction, and that is why this new design is exciting.\n  Indeed, one of these designs, the gas turbine modular helium reactor, \nis even designed to be built underground and therefore better suited to \nthe threats that now present themselves post-September 11.\n  The Federal Government should work closely with the nuclear industry \nand with our utilities to see that these new reactors live up to the \nclaims being made about them and that they are brought to market as \nsoon as possible.\n  Let me turn now to another aspect with which our amendment attempts \nto address. We have spent a great deal of time this morning speaking \nabout the transportation sector, CAFE standards, and what can we do to \nmake our transportation sector more efficient. All of those are very \nimportant issues. But one of the most interesting solutions that might \nbe found as we develop a new generation of nuclear powerplants is the \nbyproduct of these new plants--hydrogen.\n\n  The administration recently announced some interesting facts \nregarding the development of a new generation of hydrogen-powered car. \nThey call it the freedom car. But we should be mindful that we could \ncall it the freedom truck, the freedom bus. This is not only about \ncars.\n  Every Member probably realizes the importance of ultimately changing \nthe coinage of the energy and transportation sector from oil to \nsomething else. Although we are an oil- and gas-producing State, and I \nam proud of the oil and gas that we produce, we know even in Louisiana \nthat the future calls for a greater mix, and the new nuclear reactors \ncould really be what we need in terms of freeing ourselves from \nimported oil.\n  Our recent engagement in the Middle East and the festering \ninstabilities there, make it very clear the sooner we wean ourselves \nfrom imported oil the better. Hydrogen, either through direct \ncombustion or through fuel cells, seems to have all the hallmarks of an \nideal, non-polluting fuel for transportation that might ultimately \nsupplant imported oil. However, the President's announcement and much \nof the subsequent excitement seems to miss one very important question: \nWhere are we going to get the hydrogen in the quantities necessary to \nfuel the cars or trucks or buses on our Nation's highways in the \nfuture?\n  Please remember that hydrogen is not an energy source. Hydrogen is an \nenergy carrier. It must be produced by either splitting water or \nreforming fossil fuels. Right now, industrial scale quantities of \nhydrogen are produced from natural gas or other fossil fuels, but it \ndoes not make sense from an environmental or energy security point of \nview to produce hydrogen from fossil fuels. What progress would we be \nmaking if we go down that road?\n  So what is the alternative? Fortunately, nuclear power is offering to \nus an alternative, a very promising way to produce large amounts of \nhydrogen required to move towards a hydrogen economy in the relatively \nnear term.\n  The more promising way to produce hydrogen is to utilize the next \ngeneration of nuclear reactors that operate at much higher \ntemperatures. The higher temperatures of these reactors make possible a \nprocess called thermochemical water splitting. The process has received \nonly minor research dollars in this country but has received \nsubstantial research dollars in funding from other parts of the world, \nincluding Japan.\n  Thermochemical water splitting is very promising as it is \nenvironmentally benign and has a very high rate of efficiency. Indeed, \nit is up to 50 percent more efficient in converting the heat of a \nreactor into hydrogen energy.\n  The amendment we have offered and that has been accepted recognizes \nthe importance of developing a next generation of reactors that is \nsafer, more economical, more proliferation resistant, and creates less \nwaste. It also recognizes the importance of developing hydrogen \nproduction capabilities with the next generation of nuclear reactors.\n  The promise of a hydrogen-based transportation sector is indeed very \nexciting. As the chairman has pointed out on numerous occasions, it is \nthe transportation sector demand that is driving our dangerous and \nunwise, in my opinion, reliance on foreign oil imports. We must begin \nto free ourselves from that relationship, and this amendment, with the \nunderlying technology, gives us a real opportunity, not in 50 years, \nnot in 20 years, but within the next few years, in this decade, to \nbegin exploring new technologies that keep our environment clean, that \ngive us the freedom we deserve and we expect, and also is well within \nour economic means of achieving.\n\n  It is very exciting, but unless we plant the seeds of a realistic \nmeans of producing the large scale amounts of hydrogen required, this \ndream will never be realized. Based on the acceptance of this \namendment, I think the Senate has decided that the next generation of \nnuclear powerplants we are going to have to build in this Nation anyway \ncould provide that answer.\n  It has been a great pleasure working on this amendment with my \ncolleagues and being part of this energy debate.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me congratulate my colleague, the \njunior Senator from Louisiana, on her amendment. I think the \nrealization of what the advanced technology would mean, particularly on \nhigh-level nuclear waste in recovery of hydrogen for a number of \npurposes, including fuel cells and others, is something that would tend \nto focus in on high-level waste, and would have a potential value there \nthat may lead us to recognize it is not sufficient to just concentrate \non burying this waste.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 10 minutes \nof debate on the amendment of the Senator from Colorado. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may have 1 minute to compliment the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will take it off of our time.\n  I commend the Senator for her recognition of the value of high-level \nnuclear waste and the utilization of it.\n  I also commend the Senator from Louisiana on her bioenergy amendment, \nwhich we have accepted. This amendment expands the authorization for \nbioenergy research to include biochemical processes that can create \ncertain replacements. There is promising research in these areas. It is \nwise to continue to work on this. We support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from \nLouisiana for these two amendments. I am a cosponsor of both. On a \nbigger scale than that, we are both from oil and gas States. Yet the \nSenator has taken a position that it is not just oil and gas that make \nup the future for the United States. We have to look at a variety of \nalternatives.\n  The Senator has done a superb job working on nuclear issues. The two \nproposed amendments on nuclear are clearly relevant. We are moving \nahead in those areas in the appropriations process. The Senator will \nhave the assurance that both are covered by appropriations if, indeed, \nSenator Bingaman and the others bring it back from conference with the \namendments.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield?\n\n[[Page S1845]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I appreciate those remarks. The Senator from New Mexico \nhas been an extraordinary leader in this field of nuclear energy.\n  I compliment the industry. The Senator from New Mexico understands \nthat the oil and gas industry has been, in the last couple of years, \nbroadening its horizons and outlook in welcoming these new sources of \nenergy. They are turning themselves from oil companies to energy \ncompanies, from gas companies to energy companies, opening up \npossibilities for new sources of energy.\n  I commend the industry and hope this bill that Senator Domenici has \nworked on so hard will compliment the work in the private sector to \nhelp this country get to the freedom we need from imported sources so \nwe can set our own destiny.\n  I am proud to be a sponsor of this amendment and others like it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I compliment the Senator from Louisiana also for her \namendment earlier agreed to. We worked hard with her and her staff to \nbe sure this amendment could be included in the bill. I am glad it is \nin the bill.\n  What is the regular order?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3007\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a vote at 4:30 with respect to the \nCampbell amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes thirty seconds on the Senator's \ntime and 2 minutes for the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have Senator \nSmith of New Hampshire added as a cosponsor of this amendment, and I \nyield myself the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Colleagues, section 822 is a bad idea. Under section \n822, we are going to allow the DOE to give grants to take 15-year-old, \nand possibly more, fuel-efficient cars, which would rarely be driven, \noff the highways and then turn around and offer another grant of \ntaxpayer-funded money to people who want to purchase a new car which \nmay be less fuel efficient than the ones to be taken off the highway \nand will probably be driven more because they are newer.\n  How do we sell that under the guise of fuel efficiency? States have \nthe ability to have scrappage programs--many do. Some offer between \n$1,000 and $2,000 per car to be scrapped. In the suggested grant to \ntake older cars out of circulation, if one-fourth of the 38 million \ncars 15 years or older were funded, it would cost taxpayers $19 \nbillion. Maybe I am missing something, but I did hear we have lost our \nhuge surplus of last year and may, in fact, be in deficit this year. It \nseems to me we have a better place to use our money. This is not the \ntime to spend $19 billion.\n  The authors of the section 822 say it is voluntary, but who will turn \ndown a potential $1,000 to turn in an old car and another $1,000 of \ntaxpayer money to buy a new one when someone else is paying?\n  I ask my colleagues to vote down section 822 at 4:30.\n  As Senators, we have an obligation to make decisions based on \ninformation. Here, the authors of section 822 are asking you to make a \ndecision based on no information because no studies or hearings were \never held that would legitimize the Federal subsidization of car \nscrappage programs.\n  Again, the authors of 822 argue that compelling states to establish \nscrappage and repair programs to get older cars off the road is a \nvoluntary program. Further, they argue that some states already have \nscrappage programs.\n  Well, if States want scrappage programs then they should be able to \nestablish their own--why should the Federal Government have any role in \nthat which States can do already do?\n  Furthermore, the authors of section 822's reliance on some states \nchoosing to establish scrappage program is misleading. Current state \nprograms seek to address poor emissions quality, a serious health \nconcern.\n  Section 822 assumes that older cars have poor fuel efficiency and \ncreates an expensive carrot and stick approach to compel states and \nindividuals to participate in a completely new and untested program.\n  In any event section 822 does not provide any means testing ensuring \nthat only fuel inefficient vehicles are scrapped. Therefore, a 1986 \nFord Escort getting 41 city miles per gallon would be treated the same \nas a Cadillac Seville of the same year that gets a mere 17 miles per \ngallon. The only qualifying criteria would be that they are both 1986 \nautomobiles.\n  The authors of section 822 state that no one is penalized, that only \nindividuals choosing to participate would be affected. Yet, the truth \nis that everyone is captured by this program.\n  The reduced supply of car parts translates to increased costs for low \nand fixed income people who cannot afford to buy a federal government \nsubsidized, DOE approved vehicle.\n  Further, there are 38 million cars that could be affected. If just \none quarter of those owners chose to get $1,000 for scrapping their \ncar, and then another tax payer subsidized $1,000 credit to buy a new \nDOE approved vehicle, the total cost to all U.S. taxpayers, whether \nthey ``volunteer'' to participate or not, would be $19 billion.\n  Well, that seems to be a lot of money--that's because it is. I would \nhave my friends note that at no time did the authors of section 822 \nstate that this provision would not be terribly expensive. They didn't \ndefend their measure as fiscally responsible because they don't know if \nit is or not.\n  The authors argue that they ``fixed'' their provision by requiring \nthe states to hold a public notification of the intent to scrap \nvehicles and then provide for parts salvage. How will a state possibly \nmanage that, and what will it cost the federal government? Again, we \ndon't know.\n  A few short hours ago, my friend Senator Bingaman stated, ``I don't \nsee why it is in the public interest to strike a provision that enables \nthe Secretary of Transportation to pursue this to the extent that the \nAppropriations Committee puts funds in to support the program.'' \nNormally, we know how much money something costs before we buy it.\n  I ask you not to buy this ill conceived Federal subsidization \nscrappage program of old cars and welfare for the wealthy. Section 822 \nwill hurt the most vulnerable of our citizens, hurt small businesses, \nand hurt U.S. taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, as I indicated, I am disappointed \nthe Senator from Colorado felt obligated to offer this amendment. \nHaving heard his concerns and the concerns of others, I urge all \nSenators to support his amendment. My view is this is not an amendment \nthat justifies having a vote on the Senate floor, but he is insisting \non one, so evidently we will go through it and have a rollcall vote and \nbring all Senators to the floor to vote for the amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. If our colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not \nneed a recorded vote, we do not, either. If he is willing to accept \nthis amendment, I am sure the minority would, too, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to vitiate the recorded vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, before we do the voice vote, which I \ngather is what the Senator from Colorado would like on his amendment, \nlet me read some provisions or sections of a letter we received from \nthe Automotive Service Association.\n  This is a letter to Senator Daschle, dated February 25, an \norganization with 15,000 members nationwide. It has 300 members in \nColorado, my colleague's home State. It says:\n\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I want to thank you for your efforts \n     on behalf of the automotive aftermarket in the development of \n     Senate Bill 517, the energy policies act of 2002.\n       The Automotive Service Association is the largest and the \n     oldest trade association representing independent automotive \n     repair facilities in the United States. . . .\n       Your revised Section 832, Assistance for State Programs to \n     Retire Fuel-Inefficient Motor Vehicles, includes both a \n     repair and recycling facilities. This assists mechanical and \n     coalition repair facilities. Quite frankly, many of these \n     older vehicles would not receive fuel-efficiency related \n     repairs without\n\n[[Page S1846]]\n\n     some incentive. This legislation will provide the opportunity \n     for these vehicles to receive the necessary maintenance.\n       Allowing the salvage of valuable parts enhances competition \n     in the parts marketplaces as well as makes sense for the \n     environment.\n       We appreciate the efforts that you and Chairman Jeff \n     Bingaman have made to alleviate many of the concerns our \n     industry has had with this legislation. We support the bill \n     and look forward to a continued working relationship with you \n     and your staff.\n       ASA is contacting automotive repairers in South Dakota and \n     New Mexico to inform them of your efforts.\n\n  Signed by Robert Redding, Jr., on behalf of the Automotive Service \nAssociation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this entire letter be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I believe this is good public policy to \nenact, along the lines we have talked about here. But since my \ncolleague and others have indicated concern about including it in the \nenergy bill, I have no problem with it being deleted.\n  I urge all Senators to support the amendment of the Senator from \nColorado.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                               Automotive Service Association,\n\n                                   Bedford, TX, February 25, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I want to thank you for your efforts \n     on behalf of the automotive aftermarket in the development of \n     Senate Bill 517, the Energy Policy Act of 2002.\n       The Automotive Service Association is the largest and \n     oldest trade association representing independent automotive \n     repair facilities in the United States. These collision, \n     mechanical and transmission small business members are \n     located in all fifty states and several foreign countries.\n       Your revised Section 832, Assistance for State Programs to \n     Retire Fuel-Inefficient Motor Vehicles, includes both a \n     repair and recycling option.

Mr. President, I introduce an amendment creating a new \nDOE Office of Spent Nuclear Fuel Research. This new Office would \norganize a research program to explore new, improved national \nstrategies for spent nuclear fuel.\n  Spent fuel has immense energy potential--that we are simply tossing \naway with our focus only on a permanent repository. We could be \nrecycling that spent fuel back into civilian fuel and extracting \nadditional energy. We could follow the examples of France, the U.K., \nand Japan in reprocessing the fuel to not only extract more energy, but \nalso to reduce the volume and toxicity of the final waste forms.\n  It is too bad we did not start with this emphasis and organization \nwithin the last 15 or 20 years. But we were on a path that said under \nno conditions would we do this. We thought it would add to the \nnonproliferation potential. We thought we would set an example and \nnobody would do it, so we would not produce any additional plutonium.\n  What happened is we stayed in our rut, thinking it was going to be \nworldwide, while other countries decided ours was a rather imprudent \npolicy and they have proceeded. I just enumerated the countries that \nhave done that.\n  I support continued progress at Yucca Mountain and appreciate the \nPresident's decision to move ahead toward licensing of it as our \nNation's first permanent repository for high\n\n[[Page S1847]]\n\nlevel waste. But, I have frequently suggested that our single-minded \nfocus on this ``solution'' for spent fuel does not serve our Nation \nwell. It is simply not obvious that permanent disposal of spent fuel is \nin the best interests of all our citizens. It's even less obvious to me \nthat we should equate the terms ``spent fuel'' and ``waste.''\n  Since Yucca Mountain can't accommodate all the spent fuel from our \ncurrent generation of nuclear plants, we clearly either need a better \nsolution or more repositories. Given the level of local public support \nenjoyed by Yucca Mountain, I don't think any of us should relish the \nprospect of creating more Yucca Mountains.\n  Depending on our future demands and options for electricity, we may \nneed to recover the tremendous energy that remains in spent fuel. And \nstrong public opposition to disposal of spent fuel, with its long-term \nradio toxicity, may preclude use of repositories that simply accept and \npermanently store spent fuel.\n  If the research program led by this new office is successful, we can \nrecover the residual energy in spent fuel. And we could produce a final \nwaste form that is no more toxic, after a few hundred years, than the \noriginal uranium ore. I was very pleased that the President \nspecifically endorsed these studies of reprocessing and transmutation \nin the national energy policy.\n  I am well aware that reprocessing is not viewed as economically \npractical now, because of today's very low uranium prices. Furthermore, \nI fully recognize that it must only be done with careful attention to \nproliferation issues. But I submit that the U.S. should be prepared for \na future evaluation that may determine that we are too hasty today to \ntreat spent fuel as waste, and that instead we should have been viewing \nit as an energy resource for future generations.\n  We do not have the knowledge today to make this decision. This \namendment establishes a research program to evaluate options to provide \nreal data for such a future decision.\n\n  This research program would have other benefits. We may want to \nreduce the toxicity of materials in any repository to address public \nconcerns. Or we may find we need another repository in the future, and \nwant to incorporate advanced technologies into the final waste products \nat that time. We could, for example, decide that we want to maximize \nthe storage potential of a future repository, and that would require \nsome treatment of the spent fuel before final disposition.\n  This amendment requires that a range of advanced approaches for spent \nfuel be studied with the new Office of Spent Nuclear Fuel Research. It \nencourages the Department to seek international cooperation. I know, \nbased on personal contacts, that France, Russia, and Japan are eager to \njoin with us in an international study of spent fuel options.\n  It requires that we focus on research programs that minimize \nproliferation and health risks from the spent fuel. And it requires \nthat we study the economic implications of each technology.\n  With this new Office and its research program, the United States will \nbe prepared, some years in the future, to make the most intelligent \ndecision regarding the future of nuclear energy as one of our major \npower sources. Maybe at that time, we'll have other better energy \nalternatives and decide that we can move away from nuclear power. Or we \nmay find that we need nuclear energy to continue and even expand its \ncurrent contribution to our nation's power grid. In any case, this \nresearch will provide the framework to guide Congress in these future \ndecisions.\n  Mr. President, while I have the floor, I also want to speak briefly \nto three other amendments on nuclear energy issues, presented by my \ncolleagues, Ms. Landrieu and Mr. Craig. I greatly appreciate their \ninterest in this important technology. I strongly support these \nadditional amendments and am a cosponsor of each one.\n  Ms. Landrieu has two amendments. One notes the important role that \nhydrogen may play in future transportation strategies for the nation, \neither directly as a fuel or in fuel cells. Either of these approaches \ncould lead to a transportation sector that is virtually emission free. \nThis is a great vision, but it depends on, among several challenges, \nidentification of a cheap reliable supply of hydrogen.\n  Hydrogen can either be made from water using electricity, or from \nseveral chemical processes involving heat. Senator Landrieu's amendment \nasks that the Nuclear Energy Research Initiative specifically explore \nthe use of nuclear reactors for hydrogen production.\n  Reactors are well suited to such a challenge. They could supply \nelectricity in off-peak hours. Or, some types of advanced reactors \nwould provide an ample heat resource. In fact, in Japan, their research \non one form of advanced reactor is focused on hydrogen production.\n  Her second amendment encourages the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to \nexplore licensing issues, which may arise with advanced reactor \ndesigns. Her legislation would allow the NRC to pursue this research \nwithout tapping income collected from licensees, through use of \nappropriated funds. This is a good idea, and one that is already \nencouraged in the appropriations process.\n  Mr. Craig's nuclear energy amendment authorizes the Nuclear Power \n2010 program, as proposed by the Administration to begin in fiscal year \n2003. This builds on and expands the work pursued in the Nuclear Energy \nTechnology Program that has been funded for the last two years.\n  Under this new program the DOE would seek industrial proposals for \njoint venture teams to participate, including development of business \narrangements for building and operating new plants in the United \nStates. I appreciate that it would pursue development of the two most \npromising classes of advanced reactors, either water- or gas-cooled \nsystems.\n  Mr. Craig's inclusion of international collaboration is also \ncritical, just as I want to encourage such participation in development \nof improved strategies for spent fuel. Many countries have strong \nnuclear energy programs, we can achieve mutual goals faster and cheaper \nif we work together, just as is now happening with the ten-nation \neffort toward the Generation IV reactor.\n  I share the vision of Mr. Craig that the Nuclear Power 2010 program \nwill result in a new reactor in this country in the next decade. That \nwill be an important step in demonstrating to our citizens and to the \nworld that the United States is not going to be left by the wayside \nwhile other countries pursue this vital energy source.\n  Tomorrow or next week, whichever is most accommodating, I will take \nthe floor and tell the American people what is in this bill regarding \nthe future for nuclear energy. Many things have already been adopted \nand put in the bill by the sponsors, but we now have, with this \namendment before the Senate or put in the bill, all of the amendments \nthat Senators who have been following and working in this area thought \nwere important to its future. They will now be encapsulated in this \nwith the adoption of this, which is our last one.\n\n\n                             nuclear waste\n\n  Mr. REID. I want to confirm that acceptance of this amendment does \nnot create any opportunity to discuss nuclear waste issues in \nconference.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with the Senator's view. I will be a conferee \non this bill. I assure the Senator that I will resist any attempt to \nopen the conference to discussion of waste issues. I would also like to \nnote that, as stated in the amendment, the national laboratories will \nplay strong roles in this work. In fact, from our positions on the \nEnergy and Water Development Subcommittee on Appropriations, let's work \ntogether to ensure their participation.\n  I thank Senator Bingaman in advance of agreeing to this for his help \non it, for what he has done in the bill with reference to not only the \nPrice-Anderson, which he took the lead on even though it was not his \namendment, but all the other provisions he has put in that will create \na level playing field and modernize Americans' ability to utilize \nnuclear power if they choose, since it will not pollute the environment \nand can be part of a national program to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me say with the colloquy my \ncolleague from New Mexico has entered into the\n\n[[Page S1848]]\n\nRecord between himself and Senator Reid, I think all concerns that have \nbeen raised on our side are resolved. There is no objection to the \nadoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3009) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment by \nthe senior Senator from New Mexico. I appreciate the junior Senator's \nacceptance of it.\n  The amendment, as noted, establishes an Office of Spent Fuel within \nthe Department of Energy. It is important that Congress address the \nrange of alternatives to deal with spent fuel from nuclear reactors. \nThis amendment goes a long way to accomplish that.\n  I have served here 21 years with Senator Domenici. He has been a \ntireless advocate of pursuing the advancement of nuclear energy. Last \nyear he introduced S. 472, which is a comprehensive energy bill and \nnuclear bill, and the committee held several hearings. He understands \nwe must have a diverse and responsible energy mix if we ever hope to \nreduce our dependence significantly on Saddam Hussein and his oil.\n  Currently, nuclear energy provides 20 percent of the electricity in \nthis country. It is taken for granted by many. It is a clean, \nnonemitting generation and produces no greenhouse gases, no \nSOx, no NOx. There are 103 operating reactors in \n31 States.\n  Senator Domenici's Office of Spent Fuel is an important part of the \nfuture of nuclear energy in this country, and we must deal with the \nissue of spent fuel. This will require research on all fronts.\n\n  The language of the amendment was part of S. 1287, the Nuclear Waste \nAct amendments that passed the Senate in the last Congress. The office \nwould examine the treatment, recycling, and disposal of high-level \nreactive wastes and spent fuel, and consequently I strongly urge its \nsupport. I thank the Members for the adoption of this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/13/senate-section/article/S1848-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk again about \ntwo nominees, Mr. Emil Frankel, to be Assistant Secretary of \nTransportation, and Jeffrey Shane, to be Associate Deputy Secretary of \nTransportation.\n  I, again, urge the holds that are being placed on these nominations \nto move forward. It is been 3 months since they were reported \nunanimously out of the Commerce Committee.\n  I know both individuals and they are highly qualified. Both of them \nare nominated for very important jobs in the Department of \nTransportation. All of us know, in light of the events of September 11, \nthat these jobs are vital to America's security.\n  I said earlier in my remarks that I had not put a hold on a nominee. \nWhat I meant to say--and I would like to correct the record at this \ntime--is that I have put holds on nominees, but I have never done so \nanonymously. I have stood up and said that I had holds on nominees. On \nthe holds I have put on over the years, I have been here and stated my \nreasons why. I have not done so anonymously.\n  I hope the unnamed Member or Members who have a hold on Mr. Shane and \nMr. Frankel will come forward. So, I hope, again, that the Senate will \nconsider these two highly qualified nominees. If there are areas that \nare not related to these nominees, as far as transportation is \nconcerned, I will be pleased to work with any Member to try to get \nthose concerns satisfied.\n  Again, I would like to correct the record when I stated earlier that \nI had never put a hold on a nominee. I have never anonymously put a \nhold on a nominee. And I have forced votes on other nominees as well.\n  I hope the holds on Mr. Frankel and Mr. Shane will be removed soon. \nWe are in danger of losing those individuals because, understandably, \nafter a period of 3 months, they have to get on with their lives. And \nthat certainly is understandable.\n  So I hope we will move forward with their nominations soon and the \nholds will be lifted. Again, I stand ready to work with any Member who \nhas a hold on their nominations if there is any way we can resolve any \nproblems that they might have.\n  I also state that I never put a hold on a nominee because there was \nsome unrelated issue. I put holds on nominees in the past because I did \nnot think they were qualified, and I stated so.\n  So I hope that clarifies the record on that. But that does not \ndetract from the fact--whether I ever did or did not--that these are \ntwo qualified nominees. It has now been over 3 months since they were \nreported out of the Commerce Committee and they deserve to have the \nopportunity to serve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as we come close to the hour of 5 \no'clock, I am not sure just what the remainder of the schedule is. I \nthink we anticipate tomorrow morning starting on renewables.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that we will spend \nseveral hours tomorrow, at least, dealing with a couple of issues \nrelated to electricity restructuring. One is a reliability amendment \nthat we expect to have offered. I believe Senator Thomas is planning to \noffer that amendment. We will have debate and a vote.\n  Then I intend to offer an amendment on a renewable portfolio \nstandard, which will then be followed by a proposal by Senator \nJeffords. And then probably also there will be a proposal by Senator \nKyl. We will deal with, hopefully, those three proposals, including the \nissue of a renewable portfolio standard. After that, I don't know what \nthe business will be.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend will yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. If I could just make this comment, I think the two managers \nhave a great plan: in the morning come in and work on the Thomas \nlegislation. It is my understanding that he does not want a time set. I \nthink that is appropriate because there may be other issues that come \nup.\n  But I would hope that we could--if we come in, say, at 9:30--complete \naction on that by 12:15 or thereabouts, because every Thursday we have \nthe policy luncheons, so we do not have votes from 12:30 to 2.\n  We could do that and then move to the Bingaman amendment. Senator \nJeffords said he would agree to an hour and 15 minutes. So that would \nbe 2\\1/2\\ hours, if all that time were used.\n\n  I would hope, I say to the manager, my friend from Alaska, that we \ncould get Senator Kyl to agree on a time for his amendment tonight, so \nwhen we do the wrap-up we could have it set that whenever we finish the \nreliability amendment--that is the Thomas amendment--we could \nimmediately go into the mechanics set up for the Bingaman amendment, \nthe Jeffords amendment, and the Kyl amendment, and have an end for \nthat.\n  It seems it should not be difficult for people to agree for times on \nthat because, if Senator Kyl's amendment is adopted, then it wipes out \neverything in front of it anyway. So I hope Senator Kyl can give us \nsome time tonight so we can complete action on this matter tomorrow.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond to the majority whip, I am in \ncomplete agreement. We do not have a time agreement yet among \nourselves. I assume the leadership will set the time for us to come in. \nBut I encourage Senators on our side to be prepared on reliability, \nwhich, as the majority whip indicated, will be offered by Senator \nThomas in the morning.\n  I also encourage all Members on our side, if they have other \namendments they intend to offer, I would like to get the amendments in \nso we can anticipate what we will have before us. I would be willing at \nsome point in time to agree to a list of amendments that have been \nbrought in by a certain time, let's say, prior to the end of this week, \nsomething of that nature. But we can pursue that.\n  But I do agree with the majority whip that we should move along. The \nrenewable portfolio, as the Senator indicated, probably will take some \ntime. So I would be happy to work towards some time agreements as we \nproceed tomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. If I could propound a unanimous consent request, I ask \nunanimous consent that tomorrow, when we resume consideration of the \nenergy bill, at approximately 9:30 a.m., immediately following the \nprayer and the Pledge of Allegiance, Senator Thomas be recognized to \noffer his reliability amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Reserving the right to object, in fairness to Senator \nThomas, we have not had a chance to contact him as to whether it would \nbe 9:30 or 10 o'clock, but I am not going to object.\n  Mr. REID. We will protect him until he gets here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. We will attempt to work with the managers to see if we can \nwork out something for this evening on time for renewability. If we \ncan, it is the plan of the two managers that after completing the \nThomas amendment we will move to Bingaman, Jeffords, and then Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it would be inappropriate if I let a \nday go by when I did not remind my colleagues that there was some \nsignificance as to what we did during the day.\n  Today, there has been a good deal of conversation that, indeed, we \ncould make up by CAFE savings what we would generate by opening ANWR. \nThe Senate, in its action--you notice I did not reflect on wisdom--\nbasically precluded that, at least for the time being until we go to \nconference.\n  Also, the issue of the pickup truck, I think, spoke for a majority \nconcerning safety issues.\n  I wouldn't be surprised before we are out of here if we also have an \namendment that addresses the Suburbans and SUVs relative to safety.\n  The point I would like to leave with Members today is that we are \nrapidly diminishing excuses for not opening up ANWR and recognizing \nthat, indeed, the argument that previously prevailed that we can simply \nmake this up on CAFE standards is clearly not in the interest of a \nmajority of the Senate, primarily for the reason of safety associated \nwith Americans, and children in particular, and the advantages of a \nheavier car moving our children around.\n  As we look at alternatives, I remind my colleagues who are in \nobjection to opening ANWR that they do bear responsibility for coming \nup with alternatives that are realistic. Certainly from our side, ANWR \nis realistic. And the probability of a major discovery is second to \nnone from the standpoint of the geology of North America.\n  I think I have said enough for today. Anything I would say further \nwould be repetition of what I have said time and time again. In an \neffort to relieve my colleague from New Mexico and the staff and the \nPresiding Officer, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, just to indicate to my colleague from \nAlaska, my interpretation of what occurred today is perhaps somewhat \ndifferent than his. My own view is we made some substantial progress in \ngetting agreement on provisions related to electricity restructuring; \nthat is, the package of amendments Senator Thomas proposed and that we \nagreed to was a very good effort on the part of our staff, the \nRepublican staff, Senator Thomas's staff, various people who have been \nworking very hard on that set of issues.\n  My own view is, the bill was substantially weakened by the two votes \nwe had related to CAFE standards in particular. Clearly, the Senate was \nnot willing to step up and ensure any kind of significant increased \nefficiency in the transportation sector in the coming years. That, to \nme, is a disappointment, a weakening of the bill.\n  I don't see the logic that my colleague from Alaska seems to read \ninto everything: The lack of wisdom of the Senate in the area of CAFE \nstandards should justify additional lack of wisdom in the area of \nopening ANWR to drilling. But that is a debate for another time.\n  I do hope my colleague from Alaska will offer his ANWR amendment at \nthe earliest possible date. Clearly, we cannot move to complete action \non this bill until that much awaited event occurs. We have been hearing \nabout his proposal on ANWR for many months. We have had the opportunity \nnow to\n\n[[Page S1850]]\n\nhave it offered for the last week and a half. We hope very much soon \nthat will happen.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would certainly concur with my \ncolleague that we have made significant progress, particularly on that \nportion covering electricity. I remind my colleague that the transit of \npeople, goods, and services utilizes not electricity but oil. We are \nsomewhat extraordinary in this country inasmuch as we are about 3 \npercent of the population, and we use about 25 percent of the energy \nand contribute about a third of the gross world product. We are pretty \nefficient, but nevertheless, we don't move in and out of Washington, \nDC, by hot air. Somebody has to take the oil, whether it be oil coming \nfrom Saddam Hussein, refine it, put it in the airplanes.\n  Until we find another alternative, we are going to either have to \nmake a choice of increasing our dependence on imported sources such as \nIraq or have the alternative of developing resources here at home and \npreserving U.S. jobs and the U.S. economy rather than exporting our \ndollars overseas. I hope the wisdom of the Senate will prevail when we \nget to the ANWR amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/13/senate-section/article/S1850-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Madam President, I wish to speak about the Middle East \nbecause the news from the Israeli and the Palestinian territory grows \ndimmer and deadlier by the day.\n  Terrorist attacks and reprisal raids have now merged into continuous \ncarnage that looks increasingly indistinguishable from all-out war. The \nIsraelis and the Palestinians are being drawn into a horrific cycle of \nrevenge.\n  Frankly, I think an eye for an eye and pain inflicted upon pain \nextended into the future will be an ever-wider river of blood that will \nbe spilled. I wonder how wide the river of blood has to be before we \nget back to some kind of political settlement--some kind of political \nprocess. There is no future as I look at the status quo extended into \nthe future--not for the people of Israel and not for the Palestinians.\n  Let me start out on a personal note. I have used this example several \ntimes while talking to other Minnesotans and people I met with here in \nDC as well.\n  I was at a gathering where I was in a fairly sharp debate with some \ncitizens who were talking to me about what they consider to be the \nunfairness and the wrongness of Israeli policies towards the \nPalestinian people. In this discussion, I turned to them and said: \nListen, you have a right to make the critique you are making. But I \nhave not heard you express any indignation whatsoever about the \nPalestinian suicide bombers going to an Israeli teenager pizza parlor \nwith fragmentation bombs and cluster bombs trying to basically murder \nas many Israeli teenagers as possible. I don't mind your critique of \nsome of Sharon's policies. I have questions about some of them. But \nwhere is your indignation and your anger about the murder of Israeli \nteenagers? I condemn that. I condemn the deliberate targeting of \ninnocent people and the murder of innocent people. As Camus said, \nmurder is never legitimate.\n  Frankly, some of Arafat's comments have become increasingly militant \nin the last several days. I certainly question some of his leadership. \nHis statements in the last several days--and, maybe even more \nimportantly, some of the actions taken by Arafat's people--give me \npause.\n  But, by the same token, I want to be really clear about this. I think \nit is really important that we have Tony Zinni in the Middle East. I \nthink it is critically important that our country play a positive role. \nI think it is critically important, as the administration has made \nclear--I said this to Secretary Bill Burton as well--that we make it \nclear to the extremists that Zinni is not leaving on the basis of a \nterrorist act here, there, or somewhere else. We are engaged.\n  Frankly, the only future is a political settlement. Senator Mitchell \nwas right. The Mitchell report I think lays out a brilliant framework--\nif we can just somehow get there again.\n  I don't come to the floor with clear answers as to what to do, but I \ndo know that an eye for an eye and the increasing cycle of violence \ntakes us nowhere good--not for the Israelis, not for the Palestinians, \nnot for our country, and not for the world in which we live.\n  I do not know. I think there are many questions that can be raised \nabout Crown Prince Abdullah's proposal and where Saudi Arabia is going. \nI myself have questions about some of the proposals. But, by the same \ntoken, at least there is some hope here. We shall see what happens at \nthis Arab summit conference.\n\n  We really need to be talking--on the part of Saudi Arabia and other \ncountries--about the full normalization of relations with Israel. They \ncannot back down from that. That is the very essence of where we have \nto go. I am concerned that some of the Arab countries seem to be \nbacking down from that.\n  But I do not believe this proposal should be ruled out. I do not \nbelieve a proposal that at least attempts to move us towards some kind \nof negotiation and some kind of a peace process should be ruled out. \nNot all of it will be acceptable. I can tell you that right now. But I \ncertainly would like to see the American Government in particular \nsomehow play a role in moving from what has become an ever-growing \ncycle of violence and loss of life of innocent people to some kind of \nframework for negotiation and a political settlement.\n  Ultimately, the truth of the matter is that I am an American Jew. I \nam the son of a Jewish immigrant who fled from persecution in Ukraine. \nAnd then his family moved to Russia. At the age of 17, he fled to our \ncountry. I will be clear. I speak out of love for Israel. And Israel as \na country will exist. The security of Israel and the need of Israel \nhave to be met.\n  It is also true that the Palestinian people will have their own \nnation. Palestinians and Israelis have to live next to one another, and \nthey will have to respect one another. That will happen. My only \nquestion is, How much wider a river of blood has to be spilled before \nwe get back to where we all know we need to go? So I want to, I guess \nin a way, applaud the administration, applaud Secretary Powell for \nsending Tony Zinni there.\n  I simply say that we need to be engaged. Our Government can play a \ndecisive, critical, and positive role. And we must do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/13/senate-section/article/S1850-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1850-S1851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HELPING THE HELPLESS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I rise to express my puzzlement, my \ndismay, as to why, as soon as possible, we can't do a better job of \nhelping people who are faced with some very compelling problems, very \ncompelling needs.\n  What I am getting at is very simple. And maybe this all becomes part \nof the budget resolution. I know the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee is in the Chamber.\n  I was on the Iron Range in Minnesota. These are people who have been \nspat out of the economy. They are taconite workers. Royal TV has pulled \nthe plug. Others are going into bankruptcy. But I thought the \ndiscussion would be about pensions, and that is part of what people are \nworried about. It is not just Enron.\n  But I met more workers who were in their late fifties--57, 58 years \nold--mainly men, some women; and they were all saying the same thing: \n``I had a bout with cancer,'' or, ``I had a heart attack and I can't \nget any coverage anywhere.'' They are terrified. They have no health \ncare coverage. The\n\n[[Page S1851]]\n\nCOBRA plan is $1,000 a month. They can't afford it. They are out of \nwork, and they have these preexisting conditions, and the premiums are \nso high.\n  What are these people going to do? They are asking me for help. They \nare asking all of us for help.\n  I have to figure out a way--I guess we can have a vote on it--as to \nhow we can help people who are out of work through no fault of their \nown. People have no coverage. They are terrified. We would be \nterrified.\n  So I keep thinking--my head spins--there is education, special \neducation, and States saying: Please live up to your commitment. In \nMinnesota, some of our school districts are letting off 20, 25 percent \nof the teachers. The class size is going up. The prekindergarten \nprograms are being cut. But then we say we don't have enough money.\n  Other people are talking to me about affordable prescription drugs--a \nhuge issue--but we say we really do not have enough money to make sure \nthe premiums are down and the copays aren't too high and the \ndeductibles aren't too high, and having catastrophic coverage that will \nwork for people. We say we do not have money for that.\n  Then on the whole question of what I just talked about, expanding \nhealth care coverage for people, we do not have the money for that. I \njust think it is unacceptable. I think we have to make some decisions \nabout choices, about how much money goes to the tax cuts scheduled over \nX number of years, benefiting whom, and whether or not we are going to \nbe able to do anything when it comes to other really critically \nimportant issues in our communities having to do with education, health \ncare, job training, and affordable prescription drugs, to mention just \nthree or four. I put affordable housing right up there as well.\n  I am convinced affordable housing is becoming the second most \nimportant education program. It breaks my heart: I don't know how these \n8- and 9- and 10-year-olds can do well in school when their families \nmove two or three times a year because they do not have affordable \nhousing.\n  I do not know. I think soon we will get to this debate. I, for \nmyself, have made it really clear. Listen, the Senator from New Mexico, \nhe is one of my favorite Senators. The work we do on mental health is \nso important to me. I know he would not agree with what I am about to \nsay, but I will say it in the Chamber. I say it in Minnesota all the \ntime. Other people can have better alternatives.\n  I am saying, forgo the tax cut for the top 1 percent of the \npopulation--families who earn around $297,000 a year--forgo it. And \ndon't eliminate the alternative minimum tax. Don't do it. That alone is \n$130 billion. That would fund special education. That would put the \nFederal Government on a glidepath, within 5 years, to reach our full \nfunding, and in another 5 years to have full funding. That would make \nall the difference in the world, just to educate our children.\n  To me, it is a choice. I make that choice. I will probably have an \namendment to give Senators a chance to decide. There is an old Yiddish \nproverb that says: You can't dance at two weddings at the same time. We \neither go forward with all these scheduled tax cuts the way we want to \ndo it--in which case we will not have the money for all of these other \nthings, and we will cut the Community Policing Program by 80 percent, \ncut the 7(a) Small Business Program by 50 percent, cut the Job Training \nProgram, and cut the low-income energy assistance program by $300,000 \nand we will tell people we have no money to do any of these other \nthings or we will not go forward with all these scheduled tax cuts. It \nis that simple.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/13/senate-section/article/S1851-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1851-S1852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THANK GOODNESS FOR ALAN GREENSPAN AND THE TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, in my view, the recession that started \nlast March is over and the economy is in recovery.\n  The unemployment rate has dropped 2 straight months and is now at 5.5 \npercent. Clearly, it was thought that the last unemployment report \nwould show that unemployment went up. That is what all the experts \nthought, even if we were beginning a recovery. So for it to belie that \nand come down is a very powerful indicator that, indeed, the recovery \nhas started.\n  New orders and production are expanding the manufacturing sector. \nExcluding automobiles, retail sales have increased for 5 straight \nmonths. Good news.\n  We ought to be thankful that the recession was not deeper or longer \nthan it was. It now appears that the peak in the unemployment rate was \n5.8 percent in December. The peak was 5.8 percent, and that was a lot \nhigher than anyone would like. No one likes to watch the unemployment \nrate go up. But we ought to recognize that 5.8 percent is the lowest \npeak for any recession since 1945. Indeed, we have grown accustomed to \nhaving extremely high unemployment; and it is good that it did not go \nas high as it has in the past, as we went through this set of impacts \nthat I believe are behind us.\n  Why was the recession so shallow? Why didn't it linger on, as many \nthought it would? In my view, a number of factors played a role.\n  First, there was a very high rate of productivity growth. Usually \nduring a recession, productivity growth is about zero.\n  During this recession, productivity growth was 2.7 percent, which is \nfaster than we usually get during economic expansion. And, indeed, the \nlast quarter of reporting would say that the productivity growth was 5 \npercent. It is so high and so robust that it permits a Senator such as \nthis one to even question whether that could be right. But it seems to \nbe the right number based on the same information that we have been \ngathering before, that we have been using before, and that is rather \nincredible from the standpoint of the positive.\n  In a typical recession, real compensation tends to stagnate along \nwith productivity. Businesses do not increase compensation when workers \nare not getting more productive. But in this high productivity \nrecession, real compensation, believe it or not, has been relatively \nstrong, not adversely affected by the recession. In other words, if you \ndid not lose your job, you were much better off during this recession \nthan during previous ones. In turn, increases in compensation helped \nsupport the consumer demand which, in a very real sense, fueled the \nfires in opposition to the recession and the factors that were feeding \nit.\n  The second factor that made it milder than expected was monetary \npolicy. The Fed started cutting interest rates 2 months before the \nrecession began and reduced rates to 1.75, the lowest since 1961. In \ntotal, the Fed reduced rates 11 times last year.\n  By contrast, during the last recession, the Federal Reserve reacted \nmore slowly and much less forcefully. Short-term rates were still 6 \npercent when the recession ended the last time we had a recession.\n  The third factor was fiscal policy. The tax cut enacted last year \ncould not have come at a better time. No one knows exactly how much it \ncontributed to what I have just described, but obviously it had some \npositive impact. It was there at the right time, under the right \ncircumstances, and it is one of the few times in modern history that a \nCongress has enacted a piece of legislation on time, in a timely \nmanner, rather than too late and too little.\n\n  There are those who would argue that the last tax incentive to help \nwith the recession bill was too late. I believe that is the case. \nNonetheless, those changes are all good changes that will perhaps help \nthe economy stay in this upward moving direction in which we find \nourselves.\n  By using tax rebates as downpayments on marginal tax rate cuts, we \nput money in the pockets of people and convinced them that there were \nmore tax cuts to come. I believe just doing the rate cuts alone would \nnot have helped the economy as much as they did in that format with \nthose understandings possible by our people.\n  The fourth factor is financial flexibility. Unlike the situation 10 \nyears ago or the situation in Japan today, our banking system is very \nsound, and so are our credit markets. Firms have a wide variety of \noptions when they want to raise funds, and households have been able to \nrefinance their homes at lower interest rates. That has put many \nbillions of dollars in the pockets of our people, when the refinancing \noccurred. Some of that money\n\n[[Page S1852]]\n\nwent into purchases and acquisitions that our people made by using some \nor all of the refinance bonus they received because their equity was \nlong.\n  Lower energy prices contributed to this occurring. Now we are \nnoticing that they are beginning to go up again, rather dramatically--\nin fact, too much. We must send a signal to those who would arbitrarily \ndo that--and they are--that we are busy producing an energy bill in \nboth the House and Senate that will have an impact on that kind of \ncapriciousness they exercise against our people through the economy \nthey adversely affect.\n  Does this mean we have nothing to worry about regarding the economy? \nI don't think so. Another strike by terrorists could again do a great \ndeal of harm both to investors and to consumers and, in particular, to \nconfidence. Probably it would be even a little more lasting than the \nlast one because the strike on September 11 was obviously a total \nsurprise. Another strike of that magnitude or bigger would prove we are \nvulnerable even when we are more vigilant.\n  We also have to be concerned about the flow of oil from the Middle \nEast. There are those who would like to see a much wider area of \nconflagration in that region, if for no other reason than to hurt the \nUnited States. We have to apply our best efforts to ensure that this \ndoes not happen. But apart from these potential negative shocks, the \neconomy seems to be recovering and looks poised to enter a period of \nquite respectable economic growth--not a boom, but that is all right.\n  Now it is our job to make sure we continue to focus on policies that \nwill maximize the long-term growth potential of our economy, including \nstrong national defense, homeland security, energy independence, as \nmuch as we can do, and free trade. We also need to start paying \nattention to simplifying and streamlining our Tax Code. It will not \nwait forever.\n  Together these policies will put us in the best position to face the \nchallenges ahead and improve the living standards of the American \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/13/senate-section/article/S1852-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HISTORICAL PUBLICATION AWARD\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I am very pleased to note that a recent \nSenate publication has won a prestigious award. At its forthcoming \nannual meeting, the Society for History in the Federal Government will \npresent its George Pendleton Award to Senate Historical Editor Wendy \nWolff and the Senate Historical Office for the book entitled Capitol \nBuilder: The Shorthand Journals of Montgomery C. Meigs, 1853-1861. The \nPendleton Award is given annually for ``an outstanding major \npublication on the Federal Government's history produced by or for a \nFederal history program.'' It commemorates former U.S. Senator George \nPendleton, who sponsored the 1883 civil service reform act that bears \nhis name.\n  As an officer in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Montgomery Meigs \nsupervised construction of the current Senate and House wings and the \nCapitol dome. During this project, Meigs kept a detailed journal of his \nactivities, written in an obscure shorthand and only recently \ntranscribed. This publication provides rich new information on \nconstruction of the Capitol extension, and on politics and life in mid-\nnineteenth-century Washington.\n  The Meigs transcription and publication project has been a \ncollaborative effort among a number of congressional offices over the \npast decade, including the Secretary of the Senate, the Clerk of the \nHouse, the Architect of the Capitol, and the Library of Congress. \nWilliam Mohr, a retired Senate Official Reporter of Debates, translated \nthe shorthand, with financial support provided by the Senate \nBicentennial Commission and the U.S. Capitol Historical Society.\n  This project has been guided through to completion by the Senate's \nvery able historian, Dr. Richard Baker, and his dedicated staff. The \nidea originated in 1991 when Joe Stewart was Secretary of the Senate. \nIt was Joe Stewart who ensured that the resources were made available \nto bring this fascinating history to the American public. It should be \nnoted that Dr. Baker is the first Senate historian and he has set a \nhigh standard indeed for every Senate historian who will follow in his \nfootsteps. We in the Democratic Caucus have been pleased to listen to \nDr. Baker's ``history minutes'' each Tuesday at the start of our \nregular weekly conferences. He has given us a deeper appreciation of \nthe challenges previous Senators faced, the rich traditions of the \nSenate, and also the humor exhibited in past times. His stewardship of \nthis project has been justly rewarded by the awarding of the George \nPendleton Award to the Montgomery Meigs Journals.\n  Copies of this 900-page book are available from the Government \nPrinting Office and the Senate Gift Shop. I highly recommend it to my \ncolleagues and to anyone else who treasures the Capitol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/13/senate-section/article/S1852-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Madam President, I would like to congratulate the Girl \nScouts of America on their 90th anniversary. The Girl Scouts began on \nMarch 12, 1912, when founder Juliette Gordon Low assembled 18 girls in \nSavannah, GA, for the first ever Girl Scout meeting. She believed that \nall girls should be given the opportunity to develop physically, \nmentally, and spiritually.\n  Girl Scouts of America has a current membership of more than three \nmillion girls and adults, 150,000 of whom live in Michigan. There are \nalso more than 50 million Girl Scout alumnae throughout our nation. \nGirl Scouts serve their communities, developing skills in a diverse \narray of activities including sports, media relations, education and \nscience while growing into the leaders of tomorrow.\n  One of this year's Young Women of Distinction is Ms. Noorain Khan \nfrom Grand Rapids, MI. To earn this distinction she worked on many \nprojects including one with the Islamic Center of Grand Rapids which \nserves a community of 13,000 Muslims. She helped develop a grant \nproposal for a program to educate Muslim youth about their religion and \nculture, and better equip them to make responsible decisions as adults. \nHer grant proposal consisted of a preliminary curriculum outline, data \non demographics in the Islamic community and a job description for a \nprogram director. Though the grant has not yet been secured, a \nframework now exists for the Islamic center and for future grant \nproposals.\n  All Girl Scout programs are based on the Girl Scout Promise and Law \nand Four Program Goals: developing self-potential, relating to others, \ndeveloping values and contributing to society. To achieve these goals, \nthey have established programs in foster homes, homeless shelters, \nschool yards and Native American reservations. Further, the Girl Scouts \nof America have established a research institute, received government \nfunding to address violence prevention and are addressing the digital \ndivide with activities that encourage girls to pursue careers in \nscience, math and technology.\n  Today, 90 years later, the organization offers girls of all races, \nages, ethnicities, socioeconomic backgrounds and abilities the chance \nto develop the real-life skills they'll need as adults. I am sure that \nmy Senate colleagues join me in commending the Girl Scouts on their \nfirst 90 years and look forward to them celebrating many more.\n\n[[Page S1853]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, this week, celebrations throughout the \nNation will mark the 90th anniversary of the founding of Girl Scouts. I \nwould like to take a few moments to acknowledge this great organization \nand the profound impact it makes in the lives of girls and young women.\n  Ninety years ago, Juliette Gordon Low assembled a group of girls in \nSavannah, GA, for the first meeting of Girl Scouts. Her goal was to \nprovide an environment where girls could develop physically, mentally \nand spiritually. Those goals are unchanged today, with nearly 4 million \ngirls and adults currently holding membership in Girl Scouts. Even more \nimpressive is that more than 50 million women in the United States \ntoday claim a Girl Scout experience in their past.\n  While focused on its goal to help individual girls thrive, Girl \nScouts has also known that it can make an important difference in our \nNation's cultural life. From its beginnings, Girl Scouts has maintained \na commitment to inclusiveness. It has encouraged diversity in its \nranks, in its leadership and in the broad variety of public service \nprograms Girl Scouts pursue.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today in acknowledging the anniversary \nof Girl Scouts. I think that if Juliette Gordon Low were to visit a \nGirl Scout Troop today, she would rightfully be very proud of what she \nwould see.\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I want to congratulate the Girl \nScouts of the USA on celebrating its 90th anniversary. Last night I \nattended the anniversary banquet with my wife, Peatsy, who has been \ninvolved with the Girl Scout leadership for many years.\n  It never ceases to amaze me how this organization, with a membership \nof almost 4 million, has maintained the same core values it held 90 \nyears ago; yet it still has changed with the times to empower girls of \nall races, all backgrounds, and all income levels to meet their full \npotential. Some two-thirds of the women members of Congress are Girl \nScout alumni, and there is no question that more and more of our future \nbusiness leaders, doctors, lawyers, educators, and community leaders \nwill come from the Girl Scout ranks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/13/senate-section/article/S1853-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1853-S1855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             GLOBAL HIV/AIDS: THE HEALTH CRISIS OF OUR TIME\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I came to Washington to the U.S. Senate \nin my heart to serve my home state of Tennessee and this great nation, \nbut after arriving my steps have also taken me far from the floor of \nthe United States Senate--on medical mission trips to Sudan, Africa, \nand most recently, in January, to Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania.\n  The purpose of my trip just a few weeks ago was to learn, for myself, \nmore about the human impact that a simple virus is having on the \ndestruction of a continent. Not a family. Not a community. Not a state. \nNot a country. But an entire continent.\n  The statistics behind this global plague are shocking:\n  Each year, a staggering three million people die of AIDS. Someone \ndies from the disease every ten seconds. About twice that many, 5.5 \nmillion, or two every ten seconds, become infected. That's 15,000 a \nday. And what's even more tragic is that 6,000 of those infected each \nday are young--between ages 15 and 24. Globally, as many as 40 million \nare infected. Africa is hit particularly hard. Of those infected, 70% \nare in Africa. In Botswana alone, one out of every three individuals is \ninfected.\n  And the toll on families is incalculable. 13 million children have \nbeen orphaned by AIDS, mostly in Africa. Projections for the next ten \nyears are sobering--the orphan population may well grown to 40 \nmillion--the number equivalent to all children living east of the \nMississippi River here in the U.S. But Africa is not alone. India, with \nover 4 million cases, is on the edge of an explosive epidemic. China is \nestimated to have as many as 10 million infected persons. The Caribbean \nsadly boasts one of the highest rates of infection of any region in the \nworld. Eastern Europe and Russia report the fastest growth of AIDS \ncases, 11 times over during a three year period. And even worse--90 \npercent of those infected do not know they have the disease. There is \nno cure. There is no vaccine. And it is increasing in numbers.\n  As ranking member of the African Affairs subcommittee of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, I have a commitment to increase public awareness \nof the HIV pandemic in Africa, and most importantly, to develop a \nstrategy to combat and eradicate the disease from the continent and the \nworld. What I saw and learned in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania was \nextraordinary--coming face-to-face with the human tragedy of HIV/AIDS, \nand lives cut far too short.\n\n  Madam President, Africa has lost an entire generation. In Nairobi, \nKenya, I visited the Kibera slum. With a population of over 750,000, \none out of five of those who live in Kibera are HIV/AIDS positive. As I \nwalked the crowded, dirty pathways sandwiched between hundreds of \nthousands of aluminum shanties, I was amazed that everyone was a child, \nor very old. The disease had wiped out the parents--the most productive \nsegment of the population--teachers, military personnel, hospital \nworkers, law enforcement officers.\n  In Arusha, Tanzania, I met Nema whose name means ``Grace.'' She sells \nbananas to survive and provide for her year and a half old son, Daniel. \nWhen Daniel cried from hunger, Nema kissed his hand because she had \nnothing to give him but her love.\n  Margaret, also in Arusha, whose symptoms first came on in 1990. When \nher husband died, despite her illness, she found the strength to fight \nhis family to keep the family property. Thanks to her brothers, she has \na house for her six children.\n  And I had the privilege of visiting with Tabu, a 28-year-old \nprostitute, who was leaving Arusha to return to her village to die. She \nstayed an extra day to meet with us, and I will never forget her \ncheerful demeanor and mischievous smile as we met in her small stick-\nframed mud hut, no more than 12 by 12. Her two sisters are also \ninfected, another sister has already died. Tabu will leave behind an \neleven year old daughter, Adija.\n  At home in Tennessee, or even here in Washington, D.C., Uganda and \nTanzania feel very far away. But the plague of HIV/AIDS and the chaos, \ndespair and civil disorder it perpetrates only leads to the demise of \ndemocracy in a country, in a continent, in the world. Without civil \ninstitutions, there is disorder. Last year in South Africa, one in \nevery 200 teachers died of AIDS. In Kenya, 75 percent of deaths on the \npolice force are from AIDS. HIV-related deaths among hospital workers \nin Zambia have increased 13 times in over a decade. In the wake of \nthese losses, economies are devastated. Botswana's economy is projected \nto shrink by 30 percent in ten years. Kenya's economy will see a 15 \npercent decline. Family incomes in the Ivory Coast have declined by 50 \npercent while expenditures for health care have risen by 4000 percent.\n  The orphans of Africa are left without parents, without teachers, \nwithout role models and leaders. They are susceptible to recruitment by \ncriminal organizations, revolutionary militias, and terrorists. \nTerrorism could become a way of life--not only for maniacal cults but \nfor a generation. September 11 taught us how small our world really is. \nAnd how great the responsibility before us.\n  And that is why I'm devoting much of my time in the U.S. Senate to \nthe issue of global HIV/AIDS, and in particular, to the impact of the \ndisease in Africa. Just as our great nation is the leader in the war on \nterrorism, we must also continue to lead in the global battle against \nAIDS as we work to build a better, safer world. Then where do we go \nfrom here?\n  It seems to me there are three key ingredients: leadership, \nprevention and treatment, and funding.\n  I would like to elaborate a moment on each. The good news is we know \na lot about how to reverse the epidemic. And as a first step, it takes \nstrong leadership at all levels, but as with most things in life, that \nleadership must start at the top. President Museveni in Uganda, with \nwhom I spent some time on my trip, has not been bashful about speaking \nvery publicly to the citizens of his country about HIV/AIDS. Bakili \nMuluzi, President of Malawi, was in my office here in Washington just a \nfew weeks ago. He told me that he opens every speech to his countrymen \nwith an admonition about HIV/AIDS. These two presidents underscore the \nneed to bring the disease out into the light, helping to eliminate the \nstigma often associated\n\n[[Page S1854]]\n\nwith the disease, and opening the way for public education.\n  Others have also been doing their part--governments, the U.N., the \nWorld Bank, world leaders, corporations and philanthropies. From \nPresident Bush to Kofi Annan and Secretary Powell, world leaders \nsupport a call to action, and all recognize the need to do more. It's \nalso leadership from people as unlikely as Bono, lead singer of the \nIrish rock band, U-2. With his passion for Africa and his ``bully \npulpit'' as a celebrity, he's a credible and accomplished spokesperson \non the issue. He joined us in Uganda and Kenya for a couple of days, \nand I was impressed with his knowledge, his commitment, his caring.\n  It's the role of leadership at all levels to ensure that our efforts \nare well coordinated, understanding the importance of enlisting all \nstakeholders in the fight against HIV/AIDS. We must coordinate within \nnational governments as well as across them. We must leverage our \nprecious resources and avoid duplication of effort. As I saw first-hand \nin east Africa, many of the best ideas come from those working in the \ntrenches to fight this disease. Local community participation is \nessential to this process, and local leadership is critical, \nparticularly as we work to prevent and treat the disease. Let me cite a \ncouple of examples.\n\n  In Tanzania, Sister Denise Lynch runs the Uhai Center for the Roman \nCatholic Diocese of Arusha, providing a range of services to village \nschools and churches. Father Bill Freida, a physician at St. Mary's \nHospital in Kenya, tells me they serve over 400 patients a day, and \ntheir chapel and bakery are anchors for the community. And Dr. Ebenezer \nMawasha, also in Tanzania, promotes the teaching of spiritual and moral \nvalues in addition to health and hygiene education.\n  The work that these individuals have accomplished, coupled with their \nfaith and commitment, are a true inspiration to me. And their efforts \nin preventing the disease will have positive repercussions in the years \nto come. Their leadership on the ground, in the trenches, each and \nevery day, is fundamental to our ultimate success. I also want to \nsalute the leadership of those with the CDC and U.S. AID on the ground \nin east Africa. President Museveni told me that our government's \ninvestment in Uganda, for example, of $120 million over the last ten \nyears has been instrumental in their success in bringing new infection \nrates from 32 percent to just over 6 percent. Our presence through \nthese two federal agencies is making a difference.\n  Until science produces a vaccine, prevention through behavioral \nchange and awareness is the key. And once again, cultural stigmas must \nbe overcome. With a combination of comprehensive national plans, donor \nsupport and community-based organizations, progress can be made. \nUganda, Thailand and Senegal are these examples of solid success. We \nmust encourage people to be tested, for here is our real opportunity to \nsave countless lives. The more people know about infection, the more \nlikely they are to do something about it. I believe we should increase \ninvestments in rapid HIV testing kits and counseling for developing \ncountries. Access to these testing tools helps to reinforce prevention \nmessages and guide treatment options.\n  As I saw in Africa, testing centers become centers of hope for a \ncommunity, a place where those struggling with HIV/AIDS can share \nideas, support each other, learn coping strategies, and receive medical \ntreatment and nutritional support. I was particularly impressed with \nthe work in the Kibera slum of Nairobi at the Kibera Self-Help \nProgramme, run by the Centers for Disease Control. Officials there told \nme that a negative test provides a powerful incentive to stay healthy, \nand gives people an opportunity to receive counseling on risk behavior \nthat will ultimately save lives. A positive test removes the burden of \nnot knowing and allows for timely treatment and counseling, an \nimportant first step in living longer and healthier lives.\n  In recent months, pharmaceutical companies sent a message of hope by \nslashing prices on anti-retrovirals for poor countries. Other treatment \nregimens may make an ever bigger difference in extending life and \nholding families together. Just as importantly, the hope of some kind \nof treatment will encourage more people to have themselves tested. And \nthere are other potential public health advantages to treatment that \nrequire further research and evaluation. Treatment with anti-retroviral \ndrugs lowers the amount of virus in the blood, potentially decreasing \nthe risk of transmission, both among adults and mother to child \ntransmissions.\n\n  In addition, access to treatment and drugs is also needed for \nopportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis. For all the damage that \nHIV/AIDS does, TB kills more people in Africa with AIDS than any other \nopportunistic infection. CDC officials in Kenya told me TB has \nincreased six times over in the last ten years, and it's impossible to \nseparate HIV and TB. I've seen first hand in Sudan the reemergence of \nTB in strains more resistant, move virulent, than any we've seen \nbefore.\n  And finally, support of health care delivery systems, with a special \nemphasis on personnel training, is essential to effective treatment \nprograms. Let me add that on the subject of vaccines we must continue \nto search for the tools to finally reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS. \nResearch and development must continue, and I'm pleased to report that \nNIH currently has over two dozen vaccine candidates in the pipeline. \nSomeday, and hopefully very soon, we will have a vaccine to prevent \nthis disease.\n  In sum, I believe there are eight goals we must pursue in this global \nfight.\n  1. We must continue to encourage the political, religious and \nbusiness leaders of the world to unit in an international commitment to \nhalt the spread of HIV/AIDS and to help those who are afflicted with \nthe disease.\n  2. We must continue to embrace the new Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, TB, \nand Malaria. This is not a UN fund, or an American fund. It is a new \nway of doing business.\n  3. We must better leverage America's public health care resources and \ntalent to address the challenge. There must be a ``call to cure'' for \nour health care professionals to use their talent and expertise.\n  4. We should encourage and empower coalitions of governments, multi-\nlateral institutions, corporations, foundations, scientific \ninstitutions and NGO's to fill the gap between the available resources \nand the unmet needs for prevention, care and treatment.\n  5. We must continue to put community-based organizations, both \nreligious and secular, at the forefront of action on the ground by \ngetting funds to them quickly so they can most effectively do their \njobs in reaching out those who need help most.\n  6. We must make certain that international research efforts on \ndisease affecting poor countries is reinforced in a manner that assures \nthe best scientific work in the world will lead to real benefits for \nthe developing world--at a cost they can afford.\n  7. We must focus on prevention, and also support care and treatment \noptions that combine reasonable cost pharmaceuticals with appropriately \nstructured health care delivery systems.\n  8. Finally, we must do all we can to provide comfort to the families \nand orphans affected, to give them hope and dignity.\n  I can still hear young Daniel's cries of hunger and know that his \nyoung mother will not live to see him grow into adolescence, much less \nmanhood; can see Sister Denise as she patiently and capably answers my \nmany questions about the best ways we can help; still hear the pride in \nFather Freida's voice as he describes his hospital as a place to \nprovide dignity and comfort to the inflicted and dying; and I think of \nTabu who has returned to her home village to face death. These images \nwill remain with me; these images strengthen my resolve to win the \nfight against HIV/AIDS.\n  History will judge us as to how we as a nation, as a global \ncommunity, address and respond to this most devastating and destructive \npublic health crisis we have seen since the bubonic plague ravaged \nEurope over 600 years ago.\n  The task before us looms large, but by pulling together, with \nleadership from all, we will eliminate the scourge of HIV/AIDS from the \nface of the globe in our lifetime.\n\n[[Page S1855]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/13/senate-section/article/S1853-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1853-S1855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             GLOBAL HIV/AIDS: THE HEALTH CRISIS OF OUR TIME\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

We must make certain that international research efforts on \ndisease affecting poor countries is reinforced in a manner that assures \nthe best scientific work in the world will lead to real benefits for \nthe developing world--at a cost they can afford.\n  7. We must focus on prevention, and also support care and treatment \noptions that combine reasonable cost pharmaceuticals with appropriately \nstructured health care delivery systems.\n  8. Finally, we must do all we can to provide comfort to the families \nand orphans affected, to give them hope and dignity.\n  I can still hear young Daniel's cries of hunger and know that his \nyoung mother will not live to see him grow into adolescence, much less \nmanhood; can see Sister Denise as she patiently and capably answers my \nmany questions about the best ways we can help; still hear the pride in \nFather Freida's voice as he describes his hospital as a place to \nprovide dignity and comfort to the inflicted and dying; and I think of \nTabu who has returned to her home village to face death. These images \nwill remain with me; these images strengthen my resolve to win the \nfight against HIV/AIDS.\n  History will judge us as to how we as a nation, as a global \ncommunity, address and respond to this most devastating and destructive \npublic health crisis we have seen since the bubonic plague ravaged \nEurope over 600 years ago.\n  The task before us looms large, but by pulling together, with \nleadership from all, we will eliminate the scourge of HIV/AIDS from the \nface of the globe in our lifetime.\n\n[[Page S1855]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/13/senate-section/article/S1855-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ECONOMIC STIMULUS--SENATE PASSAGE\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, it is with great relief that I rise today \nin commendation for approval of the ``Job Creation and Worker \nAssistance Act of 2002,'' which I believe represents a job security, \njob creation and balanced response by the Federal Government to the \neconomic challenges faced by families and businesses. With the signing \nof this Act into law, on March 9, 2002, by the President, Americans \nfinally received the economic stimulus relief that should have been \npassed many months ago.\n  During the past months, all Americans have been deluged with grim \nnews of recessions, plummeting consumer confidence and rising \nunemployment. Last March, which is widely believed to be the beginning \nof the current recession, unemployment totaled 6.2 million, or 4.3 \npercent. Just under a year later, February unemployment rate equaled \n5.5 percent, a number representative of the 1.4 million jobs lost since \nMarch of last year.\n  These numbers represent much more than just mere statistics, the 5.5 \npercent represents 7.9 million people who are without a job, a steady \npaycheck and the security of knowing that bills will be paid and food \nwill be on the table. Even more worrisome for many families is that \nthey have begun to exhaust their State unemployment benefits: in \nJanuary 2002 alone, 373,000 displaced workers ran out of the financial \nsupport they need to simply survive as they look for a job.\n  This is why ending the obstruction by passage of the Job Creation and \nWorker Assistance Act of 2002 is so important. This bill not only \nincludes targeted tax incentives that will increase capital investment \nand spending, ensuring that the weak recovery underway will not be \nderailed, but it provides the economic security the families of \ndisplaced workers so desperately need to get by until new jobs can be \nfound.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to talk briefly about two \nprovisions that I am particularly pleased are included in the economic \nstimulus package.\n  First, this recession is notable for the sharp plummet in the level \nof capital investment in new equipment and technologies by companies, \ncoupled with a decrease in consumer demand. Until such capital \nexpenditures increase, our economy will not fully recover from the \nrecession.\n  Accelerated depreciation is a top priority of Virginia's and \nAmerica's technology industry. It will spur capital expenditures for \nnew advanced equipment and technology. This incentive will create and \nsave more jobs for working men and women involved in producing, \ncreating, fabricating and transporting such capital equipment from \ncomputers and construction equipment to airplanes and locomotives.\n  By providing for a 30-percent bonus depreciation rate over a 3-year \nperiod, the economic stimulus package will encourage enterprising \nbusinesses and people to invest and grow, promoting capital \nexpenditures that would not have occurred but for the passage of this \nact, eventually increasing job growth and consumer spending.\n  Second, the bill includes a provision, similar to legislation I \nintroduced in September 2001, which provides displaced workers with an \nadditional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits after they have exhausted \ntheir State-provided unemployment benefits.\n  Recently, we have received good news on the economy and the prospects \nof its recovery from the recession. February was the first month in \nwhich jobs were added since July 2001, and the unemployment rate is \nfinally beginning to inch down from its high of 5.8 percent in December \n2001.\n  Yet, even with the good news, Chairman Greenspan is still maintaining \nhis earlier forecast of relatively weak economic growth in 2002 of \nbetween 2.5 percent and 3 percent. It will take time for the economy to \nfully recover and to create the jobs that will get workers back on the \npayrolls. News of eventual recovery is of little relief for the 1.4 \nmillion workers who have exhausted their unemployment benefits since \nSeptember 2001.\n  Without the immediate financial life-line that the additional 13 \nweeks of benefits provides, these families, at the minimum, risk \nruining their credit ratings and, in the worst-case scenario, could \nlose their home or car.\n  Hard-working Americans, facing such a harrowing situation, ought to \nhave a response to help them get through the early stages of the \neconomy recovery until jobs become more readily available and workers \ncan provide for their families. The 13 weeks of extended benefits \nprovides the temporary financial assistance for displaced workers to \nget back on their feet and successfully get a new job.\n  In sum, the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 is the \nappropriate combination of immediate financial relief and security to \nAmerican families and tax incentives for businesses to make the capital \ninvestments necessary for economic growth and job creation. I am \nconfident that the new opportunities made available with the passage of \nthis act will go a long way toward ensuring a more secure future for \nAmerican working men, women and families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/13/senate-section/article/S1855-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HONORING BETHANEY ADAMS\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I rise today to honor a truly \namazing and enchanting woman, Ms. Bethaney Adams of Bowling Green, \nKentucky. Bethaney was recently named Ms. Wheelchair Kentucky by the \nMs. Wheelchair America Program, Inc. The Ms. Wheelchair America \nProgram's mission is to provide an opportunity for women of achievement \nwho utilize wheelchairs, such as Bethaney, to successfully educate and \nadvocate for individuals with disabilities.\n  One certainty that I have come to realize in life is that adversity \nwill strike and often with a mighty blow. When Bethaney Adams came face \nto face with adversity, she did not back down from her fears or focus \nher thoughts on negative scenarios. In fact, she excluded the word \ndefeat from her vocabulary and decided to live life with a purpose and \nmeaning. Bethaney, a senior at Murray State University, is currently \ngetting her undergraduate degree in therapeutic recreation. After \ncompleting her studies at Murray, she plans on pursuing her masters \ndegree in therapeutic recreation and eventually wants to work in a \nchildren's hospital where she could assist and inspire those living \nwith disabilities on a daily basis.\n  Outside of her studies, Bethaney has made great strides in the area \nof community service. She has taken trips to Mexico, Washington, D.C., \nand New Orleans, where she worked to aid those less fortunate \nindividuals living in poverty. Here in D.C., she stayed at a homeless \nshelter in an attempt to motivate those currently down on their luck. \nBethaney made the choice a long time ago to view her ``dis''ability as \njust the opposite. Being in a wheelchair gives her the ability to \ncommunicate with others and make a difference in their lives.\n  As for Bethaney's most recent accomplishment, winning Ms. Wheelchair \nKentucky, she now plans to use this as an opportunity to broaden the \nscope of her audience. She will speak at camps across the Commonwealth \nand address inner-city youth in an effort to provide that successful \nand positive thinking leads directly to successful and positive \nactions. In June Bethaney will, for the third straight year, be a \nspeaker at the National Spina Bifida Conference in Orlando, Florida, \nand in August she will represent Kentucky in the Ms. Wheelchair America \npageant to be held in Maryland. The contest will judge the contestants \nbased upon their accomplishments, communication skills, self-\nperception, and projection in the personal and on-stage interviews as \nwell as the platform speech presentation. I know Bethaney will make \nKentucky proud.\n  I once again congratulate Bethaney Adams for this honorable \ndistinction and wish her the best in all her future endeavors. I \nbelieve each and every one of us can take something away from this \nincredible woman and her ability to turn an obstacle into a motivation. \nI thank her for being an inspiration to me and so many others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/13/senate-section/article/S1855-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1855-S1856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO 2001 BUSINESS OF THE YEAR--FIDELITY INVESTMENTS\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

An active member of the community, Fidelity Investments has \nbeen a model in stewardship for the greater Merrimack area.\n  I commend the achievements of Fidelity Investments for the growth of \nthe company and the opportunities it provides to the citizens of \nMerrimack and the State. In 1996, Fidelity Investments opened its \nMerrimack facility with 300 employees and a single business unit on the \nformer Digital Equipment site. Five years later in 2002, Fidelity has \nexpanded to more than 20 Fidelity-affiliated business units with more \nthan 3,500 employees.\n  Fidelity Investments has been a dedicated member of the Merrimack \nChamber for the past five years. Always active in community events, \nFidelity has contributed to programs including: Merrimack Chamber Golf \nTournament and Banquet, Fidelity Foundation, Mentor Program with \nMastricola Middle School, Career's Academy of Finance program at the \nSouth Central School, sponsor of the Union Leader's Stock Market Made \nEasy program, sponsor of Junior Achievement's Titan Cyber-Biz program, \nand sponsor of Kids Voting New Hampshire.\n  The company also has a strong relationship with members of the \nMerrimack law enforcement and public safety communities providing \nsponsorships for training and donations of equipment including \nparticipation in the Local Emergency Planning Committee. Fidelity also \noffers access to and usage of the company's helicopter pad by the \nMerrimack Fire Department during medical emergencies.\n  I applaud the exemplary acts of community involvement by the \nleadership and employees of Fidelity Investments and congratulate them \non this prestigious award. The Town of Merrimack and entire State have \nbenefitted from the economic and charitable contributions made by the \nconcerned citizens at Fidelity Investments.

Madam President, I rise today to \npay tribute to the citizens of Milton, New Hampshire, on the occasion \nof the Town's bicentennial celebration.\n  The Town of Milton, located in Strafford County, has a rich history \nin the State of New Hampshire. A petition was submitted in 1794 by the \ncitizens of Rochester to be incorporated as a separate town. On June \n11, 1802, the Town of Milton was incorporated.\n  Milton is located on Milton Three Ponds, an area blessed with an \nabundance of waterpower which was utilized by different industries \nincluding several sawmills and a woolen mill, Miltonia Mills which \nspecialized in fine wool blankets that were used by Admiral Peary on \nexploratory exhibitions. A distillery and five icehouses which supplied \nice to Boston, Massachusetts, were also located in Milton.\n  Construction of homes began in Milton during the early 1800's and the \nfirst rural schools, Plummer's Ridge School #1 and Nute Ridge School #2 \nwere built. Both school buildings remain standing in Milton today. In \n1853, Lewis Worster Nute, a native of Milton, provided financial \nsupport in his will to build a school and a library in Milton and a \nchapel in West Milton.\n  Today, the Town of Milton, situated in southeastern New Hampshire, \nhas a population of approximately four thousand residents. Teneriffe \nMountain overlooks Milton Three Ponds which connects to the Salmon \nFalls River, offering spectacular scenery year round.\n  Milton's municipal government consists of an elected three member \nBoard of Selectmen and numerous other boards and committees. The Town's \nrepresentatives in the New Hampshire legislature include: \nRepresentatives Nancy Johnson and Rodney Woodill and State Senator Carl \nJohnson. The Town has an excellent on-call Fire Department and \nAmbulance Corps, along with a well staffed Police Department and a \nsummer marine patrol.\n  Each year the townspeople of Milton nominate a ``Citizen of the \nYear''. In 2002, the Fire, Police and Ambulance Corps will be honored \nas the true heroes in Milton, New Hampshire.\n  I congratulate the citizens of Milton, New Hampshire, as they \ncelebrate the Town's bicentennial anniversary and wish them continued \nsuccess and prosperity in the years to come. It is truly an honor and a \nprivilege to represent the people of the Town of Milton in the United \nStates Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/13/senate-section/article/S1856-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO NELSON DISCO\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I rise today to \npay tribute to Nelson Disco of Merrimack, New Hampshire, on being named \nas the 2001 President's Award recipient by the Merrimack Chamber of \nCommerce.\n  A dedicated member of the community at large, Nelson has worked \ndiligently donating his time and talents to projects and programs \nbenefitting the Town of Merrimack including: Parks and Recreation \nDepartment tennis court designer, member of the Board of Selectmen, and \nPlanning Board.\n  Nelson was a recipient of the Paul Harris Fellowship Award from the \nMerrimack Rotary Club and was the 1990 Chamber Business Person of the \nYear. Retired from Sanders Corporation in 2000, he has been an \nexemplary contributor to the Chamber of Commerce assisting with \nprograms including co-chair of the Gourmet Festival and volunteer on \nthe Banquet Committee.\n  Nelson enjoys his retirement exercising with friends four days per \nweek and volunteering at the American Canadian Genealogy Library.\n  I applaud the service that Nelson has selflessly provided to the \ncitizens of Merrimack.

Madam President, today, I, along with Senator Thurmond, \nintroduce two duty suspensions designed to permit the import of raw \nmaterials into the United States duty free. The materials are not \nindigenous to or made in the United States. Therefore, their \nimportation will not displace domestic sourcing. Moreover, because of \nthe nature of the products at issue, they will assist in the creation \nof additional jobs in the United States.\n  I believe that this is the most appropriate use of such legislation. \nThe imported product will not displace any that is manufactured in the \nUnited States. Moreover, the imported product will assist in enhancing \nAmerican productive capacity. I am therefore hopeful that this new \ncapacity can be used to supply both domestic and foreign needs and will \nincrease employment in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/13/senate-section/article/S1858-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1858-S1859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2998.

Madam President, as my colleagues know and the staff \nknows, it must be important to me to come to the floor after there are \nno votes and miss a train home to Delaware. As I think I can verify, \nthere probably has not been 10 times in my career that I have spoken \nafter there are no votes, so I apologize for keeping the staff here and \nkeeping folks in, but this is of consequence to me and my State.\n  My good friend--and we all say that; we use that phrase, and he \nreally is a good friend not only politically but personally--John \nMcCain came to the Chamber and asked the rhetorical question of who has \na hold on two nominees for the Department of Transportation. He does \nnot like secret holds.\n  He was being very polite because he did not want to point out what he \nalready knew: That I have a hold on those two nominees.\n  I have been a Senator for 29 years. I have never, not one single time \nbut this, in my entire career ever put a hold on any nomination, \nlegislation, or anything on the Senate floor. I know Senator McCain \nunderstands holds. He has put holds on Department of Transportation \nnominees before, but I agree with him, the holds should be made public.\n  I wish to publicly acknowledge what I thought everyone knew. I am the \nguy who has put the hold on those two nominees. Madam President, let me \nexplain to you why, very briefly.\n  After September 11, Congress moved very quickly and effectively to \nprovide necessary funds for aviation security improvements and \nultimately for port security improvements. I supported those bills \nwholeheartedly, as did almost all of my colleagues.\n  At the time, however, it was my understanding, given to me in the \nChamber of this body and, I believe--and I am not suggesting she is any \npart of this--but I believe the Presiding Officer will recall, as every \nother Senator will, there was a commitment that there would also be a \nmove to quickly address a similar and equally vexing problem of \nrailroad security.\n  Passenger rail is a critical component of our national transportation \ninfrastructure as, I might add, September 11 so vividly has shown. \nImagine what would have happened if we had no passenger rail system \nSeptember 11 when the skies shut down. And yet all of those passengers \ncontinue to travel at their risk. They continue to ride in poorly lit, \npoorly ventilated, and poorly maintained tunnels, some of which were \nbuilt as long ago as 1879.\n  They remain serious targets for acts of terrorism. There is no \nventilation. There is no lighting. There is no escape. There are more \npeople, right now as we speak, in tunnels on railcars underneath New \nYork City than in seven 747s completely filled. We have done nothing to \nimprove the security and safety of the people who are riding these \nrails right now.\n  Imagine what happens if a bomb, a chemical weapon, or a biological \nweapon is dispersed in that confined area? I might point out to my \nfriends, they may remember a little over a year ago there was a fire in \nthe Baltimore Tunnel. It shut down Baltimore. It not only shut down the \nrail, it shut down the south end of Baltimore for a long time.\n  My frustration is reaching the boiling point. Because of these \nsecurity threats, immediately following the attacks of September 11, I \nattempted to authorize funds for rail security improvements as part of \nthe aviation bill. Because of the objections raised, however, I then \nwent to Senators Hollings and McCain, and instead, based on their \ncommitment, which they kept, they offered to pass a separate bill in \nthe Commerce Committee authorizing rail security monies. True to their \nwords, on October 17, they did just that. S. 1550 authorized $1.8 \nbillion for passenger rail security improvements, even though Amtrak \nhad originally requested $3.2 billion; $1.8 billion was a barebones \nminimum the committee believed it would provide for essential security \nupgrades in safety improvements, mainly a billion of that to improving \nthe tunnels and the safety in the tunnels against threatened attacks.\n  The other $800 million went to having dogs on trains sniffing bombs, \nand additional police. Yet here we stand 6 months later, and we still \ndo not have the money for rail security. I still do not even have a \nvote on rail security.\n  This completely defies logic. The reason is because a number of my \ncolleagues have objected secretly, not publicly, to S. 1550, and they \nhave put holds on the bill. This despite all it will do to safeguard \nour passenger rail system and despite the backing of the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  Remember, this other stuff we did immediately did not even go through\n\n[[Page S1868]]\n\nany committee originally. That is why for the first time in my 29-plus \nyears in the Senate I have placed holds on two Department of \nTransportation nominees, both fine, decent, and competent people. The \nissue is not their nomination. The issue is rail security. I know of no \nother way to get the attention of anybody. I do not know what else I \nhave to do--stand on my head in the middle of the well to get the \nattention of people around here?\n  Granted, not everybody has Amtrak go through their areas. I \nunderstand that. Granted, Amtrak is not as important to passenger rail \nservice for them as it is to the Northeast and to me. This is my farm \nbill. This is my bill relating to airport security. This is my bill \nrelating to the poultry industry. This is my bill relating to the most \ncritical need that exists relating to security in my region.\n  This bill is not controversial. It is completely bipartisan and it \nhas completely been vetted by the committee of jurisdiction. It is \nimportant to passenger rail travelers.\n  There is absolutely no reason for the Senate not to go on record \ntoday, right now in fact, and support this bill, to give Amtrak the \nresources it needs to upgrade the system and make all the safety \nimprovements possible with this limited amount of money.\n  In 2 hours or 3 hours of debate we came up with $15 billion or $14 \nbillion to bail out the airlines that were already in trouble, by the \nway. Had there never been 9-11, half of them would have gone out of \nbusiness anyway--if not half, a significant number. So I do not know \nwhy my asking for this for my region, based upon a legitimate need, is \nso difficult for people to understand.\n\n  In fact, I want to hear someone stand up and tell me how it is that \nmy friends across the aisle have taken the liberty of blocking this \nbill after both Senators Hollings and McCain saw fit to pass it out of \nthe Commerce Committee without any amendments. It is time for my \ncolleagues to put aside their political goals and join me and many of \nmy colleagues who support what the Commerce Committee has done and at \nleast allow us to have a vote. We cannot afford to wait much longer. We \ndo not have that luxury.\n  Let me conclude by saying that I have great respect for Secretary of \nTransportation Norm Mineta; I worked with him when he was in the House \nwhen he was a Congressman. I worked with him in the last \nadministration. I have worked with him in this administration. He came \nto see me. He made a personal plea that I free up these two nominees.\n  I said to him: I understand.\n  He said: It is unrelated. Why? We are for you. We agree.\n  I said: Well, then make the case. Somebody in the administration has \nto stand up and holler with me. They say they are for it. When they \nwere for the airport security bill that got tied up, they stood up and \nhollered.\n  All I am asking is my colleagues who have a secret hold, unlike my \nvery public and uncharacteristic hold, come forward and debate the \nsubject. Let me have a vote. I should not say ``me.'' It is my \ncolleague, Tom Carper; it is my two colleagues from Pennsylvania; my \ncolleagues from Maryland; my colleagues from New Jersey; my colleagues \nfrom Connecticut; my colleagues from New York; my colleagues from \nMassachusetts; my colleagues from Rhode Island; my colleagues from \nMaine.\n  I really find it offensive that something of such exceptional \nimportance, as the young kids say, is ``dissed'' as this is. We would \nnot do this to the Midwestern Senators. We would not do this to the \nSouthern Senators if this was something regional to them. We would not \nblock the chance to vote on water projects for Western Senators. I \nthink this is unfair.\n  I have been around the Senate long enough to know one takes their \nlumps. You win and you lose, and I usually do not make the argument \n``unfair'', but I think it is uncharacteristic that something so \nimportant regionally to me, and to my colleagues, is not even able to \nget a single opportunity for a vote.\n  Only because the hour is so late I am not going to move, by voice \nvote, to accept the amendment that I was about to send to the desk. But \nI can tell the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, the first opportunity I \nhave, I am going to move the legislation, and I want to find out who \nobjects. My guess is the majority leader will object on behalf of some \nunknown person.\n  So in conclusion, I understand the frustration of my friend, John \nMcCain, because he very much wants to free up these two nominees. I \nagree they should be freed up, but I have no other way.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from Delaware that this Amtrak matter \nis not a matter that relates only to the Northeast corridor. I want \neveryone to know this is important for other parts of the country, and \nthe Senator is doing a service to the country. The Northeast is going \nto survive. The trains that run there pay for themselves. It is the \ntrains that are around the rest of the country that do not pay for \nthemselves. That is where we need help and the Senator from Delaware is \nhelping us.\n  I say to my friend from Delaware, we badly need a train, and if \nAmtrak hangs on--it is already in the planning--we should within the \nnext few months have an Amtrak train running between Los Angeles and \nLas Vegas. I say to my friend, is it not a sad commentary of this \ncountry that we give airlines--and I am happy to help. We bailed them \nout. We do all kinds of things to help airlines and airports. And think \nof the things that we do for highways, for passengers traveling on \nhighways. We build bridges. We do everything. But we do not do anything \nto help rail travel. It is a shame. We waste so much time, effort, and \nenergy hauling people on airplanes for distances less than 250 miles. \nWe should have trains. We should have high-speed rail. We should have \nmagnetic levitation. We should have methods to move people who are not \non highways and are not in our crowded airports.\n\n  I hope the Senator from Delaware will understand, even though \nsometimes you may feel alone on this issue, there are a lot of people \nwho will help privately. I will do that; I will help publicly--anything \nI can do to help. This is not an issue that helps the State of \nDelaware. It helps the country.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank my colleague. I take his observation and \nacknowledge it is absolutely true that it helps the whole country.\n  I would like to bifurcate two points: One, the emergency, immediate \nneed for security. The security will help Amtrak in Los Angeles as well \nas help Amtrak in Florida. The place with the biggest, clearest targets \nwhere the most people could be devastated is in those tunnels, \nprimarily. They happen to be mostly in the Northeast.\n  There is a second issue. I have not addressed the second issue. We \nhave not kept our promises at all to Amtrak in terms of Amtrak's \noperational capability and capital needs. We cannot get votes on that \neither. I am trying to deal with the littlest piece. I cannot fathom \nhow anyone could disagree. I have not heard one substantive argument \nwhy we would not provide for dogs and police to see that people are not \ncarrying onto the trains dynamite or explosives or weapons in New \nOrleans, LA, as well as in Philadelphia, PA.\n  The real point is, this is an urgent need. Ask any of the folks in \nthe intelligence community: If you were a terrorist and decided you had \none last opportunity, what would you hit? People will say you are \ngiving ideas; these terrorists already have these ideas, I assure you.\n  What did we do during the Olympics? We knew that would be a likely \ntarget because there were a lot of people and it would be a big \nstatement. To the great credit of the State of Utah and the Federal \nGovernment, we had no incident. But you are sitting around, and where \nwill you look to use the chemical weapon if you have it? The dirty \nbomb, if you possess it? That biological weapon, if you want to use it? \nWhere will you use it?\n  I am chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. I was on the \nterrorism subcommittee and the Judiciary Committee and in the \nIntelligence Committee for 10 years. Unfortunately, it seems as if I \nhave been going to school for my whole life to prepare for the issue of \nterrorism. Prioritize where the likely targets are. There are millions \nof container ships that come into ports each year. We had to deal with \nthat, and we dealt with it. Everybody\n\n[[Page S1869]]\n\nknew that was a likely target. We were not telling the terrorists \nanything they didn't know. We knew it was a problem.\n  I hope to God I am never in a position where, by even implication, I \nhave to say, I told you so. There is no way out of the tunnels. There \nis no lighting. There is no ventilation. There is no way out.\n  I apologize, I am getting angry about it. Again, I can understand my \nfriend from Arizona and others objecting to Amtrak. They do not think \nAmtrak is efficacious. I got it. I understand. They are wrong. I am \nwilling to debate that. I would love a chance to debate it. However, \nthis is drop dead common sense. I close to resent not being able to \nhave a chance for the Senator from Pennsylvania, the Senator from \nDelaware, the Senators from New York, in addition to the Senators where \nAmtrak goes--these are gigantic targets.\n\n  They once asked Willie Sutton: Why rob banks? And his answer was: \nThat is where the money is.\n  What do terrorists do? Why do they pick the two largest buildings in \nthe United States, instead of coming to Delaware and hitting a 12-story \nbuilding in Delaware? Why? Because that is where the most people are. \nThat is where the biggest targets remain.\n  I thank my friend from Nevada. He has been a staunch supporter and \ntried like the devil to help.\n  The concluding point I make: My hold is not secret. I would like to \nknow who is holding up the ability of the Senate to pass a bill that we \nwere promised on October 15 would get action; that we passed out of the \nCommerce Committee unanimously, without amendment; that, in fact, \nnobody has made a substantive argument why any of this is not needed. I \nwant to know why. I want to know why and who. Who is saying we cannot \nvote on it? And why do they think we should not have this?\n  I am a big boy. We have a vote. I win; I lose. But I want a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator from Delaware would respond to a \nquestion, the holds which are placed anonymously on legislation \npreclude a Senator such as the Senator from Delaware from finding out \nwho has taken that action, and therefore there is no opportunity to \ntalk to that colleague, reason with that colleague, perhaps find a way \nto resolve the issue.\n  The simple question: Is it time the rules of the Senate were modified \nto stop secret holds which preclude sensible action on a matter such as \nrail safety?\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator is preaching to the choir. I fully agree with \nthe Senator.\n  As the Senator knows, that is above my pay grade. There are only six \nSenators who have been here longer than I, but a lot have more \ninstitutional power than I do. I think it is a reasonable proposal, and \nI have shared that view of the Senator for a long time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I don't disagree with the Senator from Delaware very \noften, but I disagree when he says it is above his pay grade.\n  I compliment the Senator from Delaware for his impassioned \npresentation. I concur with him. I thank the Senator from Nevada for \narticulating the view of the leadership.\n  It is true the Northeast has special considerations: When you pass \nthrough the tunnels in Baltimore, you pass through the Philadelphia \ntrain stations, the tunnels going into New York City. It is time we \nconsidered the matter.\n  I hope the passion the Senator from Delaware has articulated will \nmove some Senator who has a secret hold on the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I will just take 10 seconds. I conclude \nby saying, I say to my friend, Senator McCain, I will lift the hold on \nthese two nominees the moment we get a vote on the security bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/13/senate-section/article/S1869-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.
